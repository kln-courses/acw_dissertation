EXCAVATIONS ENKOMI The French Archaeological Expedition of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, headed by Prof. Cl. F. A. Schaeffer completed its twenty-first season at Enkomi. In the central part of the town, two vaulted tombs were explored. Their origin and probable relationship with Aegean beehive tombs of the second millennium B.c., par- ticularly those of Crete and Mycenae, has yet to be established. In the same sector exploration of the wells and cisterns used during the Mycenaean and post-My- cenaean periods was continued. The wells yielded much pottery, weights in haematite and in bronze, one of which is in the shape of a mouse. Excava- tions in another sector of the town brought to light part of an industrial quarter of the 12th cen- tury B.C., where potters' kilns, bronzesmiths' work- shops and hearths, could be studied in detail. At the s of the E-w street of the town a series of post-Mycenaean habitations were cleared, which were assigned to the Peoples of the Sea. The pot- tery used during this period in Cyprus is related in form and painted decoration to the pottery found in the Peloponnese and the Aegean islands in strata lying over the abandoned habitations of the Myce- naean period. It is now clear that the disappear- ance of the Mycenaean civilization took place at the same moment in Cyprus and in the Pelopon- nese, at the end of the I3th or beginning of the 12th century B.C. Both countries may have then been occupied by peoples of the same stock, those of Cyprus having been designated by the historiog- raphers of the court of Ramses III as the Peoples of the North and of the Sea. These peoples, who succeeded the Mycenaeans in the island as they did in Aegean Greece, drew their wealth from the metal industry and from the production of arms. This is attested by the recent discovery of four Late Bronze Age swords of European type, 0.60 m. long (Syria 45 [I968] 27I, fig. 7; Ugaritica 6 [1969] 349ff), in an armorer's cache at Enkomi containing approximately ioo</page><page sequence="3">1972] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS FROM CYPRUS, 1970 313 other bronze objects, including a small model of a ritual vehicle (Syria 46 [1969] 267ff, pls. xviii-xx). Iron knives were found in post-Mycenaean tombs and habitations of the 12th century B.c. One knife with a blade of bronze has an ivory handle termi- nating in a small loop for suspension. The new finds at Enkomi prove that swords and knives were produced in the island hardly distin- guishable from their European prototypes. Dis- covered in the Sea Peoples' occupation levels, they may be dated with certainty to the beginning of the reign of Ramses III and his contemporary, Ham- murabi of Ugarit. These datings will be of great value to the chronology of similar finds from Eu- rope. SALAMIS The French Archaeological Expedition of the University of Lyon, headed by Profs. Jean Pouil- loux and Georges Roux, resumed excavation in the s sector of the city in the spring and autumn. The area of the Early Christian basilica church was fur- ther explored as well as the Temple of Zeus. Exploration of the Baths between the basilica and the sea was almost completed. Three new rooms, two of which were erected on a hypocaust, as well as one long corridor leading N-s have been unearthed. Large quantities of pottery and many coins confirm that the last stage of the Baths is later than the Basilica. The eastern atrium was excavated and partly restored (pl. 65, fig. 24) and clearance of the whole area occupied by the basilica with its two atria is practically complete (pl. 65, fig. 25). Among the finds are ten lead seals, two of which bear the name XTE(ANO. The expedition also excavated at the temple s of the Agora, which was partly explored in 89go by a British expedition and identified as that of Zeus Olympios. The first season revealed the re- mains of the stylobate of this magnificent temple, dating to the third century B.c. and measuring 22 x 27.50 m. KITION Excavations were resumed at Kition under the direction of V. Karageorghis, Director of the De- partment of Antiquities of Cyprus, on behalf of the Department. The main target was to complete excavation of the large temple at the N extremity of the ancient town and to study its deeper strata. It has now been proved that a large Mycenaean temple 35 x 22 m. was built here on a natural eminence. It consisted of a large rectangular open courtyard facing E; on its w side there was a small rectangular recess used as the holy of holies. The inner facade of the walls of the courtyard was dressed with large ashlar blocks of limestone recalling the fine construction of the walls of the Mycenaean public buildings at Enkomi. This temple was built during the early stages of the Achaean colonization of Cyprus at the end of the i3th century B.c., and used until the end of the IIth century when this part of the town was abandoned. Another important discovery was that of a rec- tangular altar built at the beginning of the 12th century B.c. (pl. 65, fig. 26). It is constructed with ashlar blocks and at its side were horns of con- secration of hard limestone, a well-known symbol of Minoan-Mycenaean religion. Rich ceramic ma- terial imported from the Peloponnese was dis- covered on the floor around the altar, as well as remnants of animal sacrifices. The altar was de- stroyed by earthquakes in the middle of the IIth century but was replaced by a second one on which there are distinct traces of fire. When the Phoenicians settled at Kition toward the end of the 9th century B.c. they rebuilt the courtyard of the ruined Mycenaean temple, rear- ranged the holy of holies and used the new temple for the worship of Astarte (see "Archaeological News from Cyprus," 1968 and 1969). In 197o a large number of small objects were found in a deposit in a corner of the courtyard of the temple and near it an iron skewer and an iron knife mixed with ashes and burnt animal bones, obviously founda- tion offerings when the temple was rebuilt. On the E outside the temple a large bothros was excavated, which yielded pottery of rare types and Greek pottery imported from Rhodes and Attica. This discovery is of great importance for the exact dating of archaic Cypriote pottery found in the same deposit. A second Mycenaean temple was discovered next to the E facade of the first one; it is slightly earlier and smaller. The temple consists of a rectangular courtyard i5.50 x 9.50 m., with the holy of holies, comprising two consecutive rooms, to the w. It was first built at the beginning of the i3th century B.c., rebuilt toward the end of that century and finally abandoned at the end of the IIth century. The tem-</page><page sequence="4">314 KYRIAKOS NICOLAOU [AJA 76 ple was not used by the Phoenicians, and thus pre- served an undisturbed stratification. In front of the holy of holies a low altar contained ashes, burnt ani- mal bones, Mycenaean bowls and small objects. GOLGOI The expedition of the University of Thessaloniki, under Prof. Georgios Bakalakis, undertook its sec- ond season at the site of ancient Golgoi, due N of Atheniou village. Work centered on the E sector of the town between the 1969 excavations and the city wall. More houses, dating from the 4th century B.c. but damaged by stone robbers, were investi- gated. Among the finds: local and imported pottery, mainly Attic black-glazed, bronze coins and arrow- heads, fragments of sculpture and of architectural members. The layers below the foundations yielded sherds of the archaic period. Two cisterns, probably for public use, were uncovered. The E city wall was cleared for 39-50 m. At several points it is preserved to a height of 2.50 m. and con- sists of rubble with mudbrick above. The E gate, leading into the town by a flight of steps, and a square bastion were revealed (pl. 65, fig. 27). Finds include pottery, fragments of terracotta figurines, bronze coins and arrowheads; they date the circuit to the end of the 4th century B.c. KOURION The Department of Antiquities with Mr. M. Loulloupis in charge resumed work on a house with mosaic floors, which has been investigated since 1967. Two almost square continuous rooms were cleared in the w part. The interior walls, of well- dressed stones with lime cement for mortar, stand to a height of 2 m. Traces of plaster on both in- terior and exterior suggest that they were plastered throughout. The w corridor was partly cleared and a drain covered with slabs was found, leading into a reservoir. Excavation of five rooms in the central part, N of the central court, continued. Part of a later channel which supplied water to a small basin in the court was uncovered. One very narrow room was proba- bly a corridor leading up to a reservoir as yet un- excavated. The floor of the room where a number of querns were found last year has now been cleared: it consisted of small pebbles held together with lime cement. Work continued in the E part of the house where statues of Hermes and Asklepios were found ear- lier. Evidently these two rooms originally formed part of a corridor paved with mosaics and parallel to the w corridor. East of this corridor was found a bath establishment with praefurnium, frigidari- um, caldarium and tepidarium, not yet entirely investigated. Clay pipes around the walls of the caldarium brought in hot air from the hypocaust below. Among many finds the most important is a mar- ble statue base built into the antechamber of the thermai. On its principal face is a relief of four ob- jects, probably symbolic; L-R: cock turning right, pair of wings, phallos (?), part of a chain (pl. 65, fig. 28). PALAIPAPHOS The German Archaeological Mission, sponsored by the German Archaeological Institute and the University of Konstanz and directed by Prof. F. G. Maier, completed its fifth season: trial excavations w of the Temple of Aphrodite and continuation of the survey of the city. The temple area was partly excavated in 1888 by the Cyprus Exploration Fund. Most of the re- mains found were Roman, except for the s wing which may be dated to the archaic period. No traces of the actual sanctuary were found, and debate has raged ever since as to its plan and structure. No evidence, however, has yet been found. A second trial excavation was at the highest point w of the Roman house investigated by the British Kouklia Expedition in 1950-52. Immediately below the surface remains of a small Byzantine church of Aghios Nicolaos were discovered, an unpretentious building of the i6th century A.D. surrounded by a graveyard with poor earth burials. The church walls rest on the remains of Roman house walls, some of which probably link up with the house just mentioned. Reexamination of the stratigraphy just s of the Roman house revealed that the layer above bedrock contained a number of fine Mycenaean IIIB sherds, Attic black-glazed ware, and even some Roman pottery-indicating extensive damage to the site. Among the finds is a fragmentary Graeco-Roman terracotta figurine (pl. 65, fig. 29). The city survey was confined to the area of eleven archaic tombs, looted in 1969, and to the remains of classical and Hellenistic houses and wells un- covered during leveling operations in the E sector. Study of the pottery from the Lakkos tou Skarnou</page><page sequence="5">1972] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS FROM CYPRUS, 1970 315 cemetery, however, showed that at least three of the tombs date from the IIth century B.c., which firmly establishes the continuity of occupation from the Late Cypriot age on. Treatment of bronzes found earlier in Late Cyp- riot wells in the Evreti has now been completed. One of them is a remarkable weight in the shape of a human head (pl. 65, fig. 30), with its interior filled with lead. The context dates it to the late i3th century B.C. A comparable anthropomorphic weight of the i4th century comes from Ras Sham- ra (Syria 18 [19371 i47f, pl. xxiv), but the type remained popular for a long time. The Palaipaphos head is the same height as that from Ras Shamra, 0.038 m., but it weighs only 169 gm. as against 190. NEA PAPHOS The Department of Antiquities, with the present author in charge, resumed excavations at the Odeon and the House of Dionysos. The cavea, orchestra and stage-building of the Odeon had already been uncovered (AJA 74 [19701 395), and this year work was carried on outside the cavea. The whole per- imeter of the analemma wall was found; the lower course is in very good condition and built of large well-dressed stones (pl. 66, fig. 31). The solid structure of the cavea is interrupted part way along by a series of small vaulted cham- bers at close regular intervals (pl. 66, fig. 32). This phenomenon also occurs within the cavea. Not far from the orchestra below the cavea is a well-built vertical wall about 5 m. deep. The seats of the lower maemianum are supported on vaults below the inner cavea, resting both on the semicircular wall and on vertical ones at right angles to the former; the latter, however, are placed radially toward the orchestra. The vaulted space between the walls below the cavea was purposely filled with earth, so that the vaults below the seats were also supported by the earth-which was, in fact, piled up first and the vaults constructed later. This fill- ing is earlier than the Odeon-it contained Hel- lenistic and Early Roman material-and the un- dersurface of the vault is very uneven. Present evidence indicates that the Odeon was built during the Augustan period and lasted down to the early 4th century A.D. with no obvious alterations. In the House of Dionysos restorers from UNEsco under the supervision of Milorad Medic lifted the damaged mosaic pavement from the Triclinium and the room of Hippolytos and Phaedra and re- set them on new foundations (pl. 66, figs. 33-34 show an unusual picture of the reverse). Excavation of the space below the mosaics produced amazing results. About i m. below the mosaic of Hippolytos and Phaedra was a thick layer of dark, somewhat greasy ashes in which were found thousands of seal im- pressions on clay (ILN, May 1971, 51-53). These sealings, II,ooo or more in all, belong to a Nomo- phylakion, where contracts of all kinds were kept, wills, dowries, etc.; the seals were used instead of the signatures of contracting persons and witnesses. These finger-ring impressions bear beautiful figure representations or portraits of gods, the Ptolemies, the Seleucides, birds, animals, the Temple of Aphrodite at Paphos and other subjects (pl. 66, fig. 35). Many are copies of coins. The sealings were bound around the roll of papyrus on which the agreement was written, a method of sealing known to Herodotus. Speaking of the sacrificial bulls in Egypt attested as pure by a high priest, he wrote: "And if the animal proves pure he [the priest] twists round the horn a band of papyrus, which he seals with clay and stamps with his signet ring" (2.38). This is a unique discovery in Cyprus; moreover more seals have been found here than anywhere else in the Hellenistic world. The ashes are simply the filling of an old pit and were brought in. We may therefore assume that somewhere nearby there was a Nomophylakion which was destroyed by fire and abandoned. We know that in Cyprus in Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman times there was an institution called the Koinon Kyprion (Federation of Cypriots), responsible for religious matters and for the bronze coinage. It is possible, therefore, that this institution was also responsible for the Nomophylakion, a kind of Public Records Office. In the same pit were found many fragmentary terracotta figurines, among them Omphale, Queen of Lydia (pl. 66, fig. 36), coins, two molds, one stone and one clay, for the disk of clay lamps of the Ephesian type (pl. 66, fig. 37), and much pottery. Another important discovery was made in the adjoining room of the Triclinium at a depth of ca. I m.: a foundry where bronze was cast for statues. Among the finds in the kiln are molds in gypsum reinforced with bones (animal ribs), most impor- tant of which is the complete back of a male bust over lifesize (pl. 66, fig. 38). This discovery is unique in the Greek world and will contribute</page><page sequence="6">316 KYRIAKOS NICOLAOU [AJA 76 greatly to the study of ancient technique in casting bronze statues. The kiln dates to the end of the Hellenistic period. Other finds in the pit include a number of bronze coins, clay lamps, much pot- tery and part of a Hellenistic inscription. The Polish Archaeological Expedition to Paphos under Prof. K. Michalowski and Dr. A. W. Da- szewski, sponsored by the University of Warsaw and the Narodowe Museum, conducted their sixth campaign at the site of a large late Graeco-Roman building adorned with mosaic pavements. Several large and richly decorated rooms in the s wing were uncovered. The main hall consists of an apsidal compartment on a high level and a lower chamber. The floor and lower part of the walls of the apsidal room were revetted with gray and white marble slabs; the upper parts were deco- rated with painted plaster. Mosaics embellished the floor of the lower cham- ber, including four panels with figure representa- tions. Unfortunately only one is fairly well pre- served; it shows the Three Fates accompanying Peleus and Thetis, who are about to dip the baby Achilleus into a basin of water (pl. 68, fig. 39). Achilleus is seated in the lap of a woman, a per- sonification of Anatrophe, while another woman called Ambrosia holds a jar. The figures are slightly smaller than lifesize, the colors bright and the workmanship fine. The style shows characteris- tics of the 4th century A.D. The scene is framed with a frieze of Amorini hunting wild animals. This house seems to be the largest residential Graeco-Roman building so far discovered in Cy- prus and was probably an official residence. Some time in the early 6th century A.D. it was taken over by squatters, and finally abandoned in the 7th cen- tury probably at the time of the Arab raids in 647. The British Archaeological Expedition to Paphos headed by Mr. A. H. S. Megaw resumed work at the site of the Byzantine Castle known as Saranda Kolones. These excavations are sponsored by the British School at Athens and the Dumbarton Oaks Center for Byzantine Studies. The Castle was first discovered in 1957 in trial excavations by Mr. Me- gaw for the Department of Antiquities; subsequent campaigns established that it had been built after the first Arab raids of 647 and destroyed during the earthquake of 1222. The principal scene of operations was the E ward and the area between the main residential part of the castle and the outer wall on the w. Here, ad- joining a pentagonal tower in the outer wall, sev- eral superimposed occupation levels were exposed. Stones thrown down in 1222 from a wall which had divided the w ward into inner and outer sec- tions were found resting on a layer containing fragments of mediaeval glazed pottery. The origi- nal threshold was found ca. 40 cm. lower and, corresponding with it, a hard layer of earth rep- resenting the original floor. Immediately below the latter, among ashes, was a massive deposit of plain pottery and lamp fragments of 7th century types. New support for the view that the castle was constructed by the Byzantines to guard the harbor resulted from investigations outside the outer wall. Here two deep pockets in the rock had been cleared, in order to build the s flank of the Nw tower on solid rock; after completion of the tower these pockets had been refilled up to the general level of the ditch. The fill in both pockets has now been excavated and on first inspection includes nothing later than the 7th century. Beneath the N section of the w outer wall an elaborate water system was found; it cut into the rock and is probably of Hellenistic date. The con- duits are plastered and large enough for a man to walk in. They were fed from a vertical shaft cut by the builders of the castle wall; originally it must have been supplied from the city's main aqueduct. At the bottom the shaft was connected by three openings to a concentric conduit from which others radiated. Staircases connected the system through- out. Another much longer conduit leads to a vast bottle-shaped cistern under the central part of the castle. These waterworks were already obsolete when the castle was built; the long conduit was blocked off at the w end, replastered and used as an annex to the bottle-shaped cistern where rain- water from the central courtyard was stored; the rest of the system within the castle provided one or more sally-ports issuing into the ditch. The Curator of Ancient Monuments, Mr. Atha- nasios Papageorghiou, continued excavation of the Gothic church at the site of St. Paul's Pillar. At the E end it was found that the nave and aisles termi- nated in projecting semicircular apses; in the s part a rectangular sacristy was excavated. More fragments of the wing of the limestone statue of an angel, found last year, were discovered in an underground chamber under the floor of the E part of the s aisle. Among the finds are some fine pieces of Majolica plates.</page><page sequence="7">1972] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS FROM CYPRUS, 1970 317 SOLOI The Canadian Archaeological Expedition of the University of Laval, Quebec, under Prof. Jean des Gagniers, resumed excavations at the necropolis, the Basilica church and the lower town. In the E necropolis eight Geometric tombs were excavated dating from the Geometric, archaic and classical periods. All yielded a large amount of pottery; we may note an archaic black-on-red kylix decorated with a fish and an Attic lekythos deco- rated with palmettes. The basilica was evidently one of the most im- portant in Cyprus; its inside length is 52 m. Almost the whole nave and N aisle have now been uncov- ered and work has begun in the atrium. Excavation has also revealed the existence of a narthex and of a chapel on the N side paved with marble slabs. In the lower town more Graeco-Roman houses were unearthed, also a street 4.95 m. wide, paved with stone slabs, of which 20 m. has been uncovered (pl. 67, fig. 40). It runs sE-Nw and may have been the principal street of Soloi in Graeco-Roman times. The street has pavements on both sides, 4.50 m. wide, beyond which are shops ca. 5 m. deep. Re- mains of columns, bases, capitals, large blocks of architecture, friezes and Corinthian cornices indi- cate that the street was colonnaded on either side like streets known in Roman Syria. A cornice ele- ment shows, in relief, comic masks alternating with a stylized plant (pl. 67, fig. 41). AGHIA IRINI The Italian Archaeological Mission to Cyprus from the Institute of Mycenaean and Aegeo-Ana- tolian Studies, Rome, headed by Prof. C. Callavotti, completed its first season at the locality Palaeokas- tron by the sea near the village of Aghia Irini, a site long known for its necropolis and its town re- mains. The main purpose is to investigate the rela- tions between Cyprus and the Minoan-Mycenaean world. The remains of what is believed to be the city wall have been uncovered for some distance and a number of Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman private houses were investigated. The houses are square or rectangular and often have staircases leading to an upper floor, bathrooms, some lined with lime cement, storage jars fixed in the floor, querns and olive presses. One of the largest rooms, 5.50 x 3.70 m., contained several querns in volcanic stone of the Hellenistic type, several clay lamps and glass vases. One tomb of the i6th century B.c. was excavated in the Late Bronze Age necropolis by the sea. It contained a rich collection of vases, bronzes, cylin- der seals and other objects, but the most exciting finds were two cups of Aegean origin, one of them decorated with the Minoan symbol of the double axe. This cup may be Late Helladic II (pl. 67, fig. 42). PHILIA The British Expedition of the University of Edinburgh, headed by Dr. T. F. Watkins, carried out its fifth season at the Neolithic settlement at Drakos near the village of Philia. Work concen- trated on the w part; the early perimeter wall and ditch were traced, and it could be seen how the settlement had prospered and expanded beyond its original limits. More of the small, single-roomed houses were excavated. They were built in a deep natural hollow in the rock, with mudbrick walls on stone foundations, and contained domestic equipment such as grinding stones and mortars on the mud and chavara floors. Besides beautiful pottery with a wide variety of painted designs (pl. 67, fig. 43) there were a number of cooking pots. Two more of the strange rock-cut hypogeia, found so far only in Philia, were discovered. The larger one was over 4 m. deep, and pierced a hori- zontal stratum of hard limestone to enter a natural cave. Clearly these subterranean complexes were carefully filled with large stones and soil, but why they were dug at all and what their purpose was is still unknown. TAMASSOS The German Archaeological Expedition, di- rected by Prof. H.-G. Buchholz and sponsored by the German Archaeological Institute of Berlin, excavated during its first season in the area of the archaic Royal Tombs investigated in 1889 by Max Ohnefalsch-Richter. With the help of the latter's manuscript and plans it was possible to locate a number of tombs explored by him but unpublished and no longer visible. Two tombs, one Middle Cypriot and one archaic, have been reexamined; both were robbed long ago and are poorly preserved. In the filling of the first tomb some broken pottery and a few bronze ob- jects were recovered, but nothing was found in the</page><page sequence="8">318 KYRIAKOS NICOLAOU [AJA 76 archaic one. This tomb, however, had a long nar- row dromos leading into a rock-cut asymmetrical chamber, a type hitherto unknown in the area of Tamassos. The remains of what is believed to be a sanctu- ary were found nearby: several bothroi filled with charcoal, ashes, bones, lamps, terracotta animal figures and much pottery, all dating from the ar- chaic period, in front of a wall built of rubble with- out mortar. A terracotta idol of Astarte, a frag- mentary Greek statuette of the mother goddess type, and a crouching lion in limestone (L. 0.085 m.) suggest that the sanctuary was dedicated to a goddess. The lion statuette is surmounted by the foot of a female with the border of her long chiton, indicating perhaps a goddess standing on two crouching lions. PHLAMOUDI The Columbia University expedition led by Profs. Edith Porada and Sarantis Symeonoglou ex- cavated for the first time at Vounarin, a small hill close to Phlamoudi near the N coast. Potsherds of the Middle Bronze Age collected earlier on the surface had led to the belief that the hill enclosed a fortress, but a sanctuary now seems indicated in- stead. See the report by Prof. Symeonoglou at the 1970 AIA General Meeting, AJA 75 (197i) 215. CAPE ST. ANDREAS The French Archaeological Expedition of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, head- ed by M. Alain Le Brun, carried out its first season of excavations at the Neolithic settlement of Cape St. Andreas at the extremity of the Karpas penin- sula. In classical times the site was occupied by a small town and in particular there was a temple of Aphrodite Akraia mentioned by Strabo, appar- ently located on top of a prominent rock. The Neo- lithic settlement is mainly on the s slope of this rock. Its remains were known earlier (Archaeo- logical Reports for 1965-66, 28; BCH 86 [1962] 372-374; and the present author visited the site on several occasions and noticed circular huts and the presence of stone objects). The excavation brought to light remains of a Neolithic village which attests human habitation of the island ca. 6000 B.c. Circular houses con- structed of rubble have been uncovered, 4 m. in diam. The finds include stone vases, bowls and basins decorated with ornaments in relief, imple- ments of bone and silex as well as animal bones- a preceramic period. Traces of similar cultural re- mains have been found at Khirokitia and else- where on the island but they are as a rule covered by later remains of the ceramic stone age. This excavation brings up the problems of the origin of the earliest inhabitants of Cyprus. M. Le Brun considers it unlikely that the earliest Neo- lithic culture of Cyprus derived from South Ana- tolia or from the Syrian coast, and is inclined to interpret this culture as a local phenomenon. MINOR EXCAVATIONS A half-looted built tomb of the archaic period was excavated near the village of Patriki (pl. 67, fig. 44). It consisted of a chamber with a stepped drom- os. The chamber is rectangular in plan, regular- ly built of large ashlar limestone blocks, with a trapezoid roof and a floor paved with slabs. The sides of the dromos are built of small irregular stones. Although looted the tomb yielded enough material to date it to the Cypro-Archaic II period. On the roof, in disturbed soil, fragments of the skull and skeleton of a horse were found in as- sociation with one large hydria and other broken pottery. Inside the chamber fragments of about eighteen iron obeloi were found as well as two fragmentary iron firedogs in the shape of a boat (CS 1790). There is a close similarity between this and the Royal Tombs at Salamis. Some 50 m. from the Patriki built tomb a large bothros with archaic terracottas was found. Mostly fragmentary, some of them are over-lifesize and represent votaries holding animals or serpents (CS 1797). An intact large tomb of the Cypro-Archaic I period was excavated at Kapsalos N of Limassol town. Apart from large quantities of vases, mainly amphorae, the tomb produced four iron knives and three pairs of small bronze shallow bowls per- forated symmetrically four times round the border, probably belonging to scales (LimM 491). Eleven tombs of the archaic to classical periods were investigated at Mia Kremmos near the vil- lage of Limnites, producing much pottery and other objects. Most notable are a gold pendant rep- resenting a bee and a bracelet of solid silver in the shape of a coiling serpent (pl. 67, fig. 45; CS 1787). A sanctuary site of the classical period was in- vestigated at Elaia, w of the village of Pyroi. Sev- eral clay and stone figurines were found in a de-</page><page sequence="9">1972] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS FROM CYPRUS, 1970 319 posit, including a fine limestone head (pl. 67, fig. 46) and a fragmentary limestone lyre with the fingers of a hand still touching the painted strings (pl. 67, fig. 47; CS 1804). Six tombs, one Hellenistic and five Graeco-Ro- man, were excavated in the central part of Kyrenia town. The Hellenistic tomb produced among other things iron candelabra, iron strigils, a pair of gold mouthpieces and a pair of crescent-shaped earrings (RR 91-95). IDALION EXPLORATION An American group directed by Paul Lapp of the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary and John Overbeck of SUNY at Albany had planned to begin excavations at the ancient city of Idalion in the spring of 1970. After the accidental death of Dr. Lapp, however, work was limited to mapping of the city site and surface reconnaissance over a wider area in preparation for future excavation, as re- ported by Prof. Overbeck at the 1970 AIA General Meeting, AJA 75 (1971) 21o. Among the pottery uncovered is a remarkable Mycenaean Rude Style pictorial krater (pl. 67, fig. 48). UNDERWATER EXPLORATION The Underwater Archaeological Expedition of the University of Oxford, led by Mr. Jeremy Green, explored systematically around the Kleides islands off Cape St. Andreas for the second year. The search was mainly concentrated N of the two main channels between the second and fourth islands, and all observations and positions of swim-lines were recorded on a large-scale map. Several scat- tered wrecks have been recorded-the principal one in 20 m. of water on a posedonia grass sea bed. In one of the wrecks ca. 68 roof tiles of Corin- thian type and eight joining tiles lie in a regularly stacked pile. A probe, metal detector and magne- tometer survey showed that the tile area was 18 x 8 m., at depths up to i m. The site seems well pre- served and undisturbed. The anchors located last year have been surveyed and photographed (ca. 200 recorded). In one area several new anchors have been located: two rows of anchors with five stones and another with seven. ANCIENT MONUMENTS Preservation and restoration continued, especially in churches and monasteries for which generous contributions were made by the Church authorities. The work was carried out mainly by the Depart- ment of Antiquities under the supervision of Mr. A. Papageorghiou, Curator of Ancient Monuments. Work on many sites can receive only brief mention. Latin Cathedral of St. Sophia, now Selemiye Mosque: restoration begun in 1969 under UNESCO expert Dr. Carlo Musso, continued; detailed plans were prepared and investigation of the foundations completed. Monastery of Aghios Panteleimon at Mitsero: the w wing was restored to its original form and the enclosure repaired. Early Christian basilica church at Soloi: parts of the opus sectile floor were consolidated and a mosaic floor lifted and reset. Church of Aghios Herakleidos: the mod- ern marmara floor was removed and the lower part of the wall paintings revealed; the original brick- tile floor was repaired. Aghios Nicolaos tis Stegis, near Kakopetria village: the original brilliant colors of the paintings, including that of the Nativity (pl. 68, fig. 49), can now be seen in the s arm of the cross; four portraits of saints in the bema were also cleaned. Church of Panaghia tou Arakou at Lagoudera: the Dumbarton Oaks expedition under Mr. David Winfield continued cleaning and restoration, in- cluding the great scenes of the Presentation of the Mother of God in the Temple, the Koimesis (pl. 68, fig. 50), the Annunciation and the Birth of Christ. A number of roundels of saints in the re- veals of the blind arches under the dome were also treated. Where original 12th century work exists under repainting the latter is being photographed and then removed. Kyrenia Castle: SE tower repaired. Bellapais Ab- bey Church of Panaghia: the narthex was repaired, and two bays of the N wall of the refectory. Buffa- vento Castle: removal of debris and earth accumu- lated against the N part of the vaulted entrance revealed foundations of earlier rooms. Monastery of Aghios Chrysostomos: part of the walls and vaults of the chapel of Aghia Trias were plastered, for better protection of the early 12th century work previously uncovered by the Dumbarton Oaks ex- pedition. Repair and restoration continued at Salamis (Gymnasium and the Early Christian basilica church at Campanopetra), the Latin Cathedral of St. Nicolas, now Lala Mustafa Mosque, in Fama- gusta, and the Byzantine church with three domes of St. Lazarus at Larnaca. Kourion: the mosaic floor of the Baths above the</page><page sequence="10">320 KYRIAKOS NICOLAOU [AJA 76 villa of Eustolios was lifted and reset. Among the restored parts is Ktisis (pl. 68, fig. 51); the Temple of Apollo Hylates and the Stadium were also re- paired. Church of Panaghia tis Amasgou at Mona- gri: repair of the paintings by the Dumbarton Oaks Center indicate that they probably belong to four periods, the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries, while the fourth period is dated by an inscription to 1564. Nea Paphos: see above for mosaic floors in the House of Dionysos. Enkleistra of Aghios Neo- phytos: most of the paintings in the cell have been successfully fixed to the walls of the rock-cut cave by the Dumbarton Oaks Center. The paintings in the tomb of the Saint, the Crucifixion and the Mother of God in the niche, however, are in urgent danger from water seepage.
