<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Reading up the Ancient Etruscans": Lawrence's Debt to George Dennis BILLY T. TRACY D. H. Lawrence constructed his version of Etruscan society from a combination of readings in history, archeology, and anthropology, and an intuitive reaction to the Etruscan tombs. From the writings of Herodotus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Livy, Theodor Mommsen, David Randall-McIver, Pericle Ducati, and A. L. Milani, he derived much of the material that gave his depiction of Etruria a semblance of historical accuracy. But of all the books he read on this archaic civiliza- tion, he was most engaged by George Dennis' The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria (1848), a comprehensive two-volume travel book which blended, "in a way not since achieved again, informative descriptions of monu- ments and places with a lively account of his experiences."1 Lawrence was not alone in his partiality toward Dennis' volumes. Mary Lovett Cameron wrote in the preface to her Old Etruria and Modern Tuscany (1909): "I do not aspire to rival George Dennis's Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria, merely to supplement that fascinating, but now in parts out of date, work." In an even more reverent spirit, Frederick Seymour's Up Hill and Down Dale in Ancient Etruria (1910) called George Dennis one whose "authority can never be disputed."2 Although changes in tourist facilities and methods of transportation had made Dennis' book less serviceable as a guide for those who would personally visit the tombs and museums, nothing dramatic enough had been uncovered in later excavations to invalidate Dennis' appraisals of Etrus- can art, society, and religion. Thus, over sixty years after the initial publication of The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria, Dennis still presented an obstacle to those who sought to follow in his footsteps. To write on the Etruscans after Dennis was an enterprise that likely would be deemed either superfluous or slightly presumptuous. 437</page><page sequence="2">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE Unlike Cameron and Seymour, Lawrence never paid direct hom- age to Dennis. But he did have that able surrogate Richard Aldington to do it for him. In answer to the question why Lawrence never visited enough Etruscan towns to complete his own proposed two-volume work, Aldington explained that he "realized that every non-specialist English writer on the Etruscans must come into competition with George Dennis, and so far Dennis is unmatched."3 Aldington admitted that this was only a partial reason for Lawrence's incompleteness. The real explanation, as Aldington knew, was the rapid decline of Law- rence's health. Even though Aldington was the one who introduced Lawrence to Dennis' work and talked with him about the Etruscans in August 1926 (during the interval between the first and second Etrus- can tours), I believe that, when Aldington would have us think that Lawrence was intimidated by Dennis, he is attributing a diffidence to his friend that was not there. Could Lawrence, who decided in the early 1920s to refute Freud with his Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious and later toyed with the idea of writing a guidebook to Ruskin's Venice, have been overawed by George Dennis? I think not. In fact, Lawrence's readings in the Cities and Cemeteries often so provoked him that in sheer antagonism he took an antithetical view. Nonetheless, deliberate opposition, as Lawrence insisted in his essay on Galsworthy, is yet another, more subtle, form of dependence. So, despite the numerous conflicts of opinion, Dennis fulfills the same role for Etruscan Places that John Lewis Burckhardt played for Sir Richard Burton's Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah, and that Charles Doughty played for T. E. Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom. In each case the earlier traveler had become so connected with the particular geographical area and subject that the later ones often found themselves reacting as strongly to the writings of their predecessors as to the landscape and peoples that immediately confronted them. Since Dennis was largely responsible for making the Etruscans an essential part of the English traveler's visit to Italy and was so imposing a precursor for Lawrence, a brief account of him at this point will not be out of place. We might expect the author of so influential and authoritative a work to have university credentials, but the fifteen- year-old Dennis had gone to work in 1829 as a clerk under the Receiver-General of Excise, instead of continuing on from Char- terhouse to Oxford. Not until 1885, after many years of service as British Consul in Tripoli (1863), Crete (1869), Palermo (1870), and Smyrna (1879), did he finally receive the honorary degree of D.C.L. 438</page><page sequence="3">LAWRENCE'S DEBT TO GEORGE DENNIS from Oxford. Italy was his major passion and second came the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean. In addition to compiling his Etrus- can book, he wrote A Handbook for Travellers in Sicily (1864), which was also published by John Murray, and was elected Vice President of the Archeological Institute at Rome, where he had made friends while researching Etruria in the 1840s.4 Dennis had become interested in the antiquities of Etruria during an 1842 visit to Perugia, the city which nearly eighty-five years later would inspire Lawrence to write his Etruscan book. For Dennis, how- ever, it was not the Museo Etrusco-Romano (now the Museo Ar- cheologico Nazionale dell'Umbria) that touched off his enthusiasm, but the Grotta de'Volumni. Near the end of the second volume of his Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria, he remembered his first descent into the tomb: Never shall I forget the anticipation of delight with which I leapt from the vettura into the fierce canicular sun, with what impa- tience I awaited the arrival of the keys, with what strange awe I entered the dark cavern-gazed on the inexplicable characters in the doorway-descried the urns dimly through the gloom- beheld the family party at their sepulchral revels-the solemn dreariness of the surrounding cells.... It was like enchantment, not reality, or rather it was the realisation of the pictures of subterranean palaces and spell-bound men, which youthful fancy had drawn from the Arabian Nights, but which had long been cast aside into the lumber-room of the memory, now 'to be suddenly restored.5 Over the next five years Dennis made several more trips to Italy, apportioning his time between on-the-site inspections of Etruscan re- mains and scholarly investigations in Roman libraries. When we con- sider that Dennis retained his employment in the Office of Excise while working on his Etruscan book, his accomplishment reveals a prodigious industry. From its first publication the Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria had been acclaimed both as a masterful guidebook to pre-Roman Italy and as a skillful piece of antiquarian investigation.6 One reviewer wrote: "In taking leave of this work for the present we cordially recommend it as a most important accession to archeological literature-at the same time that it cannot fail to be valuable to the traveller and interesting to the general reader."7 By all consensus, the volumes were considered equally appropriate to the drawing room, the library, and the "vet- tura."8 The Victorian age found the Cities and Cemeteries, with its pervasive tone of elegiac lament in the manner of Childe Harold canto IV and its 439</page><page sequence="4">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE lyrical evocations of nature, irresistible. Since the work is so little known today, I will give an extended quotation from Dennis' chapter on Norchia: In its present state of utter desolation, it has charms as much for the artist as for the antiquary. Who that has visited this spot can forget the ruined church of Lombard architecture, wasting its simple beauty on the stupid gaze of the shepherd, the only frequenter of these wilds? Who that has an eye for the pictur- esque, can forget the tall cliffs on which it stands-here, perfo- rated so as to form a bridge, there, dislocated, and cleft to their very base,-the rich red and grey tufo half-mantled with the evergreen foliage of cork, ilex, and ivy? Who can forget the deep glens around, ever wrapt in gloom, where the stillness is broken only by the murmurs of the stream, or by the shriek of the falcon-solitudes teeming with solemn memorials of a past, mys- terious race-with pompous monuments mocking their very purpose; for, raised to perpetuate the memory of the dead, they still stand, while their inmates have for ages been forgotten? He who has visited it must admit, that though nameless and un- chronicled, there are few sites in Etruria so interesting as this. .. (I, 259). As a panegyrist of Central Italian landscape, Dennis was unequaled. His Etruscan travel book, like Ruskin's writings on the Alps, told sophisticated tourists how they ought to respond to particular scenes. Dennis' timing in issuing his work had been perfect: most of the major tombs had been excavated recently and readers were curious about the discoveries. According to one contemporary, "the first edi- tion of his work on the 'Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria' at once secured the favour of the public and excited an interest in the remains of the old Etruscan nation which has never died out."9 But however persuasive a writer Dennis may have been, he did not create single- handedly the taste for Etruscan ruins and artifacts. The ground had been broken already by Mrs. Hamilton Gray's Tour to the Sepulchres of Etruria (1840), a work that, despite its incompleteness and deficiencies as a handbook to the region, deserves credit as the pioneering effort. The interest that Mrs. Hamilton Gray had aroused, Dennis capitalized on, and his work immediately supplanted its earlier rival. Dennis' volumes, moreover, were enthusiastically received by British travelers who, in the late 1840s, were becoming tired of Naples, Rome, Florence, and Venice--cities that since the days of the Grand Tour over a century before had been the crucial places to see while in Italy. Excursions to the smaller, more medieval towns in Umbria and Tuscany began to be common, even fashionable, as travelers turned 440</page><page sequence="5">LAWRENCE'S DEBT TO GEORGE DENNIS away from the paintings of Raphael and Salvator Rosa to search out those by Cimabue, Giotto, and Perugino.10 Very often these same towns-Perugia, Orvieto, Arezzo, Siena, Chiusi, and Cortona, for example-were Etruscan in origin, or at least near others that were. Trips to Etruscan sites, quite naturally, filled those hours of a traveler's day that might have been spent otherwise in the Forum or on the Pincio. Although Lawrence's enthusiasm for George Dennis fell far short of the adulation accorded him by Cameron, Seymour, and the Victo- rian reviewers, Etruscan Places abounds with acknowledged and unac- knowledged debts to his work. From the evidence of the text, it is certain that Lawrence had the Cities and Cemeteries by his side when he wrote the Etruscan essays, and it is likely that he carried Dennis' volumes with him on his tour. The pervasiveness of Lawrence's borrow- ings from Dennis can best be grasped by examining one pilferage that might be easily overlooked. Referring to the epitaph in the tomb of the Tarquins at Cerveteri, Lawrence wrote: "We can read these debonair inscriptions, that look as if someone had just chalked them up yester- day without a thought, in the archaic Etruscan letters, quite easily."" It seems merely a personal impression; nothing about his observation marks it as coming from his readings. When Lawrence informs us that the Ponte dell'Abbadia near Vulci was first built by the Etruscans we expect a source, but here we do not. Yet in the Cerveteri chapter of the Cities and Cemeteries Dennis had written: "Observe these scratched epi- graphs. They are remarkable for the wonderful freshness of the impres- sion. ... you might suppose the inscription had been written but one day, instead of more than two thousand years ago" (II, 43-45). This is not plagiarism, just the inevitable result of excessive familiarity. Strik- ingly, references to Dennis increase in Lawrence's "Vulci" and "Volterra" chapters, the ones that were written last. Even one of Dennis' own adventures, the confrontation with the workmen of Lucien Bonaparte, finds its way into the text. Perhaps Lawrence had exhausted what he had to say about the Etruscans in the Cerveteri and Tarquinia essays and for the later ones he needed material to flesh out the subject. The attraction of this hypothesis is that it explains why Lawrence never completed his Etruscan book; very simply, he had run out of novel observations. And indeed the first four essays of Etruscan Places contain most of Lawrence's insight into the art, politics, and religion of this archaic culture. Having already set forth his ideas on primitive consciousness, his consideration of the other towns would have meant the devotion of more time to the peculiarities intrinsic to each site. 441</page><page sequence="6">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE Lawrence surpassed his more trained colleagues in the ability to re- cover a people from the dimness of prehistory, but he lacked that other necessary attribute of the archeologist-a delight in painstaking detail. It is not hard to see that Lawrence would have been the wrong person to investigate the features which distinguished the Etruscan inhabitants of Chiusi from those of Tarquinia. Although a large part of Lawrence's admiration of the Etruscan Confederation depended on their mainte- nance of civic and cultural separateness, it was his habit not to be satisfied with difference until he had turned it into opposition. When he found that many artifacts in the Volterra museum had what he called a "restlessness" about them, a characteristic absent from things he had seen earlier, he resorted to the old contrast of north and south to account for the change. The procedure and intention Lawrence had set forth some five years earlier in the foreword to Fantasia of the Unconscious apply as well to Etruscan Places: I believe I am only trying to stammer out the first terms of a forgotten knowledge. But I have no desire to revive dead kings, or dead sages. It is not for me to arrange fossils and decipher hieroglyphic phrases. I couldn't do it if I wanted to. But then I can do something else. The soul must take the hint from the relics our scientists have so marvelously gathered out of the forgotten past, and from the hint develop a new living utterance. The spark is from dead wisdom, but the fire is life.12 As this passage suggests, Lawrence would not have intended Etruscan Places to be a compendium on Etruscan civilization as Dennis had intended his book to be. Rather, his aim was to recover the living universe of archaic man. He wanted to "develop a new living utterance" which would enable modern man to recognize again, as the Etruscans had eight hundred years before Christ, that "every man, every creature and tree and lake and mountain and stream, [is] animate, [has] its own peculiar consciousness" (EP, p. 49). To accomplish this task, Lawrence realized that he needed to do more than find or create a myth which would produce a new totality in the universe. He knew that nothing less than a quickening of man's mythic or symbolic consciousness would do. By returning to a mythical consciousness Lawrence attempted to recapture the worshipful attitude of archaic man. The active religious idea he wanted to regain was "the conception of the vitality of the cosmos, the myriad vitalities in wild confusion, which still is held in some array: and man, amid all the glowing welter, adventuring, 442</page><page sequence="7">LAWRENCE'S DEBT TO GEORGE DENNIS struggling, striving for one thing, life, vitality, more vitality: to get into himself more and more of the gleaming vitality of the cosmos" (EP, p. 50). This vitalistic religion seemed to Lawrence more desirable than later religions which utilized the conception of an anthropomorphic deity, because it encouraged man to worship the universe with his whole body, rather than with only his spiritual part. Lawrence preferred the animistic and vitalistic religions of the pagans to Christianity because they were more concerned with life than with afterlife. "By the time of Christ," Lawrence remarked in Apocalypse, "all religion and all thought seemed to turn from the old worship and study of vitality, potency, power, to the study of death and death-rewards, death-penalties and morals. All religion, instead of being religion of life here and now, became religion of postponed destiny, death and reward afterwards, 'if you are good.' "13 As his health deteriorated and death increasingly occupied his mind, Lawrence was drawn to Etruscan religion, since it reassured him that death did not have to arouse such terror in man. He attributed the Etruscans' ac- ceptance of death to their symbolic consciousness which enabled them to reconcile opposites, whether lion and goat, or life and death. In the Etruscans' symbolic view, heaven and earth, supernatural and natural, appeared to echo each other; and since this mystical unity between the celestial and the terrestrial extended to death as well, they could re- gard death as a continuation of life. Lawrence arrived at his understanding of the Etruscans' attitude toward death solely from an intuitive appraisal of the tomb paintings. The gay scenes which still covered the underground walls led him to believe that "once it was all bright and dancing: the delight of the underworld; honouring the dead with wine, and flutes playing for a dance, and limbs whirling and pressing. And it was deep and sincere honour rendered to the dead and to the mysteries" (EP, pp. 46-47). None of his predecessors confirmed this assertion, but their disagree- ment only convinced him further that his intimation was correct. George Dennis, for example, had written: "Everyone, on entering these tombs, must be struck by the inappropriateness of such scenes to a sepulchre; but happily for us we regard them from the high vantage- ground of Christianity, and our view is not bounded by a paradise of mere sensual gratification" (I, 294). One has little trouble guessing Lawrence's reaction to this passage. The smugness with which Dennis upheld Christianity as the pinnacle of mankind's religious strivings surely sent him into a rage. Dennis' insinuation that solemnity and black mourning clothes were more appropriate responses to death than 443</page><page sequence="8">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE banqueting and dancing probably only reentrenched Lawrence's pref- erence for Etruscan revelry. Lawrence thought that Christianity had more often left people shipwrecked than on high ground. In fact, the very failure of Chris- tianity to provide an adequate means of coping with death sent Law- rence on his search for another creed to take its place. The example of the ancient Etruscans gave him what the religion of his youth never could-the ability to face death courageously. It has often been ob- served that the Etruscan tombs supplied Lawrence with the principal image for The Ship of Death (the bronze ship was always put beside the dead); but perhaps of more importance is the fact that they gave him the strength to write the poem. Lawrence's contention that the Etruscans viewed death as "just a natural continuance of the fullness of life" explained well the exuber- ant scenes from the early period of Etruscan history, but seemed to be disproved by tombs later than the fifth century B.C. For he noticed that the tomb paintings which predated the fifth century depicted the after- life as an extension of the joyous life known on earth, while those after showed "a great gloomy, clumsy, rambling sort of underworld, damp and horrid" (EP, p. 74). Lawrence believed so firmly in the Etruscans' optimistic outlook on death that he hypothesized an outside influence to account for this change. The Romans, he insisted, were to blame for the perversion of the originally insouciant Etruscans. According to his interpretation, the Romans, who sought a mechanical triumph over nature and submitted to ideals, infused notions of good and evil into the formerly amoral Etruscan universe. It seemed a general truth to Lawrence that the Roman kind of resistance to life always carried out its designs under the guise of morality. With this seepage of morality into Etruscan thought, their conception of the afterlife as "a continuing of the wonder-journey of life" gave way gradually to the idea of a gloomy underworld and fears of purgation. Although no precedent existed for this assumption of a Roman influence, Lawrence could not understand the switch from an initial acceptance of death to the fear of death in any other way. To be sure, George Dennis offered no confirmation, for he maintained that from the beginning of their religion the Etruscans had conceived a realm of the dead populated with frightening figures. Surprisingly, modern scholarship has tended to side with Lawrence's hypothesis of an exter- nal influence and to reject Dennis' theory that the infernal demonology of the later tombs was of distinctly Etruscan origin. But, with a detach- ment which Lawrence's animosity toward the Romans prevented, these 444</page><page sequence="9">LAWRENCE'S DEBT TO GEORGE DENNIS later archeologists have redirected the blame from the Romans to the Greeks.14 Since Lawrence could never do anything part way, presenting the Etruscans as only champions of an older, more desirable mode of consciousness did not content him. With his lack of moderation he proceeded to turn them as well into exemplars of his social and political theories. Since nothing was known about either the Etruscan monarchy or the daily life of the people except what could be inferred from the tomb paintings or an analogy with early Rome, Lawrence was free to project his own ideals onto this dimly recorded culture. From George Dennis Lawrence could have learned that the Etrus- can government most likely corresponded to a feudal oligarchy. But he chose to disregard Dennis' supposition that wealth formed the basis of Etruscan political power, and instead imposed upon Etruria a hierarchy according to awareness, a system he had theoretically sketched in Fan- tasia of the Unconscious. Lawrence believed that in Etruscan culture conscious "knowing" belonged only to the Lucumo (or king-god) and the priests, while the lower levels of society, which included warriors, plebeians, and slaves, avoided trying to "understand" in favor of a life of the body. This social structure appeared to Lawrence eminently workable because the dual elements of mental and sensual conscious- ness were maintained in a polarity within the culture. For, despite the wide gap which existed between their respective understandings, the ruling and dependent classes were kept in touch by numinous symbols, which the Lucumo and priests knew, and the people felt. Lawrence considered the Lucumo the key fixture of Etruscan society, for the king-god fulfilled the double role of magistrate and leader in the sacred mysteries. But since the exact nature of the Etrus- can monarchy had been obscured by time, he interpolated the missing parts with the aid of Frazer's section on the "Magic of Kings" and his own ideas on aristocracy: With the Egyptians and Babylonians and Etruscans, strictly there were no personal gods. There were only idols or symbols. It was the living cosmos itself, dazzlingly and gaspingly complex, which was divine, and which could be contemplated only by the strongest soul, and only at moments. And only the peerless soul could draw into itself some last flame from the quick .... There you have the ancient idea of kings, kings who are gods by vividness, because they have gathered into themselves core after core of vital potency from the universe. ... (EP, pp. 50-51). Because of such credentials Lawrence deemed the Lucumo suited to join his circle of "natural aristocrats," a grouping based not on the false 445</page><page sequence="10">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE valuations of money or birth, but on the qualities of perceptiveness and aliveness. "He who is most alive, intrinsically is king, whether men admit it or not," and Lawrence had no doubt that the ancient world always recognized regality in the most vital man.15 Lawrence borrowed few of his ideas about the Lucumo from his preparatory readings on the Etruscans. For, while he regarded the king-god's role as central to Etruria's greatness, Etruscan scholars unan- imously blamed the all-powerful Lucumo for Etruria's lack of any religious or intellectual achievement. In his Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria, for example, Dennis wrote: Before the gate of that paradise where the intellect revels unfet- tered among speculations on its own nature, on its origin, exis- tence, and final destiny, on its relation to the First Cause, to the other minds, and society in general-stood the sacerdotal Lucumo, brandishing in one hand the double-edged sword of secular and ecclesiastical authority and holding forth in the other hand the book of Tages, exclaiming, to his awe-struck subjects, "Believe and Obey!" (I, liv). Lawrence valued the Lucumo for the very reasons that Dennis and later Etruscologists, like M. Pallottino and Raymond Bloch, condemned him: because the king-god kept the mass of the population enthralled and prevented them from pondering the meaning of life. Lawrence never denied the importance of philosophical inquiry, but he thought it best reserved for the most perceptive minds, which in Etruria meant the Lucumo and the priests. He maintained that a major dilemma of the modern world was its overconcern with such abstractions as "exis- tence and final destiny"; and he prized the hierarchical structure of Etruscan society since it encouraged the people to live rather than to think about life. Lawrence always argued for a recognition of the difference be- tween political freedom and being free. He knew that the former condition had not existed in Etruria, for George Dennis had put the matter bluntly when he wrote: "Political freedom was a plant which flourished not in Etruria. The power was wholly in the hands of the priestly nobles; the people had no voice in the government, not even the power of making themselves heard and respected, as at Rome" (I, xlvii). Lawrence did not dispute these facts; instead, he gave them a different slant. The freedom of ancient and modern governments, in which everyone theoretically could make his opinions known, seemed to him very empty. Lawrence's own conception of what freedom entailed received its most concise formulation about five years before 446</page><page sequence="11">LAWRENCE'S DEBT TO GEORGE DENNIS he visited the tombs. "Men are free," he wrote, "when they belong to a living, organic, believing community, active in fulfilling some unful- filled, perhaps unrealized purpose."16 It was with this definition of freedom in mind that Lawrence could see freedom in the Etruscan state. Although enraged by Dennis' condescending attitude toward Etruscan politics and religion, Lawrence almost forgave him everything because of his ability to respond to the naturalness of Etruscan art. In the "Volterra" essay Lawrence quotes Dennis on the ash chests: The touches of nature on these Etruscan urns, so simply but eloquently expressed, must appeal to the sympathies of all-they are chords to which every heart must respond; and I envy not the man who can walk through this museum unmoved, without feeling a tear rise to his eye, 'And recognizing ever and anon The breeze of Nature stirring in his soul.' (EP, p. 106; also Dennis, II, 198-99) This paraphrase of Dr. Johnson's dictum on Gray's "Elegy," although a bit lachrymose for Lawrence's taste, summed up those attributes of insouciance and unpretentiousness that made the Etruscans so attrac- tive to Lawrence himself. Dennis alone of all earlier writers anticipated Lawrence's reaction to Etruscan art. When the Victorian scholar says that "the Etruscans seem to have excelled in the palpable expression of natural feeling" (II, 198), he is very close to appreciating that quality which Lawrence described as "naturalness verging on the commonplace, but usually missing it, and often achieving an originality so free and so bold, and so fresh . . ." (EP, p. 32). But, like many other nineteenth-century ar- cheologists and art historians, Dennis tended to think more highly of a particular work the more nearly it exemplified Greek aesthetic ideals. The early tomb paintings aroused an antiquarian interest in him, but he preferred the later ones "which breathe of Greece, of the spirit and feelings of the Hellenic vases, where there is a grace of outline, a dignity and simplicity of attitude, and a force of expression, which prove the limner to have been a master of his art . . ." (I, lxxvii). This kind of bias explained the adulation accorded the well-known painting of a woman with wheat-ears for a fillet in the relatively late Tomb of Orcus at Tarquinia. Lawrence was not surprised that most experts considered this tomb to be the high point of Etruscan painting for "it belongs to the classic Convention, and men can only see according to a Convention. We haven't exactly plucked our eyes out, but we've 447</page><page sequence="12">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE plucked out three-fourths of their vision" (EP, p. 76). In Lawrence's estimation the paintings in the Tomb of Orcus revealed only the dec- adence of Etruscan art, not its major phase. In Etruscan Places Lawrence tried to get his readers to take a fresh rook at Etruscan paintings and artifacts. To accomplish this he had to make them question their assumptions about art, assumptions founded upon the preconception that all art should aspire to the achievements of classical Greece. In contrast to the many short-lived touchstones of artistic excellence, this one had proved remarkably durable, lasting from the latter half of the eighteenth century to the present age. As Roger Fry has reflected: "It is an extraordinary chapter in that great still unwritten book, the history of taste-this which deals with the supreme sanctity of Greek art."17 Lawrence did not begin to write such a chapter but he did his part by calling for a revaluation of Greek aesthetics. Of course he proceeded in his own way by attempting to make the reader prefer the spontaneity of the Etruscans to the over- refined elegance of the Greeks. The most common estimate of Etruscan art, as stated by Dennis, was that it showed "more spirit than correctness, better intention than capability of execution" (I, 343). To this kind of criticism Lawrence responded: "For me, I get more real pleasure out of these Volterran ash-chests than out of-I had almost said, the Parthenon frieze. One wearies of the aesthetic quality-a quality which takes the edge off everything, and makes it seem 'boiled down.' A great deal of pure Greek beauty has this boiled down effect. It is too much cooked in the artistic consciousness" (EP, pp. 106-07). Lawrence's perennial bias against the intellect shows through in this attack on Greek architecture. Since this is his stock indictment of everything from Joyce's Ulysses to Western civilization as a whole, it is reassuring to know that in his essay on Greek art in Last Lectures Roger Fry also suspects the Greek desire for perfection. "In the end I think we must conclude," Fry writes, "that this Greek desire for perfection is not really an aesthetic urge, but is a trespass by the intellect into the province of aesthetic feeling."18 However interesting and convincing, Lawrence cannot lay claim to being our most reliable critic of Etruscan art. Lawrence's intense re- sponse to Etruscan symbolism disqualifies him. As Herbert Read has observed in Art and Society: "Symbolism, far from encouraging a higher aesthetic standard, is entirely indifferent; and being satisfied with the most summary representation of the object, image or idea, tends actu- ally to discourage any elaboration in the interests of purely aesthetic qualities."19 Read is speaking of symbolic intent as it affects the creator 448</page><page sequence="13">LAWRENCE'S DEBT TO GEORGE DENNIS of the art object, but his conclusion can be turned about and applied to the observer. Lawrence's statement that "it is the symbolic element which rouses the deeper emotion, and gives the peculiarly satisfying quality to the dancing figures and creatures" (EP, p. 57) clearly illus- trates that he reacts to Etruscan art more in the manner of an initiate than as a critic. Content to leave an objective evaluation of Etruscan art to those with the proper training, Lawrence attempted to work back from the esoteric symbolism and imagery of the Etruscans to the life of pre-Roman Italy. This qualification of Lawrence's credentials as a critic of Etruscan art applies mainly to his treatment of the tomb paintings. When con- fronted by nonrepresentational forms he is in safer territory. Once released from the self-imposed task of penetrating the Etruscans' sym- bolic system, he can feel free to turn their nonsymbolic objects into his own symbols. Lawrence's appreciation of the early pieces of black, crude-limned bucchero ware demonstrates this impulse. "If one looks for the Greek form of elegance and convention," Lawrence com- mented, "those elegant 'still-unravished brides of quietness,' one is disappointed. But get over the strange desire we have for the elegant convention, and the vases and dishes of the Etruscans, especially many of the black bucchero ware, begin to open out like strange flowers, black flowers with all the softness and rebellion of life against conven- tion, or red-and-black flowers painted with amusing free, bold designs" (EP, p. 32). George Dennis and Pericle Ducati had dismissed the early bucchero ware as being of little value in comparison with the Greek- influenced vases of later centuries. Rejecting their opinions, Lawrence favored the older, simpler efforts and detected in these comparatively crude artifacts the essential Etruscan temperament. These "black flow- ers" became his symbols of the insouciance of Etruscan life and the naturalness of Etruscan art. Lawrence depended heavily on the work of scholars to give his Etruscan travel book an historical authenticity. But the information he gathered from his studies formed only the starting point from which he proceeded to his own conclusion. For, while Lawrence's eclectic pro- pensity led him to extract ideas from various sources which he then worked into his own system, his individuality prevented him from adhering too closely to anyone else's theories. Lawrence was grateful to his predecessors and to George Dennis in particular for covering the Etruscans so well. In effect, they freed him from having to supply factual information, a task which had weighted down Burton's and Doughty's Arabian travel books. Since geographic and demographic 449</page><page sequence="14">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE data could be found elsewhere, Lawrence was able to concentrate on what interested him most: the Etruscan mode of consciousness. 1 Otto-Wilhelm Von Vacano, The Etruscans in the Ancient World (London: Edward Arnold, 1960), p. 182. 2 (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1910), p. 146, n. 1. 3 Introduction to Etruscan Places, by D. H. Lawrence (London: Heinemann, 1965), p. v. 4 One odd circumstance of Dennis' career was that every time he finished a book on Italy, he almost immediately accepted a post in a different part of the world: in 1849 he began a tenure as private secretary to the Governor of British Guiana; and in 1863 he moved to Bengazi, Tripoli. 5 (London: John Murray, 1848), II, 482-83.

Pallottino has stated that it is impossi- ble "categorically to state that belief in man's survival in the tomb excludes all belief in the transmigration of souls to a realm beyond the grave. It is certain, however, that in Etruria the latter belief became progressively more and more established and definite under the influence of Greek religion and mythology, with a consequent weakening of the original beliefs."
