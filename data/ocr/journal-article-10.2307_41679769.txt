Yet, for all its unlikelihood, at least part of the tale is true* A man was hanged and a woman burned for the murder of Mrs* Clark in 1605*2 And by that time or very shortly after, the bed had become a widely known tourist attraction* In 1611, Henry Peacham would list "King Richards bed-sted i' Leyster" among sights that could be seen for a penny in England and Wales (alongside such "trifles, and toyes" ' as "Westminster monuments," the cave of Merlin, and a cassowary which ate hot coals)*3 The bedstead was but one of several Ricardian objects and artifacts which might be viewed on a tour of Leicester in the early seventeenth century, including the horse trough at the Greyhound Inn, rumored to have been Richards sarcophagus, a monument to the fallen king erected by a prominent citizen in his garden, and the protrud- ing stone on Bow Bridge against which Richard s head was said to have struck when his corpse was brought back from Bosworth Field, slung over the back of a horse*4 Richards remains were the bedrock of a nascent civic tourist industry* Whether or not the Clarks ever profited from the fateful bedstead, their succès- sors at the Blue Boar undoubtedly did* In the same years that visitors to Leicester could give a penny to see the bed in which Richard III spent the last night of his life, London audiences were being treated to the same sight - and at much the same price* Although a bed is not specified in the stage directions for Richard III , the king is required to sleep on stage and be awakened by ghosts in the scene depicting the night before the battle* It is very probable that a bed was used for this scene when it was presented on the London stage, whilst a chair might have been employed in the more straitened conditions of touring* (This appears to have been the 2 James Thompson/' Richard III at Leicester/' Notes &amp; Queries , 2nd sen 86 (1857): 153-54, esp. 154» The woman's punishment took this horrible form because, as a maidservant, the mur- der of her mistress constituted "petty treason," 3 Henry Peacham, prefatory verses in Coryats Crudities (London, 1611), sig. k4v. Among the most valuable and visually impressive of early modern household items, it is not entirely sur- prising that bedsteads could become celebrated tourist attractions, as witnessed in the case of the Great Bed of Ware (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum), as well as Richard s bed at Leicester.

or, from Richards point of view, a hope - that the change may not be as lasting as it seems* The phrase "our bruisèd arms" creates an asso- ciation between battered and outmoded weapons and armor from the civil wars and Richards own body - not least because his arm is misshapen, "like a blasted sapling withered up" (3*4*69)*8 Richard thus figures himself as an object out of time, relegated to the trophy cabinet because he is not shaped for the sportive tricks of the new era* He interprets the celebration of peace as a rejection of the past, and therefore of himself* In displaying their arms as monuments, the vic- tors are not only celebrating the victory of their house over that of Lancaster, but also the victory of the present era over the immediately preceding one, of a time of peace and pleasure over a time of war and risk and fear* Richard, by contrast, aims for a victory of the past over the present* His wish is for the exhausted energy in those bruised arms to reassert itself, like the sinister secret in Mrs* Clark's neglected bedstead suddenly spilling forth* This essay will trace the afterlives of a range of objects associated with the reign and person of Richard III, including his crown, dagger, livery badges, books, and bed* To be sure, it is impossible to prove that all of the objects ascribed to Richard in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries really belonged to him, or even dated to his era* Some, including the bed at the Blue Boar, may have acquired the association at a later date, rather as the foundling in Wildes play is advised to acquire a parent before the season is quite over* Yet, as will be seen, even objects with no original connection to Richard III became tied to him in the course of their careers to such an extent that the association with Richard determined their value, their significance, and their very survival (or otherwise)* The divergent forms of value attached to Richarďs putative possessions in the early modern period provide a context for interpreting the reemergence of many of these same items as theatrical props in Richard III * Stage properties such as Richards prayer book, dagger, bedstead, and armor were objects with histories and complex associations, no less than those things in the world beyond the playhouse which were said to have belonged to the king himself* In its treatment of objects, I will suggest, Richard III invites us to consider how much and how 8 Compare Sonnet 73, in which the autumnal "boughs which shake against the cold" (L 3) seem weirdly close to human limbs.</page><page sequence="6">302 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY little separates the dramatic property from the genuine article, and in doing so to gauge the proximity and the distance between Shakespeares era and Richards own, Although "object biography" has emerged as an academic buzzword only relatively recently, Shakespeare was an early and confirmed practitioner of the genre* Some of the most memorable passages in the plays involve the revelation of a material items past* Shylock lends poignancy to his lament for the tur- quoise ring his daughter has stolen by recalling, "I had it from Leah when I was a bachelor* I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys" ( Merchant of Venice , 3*1*101)*9 The Ghost in Hamlet appears significantly in "the very armour he had on / When he thambitious Norway combated" (1*1*59-60), raising the question of why that armour, like the throne, escaped inheritance by his son*10 Othello terrifies Desdemona by revealing the prehistory of the apparently nor- mal handkerchief she has mislaid: "The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk, / And it was dyed in mummy, which the skilful / Conserved of maidens hearts" ( Othello , 3*4*71-73)* For Othello, the "magic in the web of it" is the key to the objects enduring power and significance: origin is essence* Yet, with a previous career in English stage practice as well as within the dramatic narra- tive, the handkerchief has more than one history* As a type of charged theatrical property, it harks back to the bloody handkerchief of Kyds Spanish Tragedy , and even to the holy handkerchief of Veronica seen on the pre-Reformation stage*11 While this too is a kind of sacred origin, the biography of the handkerchief qua prop does not testify to unchanging essence, but rather to ongoing processes of transformation, negotiation, de- and re-mystification* Recent academic approaches to object biography continue to play out the tensions and contradictions implicit in the two histories of the handkerchief* In his seminal article "The Cultural Biography of Things" (1984), Igor KopytofF argues that the life cycles of objects may involve repeated transitions between commodity status and other quite distinct forms of value (Leah s ring is a case 9 On Leah's ring, see Catherine Richardson, Shakespeare and Material Culture (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2011), 38-63. 10 On the Ghosts armor as a withheld material legacy, see Peter Stallybrass, "Worn Worlds: Clothes and Identity on the Renaissance Stage," in Subject and Object in Renaissance Culture, ed.

It is fair to say that the vast majority of objects from the world of 1483-85 passed into the succeeding era without carrying more than a flicker of untimeliness* Pots, pikes, and pav- ing stones were employed or destroyed on the basis of their present usefulness, not for what they had been in the reign of Richard III* Yet a particular range of objects survived into the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as witnesses to a lost world, their use value bound inextricably to their past* Many of the objects 12 Igor KopytofF, "The Cultural Biography of Things: Commoditization as Process," in The Social Life of Things : Commodities in Cultural Perspective, ed.

The Derby connection would explain the passage of Stanley heirlooms to the Wentworths. It is not entirely clear whether the old hangings "found here" at Wentworth Woodhouse estate were part of the same suite as the Knowsley hangings taken from Richard s tent, or simply resembled them* In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Knowsley was not yet the main seat of the Stanleys, but a hunting lodge in the grounds of Lathom HalL The ballads and poems The Rose of England and Bosworth Field (both before 1495), Lady Bessy (early sixteenth century), and T he Stanley Poem (1560-72) all celebrate the achievements of the Stanleys at Bosworth, while expressing ever-fainter allegiance to the Tudor dynasty.

What dis- tinguishes the relic from the trophy or the souvenir? As Alexandra Walsham has observed, the membrane dividing these categories is "shifting and porous"; what seems to divide relics most clearly from other objects "is their capacity to operate as a locus and conduit of power*"41 That power invariably has its sources in the past* A relic can be thought of as an object imprinted so strongly by an event that it carries the potent essence of that moment forward in time - an object for which the crucifixion of Christ or the stabbing of Henry VI is not only a part of its history but of its material essence for all time to come* Relics are thus para- digmatic participants in what Harris calls the temporality of explosion, in which "the traces of the past acquire a living agency within, and against, the present*"42 John London was clearly rather fascinated by the pretty relics of Caversham, even as he wrote of them with scorn* He mentions the dagger that killed Henry and the knife that slew Saint Edward (Edward the martyr, a tenth-century Eng- 39 John P.

Orthodox opinion, as expressed by Thomas Aquinas, held relics to be deserving of honor because of their past association with a body which had served a temple of the Holy Spirit: "It is for this reason that God himself grants honour to their relics by performing miracles when they are present"; see Summa Theologiae, Volume 50: The One Mediator (3a, 16-26), ed, and trans, Colman O'Neill (London: Blackfriars, 1965), 3a, 25, 6 (203), While Aquinas is careful to avoid the suggestion of any power or efficacy residing in the object itself, popular belief was undoubtedly closer to the position of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, who held that the bodies of saints, and also their garments, retained a powerful virtue because of the righteousness of the soul which had once been housed within them. See The Catechetical Lectures of St Cyril Archbishop of Jerusalem (Oxford: Parker, 1838), lecture 18:16, 248, Whether or not one is thinking of actual relics, it seems impossible to think about this category of object without drawing on religious terminology - Harris here refers to both the breaking of the seals in Revelation and the "weak messianism" of Walter Benjamin (91, 92-94),</page><page sequence="16">312 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY lish king) in three successive letters from Reading (two addressed to Cromwell, and one, probably, to Richard Rich), In the second letter he describes the instru- ment of Henry s death as including "schethe and all/' as if he were remember- ing that passage in Polydore Vergil which has Richard constantly drawing the dagger in and out of the sheath*43 Caversham does seem to have specialized in sacralized instruments of destruction* Along with the daggers, London says in his third letter, he is sending "the principali relik of idolytrie within thys realme, an aungell with oon wyng that brow3t to Caversham the spere hedde that percyd our Saviour is syde upon the crosse*" To Rich he acknowledges having missed, however, "a peece of the holy halter Judas wasse hangyd withalL"44 By Londons account, the shrine at Caversham housed a veritable armory of blood-shedding weapons under the name of relics* In itself, this was nothing out of the ordinary* The Holy Cross, the chief instrument of Christs death, was a prolific source of relics across all Christendom; nearby Reading Abbey possessed two pieces of the Cross*45 But Cavershams specialization in a certain definite type of relic was open to misconstruction* It is likely enough that in dis- playing these items to London, the warden of the shrine sought to persuade the royal commissioner that Caversham was a place where kings were held in special reverence* In the context of the Act of Supremacy, the warden may have been taking the line: "The church has always looked to the king for spiritual leader- ship, and nowhere more so than at this shrine" London, however, seems intent on twisting this to imply that the shrine has made a habit of collecting and venerating instruments of treason and regicide* When the "the holy dager that kylled Kinge Henry" and "the holy knyfe that kylled Seynt Edwarde" are exhib- ited alongside "the holy halter Judas wasse hangyd withal," one is left to question whether the weapon is being venerated for its connection with martyrdom, or simply for having dispatched a villain* The contested meaning of this relic can be summed up in the question: is this the instrument that martyred holy king Henry, or is it the perversely venerated dagger of Richard III? London reported that he was sending the dagger to Cromwell by the next available barge, together with other relics of the shrine* What happened when the dagger reached its destination? In a season when monasteries and shrines were falling up and down the country, and their most treasured items being confiscated by the crown, a flood of miscellaneous artifacts can be imagined trundling by road and river into London* Different kinds of holy objects were 43 Wright, ed., Three Chapters of Letters, 224» 44 Wright, ed., Three Chapters of Letters, 225, 224. 45 Other than this, Readings copious relic collection centered around bones - possibly a sign that the abbey had completed its collection by the end of the twelfth century.

These are volumes that bear directly on the themes of royal lineage and British history; it is as if Cromwell were recognizing his inevitable absorption into the very tradition and genealogy he had sought to disrupt, at a point when he was just a step or two from royalty, and a few months from death* A still more complex history of reuse and reinscription is found in the case of Richard s personal prayer book* Unlike the dagger and the bedstead, this is an object we can say with certainty did belong to Richard and was used by him, thus enrolling him in a lineage with owners both anterior and posterior* The book was made around 1420, probably for a clerical user* It is an ornate but not exactly sumptuous example of its kind* Richard seems to have adopted it around the time he came to the throne, inscribing in his own sprawling hand his name and birthday in the calendar: Hac die natus erat Ricardus Rex Anglie tertius Apud Foderingay Anno domini mlccccliio [on this day was born Richard III King of England AD 1452] *53 He had various prayers added to it, including a long prayer for help against besetting foes and tribulations, calling on God "to make and keep concord between me and my enemies, to show me and pour over me your grace and glory, and deign to assuage, turn aside, destroy, and bring to nothing the hatred they bear towards to me*"54 Often referred to as the "prayer of Richard III/' the prayer was in fact widely disseminated around Europe and was used by Maximilian I and Frederick of Aragon, among others; its conventional- ity does not preclude the possibility that it offers us a glimpse of his personal psychology and spiritual preoccupations*55 Like his tent hangings, Richard s prayer book seems to have formed part of the spoils of Bosworth, claimed in this case by the new kings mother, Margaret Beaufort*56 Eamon Duffy has suggested that Margaret acquired it "as a trophy 52 Anne E Sutton and Livia Visser- Fuchs, Richard Ills Books: Ideals and Reality in the Life and Library of a Medieval Prince (Stroud, UK: Alan Sutton, 1997), 53 Lambeth MS 474, foL 7v.

Of course, Richards book is not what it seems* It is a theatrical prop, and is understood as such by the characters within the drama, as well as by the actors who play them* Buckingham is both the deviser of the tableau - advising Richard to "get a prayer book in your hand / And stand between two churchmen" (1L 47-48) - and its subsequent interpreter, drawing attention to Richards brace of bishops as "Two props of virtue for a Christian prince" (L 96)* Although it is arguable that the modern sense of "prop" as an object in a theatrical performance did not come into use before the nineteenth century, the resonance between these "props" and stage properties is hard to ignore* As Elizabethan Williamson observes, the attention given to the prayer book creates "a moment in which the spectators, the actor, and the character are all simulta- neously aware of the similarity between the object within the drama and the property used in the theatrical production*"60 The volume that appeared on the Elizabethan stage and in subsequent performances was not, to be sure, the same volume that had once belonged to Richard III - indeed, the players may well have thought it safest not to employ a religious text of any sort*61 That the scene attracted controversy is perhaps witnessed by the omission of the lines referring to the prayer book from the quarto version of the play* As John Jowett notes, the prominence given to the book may have been interpreted as a satirical reference to the Protestant Book of Common Prayer*62 Although the historical setting of the play would indicate a Catholic book of hours, the manipulation of the property eloquently suggests how the book, which Protestant discourse persistently privileged over the image, could function as a misleading outward sign* The object with which Richard is associated most powerfully, in the dra- matic as in the historical tradition, is of course his dagger* Shakespeare does not take every opportunity to equip his villain with the dagger made famous by Polydore Vergil and Thomas More* Richards murder of Henry VI - the event that sanctified the "holy dagger" of Caversham - is committed in 3 Henry 60 Williamson, 161* 61 There is opportunity for a visual joke if the book in Richards hand is obviously inappropri- ate. In Richard Loncraine's 1995 film, Buckingham hands Richard what appears to be a vulgar thriller; when Richard gives it a doubtful look, Buckingham whips off the paper cover, leaving a black-bound volume which can pass for a book of prayer.

Samuel Rowlands was probably thinking of Burbages performance when, in 1600, he satirized those who "like Richard, the usurper, swagger, that had his hand con- tinual on his dagger"63 The notorious dagger does feature centrally in at least one scene, that in which Richard welcomes his nephews to London* Newly taken from his moth- er s side in sanctuary, the little Duke of York is pert in his requests* York I pray you, uncle, render me this dagger* richard My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart! prince Edward A beggar, brother? York Of my kind uncle that I know will give, And being but a toy which is no grief to give* (3*1*110-14) In terming his uncles far-from-harmless dagger a "toy," the young prince per- haps means only that it is a thing of little worth or significance - a common sense of "toy" in the sixteenth century* Yet that the speaker is a child inevitably suggests the other sense of the term, familiar in the modern era and already emergent in Shakespeare s time: that is, a toy as a plaything, and more especially an object representing another ("real") object*64 The teasing phrase thus draws attention to the double nature of the actual object displayed upon the stage* The dagger used in early performances was in all likelihood a real weapon (pos- sibly the personal possession of Richard Burbage)* Yet in calling it a "toy," York seems willfully to draw attention to the way its use as a prop creates a split in the status of the object - driving a wedge between the thing itself and its func- tion as a dramatic sign*65 His use of the word derives some of its force from its application by Protestant reformers to Catholic images and relics - such as 63 That Rowlands is thinking of Shakespeare's Richard is probable.

There is no reason to believe that Shake- speare knew about the "holy dagger" of Caversham, the bed at the Blue Boar, or the peregrinations of the Kings prayer book* Yet neither the survival of these par- ticular objects nor their material echoes on the stage is a matter of random chance* The sorts of items in question are all "personal," in the sense that, at any given time, they are likely to be counted among the intimate belongings of one indi- vidual (or a small family group)* At the same time, they are durable objects that might be expected to survive and retain their usefulness for several generations* Such objects define our identities, yet they are apt to outlive us, going on to enjoy equally intimate association with our chosen or unchosen successors* Shakespeare, famously, bequeathed a bed - the second best - to his wife in his will* Sometimes, of course, instead of being passed on, such belongings were sold off: because they 66 John Bale, An Expostulation or Complaynte agaynste the Blasphemyes of a Franticke Papyst of Hamshyre (London, 1552), sig.

See also Williamson, 193. 67 The royal crown is visually and verbally prominent in the play, especially from 4,2, in which Richard enters crowned, to the final scene, where it is presented to Richmond, fresh "From the dead temples of this bloody wretch" (5.8,5). Richards coinage - or at any rate his coins - also appear, offered in recompense to the messenger he has overhastily struck (4.4.445). Seeking a murderer, he asks"Knowst thou not any whom corrupting gold/ Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?"

other prominent objects, including the crown, the throne, and Hastings severed head, would probably have been constructed as props, either for this play or past productions* The stores of theatrical companies were well- stocked with both kinds of objects, and the property list of the Admirals Men, with its "i bedsteade * * * i golden scepter * * * ii rackets * * * owld Mahemetes head," does not seem to distinguish or discriminate between them*69 Of course, even a "born" ' prop is, in material terms, a real thing, and thus capable of acquiring a history or biography of its own* Antony Sher s memoir of his experience play- ing Richard III for the Royal Shakespeare Company in the 1980s records an uncanny encounter with the material vestiges of past performances* Rehearsals took place in a room "full of old things from old productions: a goblet, a sceptre, a throne* Theatre props age faster than their real counterparts* The cardboard shows, the plaster shows, they look crude and childish, reminding you of school productions*"70 Although Sher assumes a clear and obvious distinction between theatrical properties and real things, the spectacle of the aging prop undercuts and almost inverts this distinction* The failure of the props illusionistic poten- tial highlights its sheer materiality* Marked by their histories, the props seem if anything more real than their "real counterparts" which, concealing their age, readily subordinating the past to the needs of the present, begin to seem almost tawdrily theatrical* Sher goes on to describe the storeroom as "full of ghosts - one of them sits on an upper level looking down, a white polystyrene figure from some long- forgotten show, sitting intently forward, elbows on knees, keeping a watchful eye on this latest production* The Ghost of RSC Past*"71 The image of the ghost-as-property / property-as-ghost serves as a reminder that dramatic prop- erties could and did develop their own biographies*72 Richard III has been par- 68 Jones and Stallybrass, 175-206, 69 "Enventary," 335, Antony Sher, Year of the King (London: Nick Hern, 2004), 158, 71 Sher, 158-59, 72 On "ghosting" in the theatre - Marvin Carlsons term for the way aspects of performance including sets, actor s bodies, and props can refer to or draw links with past performances - see The Haunted Stage : The Theater as Memory Machine (Ann Arbor: U of Michigan P, 2001),</page><page sequence="25">TROPHIES, TRACES, RELICS, AND PROPS 321 ticularly haunted by past performances, past actors, and past stage properties* Not only Garricks performance but also his pantaloons and ermine robe were faithfully copied by subsequent Richards for a century or more* Richards cloth- ing - unspecified in Shakespeare's text - became one of his most immediately recognizable features* The sword worn by Edmund Kean in his celebrated 1813 performance in the role was handed down from one actor to another through- out the nineteenth century, becoming a sort of emblem of preeminence* Henry Irving used it; at length it came to John Gielgud, who presented it to Laurence Olivier in recognition of his definitive performance of the part* With Olivier, the swords remarkable life cycle seems to have come to an end, or at least a temporary halt*73 Fetishized theatrical objects like Keans sword differ from normal theatri- cal properties in that their display on stage refers us not only to the past event involving their real counterpart (such as the sword worn by Richard at Bos- worth), but at least for those in the know, to the series of past occasions upon which this object has graced the stage*74 If we accept Elizabeth Williamsons provocative designation of such props as theatrical "relics," this would be the second time in history that Richards notorious blade attained the status of a relic*75 Arguably, the full cultural history of this object would have to be traced through a series of distinct but homologous material forms - Keans sword, the blade wielded by Burbage, the Caversham dagger, the weapon of the real King Richard* If stage properties associated with Richard III have proven particularly prone to fetishization and relicization, the sources of this phenomenon surely lie in the play itself, which so persistently calls attention to the double nature of its props* Of all the plays properties, those named by Richard in his first soliloquy, "bruised arms," provide the most complex and provocative example of how Rich- ard III interrogates its own objects* Arms and armor feature prominently in the play, above all of course in the final act devoted to the fight at Bosworth* Frances Teague has noted how references to Richard s armor convey the passage of time in the scenes depicting the night before the battle (a period of some twelve hours traversed in just over 350 lines)*76 Richard initially enters "in arms" (5*3*0 sd), but fifty lines later, after an exit and reentrance, he is asking Catesby if his armor is all laid up in his tent (5*5*5); he tells Ratcliffe to come to his tent and help him don his armor "about the mid of night" (1* 30) and later in the same scene, 73 Barbara Hodgdon, "Shopping in the Archives: Material Memories," in Shakespeare , Memory and Performance, ed, Peter Holland (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2006), 135-167, esp. 165* 74 On the fetishized prop, see Sofer, 26-27, 75 Williamson, 204-10. 76 Teague, 20-21.</page><page sequence="26">322 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY after the kings awful encounter with the ghosts, Ratcliffe duly enters to say that the cock has crowed, "your friends are up and buckle on their armor" (L 165)* A timely object indeed, armor in Act 5 functions almost as a clock to mark the passage of the hours* The armor that Richard is seen wearing earlier in the play has a more com- plex relationship to the passage of time* In Act 3, scene 5, in which Richard has just accomplished the death of Hastings and must now convince the Mayor and citizens of London that the earl posed an immediate danger to the state, the initial stage direction reads "Enter Richard and Buckingham in rotten armour, marvellous ill-favored" This remarkable phrase - second only to "Exit pursued by a bear" among the handful of genuinely memorable Shakespearean stage directions - is a transmutation of a line in Thomas Mores History , where it is explained that Richard and Buckingham dressed themselves in "old il faring briginders, such as no man shold wene that thei would vouchsafe to haue put upon their backes, except that some sodaine necessitie had constrained them *"77 This is a rare instance of a stage direction that is indisputably authorial, drawn directly from the playwrights chronicle sources*78 The type of armor specified by More, a brigander or brigandine, is in essence a leather or canvas vest with metal rings or studs sewn or riveted into it (Figure 4)* Comparatively lightweight and inexpensive, the brigander was widely worn by foot soldiers in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries (although there are also examples of more ornate court armor in this style)* By the late Elizabethan period, the brigander was largely outmoded; as the old soldier Humfrey Bar- wick noted in a treatise on firearms contemporary with Shakespeare's play, "as for the armours, the best is the Brigandine * * * [yet] for shot all men doth know that the like armours will not defend the force therof* * * ♦ Why then should such meane armors be allowed, with men of understanding and knowledge? It were most fit that our enemies were so armed*"79 Yet the brigander remained a useful theatrical property, because it could be donned and removed comparatively eas- ily* Though the stage direction in Richard III does not specify that the men are 77 More, 52, 78 The line is in fact a conflation of the slightly divergent passages in Holinshed ("old ill faring briganders") in The Chronicles of England, Scotland , and Ireland (London, 1586), voL 6, 724, and Hall ("olde euill fauoured briganders") in Union of the Noble and Illustre Famelies, Edward V, foL 15v.

What seems safest to say is that any kind of armor can be rusty, but only certain kinds, such as the brigander, can also be rotten.</page><page sequence="28">324 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY ing that the armor is not only antiquated but badly knocked about - the stage direction puts much stronger emphasis on the fact that the armor is old, with its poor condition resulting from sheer antiquity rather than mistreatment» The impression of having been roughed up is transferred from the armor itself to the men who wear it, who are, if not ill faring, "marvelous ill-favored ♦" The stage directions emphasis on the age and rottenness of the armor is likely to be an accurate reflection of the sort of properties employed in early performances of this scene» There is little reason to doubt that the Elizabethan actors were wear- ing precisely "rotten armor," that is, old briganders visibly falling to pieces» Unlike the gilt crowns and wooden shields which feature prominently in the property list of the Admirals Men, rotten armor would have been difficult to mock up out of available materials - sewing rusty rings onto disintegrating leather cannot be an easy job» Stage armor in good condition would of course have been too valuable to wreck for the purpose» The two rotten briganders would, I propose, constitute examples of theatri- cal props that were also the genuine article - genuine armor that was genuinely old and rotten» The suits might easily have been half a century old, made for service in the French or Scottish campaigns of the 1540s; they could conceiv- ably have been a good deal older still» Imagination alone is capable of providing a link between the armor in the play and the two pairs of brigandines listed in an inventory of the possessions of William Catesby, Richard Ills Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1484» What is beyond doubt is that if Catesby s fine court armor-- one pair covered in "ble we &amp; talbuy saten," the other "covered with clothe of gold"- had survived the intervening century to present itself for use in Shakespeare's play, it would have been most appropriately "rotten»" 81 An alternative imagined history for Richards rotten armor would make it the very coat worn by Shakespeares own great-grandfather when he fought on Henrys side at Bosworth»82 However improbable such specific scenarios may seem, it is altogether possible that the old briganders employed in early productions were something not dissimilar - that is, that they were someone's family heirlooms» Armor was often passed down from generation to generation 81 "William Catesby s Inventory," 10 December 1484 (PRO E/154/2/4), in Tudor-Craig, ed. Richard III, 97-98. The list of Catesby s belongings contains many of the same kinds of objects listed in the inventory of properties belonging to the Admirals Men, and many of the kinds of items with which this essay has been concerned:"a fethirbed of downe with a Bolster," "a hanging for a chaumber,""a sawter [psalter] ""many smal knyves" 82 M. C Bradbrook speculated that the deeds of Shakespeare's great-great grandfather (named in the family's grant of arms as having done "valiant service" under Henry VII) had remained a matter of family pride and tradition; see Shakespeare , The Poet in His World (Lon- don, 1978), 58.</page><page sequence="29">TROPHIES, TRACES, RELICS, AND PROPS 325 as a memorial of past achievement, even when wear and changing fashion had rendered it long past service, a practice exemplified in Anne Cliffords bequest to her grandchildren of "the remainder of the two rich armors which were my noble fathers, to remaine to them and their posterity (if they soe please) as a remembrance of him *"83 The place for such antiquated equipment was on a gentleman's wall rather than a soldiers back* Reviewing the readiness of the Elizabethan militia, the Earl of Essex complained of its being supplied with "furniture only fitt to hang over the skreene in a halle the whole age of a man ere yt be taken downe*"84 Familiar with such displays, early audiences would have understood that Richard and Buckingham were now wearing the very objects invoked in the plays opening soliloquy, bruised arms taken down from walls where they had been hung up for monuments*85 To be sure, the two moidering briganders would not have been the only gar- ments on the Elizabethan stage whose histories stretched back a good many decades, having already "lived" rather longer than the actors who wore them* In Henry Peachams sketch of a scene from Titus Andronicus, the soldier adjacent to Titus wears what appears to be "a real Gothic cuirass of about 1480, that had found its way eventually to a theatrical wardrobe"86 In early performances of Richard III, the vestments that graced the body of the Bishop of Ely may well have been made for a Catholic churchman of the 1530s or earlier*87 Playing com- panies invested in old clothes both for their economic and their symbolic value* Old clothes in good condition lent more than visual glamour to a performance; 83 Quoted in Jones and Stallybrass, 203, 84 Quoted in L* W* Henry, "The Earl of Essex as Strategist and Military Organizer," English Historical Review 68 (1953): 370. The age and condition of the arms and armor in parish stores were matters of perennial concern for the Privy Council See Lindsay Boynton, The Elizabethan Militia (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1967), 22-25, 61-62, 74-75, 195* 85 Martin Holmes speculated that the Chamberlains Men possessed a particular old suit of armor that inspired Shakespeare's imagination, resulting in both the rotten armor of Richard III and the "rusty armor" that would feature in Pericles * The distance between the plays and, more crucially, the difference in the type of armor implied make this unlikely, but Holmes's general point that there was "old armour available in or about the property room" is surely right* Martin Holmes, Shakespeare and his Players (London: John Murray, 1972), 154* 86 Holmes, 152* 87 See Jones and Stallybrass, 192; and Stephen Greenblatt, Learning to Curse : Essays in Early Modern Culture (New York: Routledge, 1990), 161-62* We may never know if the actor playing Thomas Wolsey in Shakespeare's Henry VIII wore the cardinals own hat, but there is a good likelihood that his costume included genuine Catholic vestments made before the Reforma- tion, contributing to a sense of direct contact with Wolsey and his world* The implied parallel between the actors and the original wearers of the clothing could cut both ways; when Elizabe- than players donned old Catholic vestments, they both appropriated some of the mystery and authority of the old rites for dramatic purposes, and implied that Catholic rites and liturgy had always been a kind of performance, or indeed a deception*</page><page sequence="30">326 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY in historical drama, the presence of such garments contributed to the blurring of the boundary between the present and the past, and hence between the play- ers and the persons they presented* Such effects would naturally depend on the clothes being kept in the best possible state of repair, looking as they might have done when worn for the first time* The unusual thing about the rotten armor as a stage property is thus not that it is old but that, like the props witnessed by Sher in the RSC warehouse, it shows its age* Beyond repair, it bears ironic wit- ness to the irreversible passage of time and to the irrecoverability of origins, in a manner that would seem to undermine the basic project of historical drama* Rather than allowing the audience to believe that they are seeing the past as it really was, the armor reminds us of the way the past generally survives in the present - as remnant, as residue, as rubbish* The use of the armor as a prop creates a tension between two kinds of authenticity* In historical terms the armor is authentic - more than any other property on the stage, it might conceivably have its origins in or soon after the era of Richard III* Yet, by reminding the Elizabethan audience of the distance between the present time and 1483, the armor threatens to undermine the authenticity of the historical performance* In the context of Act 3, scene 5, the armor becomes an emblem of theatricality and deceit, somehow impelling the two men who wear it - men whom the audience has been instructed to recog- nize as "Richard" and "Buckingham" - to acknowledge that they are only players after all: Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian, Tremble and start at wagging of a straw, Speak, and look back, and pry on every side, Intending deep suspicion* (11*5-8) The rotten briganders of Act 3 are thus the chiastic double and opposite of the armor that features so prominently in Act 5* The Bosworth armor would have been shiny and new in appearance, very probably gilt copper or wood, and there- fore within the terms of the play-world it is real; the rotten armor by contrast, is genuinely from the past, and therefore within the terms of the play- world it is false* To employ the terms which Brian Walsh has applied to the play, this is a moment in which the "repertoire" directly confronts the "archive*"88 The encoun- 88 Brian Walsh, Shakespeare, the Queen's Men, and the Elizabethan Performance of History (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2009), 144-45, 164-65» The categories of the archive, consist- ing of the textual and material evidence of the past, and the repertoire, consisting of embodied practices usually regarded as ephemeral, are drawn from Diana Taylor, The Archive and the Repertoire : Performing Cultural History in the Americas (Durham, NC: Duke UP, 2003)» For Walsh, Richard III is distinguished by the dynamic interaction of the repertoire with the archive: "the events of the past » . * become inextricably tied to their theatrical embodiments" (145-46)»</page><page sequence="31">TROPHIES, TRACES, RELICS, AND PROPS 327 ter is fraught with risks for both* On the one hand, as I have suggested, the decaying briganders have the potential to expose the falsity of the historical performance* On the other, the staging of the timeworn armor can be read as a deliberate humiliation of the material remains of the past, whose veracity the play contrives to discredit in favor of its performative truth* Yet the manner in which Richard III so persistently interrogates its objects, drawing attention both to their status as props and to their histories beyond the theater doors, suggests a more complex interaction between performance and the material archive* By highlighting its struggle to contain those objects whose untimeliness threatens to disrupt the time of performance, the play discloses a parallel between its own operations and those of its protagonist, who also struggles to keep alternative temporalities at bay* The tensions between the actor playing Richard and the properties he wields and wears are mirrored in the tensions between the charac- ter Richard and the past he seeks at various points to revive, deny, and outrun* The time of objects cuts across the performance as the past embodied in the ghosts cuts across the present on the night before battle* As Hogarth implied, the plays objects - crown, armor, bedstead, and dagger - are the real ghosts* The rotten armor-as-prop has a story of its own to tell, one that is neither Richards story (about resistance to Hastings supposed coup), nor Shakespeares story (about Richard and Buckingham's sinister theatricality)* The full story of what peregrinations led from its first manufacture to its tattered last hurrah on the Elizabethan stage was no doubt as unknown to Shakespeares audience as it is to us* The case of the crumbling briganders suggests how it is in part the very fragility of material things, their susceptibility to being marked by the passage of time, that keeps them from being subsumed entirely into our current systems of significance, and perhaps even grants them a kind of extrahuman agency* This essay has drawn pragmatic distinctions between different kinds of old objects - trophies, relics, palimpsests - bearing the imprint of the past in differ- ent ways* In reality, of course, these categories blend into one another* Objects transform themselves unevenly over time, neither preserving the untarnished essence of the past, nor altering their natures entirely to serve the demands of the present* Shakespeares play is aware of this* Even as it registers the power- ful fantasy of separating objects from their histories - a fantasy common to the tyrant who crows "all the world to nothing!" (1*2*225), and to a certain strain of object biography - Richard III acknowledges the impossibility of ever fully controlling its properties, or containing the pasts they carry with them into the theater*</page></plain_text>
