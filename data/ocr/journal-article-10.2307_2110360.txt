<plain_text><page sequence="1">JERONE STEPHENS Bowling Green State University Somze Questions about a More Biologzical 1y Oriented Political Science The focus of this work is on the influence of the biological sciences in the study of political and social behavior. The first section is devoted to an examina- tion of reasoning by analogy from biology to political behavior, and the second section is devoted to a critical analysis of these analogies from the vantage point of biologists, social scientists and philosophers of science. The primary focus of the third section is on the direct application of generalizations from ethology to political and social behavior. IN A RECENT article published in this journal, Professor Albert Somit suggested that political science might benefit by focusing attention on the findings of biologists, especially in the areas of psychopharmacology and ethology.1 In this work, I want to examine some of the recent past attempts of biologists and social scientists to use the ideas developed in biology to establish a more biologically oriented social science. The past attempts of biologists, social scientists and others to relate biology and social science have taken several forms, but the two I want to focus on are the biological orientation brought into social science by the general systems theorists on the one hand, and by ethologists, or the popularizers of ethology, on the other. The questions raised by these orientations are different, but in both there is a distinct effort to provide a biological base for social science in a way that gives rise to serious questions as to the adequacy, or potential adequacy, of such a base. By raising some questions about past efforts to relate biology and social science, I hope to call attention to problems that have confronted other adherents of a more biologically oriented social science in a way that will aid political scientists in avoiding the same problems. Although political scientists have not been as concerned in the past with the attempt to apply biological principles or analogies to the study of politics in the way that both biologists and those in other social science disciplines have, events in recent years indicate that political scientists will become more interested in the application I Albert Somit, "Toward a More Biologically Oriented Political Science: Ethology and Psychopharmacology," Midwest Journal of Political Science, 12 (November, 1968), 550-567. 687</page><page sequence="2">688 JERONE STEPHENS of both biological principles and analogies to political science in the future. In this work, I want to contribute to the discussion of a more biologically oriented political science by raising questions about the problems previous attempts at such an orientation have uncovered, and to specify the reasons why problems have arisen. Since systems analyses of all types have been closely connected with biological analogies, I will also have an occasion to point out the distinctions between one kind of systems analysis that has been developed primarily by biologists, and one that still retains a strong biological orientation, general systems theory, and other types of systems theory which are not as closely tied to biology. Political scientists and laymen alike often use comparisons between body organs and governmental institutions in a metaphorical way, but at least since the time of Thomas Hobbes, there has also been a tendency to use such comparisons in a way that is more technical. In his work on the organismic theories of the state, Francis Coker reminds us that Hobbes used analogies between body organs and the specialized functions of various governmental agencies. Hobbes writes, Coker tells us, that: the public ministers for general administration resemble "the nerves and tendons that move the several limbs of a body natural " (p. 227); the ministers for judicature "may fitly be compared to the organs of will in the body natural" (p. 230). Money is the blood of the commonwealth, "the conduits . . . by which it is conveyed to the public use " through the offices of collection and expenditure, being analogous, respectively, to the nerves and arteries of the natural man (pp. 238-9).2 It is not our intention here to assess to what extent Hobbes and others were using the comparisons between the body organs and political institutions as metaphors, analogies or homologies, but merely to point out that the practice noted in Hobbes reappeared in the 1930's and became the basis for the development of a more biologically oriented social science. In 1936 the biologist E. V. Cowdry published an article entitled "Body Anatomic and Body Politic " where he suggested that political and social scientists draw on biology for the following kinds of analogies. 2 Francis Coker, Organismic Theories of the State (New York, 1910), p. 15.</page><page sequence="3">A MORE BIOLOGICALLY ORIENTED POLITICAL SCIENCE 689 The muscle cells may be likened to ... manual laborers.... gland cells may be looked upon as manufacturers. . . . The nerve cells are the oldest and the wisest. They constitute the ruling class and have special means of gathering information.8 Analogies like Cowdry's were widespread in the 1930's4 and became even more prominent in the 1940's. In a series of articles published between January and June 1940,5 the physiologist R. E. Gerard put forth a set of terms and several ideas that are still prevalent today. Central to Gerard's approach to the development of a biologically oriented social science is the idea of hierarchical homologies among organisms. An organism, Gerard writes, is a semi-independent unit system composed of lesser units in interrelation with one another.... It applies to solar systems, snow crystals, atomic nuclei, and football teams no less than to micrococci, maple trees and men.' The larger organisms within which other organisms are found are epiorganisms. The emphasis in Gerard's work is on showing that organisms, from body cells to governments, share some of the same problems and act in similar ways. There is also an insistence that the similarities are more than mere metaphors or analogies; they are, in a word, homologies. Since organisms are homologous in many ways, it follows, Gerard thinks, that they often act alike and that generaliza- tions describingr behavior at one level can be applied to organisms at another level. The result of such reasoning has been that Gerard and others now attempt to discover generalizations or curves that " fit " several different levels of organisms. We will look at some of these generalizations shortly. Previously I mentioned that Gerard asserts that he, unlike past advo- cates of comparisons between body organs and social agencies or insti- tutions, is offering true analogies or homologies and not just metaphors or similes. It is necessary that Gerard take this position because he, like Cowdry, makes extensive use of comparisons between organ sys- tems of the body and social institutions. In one of his 1940 articles, for example, Gerard says the following: 'E. V. Cowdry, "Body Anatomic and Body Politic," Scientific Quarterly, 42 (1936), 225. 'See, for example, S. J. Holmes, "Darwinian Ethics . .. .," Science, 90 (1939), 122. 'Ralph W. Gerard, " Organism, Society and Science," No. I, II and III, Scientific Monthly, 50 (1940), 340-350, 403-412 and 530-535.

What seems to distinguish, for Gerard, these kinds of comparisons from those of Cowdry and even Hobbes, is that Gerard attempts to formulate generalizations that can apply to all levels of organization, and these generalizations have to do basically with how integration of the organism or epiorganism is brought about. In his 1942 work on levels of integration, Gerard compared the coming together of single myxamoeba (slime molds) into a worm-shaped mass, during an emergency, with the coming together of individual men into a greater whole, the army, also during an emergency; in both cases there was overt integration of the whole from single parts.8 Whether or not the difference that Gerard singles out as separating his homologies and analogies from earlier attempts at seemingly similar analogies is a meaningful distinction will have to be examined, and one way of doing this is to see what other biologists have had to say about efforts like Cowdry's and Gerard's to establish a more biologically oriented social science. During the period when Gerard was developing his ideas about a more biologically oriented social science, other biologists were voicing considerable doubts about some of the ideas used by Cowdry and Gerard. In an epilogue to his Wisdom of the Body, Walter B. Cannon, a man who has had considerable influence on social science theorizing, writes: The resemblance between the body biologic and the body politic has long attracted the interest of philosophers, biologists and historians. Among socio- logists, economists and men of affairs, however, the analogies have been largely discredited, because, it is said, the comparisons have not contributed to the under- standing of the social structure. The failure to be helpful seems to have been due to pressing to an absurd degree resemblances in the minutiae of that structure. We are not illuminated by a likening of manual laborers to muscle cells, manu- facturers to gland cells . . . and policemen to white blood corpuscles.

But those social scientists who have followed Cannon's advice have taken a different approach than those who have followed in the direction Gerard charted. The difference will be discussed shortly. In the same volume of Scientific Monthly where Gerard published the first of his suggestions for a more biologically oriented social science, the biologist Julian Huxley warned against the use of analogies for pro- viding evidence for social science generalizations, although Huxley does advocate the use of analogies for purposes of scientific discovery. We must be aware of the pitfalls of analogies even here, however, because biologists might expect that society operates with machine-like smoothness of a lower animal or insect, but generalizations that are valid for one level of life may not be for another level. Huxley points out that analogies that rest on different bases-i. e., the fixity of instinct versus the plasticity of man's intelligence-make it impossible for certain instincts to become predominant in man but not in insects. For example, it is physically impossible for the altruistic instinct to become predominant in man because " as Haldane has demonstrated, this [predominance] can only occur when neuter castes of workers or soldiers exist." 10 It is especially important that social scientists be aware of such criticisms and findings because it has always been popu- lar to make analogies between altruism in man and lower levels of life, and it is not often pointed out that it is sometimes impossible for man to manifest the same instincts as lower levels of life. Gerard often asserts that man will become more altruistic over time, and more recently those arguing for a more biologically oriented social science claim that international and other conflict occurs because man has not lived long enough for his instincts against intraspecific aggression to have developed. Besides pointing out that analogies that rest on different bases can be misleading or even false when applied to different levels of life, 9Walter B. Cannon, "The Body Physiologic and the Body Politic," Science, 90 (1939), 5. "'Julian Huxley, "Science, Natural and Social," Scientific Monthly, 50 (1940), 13.</page><page sequence="6">692 JERONE STEPHENS Huxley also deals specifically with Gerard's contention that generali- zations dealing with several levels of organization can be used with great benefit. The major problem in comparing different levels of organization, as between cells and individuals and between the animal body and society, is the "far greater subordination of the parts to the whole . . ." in cells thanl in individuals and of individuals when compared to society." Other critics of a too facile analogy between lower and higher levels of organization have also added their warnings about applying generalizations to several types of organizations indis- criminately. Joseph Needham and George G. Simpson join Huxley in pointing out that the organism-society analogy overlooks fundamental differences between organism and society in the followings ways: (1) the degree of concentration of consciousness in specialized parts, (2) the degree of differentiation arising during reproduction (of individuals in society and of cells in the organisms), (3) the mode of reproduction and inheritance, and (4) the degree of subordination of parts to the whole."2 In 1945, the biologist Alex B. Novikoff took up some of Gerard's specific claims about a more biologically oriented social science, and devoted much of his attention to the question of integrative levels. The central problem that is of concern to Novikoff is that those who would compare biological and sociological levels overlook fundamental differences between these levels. The major difference that he wants to emphasize is that " while man's social relations have undergone marked transformation, his biology has remained essentially unchanged"'13 in the seven or eight thousand years of recorded history. The extrapola- tion Gerard makes between society and the living organism is, Novikoff believes, fundamentally misleading. His reasons for this conclusion are of interest today because Gerard and others who stress the formal nature of integrative levels are still emphasizing the supposed structural similarities between different levels and it will be of interest to note Novikoff's criticism of twenty-five years ago. The problem in Gerard results: Because he fails to distinguish the social from the biological, Gerard is led to formulate a single principle to govern the entire historical process from the origin of molecules to the development of human society, the progressive growth of cooperation and altruism. By oversimplifying phenomena and divesting each :Ibid. 12Quoted from Alex B. Novikoff, "The Concept of Integrative Levels and Biology," Science, 101 (1945), 213, note 22. `3Ibid., 213.</page><page sequence="7">A MORE BIOLOGICALLY ORIENTED POLITICAL SCIENCE 693 level of organization, among organisms and in society, of its specific characteristic qualities, a metaphysical statement is produced to the effect that society will inevitably-because it is an organism-progress toward a cooperative state." The emphasis on levels must not lead, Novikoff warns us, to the belief that from a knowledge of the lower levels of life, we can predict what will happen at a higher level. It is quite clear, however, that those who are in the process of developing a more biologically oriented social science do not often heed this warning. Before demonstrating specifi- cally how there is a failure to heed Novikoff's warning, it is necessary to briefly discuss the work of another biologist who has been extremely influential in promoting a group science that would be dependent on homologies between different levels of organization, Ludwig von Bertalanffy. Professor Bertalanffy says that he began his work in the 1920's but that much of what he had to say had to be deferred until after the Second World War. Whenever von Bertalanffy began, it is quite clear that his work was closely paralleled by Gerard in this country. Bertalanffy, like Gerard, wants to develop homologies that apply to several levels of organization, and to emphasize what he calls struc- tural similarities of the different levels of reality. What this means is that we look for phenomena that can be described by the same set of equations or curves. Hence, Bertalanffy finds significance in growth curves that are exponential for "pounds in a banking account, to radium atoms, molecules, bacteria, or individuals in a population." '5 The attempt to subsume several types of phenomena under the same generalizations is not new to Bertalanffy; Gerard found some signifi- cance in that the growth of organisms and of colonies, bacterial or human, had similar growth curves."' What is new in Bertalanffy is the name general systems theory, and the attempt to use mathematical symbols far more extensively than other advocates of a more biologi- cally based social science. It is Bertalanffy's stated aim to develop a general systems theory that can be applied to several disciplines in the same way mathematics can be used in various disciplines. General systems theory, therefore, is a general science of "wholeness"... In elaborate form it would be a logico-mathematical discipline, in itself purely formal but applicable to the various empirical sciences. For sciences concerned with "organized wholes," it would be of similar significance to that which lIbid., 213-214.

Since levels are not a consideration in the application of the laws of gravity, we cannot compare this type of law to ones where levels are important, even central, to the subject being studied. Novikoff pointed out long ago that levels could not be ignored by Gerard and others who were attempting to develop a more biologically oriented social science because The concept of integrative levels, as it stresses the need to study the inter- relations between the biological and sociological, emphasizes the fact the two constitute two distinct levels. Blurring this distinction leads to anthropomorphism and to mystical, often dangerous, statements about society.19 Neither Gerard, Bertalanffy nor other general systems theorists have heeded Novikoff's warning, but the social and political scientist cannot refuse to take seriously the difference between biological and group levels if he is to avoid serious methodological and empirical problems.20 Other biologists have been equally quick in pointing out that the blurring of different levels of organization can be both misleading and dangerous. The biologist J. Maynard Smith recently pointed out that: although analogies between historical and biological processes can readily be drawn, I am doubtful whether any general analogy between them is likely to be helpful. In both we are confronted by processes of continuous rather than of purely cyclical change.l 17 Bertalanffy, op. cit., p. 57.

In 1950, Carl Hempel and Bertalanffy participated in a symposium on general systems theory and the unity of science, and Hempel questioned several aspects of general systems theory; his comments on two points are of interest to us. We recall that Bertalanffy says that general systems theory would be " purely formal but applicable to the various empirical sciences," and Hempel has asked what a purely formal theory that could be applied to several sciences would be like. The only answer, Hempel says, is that a purely formal systems theory "would consti- tute a branch of pure mathematics " and Hempel continues by saying: As a consequence, unlike the theories in physics, chemistry or biology, it [general systems theory] would not have any predictive force; its principles would not enable us to foretell the characteristics of concrete systems as yet unexplored.24 Since Hempel made this observation, Bertalanffy has done nothing to answer the objections that general systems theory would constitute a branch of pure mathematics; nor has he replied directly to Hempel or to clarify how general systems theory would, if purely formal, unify the various sciences any more than the use of another branch of mathematics, statistics, unifies the sciences where statistics are used. The formal aspect of general systems theory remains a puzzle to many people because of the failure of general systems theorists to make it 22 Ibid., p. 85. 2 Tom Bums, " Social Norms and Social Evolution," in Banton, op. cit., p. 154; and Michael Banton, "The Autonomy of Post-Darwinian Sociology," in Banton, pp. 167-179. 24Carl Hempel, "General Systems Theory: A New Approach to Unity of Science," Human Biology, 23 (1951), 314.</page><page sequence="10">696 JERONE STEPHENS clear what exactly is meant by the assertion that the theory is purely formal. Less puzzling, but no less questioned, is the continued insistence by general systems theorists that true homologies are different from mere analogies. Hempel takes up Bertalanffy's distinction between mere analogies and true homologies, also referred to as structural similarities and structural isomorphisms, and concludes that the differ- ence between the two are a matter of degree.25 Another philosopher of science, Roger Buck, has dealt extensively with the distinction the general systems theorist makes between an- alogies and homologies. Buck rejects the distinction betxveen analogies and homologies that the general systems theorist makes, and suggests that analogies be called analogies. Buck also suggests that disanalogies between phenomena be mentioned, and then asks what is to be learned from the analogy that Gerard makes between the behavior of slime molds and Londoners under attack during World War 11.26 If there are no conclusions that can be used to understand the behavior of both slime molds and humans, Buck asks, then why bother with structural simi- larities? And as Buck also points out, the conclusions that are to be drawn are missing from most general systems theorists' works and all we are left with is the contention that there is a structural similarity of some kind.27 Hence, it is said on the one hand that the spread of disease and the spread of rumors are structurally similar, and on the other, that " the curve [of survivorship] for man happens to resemble that for Drosphila flies, man's age in years being roughly equated to a fly's age in days," 28 but we are not told the importance of these structural similarities, and we are left with the belief that the similari- ties are significant. Unless we can find an underlying theory that permits us to explain why man, in years, and flies, in days, have the same survivorship curve, we have gained nothing except find what may be an interesting coincidence but nothing else. The general systems theorist and biologist, Anatol Rapoport, who sometimes writes about research in political and social science, remarks that in a critique of Lewvis Richardson's theory of war, he, Rapoport, pointed out that Richardson's contention that " the size of bandit raids 25 Ibid., p. 316. 28 Roger C.

The methodological and empirical problems that are encount- ered in trying to move from one level to another simply cannot be smoothed over in the way that the general systems theorists say they can. In an illuminating discussion of isomorphisms in science, Professor May Brodbeck points out that if two areas are isomorphic, the following conditions will hold: the terms in the better known area, in our case biology, are put in a one-to-one relationship with those of the new area, social or political science, and the correspondence of the terms is used to translate the laws of one area into those of the new area.3' The result is that we have a set of hypotheses about the new area, and if the hypotheses are true, the two theories are isomorphic to each other. Brodbeck's comments on the use of the kinds of organic and social isomorphisms that Rapoport mentions, and our ability to estab- lish one-to-one correspondence between the terms used in biology and social science are worth mentioning. After pointing out that guesses about isomorphisms have often taken the form of comparing a society to the growth of a plant or that biological evolution is likened to social evolution, Brodbeck comments that the following conditions must obtain. First, it must be possible to state clearly what is in one-to-one correspondence with what. Organisms grow; they increase in size and weight. What is social " growth "? What is the autumnal phase of society corresponding to the autumn of a plant? . . . Second, once clearly defined empirical concepts in one area are made to correspond to the terms of the model, then formal similarities, if any, are 29 Anatol Rapoport, "Some Systems Approaches to Political Theory," in David Easton, ed., Varieties of Political Theory (Englewood Cliffs, 1966), p. 136. 30Ibid., p. 139. 31 Brodbeck, op. cit., p. 584.</page><page sequence="12">698 JERONE STEPHENS sought. Nutrition is connected with growth in biology. Are the social concepts corresponding to nutrition and to growth similarly connected? In other words, not only must the terms of the two areas correspond, but the connections among these concepts must be preserved, if the model is to be of use.82 It is quite clear from the examples we have used from general systems theory that these theorists do not even attempt to meet either condi- tion. But until there is an attempt at establishing a one-to-one corre- spondence between biological and social science concepts, and an attempt to show that the resulting hypotheses are true, the use of biological principles in the social sciences will remain metaphorical and confusing. It has been demonstrated over and over again that vague references drawn from biology and applied to society must be made more precise than either biologists or social scientists have been able to make them in the past. What a new, more biologically oriented political science will do is to repeat the errors and problems of past attempts to link biology and politics unless previous practices are altered. One clarification that can be made here is of the terms analogy and homology or isomorphisms; if there is an attempt to place behavioral science concepts into a one-to-one correspondence with those from another science, and to then provide empirical evidence for the resulting hypotheses, we have a clear attempt to establish isomorphisms. If, on the other hand, neither of these conditions are precisely met, we have an analogy. Using this terminology, we see that the general systems theorist, despite his claims of moving beyond mere analogies to true homologies, has not done so. The analogies produced thus far by the general systems theorists are of little or no improvement over biological analogies that have been around in political science since Hobbes. We now come to the question of the direct and indirect influence general systems theory has had on political science. Professor David Easton mentions that he once was a member of a group that included many of the most important general systems theorists while many of these theorists were at the University of Chicago, and that he had formal contact for a year with the ones who moved on to the Mental Health Institute at the University of Michigan.33 Another political scientist, J. David Singer,34 is now a member of the Institute, and " Ibid., p. 585. Emphasis in the original. 3"David Easton, A Framework for Political Analysis (Englewood Cliffs, 1965), pp. xii-xxiii. " J.

One of the Institute members, the biologist Anatol Rapoport, has contributed to political science journals and books, and has addressed audiences com- posed almost entirely of political scientists;35 hence, we have some evidence of indirect influence on political scientists. The direct impact, of course, is harder to ascertain. Deutsch and Rieselbach say that: In time (general systems theorists) interests came to overlap and converge with the original non-mathematical concepts of a social system developed by Talcott Parsons and his collaborators; with the interests of David Easton in the study of a political system. ..88 Oran Young lists fifteen political scientists or political sociologists that make extensive use of general systems ideas and concepts, but he also points out that political scientists have not given serious attention to general systems theory until recently,37 and the number of political scientists who do so may well increase in the near future. Young does raise one point that needs to be met head on; he says that general systems theory has not been used extensively in social science, and hence it is difficult to judge its utility for the social sciences at this time. It is beyond question that general systems theory has not been employed extensively by social, and more especially, political scientists, but the basic ideas and terminology have been in existence since at least 1940, as I have shown, and the advances in these thirty years do not seem to have been great. The same type of analogies that Gerard started with thirty years ago are still being made, and in essentially the same form, and political scientists should take this into account when considering the possible utility general systems theory might have in the future. And although I do not want to labor the point, the same criticisms made against Gerard, and other biologists who were 5 See Rapoport, op. cit. 38 Karl W. Deutsch and Leroy N.

Before moving on to other matters, two points must be emphasized. First, the most influential spokesmen for general systems theory are still Bertalanffy, Gerard, and Rapoport, all three of whom are biologists of one type or another; hence, the biological basis of general systems theory is still evident, and as long as the dominance of the biologists continues, it would seem that the organismic-society analogy will be retained, and contrary to Young's contention,8 I believe that it must be retained if general systems theory is not to turn into some other kind of systems theory now employed in political science. This brings us to the second point. The distinct feature of general systems theory, as opposed to Easton's or Parson's systems theory, is that there is an analogy between living systems and social systems in general systems theory that is not present, at least not anything like to the same extent, in other systems theory political scientists are familiar with. The difference seems to be one like Cannon suggested when he was critical of the elaborate structural similarities between organic and social systems made by biologists like Gerard and Cowdry. Cannon, we recall, suggested that social scientists might search for social homeostasis and for the structures that maintain, if they do, the homeo- stasis in social systems, and not to concentrate on the minutiae of the organic-society resemblances. To a large extent, Cannon's advice seems to have been taken by the systems theorists who look for functional requisites of society, and the structures that support these requisites, and ignored by the general systems theorist. The result has been that there is a logical distinction between the social homeostasis systems theories and the general systems theories, and while the former might have been initially rooted as closely to biology as the latter, this cer- tainly is no longer the case. Whether social homeostasis is or is not present in a social system is entirely dependent on social and political behavior, and not on whether or not several levels of organization have the same structures or properties, which, for the general systems theorists, is prima facie evidence of simznificance.89 38 Young, "The Impact . . . ," op. cit., 253. 3 A point made in a paper read at the 1969 APSA convention "The Biological Bases of Behavior and Their Implications for Political Theory," by Peter Corning can be used to illustrate the fact that analogies between biology and systems theories of the Easton type do not contribute anything to such an analysis.

A type of biologism is one like Gerard's contention that it is not a question of if, but only of when, an effective international unit will supplement, and eventually largely supplant, our present national ones. Isola- tionism is a biological anachronism."1 Isolationism may very well be a biological anachronisin, but this means absolutely nothing when applied directly to social or -? -.l:tical organi- zations; political isolationism is certainly still possible, ind in no way can we apply the laws of biology to explain or predict future stages of political organization. The direct application of Darwinian laws of evolution to social systems was exactly the same kind of biologism that is manifest in Gerard's statement. And while most general systems theorists warn against biologisms, there is another group of biologists, popularizers of science and social scientists who are employing the ideas and hypotheses of ethology, the study of evolutionary change in animal behavior, who often seems to lapse into biologisms. A look at the application of the findings from ethology to social and political behavior will help round out our discussion of a more biologically oriented political science and the questions raised by such an orien- tation. of a Darwinian model of society because the political system is the adaptive mechanism for the social system as a whole. But it is quite clear from reading Easton that no such analogy is required nor will it contribute anything to Easton's, or any other, systems analysis. If laws are passed, or behavior modified, in a political system that contributes to one of Easton's essential functions, or to one of Parsons' social requisites, then the law or behavior can be viewed as main- taining dynamic equilibrium within the social system, and to add that this would be analogous with biological Darwinism is merely superfluous. While nothing can be gained from such an analogy, more confusion will be introduced into systems analysis than is already present, and systems analysis of the Eastonian type already has more than its share of problems without adding more. For a discussion of these problems, see my " The Logic of Functional and Systems Analyses in Political Science," Midwest Journal of Political Science, 13 (August, 1969), 367-394. 40 A biologism is the direct application of a biological law to social behavior; for an enlightening discussion of biologisms, see Ralph S.

Recently, the anthropologist Lionel Tiger has broadened the scope of the social scientist's concern by including the possibility that there may be a genetic explanation of the tendency for males to form all male groups. Tiger indicates, also, that there is no reason why students of politics should not study the politics of other animals.42 It is not clear, however, whether or not Tiger is suggesting we do this for heuristic or explanatory reasons. Although it is not clear in Tiger's work as to whether he would use biological principles for heuristic or explanatory purposes, it is quite clear that others believe that generalizations about aggression and the territorial imperative can be transferred intact from animal to human behavior. Among the most outspoken in his belief of this transfer is Robert Ardrey. In The Territorial Imperative, a book social scientists have given a great deal of attention to, he writes: Man . . . is as much a territorial animal as is a mockingbird singing in the clear California night. We act as we do for reasons of our evolutionary past, not our cultural present, and our behavior is as much a mark of our species as is the shape of a human thigh bone. . . . If we defend the title of our land or the sovereignty of our country, we do so for reasons no different, no less innate, no less ineradicable than do lower animals.43 Ardrey has, of course, no direct evidence for this rather strong state- ment but rather attempts to show that the Allies' part in the Second World War and the failure of scientific socialism are manifestations of the territorial imperative. In discussing, in general, the Allies' con- duct of the war, he writes: Our side's failure to comprehend the force which in the end would save us had no effect on the course of the war. We acted by instinctual command. Whether we were enlightened or ignorant, self-aware or self-deluded, whether we acted in the light or whether we acted in the dark, we should have in any case acted the same." We would have acted the same, Ardrey asserts, because we protect our territory like other animals, and when our territory is threatened 42 Lionel Tiger, Men in Groups (New York, 1969), p. 15. " Robert Ardrey, The Territorial Imperative (New York, 1966), p. 5. "Ibid., p. 241.</page><page sequence="17">A MoRE BIOLOGICALLY ORIENTED POLITICAL SCIENCE 703 we fight. In applying the territorial imperative to war and specific countries Ardrey asks, "Why did Finland fight? No explanation less than ten million years old can provide a significant answer." 45 What is true for Finland, Ardrey says, is also true of England. But Ardrey leaves unanswered this question: why did other nations not fight? Why is the territorial imperative invoked for Finland and England but not for, say, Holland. Surely if territoriality is genetically trans- mitted in man, it is transmitted to all, or most, in the same way. And Ardrey leaves unanswered the question as to why the territorial im- perative would lead individuals to fight to protect their territory when that territory is not private property, which he takes to be the property man protects. It could be said, of course, that what was being protected was the nation and thereby an indirect protection of private property, but since the nation is an " artificial " entity, there is likely to be a great deal of confusion associated with the attempt to connect the genetic transmission of the territorial imperative and going to war to protect one's nation or sovereignty. It is clear that Ardrey has not given problems like this one much thought, however, because in explaining why Soviet collective farming has failed, he blames it on the attempt to suppress the territorial im- perative and in doing so, suppress the incentive to produce because private property is not allowed. But if taking away private property decreases the incentive to produce would not it also seem that it would take away the incentive to fight? But yet Ardrey explains a willingness to fight as a manifestation of the territorial imperative, and decreased productivity as a manifestation of the same territorial imperative even within a country that did fight and where collective farms were dominant. In discussing the failure of collective farming in the Soviet Union, Ardrey writes that: After almost half-a-century the experiment with scientific socialism finds . . itself at the mercy of an evolutionary fact of life: that man is a territorial animal."" Desmond Morris draws much the same conclusion about man's territorial instincts in his discussion of a driver who is stopped by a policeman for a minor traffic infraction. i1bid., p. 239. 48 Ibid., p. 154. It is not overly clear that territoriality is manifest in all species. W. C. Aliee writes, for example, that " It will be well, as yet, to reserve final judgement concerning the extent to which territory recognition is a factor in the social dominance system of flocking birds." "Social Dominance and Subordina- tion among Vertebrates," in Redfield, op. cit., p. 145.</page><page sequence="18">704 JERONE STEPHENS Most drivers . . . immediately respond by arguing their innocence, or making excuses of some sort for their behaviour. In doing this they are defending their (mobile) territory and are setting themselves up as territorial rivals. This is the worst course of action. It forces the police to counter-attack. If instead, an attitude of abject submission is adopted, it will become increasingly difficult for the police officer to avoid a sensation of appeasement.'7 It may well be the case that a look at police-citizen conflict could be illuminated by suggesting that there may be similarities in the way animals act when defending their territory, and the way citizens and policemen act when defending their territory, but it is unlikely that we will get far in attempting to explain the behavior of drivers by merely applying the laws (?) of animal behavior to humans. For example, it has often been pointed out that homeostasis of population systems is characteristic of animal groups, but certainly this is not true for man. If population of humans is going to be checked, the decision and means must be made by man, and no biological law will be paramount in explaining why he does or does not choose to regulate population, although it is both possible and permissible that biological laws be used in the explanation. A psychologist writing about territoriality and human aggression, Anthony Storrs, notes that: It is not yet possible to describe man's aggression in the same kind of terms which ethologists use for animal behavior; for the simplicity of basic instinctive patterns is overlaid by a complex of learned wishes . . . and other products of critical cerebration which obscure the most primitive truths about ourselves.'8 Although most ethologists and biologists attempting to apply biologi- cal principles to social behavior are as aware of possible cultural factors, there is a tendency to find evidence of the territorial imperative in rather mundane practices. This is especially true in the case of sports. The microbiologist Rene Dubos, for example, writes that "The suc- cesses of animals on their own territorial grounds bring to mind the better performance of baseball teams on their home fields." 49 Almost every ethologist and biologist mention this better performance on one's home field as being evidence of the territorial imperative without examining the statement too closely. It is a fact, for example, that many good teams do lose more baseball or football games on their home fields than they lose elsewhere. It is far more likely, then, that "Desmond Morris, The Naked Ape (New York, 1967), p. 141. " Anthony Storrs, Human Aggression (New York, 1967), p. 26. "9Rene Dubos, Man Adapting (New Haven, 1965), p. 106.</page><page sequence="19">A MoRE BIOLOGICALLY ORIENTED POLITICAL SCIENCE 705 in explaining the performance of sports teams, we will be better advised to look at individual, social and physical characteristics of the players and their environment. We have enough knowledge of behavior already to know that individuals usually perform better when per- forming before friendly groups than they do when performing before hostile ones; and we know, also, that this is a learned characteristic. We also know that familiarity with one's surroundings can increase performance considerably. Also, we are aware that, in baseball at least, there are subtle tricks that can be used by the home team grounds- keeper that will give an advantage to the home team over the visiting team. It would seem, then, that a factor such as the territorial impera- tive would either be spurious or false in explaining a team's perform- ance. Perhaps the best comment on territoriality and team performance we can cite here to make our point is a recent statement by a football coach. Washington State University football coach Jim Sweeney has been talking to psychologist William R. Berkowitz and now he thinks he knows why his team could move between the 20 yard lines but couldn't score last year. "The guy says there's a theory that defense of territory is instinctive and the defense gets tougher as the invasion threat increases," Sweeney explained. Meanwhile, the offensive team "experiences a form of guilt over its intrusion," leading to fumbles, interceptions, and penalties. Only one thing bothers the coach. "How come those other guys didn't have any guilt complex about coming across our goal line." "0 The question raised by Coach Sweeney is one that ethologists and social scientists who are going to explain social behavior by referring to the territorial imperative are going to have to answer. Until scien- tists of all stripes begin to do more than refer to what seems to be common-sensical evidence in support of a territorial imperative in man, we must remain exceedingly sceptical about the presence of such an imperative. And we cannot allow ourselves to be caught in a position where we accept such flimsy evidence, even if it were true, as supporting the belief that there is a fundamental relationship between biology and political or social behavior. The scepticism expressed thus far about the usefulness of concepts like the territorial imperative and aggression in explaining social behavior must be extended to one other area of concern to biologists, social scientists and others who are interested in the application of biology to politics: international and domestic violence. It is a common occur- 60 Cited in the Cincinnati Post and Times Star, August 23, 1969, p. 10.</page><page sequence="20">706 JERONE STEPHENS rence to find that journalists and biologists alike attempt to explain warlike behavior as a manifestation of an aggressive instinct. It is also frequently asserted that evolution in man has not progressed to the point where this instinct for intraspecific fighting has been lost through natural selection, as it has been in animals. The view that aggressive behavior is instinctual is, of course, often disputed. Professor Ashley Montagu, in his work " War and the Myth of Nature," writes that "there is no instinct towards peace in man just as there is none towards war." 61 This view is also taken by Hugh Graham and Ted Gurr in a recent work on violence. They write that most psychologists and social scientists do not regard aggression as fundamentally spontaneous or instinctive, nor does the weight of their evidence support such a view. Rather they regard most aggression, including violence, as sometimes an emotional response to socially induced frustrations, and sometimes a dispassionate, learned response evoked by specific situations. This assumption underlies almost all the studies in this volume: nature provides us with the capacity for violence; it is social circumstances that determines whether and how we exercise that capacity."2 This passage should be of particular importance to political scientists because it is from the recent study of Violence in America and indi- cates that the weight of evidence as well as opinion is that social, not biological, factors are central to an adequate explanation of violent behavior. Given the length and scope of the study on violence, it is striking that so few of the contributors even mentioned the possibility of a genetically based explanation. One author does attempt to show that crowding large numbers of men into a limited space leads to aggression, but his conclusion seems to be based on environmental, not biological factors. In concluding his essay, he says that " In summary, it seems that overpopulation only aggravates the widespread threat to social stability presented by masses of our civilization who are basically unsure of their personal future, who have lost confidence in their chance of ever attaining a secure place in their community." 53 The evidence thus far indicates that there are numerous unresolved problems that have occurred in past attempts to construct a more "Ashley Montagu, "War and the Myth of Nature," Scientific Monthly, 54 (1942), p. 32. 2 Hugh Graham and Ted Gurr, " Conclusion," in the work they edited, The History of Violence in America (New York, 1969), p. 802.

Carstairs, "Overcrowding and Human Aggression," in Graham and Gurr, op. cit., p. 763.</page><page sequence="21">A MoRE BIOLOGICALLY ORIENTED POLITICAL SCIENCE 707 biologically oriented social science and that political scientists are likely to encounter the same problems in attempting to relate biology to the study of politics. This is not to say that we should exclude completely the possibility that a more biologically oriented political science would aid in our understanding of political behavior, but we must avoid the mistakes that come from the drawing of too facile analogies, and in blurring differences in levels of organization that are important. It is all too easy, as the ethologist Lorenz warns us, " to first evolve a theory and then to underpin it with examples, for nature is so diverse that with diligent searching one can find apparently convincing examples to support wholly abstruse hypotheses." 54 Before moving too rapidly toward a more biologically oriented political science, it will be well to consider the problems that others have confronted in attempting to apply theories developed in one area to another, quite diverse, area. The beneficial returns are often less than the confusion that is introduced by such borrowing. And in the group sciences where there is still a great deal that is not known about the relationship of individual behavior to group behavior, the addition of a biological level must be approached with the greatest methodological and empirical caution. The problem of reduction,55 which is already enormous, will be even more paramount in a more biologically oriented political science. " Konrad Lorenz, On Aggression (New York, 1963), p. xii.
