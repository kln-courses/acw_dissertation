<plain_text><page sequence="1">Male Phantasy and Modern Sculpture ALEX POTTS My concern here is with the psychic and ideological formation of a phantasy - largely a male phantasy - played out around sculpture and the sculptural in modern culture. The phantasy concerned has a powerful regressive dimension, projecting a desire for a return to a mythic oneness with things, yet being constantly frustrated by the obdurate materi- ality of the 'real' sculptural objects around which it circulates. The sculptural object - the work of art as literal thing rather than two-dimensional representation - has been both a recurrent obsession and, at the same time, an awkward problem ever since the emergence of modern formalist aesthetics in the eighteenth century.1 A sculpture, by contrast with a painting, interpolates a particular kind of unframed viewing. As a thing inhabiting the same space as the spectator, it at one level offers her/him the promise of an unmediated experience, one that might momentarily dissolve the distinction between view- ing subject and viewed object that the literal frame of the painting constantly reasserts. For the spectator who subscribes to the idea being absorbed entirely in the act of contemplating a work of art, such a communion with the object would in effect make it completely unresistant to her/his projective phanta- sies. While this experience is at one level a kind of aesthetic nirvana, in which all friction between the self and the objects in the world around it is abolished, there is also the danger that, taken too literally, it could come to seem rather dumb, a form of naive fetishism. Let us make the issues more concrete, and turn to a little skit Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote in 1762 on the archetypical fable phantasising the ideal sculptural object, the Pygmalion legend. The gendering of the drama, played out between male viewer or artist, and female object of desire, is symptomatic of a gendering at work in the whole conception of the sculptural in modern aesthetics, though I do not think it is particularly illuminating to identify the viewing subjectivity involved as exclusively male. Such fixities of gender position are constantly being slightly unsettled by the complex interplay of identification and objectification that occurs in engagements with anthropomorphic images. To put this in Freudian terms, object cathexis, or the possession of an object by a subject's libido, often is only one part of a dynamic in which the subject also identifies with the object concerned, and internalises it as an aspect of her/himself. The issue of how a female subject might be drawn into, or alienated by, the psychodynamics of Rousseau's Pygmalion phantasy is an issue I shall set to one side here - except to say that it is a male phantasy, a heterosexual male phantasy, but one that is not entirely unamenable to inflection and partial repos- session by differently gendered identities. To return to Rousseau's story. He set the scene by showing the sculptor Pygmalion alternate between an ecstatic phantasy that his marble creation had actually come alive, and the dejected recognition of his folly and error in imagining that 'this inanimate object' is any more than a 'hard and shapeless mass worked with a metal tool'. What so compels him about the idea of the sculpture coming alive is not, as is usually supposed, that he will be faced by some adored other, but that he will discover in it an emanation of his own self: 'I adore myself in what I have made.' It is this narcissistic phantasy that is quite literally enacted in his climactic orgasmic delirium as the statue actually comes to life. Galatea steps off her pedestal, the boundary between herself and the sculptor is abolished and she becomes quite literally one with him. Touching herself she says: 'This is me'; touching a block of marble, the alien matter that remains indifferent to the sculptor's self- projection, she utters: 'This is not me.' Then, as she holds her hand to Pygmalion's palpitating heart, she declares: 'Ah! myself again.'2 This phantasy of transformation and projection which Rousseau dramatises lends itself especially well to representation in sculpture. In order for the equivalent image in a painting to enact this drama, it would have to undergo a preliminary mutation. The pictured form of Galatea would first have to break through the frame of two dimensional representa- tion and enter the world of things. The sculpted figure, that instead only has to be imagined as stepping off its pedestal, and already exists in the space inhabited by the spectator, is more readily amenable to being hallucinated as living presence rather than mere image. Rousseau's story is nothing if not narcissistic. But reading it from our late twentieth-century perspec- tive, we cannot just leave matters there. More than two centuries of 'bourgeois' self-analysis have over- laid the bare outlines of Rousseau's schematic phantasy, two centuries of increasingly tormented theorisations of the self and its relation to the world around it. Within the psychic and cultural baggage that has built up around the visual arts, sculpture has become particularly problematic. Its insistent materi- ality acts as an irritant to the aesthetic formalisation of 38 THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL - 15:2 1992</page><page sequence="2">the art object encoded through the conventions of painting. At the same time the immediacy of its physical presence can give the illusion that the selfs projective phantasies are being realised in palpable form in the real world. The answer Baudelaire gave in 1846 to the question 'Why is sculpture so boring' brings us into the middle of these issues: 'Sculpture has several drawbacks that are a necessary consequence of its means. Brutal and positive like nature, it is at the same time vague and eludes one's grasp, because it presents too many faces at once.' (Fig. 1) The artist has no control over how the spectator sees his work. By contrast, painting, Baudelaire noted, 'has only one point of view; it is exclusive and despotic'. In other words, the sculptural object has no clearly defined frame through which to dictate the viewing subjects' position in relation to it. Moreover, even though sculpture would normally be exhibited on a pedestal, the pedestal cannot mediate between viewer and image in the same unequivocal way that the frame of a picture mediates between the viewer and painted field. There is less to ensure the setting off of the sculpted image as representation rather than mere thing occupying the spectator's space. The literal materiality of sculpture also makes it a more primitive art than painting. It is dumb and t Fig. 1. James Pradier: La Poesie Legere (detail), exhibited at the 1846 Salon, marble, 205 cm. Musee d'Art et d'Histoire, Nimes. infantile and can never sever itself from the 'carving (of) fetishes'. As we might say now, sculpture makes the fetishism that pertains in all viewing of art too transparent, in which a dumb lump of matter is imagined to embody a living presence.3 For Baudelaire, the fetishistic aspect of the sculpted figure was closely related to the problem of displaying or presenting sculpture and to the potential status of sculpture as commodity. He insisted that in modern society a sculpture could only function effectively as a complementary art, as an object framed by architecture, or as an element forming part of other settings, such as garden sculpture absorbed within the atmospheric light and shade effects of fountains and hedges. In this way the sculptural object could effectively be transformed into a motif in a painterly ensemble. According to Baudelaire: 'Industriously carving portable figures won't do any longer.' Designed to be seen close to, as an object in an exhibition or a museum, modern sculpture was caught up in minutiae and puerilities of execution that 'victoriously surpass [those of] any ritual pipe or fetish' (Fig. 2). Sculptors working in this vein would 'voluntarily transform the tombs of Saint-Denis into cigar boxes or cashmeres, and all the Florentine bronzes into two sou pieces'. In modem times, Baudelaire argued, an independent Fig. 2. James Pradier: La Priere (statuette), 1842, plaster, 45 cm. Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Paris. 39 THE OXFORD ART JOURNAI. - 15:2 1992</page><page sequence="3">piece of sculpture became a portable item that too readily acquired the status of luxury commodity. It thereby literally epitomised what all art objects threatened to become once they were cut loose from traditional settings and functions.4 To gloss Baudelaire's analysis very freely, the framing of painting not only gave it a more respect- able status within modem society, marking it out more as image, sign, or representation, than mere material thing to be delected and exchanged - or at least its framing designated it as a particular kind of commodity different from a decorative luxury object or knickknack. The framing also set up a response in which the viewing subject knew it inhabited a different realm from the depicted object, would be held back from an unmediated encounter with things - Baudelaire's brute positivity. What in sculpture, as distinct from painting, discomfited Baudelaire, was the way in which the spectator's absorption in the experience of viewing threatened to become the regressive experience of submerging the ego, to quote Freud, in 'a much more inclusive - indeed, an all-embracing - feeling which corresponded to a more intimate bond between the ego and the world around it', the 'primary ego- feeling' of a consciousness that as yet makes 'no clear demarcation between the ego and the external world'.5 This, in Baudelaire's particular case, held a deep terror - painting by contrast was more readily seen as the conscious projection of an artist's idea, a triumph over the material world, that ratified the self-contained integrity of both artist's and viewer's ego. If we were to translate this into the prevailing typologies of infantile phantasy, the terror of unmediated encounter with the brute positivity of thingness associated by Baudelaire with the almost literal fleshiness of academic figure sculpture is not so much terror of the inflexible paternal object, but rather of all-embracing maternal object, that could threaten to dissove the frail boundaries of the male ego. The view of sculpture as being the art par excel- lence of an earlier more archaic consciousness than painting, had in some form been prevalent ever since the later eighteenth century, and certainly ever since its codification in Hegel's aesthetic in the early nine- teenth century.6 One of its earliest and also its most intriguing formulations is to be found in a pioneer- ing attempt to differentiate between the formal constitution of painting and sculpture on the model of the Lessing's distinction between literature and visual art, an essay published by Johann Gottfried Herder in 1778 entitled 'Sculpture. Some observa- tions on form and Gestalt [shape] from Pygmalion's creative dream'. Herder's central point was that sculpture offered a more fundamental, unmediated experience than painting, because it was the art of feeling and touch, rather than optical appearances: the tactile defini- tion of form underpinned our interpretation of visual experience. By contrast with Baudelaire, who highlighted the fears surrounding the idea of an unmediated apprehension of things, Herder con- strued this experience in utopian terms as one of 'deeply felt, faithful, naked truth'. 'The eye [to which painting appeals] is only the guide, only the hand is reason itself. The hand alone yields up forms, the concept of them, what they mean, what lives within them.' Sculpture not only is the art of inner form, of the underlying essence of things, but it also makes them more immediately accessible to us - we identify with sculpted representations of the body in a way that we do not with painted ones. The optical light effects and composition in painting distance 'bodily truth'.7 For Herder, the very factors that made sculpture the more powerfully immediate art also rendered it deeply problematic as an art form in the modern world. It was of its very nature archaic, and here at one level his analysis converged with Baudelaire's, even if his primal sculptural object was not Baude- laire's threatening fetish, but the ideally natural beautiful naked body of ancient Greek art (Figs. 3 and 4). His argument was an historical-sociological one - the Greek sculptural ideal was the unique product of an early form of society, possessing a direct communion with nature irretrievably lost in moder times. Ancient Greece marked a lost happy Fig. 3. Apollonius: Belvedere Torso, first or second century B.C., marble, 159cm. Vatican Museum, Rome.

Vatican Museum, Rome. childhood in the history of humankind, a privileged moment when nature and society were perfectly harmonised and were not yet in conflict with one another. But if sculpture, the paradigmatic art of this utopian moment, set in the distant past, was foundational of visual art, it was also an art from which the modems were alienated. It represented an imaginative configuration that existed as a compel- ling phantasy, but could never be realised, in the adulthood of the modern world.8 Herder's conceiving sculpture as an archaic art form was itself distinctively modern - the imagina- tive force of the sculptural was seen to lie in its representing an immediate relation to the material world not fully available to modem consciousness. It was a phantasy produced by an overwhelming sense of the mediations framing modem subjectivity's engagement with physical objects, including the body - a mythic bursting of these framings, a regressive phantasy of return to a childhood of consciousness. But even Herder's Greek sculptural utopia was not just a happy playground of beautiful youthful bodies; to be a convincing phantasy, it needed at some level to carry traces of the anxieties that produced it, and also had to do justice to other darker experiences of Greek culture, of which Herder was himself quite aware. For one thing: 'The sex is there.' We adults do not just see 'the fallacious angels of a vision' in the children's playground, to use Auden's words. Or, to give you Herder's more high-flown formulation: 'Universal human feeling is joined by sexual feelings, that we can never entirely deny even when it comes to the most noble judge- ments on what mankind is.' Physical desire splits the universal oneness of the ideal Greek figure, disturbs the supposedly innocent communion with the natural truth of the body. Herder's categorical heterosexism means that desire is particularly unsettling of the phantasy of innocent narcissistic identification with the ideal bodies of Greek art. According to him, it is only in the experience of the opposite gender, rather that ones's own, that the positive impulses of what he calls love are not threatened with disruption by the revulsions of hatred. But a more significant disturbance comes in the form of fear. According to Herder, the origins of the art of sculpture lie with images that appear huge and overwhelming, and evoke 'shuddering and awe, not love and sympathy'. The primal experience of the sculptural is of something demonic. Only later, when civilization has created a protective distance between nature and human subjectivity, could people see figurations of the body as art, rather than fetish, and the beautiful true forms of Greek sculpture emerge.9 A sense of awe or terror is not just a nightmare lurking in the most archaic reaches of the past, but is seen by Herder as fundamental to the very formal constitution of sculpture as an art based in feeling rather than seeing. The pure experience of the sculptural, as the probing after shape in the dark, does not produce that secure apprehension of the overall form of a thing defined through an image seen by the eye. The sculptural experience of an object does not delimit it as a manageable, clearly circumscribed whole - it lies too close. We are back here in the domain of regressive phantasy, a dissolu- tion of the boundaries between perceiving ego and perceived object in a probing darkness of immediat- ely felt rather than distinctly visualised form. But here a note of terror disturbs the plenitude of oneness, the terror of the helpless infantile self faced by outside impulses that threaten to overwhelm it. Like Baudelaire's disgust and terror in front of the brute positivity of sculpture, Herder's intimate communion with things is aroused more by the idea of the sculptural, than by any particular experience of a sculptural object. Indeed, Herder's evocation of the atavistic plenitude of the sculptural would seem to be radically at odds with the clearly circumscribed forms of the neo-classical sculpture of the period, or indeed even of the Greco-Roman sculptures that then dominated aesthetic discourse (Figs. 4 and 5). What brings the sculptural and sculpture together in Herder's conception of things is a viewing from very close to that dissolves clearly articulated shapes in a generalised sensation of pure surface and contour. It THE OXFORD ART JOURNAI. - 15:2 1992 41</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 5. Antonio Canova: Perseus, 1801, marble, 235 cm. Vatican Museum, Rome. is no longer a particular figure that is apprehended, but 'the beautiful line, that here always changes its path, that, never violently interrupted, never unpleasantly driven away, rolls over the body in its splendour and beauty, and never resting and ever gliding forward, giving shape to the surface, the fullness, the softly blown enchanting corporeal form, that knows nothing of planes, of corner or angle' - the confining attributes that emerge in the definition of its image in two-dimensional representation. The experience is, of course, vicarious in any actual engagement with a sculptural object where the hand does not touch, but the eye traces out the imagined sensation of being engulfed in flowing contours and surfaces.10 Specifically what is being picked up in this utopian phantasy of a flowing probing that dissolves any resistance between the object and the perceiving, desiring self, is Winckelmann's classic description of that famous fragment of antique sculpture, the Belvedere Torso (Fig. 4). Winckelmann's description culminates in the melting away of any sense of definable bodily form, in a surrender to the sensation of softly modulated contours imperceptibly flowing into one another over the body's surface.1 All sculptural form here becomes one, the sense of the figure as a particular definable entity separate from the spectator disappears. Appropriately, this is acted out on a statue that existed as a fragment, its overall bounding forms in a very literal sense ambiguous and ill-defined. This said, it is important to stress that the dissolu- tion of the self's boundaries in the experience of the sculptural is still emphatically framed in Herder's scheme of things by a centred experience of the ideal sculptural object. The image of the Greek ideal that hovers behind his analysis is the image of the body as an harmoniously integrated totality, the emblem of a subjectivity existing in blissful self-sufficiency, un- disturbed by any conflict or tension with the world about it, or any divisions within itself. In psycho- analytic terms, this would correspond to that narcissistic phase when the libidinal urges first cohere to seize upon a single object as the focus of desire, the ego itself Conflicts between internal desires and the external world are made irrelevant in a state of total self absorption, of turning back into the self, in which the nascent ego recognises in the image of itself, its ideal ego, an object of love. This narcissistic phase represents an intermediate stage in the formation of the ego, after the initial state of auto- eroticism, when, to quote Freud, 'the separate sexual instincts work independently of one another', and prior to the fixation of the sexual instincts on an external object that eventually ushers in the com- plexities of the Oedipal trajectory. It is a state when the 'hitherto isolated sexual instincts' find an object that is not an 'external one, extraneous to the subject, but its own ego'.'2 Such a narcissism follows upon a phase when the ego is still undifferentiated, dissolved in impulses coming from the external world and the promptings of its instinctive drives - when there is oneness with things but also no control over the self and its relation to the external world, a state both of oceanic plenitude and total helpless- ness. This is a state that finds its own more extremely archaic form of narcissistic oneness - Freud's primary narcissism - in an absolute self-sufficiency that excludes the reception of impulses from the external world, and is represented most completely by the state of not yet being born, or the state of sleep.'3 The narcissism of the Greek ideal, then, is one that blocks out the terror of total loss of self represented by this earlier more archaic state, as well as keeping at bay the contradictions and divisions of the mature ego: a mythic ideal ego, rather than the masochistic super-ego. Here we have an important bourgeois phantasy, located in an ideal never- existing past - for no human society, even the very simplest, could exist without division and difference, in a state prior to the Oedipal trauma - and a never to be achieved mythic future, the total obliteration of the divided, alienated self of the moder world. Herder's analysis, originating from what we could designate as the early heroic phase of bourgeois culture, has some significant points of convergence - and of difference - with a later evocation of the sculptural from the high moment of moder individ- ualism, namely Rilke's famous 1907 essay on Rodin. THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL - 15:2 1992 42</page><page sequence="6">Here the focus is on modern art, rather than, as in Herder's case, the art of antiquity. I take as emblematic of Rilke's imaginative projection of Rodin's sculpture a fragmentary figure the artist exhibited at the end of his career (Fig. 6), that in a general way could be said to echo the formal conception of that once famous antique fragment, the Belvedere Torso. Rilke echoes Herder's insistence that the primal experience of sculpture is one that in the end dissolves distinct shape in a vaguer, immediately felt, apprehension of surface. This Rilke describes as modelling, that in the very act of defining a figure as a distinct thing 'separated on all sides from the continent of the uncertain', engulfs the artist or viewer in an unarticulated experience of its surfaces. 'This work [the work at modelling] was the same in everything one made, and had to be carried out so humbly, so obediently, so devotedly, so impartially on face and hand and body that no specified parts remained and the artist worked the form without knowing what exactly would result, like a worm working its way from point to point in the dark . . .' At one level, the integrated image of the Greek ideal is here categorically abandoned in favour of some- thing radically fragmentary.14 This happens at a moment, historically, when the incomplete torso, rather than the restored whole sculpture, was Fig. 6.

Photo: Bulloz. becoming increasingly paradigmatic as the image of the best early Greek sculpture. The defining experience of sculpture for Rilke was not a humanistic identification with the figure, as in Herder, but an identification with things. The sensation of intensely modelled parts is no longer framed by the image of a body as a complete self- contained whole. The sculpted figure ceases to symbolise the idea of a centred conscious subject- the ego is in effect dissolved, and the identity and integrity of the human self becomes no more, and no less, than the identity and integrity of the objects or things that surround it. According to Rilke, to become fully absorbed in the experience of Rodin's work is to obliterate all suggestions of human subjectivity and emotion: 'With these figures [...] there come destinies and sweet and comfortless names; but suddenly they vanish like a passing radiance - and we understand why. We see men and women, men and women, again men and women [note, not women and men]. And the longer one looks, the more does even this content become simplified and one sees: Things.'15 What are these 'Things'? They are recollections, and here it is perhaps no coincidence that Rilke is writing as a contemporary of Freud, of some unmediated encounter between the self and objects in the world around it that seems to have terrorised Baudelaire. They are things that exist in immediate communion with the ego, things that seem to be at one with its desires, things inhabiting the expansive plenitude of infantile narcissism, frictionlessly pleasurable things rather than indifferent or threatening things. In Rilke's own words: the word 'things' passes you by... it means too much, all of which lacks significance. And so I am glad to have appealed to childhood; perhaps it will help me to bring home to you this word. If possible, out of practice and grown-up as your feelings are, bring them back to any one of your childhood's possessions with which you were familiar. Think whether there was ever anything nearer to you, more familiar, more indispensable than such a thing. Whether every- thing else - except it - was not capable of acting unkindly or unjustly towards you, of frightening you with pain, or confusing you with uncertainty? If, amongst your early experiences, you knew kindness, confidence, and the sense of not being alone - do you not owe it to that thing? [...] That something, worthless as it was, prepared the way for your first contact with the world, introduced you to life and to people; and more than that, its existence, its outward appearance, whatever it was, its final destruction or mysterious withdrawal from the scene caused you to know the whole of human experience, even to death itself.'6 Here one is reminded of Winnicott's transitional object, the object that is not yet totally separate from the self, that is experienced both an extension of the self and outside it, but not yet alien - the first substitute for the all-comforting mother object.17 43 THE OXFORD ART JOURNAI. - 15:2 1992</page><page sequence="7">Rilke knew as well as anyone that in this regressive phantasy, experience of the material world outside the self is not always amenable to narcissistic appropriation. Some thiings can be introjected within the self as objects of love, but others have to be expelled as objects of hate and fear.18 The conven- tions of art-talk made it almost inevitable that in the essay on Rodin, Rilke would dwell on the comforting aura of things that the self could possess on its own terms, without resistance or self-alteration. But seven years later, in 1914, he produced an essay, 'Some Reflections on Dolls', that addressed the experience of things as indifferent to - repelling the narcissistic expansion of the selfs desires - the sculptural object, not as warmly resonant thing, but worthless fetish or doll. 'If we were to bring to mind, in thinking of our childhood', Rilke writes in this essay, 'the intimate, the touching, the deserted, thoughtful aspect of things', and 'at the same time find one of these dolls, pulling it out from a pile of more responsive things - it would almost anger us with its frightful obese forgetfulness, the hatred, which undoubtedly has always been a part of our relationship to it unconsciously, would break out, it would lie before us unmasked as the horrible foreign body on which we had wasted our purest ardour.'19 The doll is the statue of Galatea that insistently stays on its pedestal, and in the end repels and disappoints the phantasies it elicits, gives brute evidence in its 'soulless and utterly irresponsible material' of the resistance of things to being at one with the selfs impulses. It could also be seen as the childhood thing that disappoints, the object that frustrates rather than satisfies desire, and provokes aggression, the attempted destruction of its alien resistance to the self. It is what some psychoanalysts would call the bad object that, like the good object - Rilke's Thing - originates with the child's earliest responses to the mother. The doll is in Freud's own terms initially a substitute for playing out the child's ambivalent attitude to the mother.20 We might read Rilke, then, as suggesting that the condition of the sculptural object was split between that of the doll and that of the auratic Thing. Rilke's comments on the destiny of the sculptural object in modem society in his Rodin essay would seem to bear this out. Sculpture, on his reckoning, has no place it can occupy as something 'thoroughly and intimately incorporated in human life', as something emanating from our needs and experiences. Rodin's sculptures could only exist as things in the full resonant sense as shadowy shapes in the sculptor's studio. They have no such place outside it. Balzac (Fig. 7) was 'returned to the studio', 'rejected', rejected, one might add, by its public as a stupid doll that had disappointed in its pretence to be the resonant embodiment of a great man. Rilke, in seeking to negotiate the contradiction between the power Rodin's works had for him as apparitions in the studio (Fig. 8), before they were Fig. 7. Auguste Rodin: Balzac, photographed in the garden of Rodin's studio at Meudon, 1897, plaster, 300 cm. Musee Rodin, Paris. Photo: Bulloz. put on pedestals, framed for viewing in some alien public setting, and their destiny as objects in modem society, had recourse to an argument characteristic for the period about the nature of the modem, and the fate of sculpture within it as the art of a more ancient order of things. Unlike the thinkers of Herder's generation, he no longer highlighted the dialectic between society and nature. Rather the antinomy between the ancient and modem was defined in terms of the inherently changeable, fluid character of the modem, and of the impossibility of fixing its values in the solid permanent forms of the sculptural. As if himself succumbing to his diagnosis of modernity, Rilke phantasised that the most vivid image of Rodin's project would not be the studio as it was, filled and cluttered by solid completed works, but empty, 'cleared out, so that what remained to be done in the ensuing years might be seen'.21 Accumulated as objects, existing independently of the creative process, particularly removed outside the studio, as images frozen forever in marble and bronze, did the sculptures not threaten to become just like the array of dolls that had 'confronted [Rilke] and almost overwhelmed [him] by their waxen nature' and inspired his essay on the hated fetishistic doll-thing? How would Rodin's sculptures distinguish themselves among the 'monotonous 44 THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL - 15:2 1992</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 8.

Rilke's reflections pose the idea that sculpture as both fascinating and deeply problematic, and in doing so raise questions about the psychic resonance of objects, as well as historical ones about the nature and status of things and objects in modern capitalist society. The sculptural is presented at one level as a psychic phantasy of regression to subjectivity prior to a categorical separation between it and the world around. Within this regressive phantasy, objects could appear either as things with which to identify, which could be perceived as being at one with the selfs desires, or as dully obdurate and indifferent, as alien things, giving the lie to, frustrating the impulses of the narcissistic pleasure-ego. Rilke's evocation of the idea of modelling in sculpture seeks to plunge the experience of the sculptural into a mythic haven where the self momentarily only encounters that part of the external world 'that is pleasurable, which it has incorporated into itself.23 But sculpture as object constantly threatens to enter the part of the world experienced as alien and hostile, to be expelled by the ego from the haven of narcissistic plenitude, a discarded and hated doll. This syndrome could be reiterated in a quite dif- ferent register, as part of an historical analysis of the anomalous status of the art object in modern THE OXFORD ART JOURNAl. - 15:2 1992 capitalist society. The art object is a special thing endowed with the aura of a resonant presence, constantly under threat of disappointing by being seen as no more than what it literally is, a mere material object, or yet another commodity. We saw something of this unease already explicitly articula- ted in Baudelaire's designation of sculpture as a transposition of archaic fetishism into modem society, that inevitably degenerated into a cult of the inanities associated with modem luxury. Such a perception of the art object as mere commodity is quite distant from the immediate terms of reference of Rilke's rich psychic investment of the sculptural. But there is still in Rilke's analysis a quite explicit echo of the distinctive reifications of modem capital- ist culture. At one level, we can talk about the prob- lematic of the sculptural object in terms of a tension between its 'real' status as mere commodity, and its cultural status as auratically charged thing. But we could also conceptualise its contradictory status as object in terms of the very definition of the object as commodity within modem capitalist culture. This would have to do with the blockage produced by the formalising effects of commodification in modem culture, between the thing as it exists within the grid of cultural convention and exchange, metaphoric- ally speaking its exchange value, and the unknow- able thing in itself, its use value. The regressive phantasies at play in Rilke's conception of the sculptural are, within this scheme, phantasies of a thing in itself, of its essence, that are both produced, and then denied, by the all-embracing commodify- ing mechanisms of modern capitalist society.24 Why this centrality of things? Why this reification of human subjectivity so that the ideal material embodiment of the human subject becomes an inanimate thing, a denial of the living conscious self? In an essay on the art of landscape, Rilke makes the significance of this quite explicit. Landscape-art, he explains, is characteristically modem because it 'transforms the whole world into inanimate land- scape', telling 'us that man is no longer the social entity, moving with poise among his like ... It tells us that he is placed amongst things like a thing, infinitely alone, and that all which is common to them both has withdrawn from things and men into the common depth.'25 At one level, this could be seen to echo Marx's dictum: 'the definite social relation between men themselves [...] assumes here, for them, the fantastic form of a relation between things',26 even while we recognise that Marx's critique of the fetishising of the exchange value of commodities in capitalist political economy, that converts the wage labourer into mere com- modity, involves an understanding of reification rather different from any consciously at play in Rilke. To take Rilke more on his own terms, the reification with which he is concerned is a con- sequence of thinking how the phantasy of an ideal subjectivity at one with itself and the world could credibly be imagined. The only form in which the 45</page><page sequence="9">autonomy and oneness of a harmoniously centred subjectivity could be projected in modern society was by way of a total obliteration of consciousness and desire. In terms of Freud's mythology of the death instinct, it represents the compulsion to return to the undisturbed state of inanimate matter.27 Phantasies of subjective oneness in the 'heroic' phase of bourgeois culture in the Enlightenment did not need to be so extreme. The self-contained ideal body, the narcissistic image of the ideal ego at its point of formation, was still a credible phantasy, even if partly occluded by other more 'primal' phantasies of the total dissolution of self and of the conscious centering of sensation and desire. Rilke relies on the art of landscape painting to represent his conception of the modern condition, while the art of sculpture does something more contradictory and complex. Rather than giving an image of this condition, it exemplifies it in its uneasy status as both mere object and richly invested Thing. It offers the phantasy of unmediated communion between object and viewer, of an unframed experi- ence of the thing in itself, which abolishes the distinction between viewing subject and viewed object, merging both, to use Rilke's terms, in the universe of Things. But it is a phantasy that, when played out in relation to actual pieces of sculpture, cannot be taken at face value without risk of appearing a flagrant fetishising of the object, or an empty con-trick. In other words, sculpture is caught within a radical contradiction - it promises an experience that is prior to, and yet in its material manifestations cannot escape from the insistent rationalisation and formalisation of things as exchangeable commodities in moder capitalism. If things are always approximating to the status of commodities, their literal materiality at one level becomes increasingly insignificant. What they are specifically as things, their use value, is quite irrelevant to the formal definition of their value through exchange. They become entirely amenable to appropriation, exist in effect in a frictionless dematerialised form for immediate consumption. Yet, where this world of commodity exchange comes to seem trivial and alien, another effect of the dichotomy between exchange value and the raw materiality of use value comes into play. To detrivialise it, to restore it to some true integrity and value outside the system of consumption and exchange, the real form of the object comes to be mythologised as some mythic thing in itself that lies beyond its constitution within the rationalising forms of commodity exchange, and is endowed with an aura that is unamenable to the mediations of culture. The syndrome that activates a sculptural object as ineffable Thing, and at the same time threatens to reveal it as mere indifferent lump of matter, is not confined to figurative work. Michael Fried's famous attack on minimalist sculpture as threatening the aura of pure abstraction, in his view exemplified by the immaterial formal values of colour field painting, is perhaps the best known recent expression of a Baudelairean anxiety over the fetishising processes that three dimensional art objects threaten to make too insistently literal.28 And take the controversey that has flared up around Carl Andre's brick Equivalent VIII (Fig. 9). No work, perhaps, has provoked such outrage as this over the apparent con- tradiction between its promise of a powerful unme- diated aesthetic experience, and its literal existence as a pile of ordinary bricks. A classic figure threatens to be no more than a doll; the minimalist master- piece no more than leggo. To sum up then. The sculptural object within modern bourgeois aesthetics at one level suggests the possibility of an object in the external world that is entirely amenable to the spectator's projective phantasy, that offers nothing to resist its appropria- tion by the latter, its 'Bestzung' (Freud's cathexis). It would seem momentarily to promise the spectator the experience of a simple world of oneness, without conflict and division. At another level, the sculptural object is so literally separate and alien, an obdurate thing rather than amenable image or representation, that it cannot help but also present the flip-side of the phantasy of oneness with the external world the experience of the latter as radically unassimilable Fig. 9.

In its inevitable failure as object of a narcissis- tic subject's projective phantasy, it provokes aggres- sion and frustration. This may point to one of the more insistent dichotomies of modern bourgeois subjectivity's consciousness of itself and its relation to the world outside it, of the omnipotent yet impotent self, of the world as extension of a sovereign subjectivity, and as totally alien or other to it, with whose earliest and most eloquent mythologiser, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, I began this article. This article originated as a paper given in the session 'The Viewer in the Frame' at the Association of Art Historians conference in London in April 1991. All references to Freud's writings are from the version of the Standard Edition published as The Pelican Freud Library (Harmondsworth). Notes 1. Comparisons between painting and sculpture already occur in Renaissance art theory, but the tenor of the discussion changes signifi- cantly in the Enlightenment period with the birth of philosophical aesthetics and the formulation of modem theories about the structurally different constitution of different art forms, such as Lessing's Laokoon of 1764. The systematic formal distinction between painting as an art of optical seeing and sculpture as an art of plastic touch elaborated by Herder in his essay Plastik (1778), represents an important new departure for speculation about the nature of the sculptural.
