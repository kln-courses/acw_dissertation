<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVA BAER JEWELED CERAMICS FROM MEDIEVAL ISLAM: A NOTE ON THE AMBIGUITY OF ISLAMIC ORNAMENT In the arts of Islam we are accustomed to thinking of jeweled artifacts in terms of the sixteenth- to eighteenth-century silver and gold luxury wares incrusted with pearls and gems that were created for members of the Safavid, Qajar, Mughal, or Ottoman upper class. Little-if any-attention has so far been given to less expensive early- and high-medieval artifacts on which gems and pearls were copied in cheaper materials by reproducing jewelry techniques in clay and on which the function of precious metals and jewelry was transformed from the embellishment of the human body to the decoration of lifeless inanimate objects such as vases, bottles, and jugs. The idea of decorating earthenware vessels with relief motifs that resemble mounted gemstones and precious jewels is neither an Islamic phenomenon nor one that originated in the Islamic era. Imitations of Sasanian gems set in gold and silver, realized in the form of square or oval bosses set within granulated lines or rosettes enclosed within a dotted border, appear on northeastern Chinese ceramic vessels in the early to mid sixth century. The Chinese fascination with these motifs is likewise attested, to cite only a few examples, from a late-sixth-century green lead-glazed vase (fig. 1)1 and from a mid-seventh-century white stoneware bowl. The latter is decorated with alternating bands of oval, square, or round medallions2 that resemble precious stones and repousse gold or silver florets, harking back to the Iranian tradition. Similar features occur on Khotanese sixth- to eighth-century ewers and jugs. On some of the coarse pottery vessels from that area jewelry motifs are spread irregularly over their bodies. More refined objects display them in horizontal bands that run around the widest part of the container or show them together with female busts. These latter have wide necklaces made up of similar jeweled and pearl strings3 that provide unequivocal testimony for the origin of all these ceramic ornaments in more costly jewelry.4 While the idea of using jewelry as a model for pottery embellishment was thus not new-jeweled ornament was allotted an important place in all divisions of Ira- nian and Central Asian art-Muslim artists exploited and developed these ideas in new ways. The most fascinating manifestation of this development is the way the artisans mentally transformed jugs and other artifacts into a "living being" by applying jewelry motifs to the shoulder, handle, or foot of these vessels as if they were parts of the human body. We shall return to this aspect in the course of this study. For the moment it will suffice to record the early realization of this "anthropomorphic" notion in the mosaics of the Dome of the Rock, where the artists laid jeweled breastplates around the neck of the amphoras, or attached earrings with one to three suspended pearls to the S-shaped handles of the vases (fig. 2).5 Most of the jewelry displayed in these mosaics belongs to the "Western," that is, Byzantine, type. However, as J. Deer has demonstrated, certain features of these crowns and diadems are Iranian in origin and are prefigured on Parthian coins and Sasanian gems.6 Similarly, jewelry depicted on other early Islamic monuments harkens back to royal Sasanian imagery. Among the sculptures of Khirbat al-Mafjar, now in the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem, are two bearded ibexes. Both animals have a necklace-one in the form of a rope, the other in the form of a band studded with pearls-tied around its neck, from which three oval petals are suspended (fig. 3).7 Similar pearl necklaces with three, or occasionally two, oval petals are worn by Sasanian kings and queens portrayed in stucco at Palace I and Palace II at Kish,8 or are hammered in relief in a gold medallion now in the Heeramaneck Col- lection.9 On seventh- to eighth-century silver vases,</page><page sequence="2">EVA BAER 1.

The first is a ribbon with a three-petaled pendant that hangs from its spout (figs. 4-5). This ornament closely resembles the type of necklace worn by the ibexes at Khirbat al-Mafjar and, as mentioned earlier, ultimately goes back to the jewelry depicted on busts of the late Sasanian kings. The second is that the artist seems deliberately to have located this decoration at the base of the spout, a site reminiscent of the human neck and therefore the most appropriate place for a necklace or pendant. A revealing parallel to the Jerusalem bottle is a vessel in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (figs. 6-7a-b).'5 The glaze on this bottle has disappeared, and the cen- tral sectioh of its body has broken off. Originally, how- ever, both the Jerusalem and the New York bottle must have shared nearly the same shape and decoration. Not only do the molded triangles and rosette patterns on the New York piece agree in nearly every detail with those on the Jerusalem specimen, but the artist of the New York bottle must also have envisioned a human being when he created its decoration: he put a necklace of spiral-like disks around the base of its spout and decorated its shoulder with threaded petals. The idea of embellishing a humble pottery vessel with ornaments imitating jewelry is again found in a small unglazed jug, attributed to eighth-century Iran, 2. Vase adorned with breastplate and earrings. Detail from the mosaics at the Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem. bottles, and textiles, these necklaces are suspended from the neck of a cock or some other royal bird,'1 or sometimes symbolically carried in the bird's beak." The continuity of this tradition is also attested on coins, such as an Arab-Sasanian dirhem of CUbayd Allah ibn Ziyad, struck in Rayy in 679-80, on which a royal effigy wears a jeweled rope with three petals.'2 Other coins struck prior to CAbd al-Malik's reform reveal similar features.13 The idea of embellishing ceramic vessels with these and other jewelry motifs may have been realized some- what later. One of the most striking examples is an unglazed eleventh-to-twelfth-century bottle from Gurgan with molded and applied decoration, now in the L. A. Mayer Memorial in Jerusalem. 4 This 3.

Mayer Memorial in Jerusalem.16 On the whole it is a plain and unpretentious vessel, but it has around its neck an arch-shaped rope from which is suspended a conspicuous barbotine pendant. It ter- minates with a "pearl" and appears to hang on the "breast" of the jug, opposite its handle, constituting a distant echo of a golden painted relief ornament on the breast of a seventh-century seated Bodhisattva from Fondukistan now in the Kabul Museum.17 Imitations of jewelry embellishing either the neck or the shoulder of a pottery vessel can also be traced on sherds and other excavated artifacts. In my search for examples, several archaeological sites have proved to be 5. Unglazed bottle in figure 4 from the front. particularly rewarding. An unglazed jug with bar- botine and molded decoration that Schmidt unearthed at Istakhr and probably from the tenth century (fig. 8)18 has a breastplate or wide necklace on its shoulder. It has four different patterns: a band of pearls close to the base of the neck, a frieze of alternating circular and oval-shaped pendants formed by spiraling threads similar to those on the Metropolitan Museum bottle, a wide band of roundels enclosing florets, common on sixth- and seventh-century Sasanian-type silver vessels,19 and finally another band of "pearls." The notion of reproducing Sasanian gems in the cheap bar- botine technique reappears on another jug from 86</page><page sequence="5">JEWELED CERAMICS FROM MEDIEVAL ISLAM 6.

Istakhr,20 whose "breastplate" is reminiscent of the ornaments of the gold, rock-crystal, and glass bowl, the so-called Cup of Jamshid, in Paris.21 Among the sherds excavated at Qasr al-Hayr al- Sharqi in Syria were unglazed molded fragments whose decoration was again clearly inspired by jewelry. On one of the barbotine sherds, one notes a necklace orna- ment (figs. 9-10)22 in the form of slightly elongated medallions made up of a rope or cord to which oval petals are attached by means of small rosettes. This pat- tern follows, it would seem, a model already used by Umayyad sculptors at Khirbat al-Mafjar to decorate the neck of a female entertainer.23 Variations of this decorative motif can also be seen on other sherds of molded vessels and recur more elaborately in a type of jewelry depicted on Syro-Mesopotamian habbs, or glazed jars, attributable to the late twelfth or early thir- teenth century. The necks of these huge jars display for- malized scrolls which are either molded or applied in the barbotine technique and alternate with what seem to be female relief busts (fig. 11).24 Facial features- eyes, nose, mouth, etc.-are applied in barbotine, as is the hair, diadem or crown, and the necklace worn by the female figures. Particularly noteworthy is the large brooch that holds the twisted strands of hair at either side of the forehead, and the necklace or breastplate made up of a band of pearls terminating at either end with a rosette ornament identical to the hairpin, and incrusted oval or drop-shaped pendants, each with a "pearl" suspended from it. A similar necklace hangs from the neck of a fragment of a pottery head that once figured on a jar, and is now in the Islamic Museum in East Berlin.25 The Metropolitan Museum of Art possesses a little clay figurine of primitive workman- ship,26 with a necklace that recalls jewelry excavated at Palmyra, and recurs with minor variations on the molded eleventh-century pottery from Lashkari Bazaar and Rayy.27 Necklaces and pendants were obviously the most popular pieces of jewelry used to embellish medieval Islamic vessels attributable to sometime between the ninth and the early thirteenth century. Imitations of other types of jewelry, such as belt buckles, brooches, and bracelets, seem to have been less common and their function on the body of the vessel more arbitrary. This more random use of jewelry is exemplified by an unglazed jug in Munich (figs. 12-13a-b).28 On its shoulder alternating cartouches with birds facing backwards and roundels with addorsed griffins are stamped apparently at random. The interstices are covered with trailing slip threads that form geometricized floral designs, small rings or circles, and spiraling motifs.

While these necklaces are not necessarily replicas of precious jewelry-two heart-shaped necklace elements in stone are preserved in the Metropolitan Museum of Art4?- gold necklaces with heart-shaped pendants or variously strung heart elements must also have existed.41 From a formal point of view the decorations on these earthenware vessels-the rosettes, florets, foliated arabesques, drop-, heart-, or disk-shaped figures-are universal motifs with a long tradition in Near Eastern art. They neither derive from jewelry nor do they replicate artifacts made by gold- or silversmiths. Never- theless I believe that the potters were deliberately imitating techniques and materials used by gold- and silversmiths and intimately linked to jewelry making. 12.

This deliberate imitation suggests that the ornamenta- tion was meant to do something more than beautify and enrich a given surface-for that purpose conventional ceramic decoration would have sufficed. When we con- sider the artistic merits of the ceramics that display this ornamentation, their potential clientele, and the cultural ambience in which they were created, it will become clear what that further purpose was. These ceramic pieces fall into two categories: almost certainly mass-produced earthenware bowls, dishes, and bottles that would be purchased in the bazaar by ordinary townspeople and villagers, and monochrome glazed and unglazed earthenwares with rich and intricate ornamentation like the Jerusalem and New York habbs, which took on a sumptuous quality of their 90</page><page sequence="9">JEWELED CERAMICS FROM MEDIEVAL ISLAM 13a. Details of jug in figure 12. 13b. Details of jug in figure 12. own. They assume a degree of excellence which is reflected, it would seem, in the signatures that figure on some of these vessels. Most likely these objects were also sold in the bazaar, but they presumably were more expensive and intended for a well-to-do clientele. This certainly was the case with the habbs, which had to remain unglazed in order to function as coolers for liquids. Be that as it may, the fact that the decoration on all these earthenwares imitates jewelry suggests that the artists had intended to increase their market value by making them look more expensive than they really were. To put it differently, there must have been a demand among the townspeople for a type of pottery that was both mass produced and therefore relatively cheap and at the same time rich and sumptuous in impression. Scattered evidence for the attraction jewelry had for people in this period, whether townspeople, members of the upper class, or men of learning, can be gathered from contemporary poetry, in which can be found descriptions of pearl and other necklaces. These poems were obviously not based on close observation, and for that reason they were criticized by al-Biruni,42 whose book on precious stones is an indispensable source of information. These poems convey something of the spirit of the time, and they help to determine the raison d'etre for these jeweled earthenwares. In accordance with Eastern tradition, one of the aspects of jewelry reflected in poetry and other contem- porary literature is the association of its magnificence with wealth, power, and authority. "If kings have no other way to increase their power," says al-Biruni, "they embellish themselves with sumptuous jewelry so that they will be honored by the people since they adore wealth and yearn for it."43 "Jewelry and precious stones belong to kings," he claims;44 "if they are in the possession of people for whom they are not appropriate they might be suspected of theft or stealing." In another section, he specifies the kind of jewelry fashionable among kings, queens, and their attendants; rings and crowns he associates with men and kings; precious stones on sashes, belts, headgear, gloves, and maces to kings and their entourage, and diadems, bracelets, armlets, necklaces, and the like to women. After they have accumulated more jewels and luxuries than they can put on their bodies, al-Biruni complains, they decorate their houses the same way they adorn their bodies, and all this to display their abundance and vanity.45 When glorifying the natural world, or architectural monuments, or objects of art, Persian and Arab poets often draw on jewelry for their figures of speech. In describing flowering gardens, for example, Manuchihri Damghani (d. 1040) likens them to rich brocades embroidered with gems and precious metals.46 Al- Bayhaqi (995-1077) compares the throne of Bu Kalijar, allegedly a compatriot of Manuchihri, to a garden whose golden trees have leaves of carnelian and whose flowers are made of gold and silver and many kinds of jewels.47 In another poem Manuchihri praises the palace of MasCud of Ghazna (1030-41) by comparing it with a paradisial pavilion constructed of stones that are all jewels and precious rubies (jawhar and yaqut).48 In looking for descriptions of objects in Persian and Arabic literature, the only vessels I have so far found mentioned are those associated with drinking and pour- 91</page><page sequence="10">EVA BAER likened almost exclusively to pearls which represent the luster of the cup, and rubies (yaqut) to the red of the wine that tints the glass. A typical example is a verse of Abu Nuwas, who is quoted by al-Biruni as saying, "The wine is a ruby and the goblet a pearl in the hand of a pearl of fine tall stature."49 Ibn al-MuCtazz's verse on a wine cup, which he describes as "a mixture of molten gold which is held together by a goblet like the shell of a white pearl," curiously, brings to mind a pearl-studded goblet in the eleventh-century Fatimid paper drawing of a musician or courtesan, now in the Israel Museum.50 Whether Ibn al-MuCtazz had ever seen such representations, we will never know. 14.

But the goblet, the flask, and the bottle, as well as the person of the cupbearer, are repeatedly compared to jewels and precious metals. For example, goblets are 16. Crescent-shaped gold pendant.

They hang from the necks of bottles or jugs; they embellish a shoulder or a foot, and they beautify the object just as a necklace, bracelet, or earring adorns the human form. The question then arises whether the artists con- ceived the vessel as being alive, as having human quali- ties, or did they simply find these to be the areas on the object most suitable for decoration, whatever its char- acter. I have no clear-cut answer to this question, but 92</page><page sequence="11">JEWELED CERAMICS FROM MEDIEVAL ISLAM \i~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Li ~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~'~~l~-'~L~"~- ,.-~ ? . i?~' Y~*~e~~, . ii% .....? gr,~~~~~..~ .. . . r: .*" si '.....~~c - .,..~ ,.,~ ,/~', "'... ....~ h '~:'".....

They may deliberately have left the beholders to interpret the decoration in their own way. Such an ambiguous approach would be in line with the general trend of Islamic ornament which particularly between the ninth and the thirteenth century often used conventional vegetal or abstract motifs to conceal human or animal forms which gave the decoration an ambivalent appearance. 19.

The animation of ceramic vessels has its closest parallels in poetry where objects are compared to human beings, resemble them physically, or talk and laugh like men. Ibn al-MuCtazz, for instance, talks about the filled wine glass in his hand as if it were a bride wearing a girdle of moist pearls.51 Similarly, Abu Nuwas compares the goblet with the image of a young woman who has painted her face and has pearls around her neck.52 In another verse he likens an old wine jar to an old woman with gray hair from whom he snatches the wine.53 Objects also talk and laugh. Nizami, in his Romance of Khusraw and Shirin, animates the bottles by making them address the young king, wishing him continuous enjoyment in life. "The bottles filled with rubies from the hand of the saqi smilingly said: May this your life endure. "54 Similarly Abu Nuwas, who was also copied by al-Nuwayri, makes the glass laugh and compares it to a gazelle-like boy.55 The notion that objects can talk and laugh comes up again in inscriptions that figure on ceramic and metal vessels. These inscriptions are phrased as if they were put into the mouth of the vessels: they advise the holder how to use it, wish him good health, or eulogize its qualities. For instance, an early-eighth-century ewer advises the holder to sprinkle with it.56 A mid- thirteenth, probably north Mesopotamian, incense burner relates to its function by saying, "Inside me is hellfire, but without dissemination of odors."57 The Jerusalem bottle from Gurgan (fig. 17) asks the user to drink to his health (ishrab haniyyan mariyyan), and a series of tenth- and eleventh-century ceramic dishes have the phrase, kul haniyyan mariyyan, "eat to your health," written across their inner surface.58 Some of the richly decorated twelfth- and thirteenth- century habbs are inscribed with the name of the artist. Yet only one specimen, an early-fourteenth-century, probably Ilkhanid, late-comer of its kind, carries an inscription that appears to be coming from its mouth and praises the healing qualities of its water. "I quench the thirst of mankind," the habb then continues to say. 94</page><page sequence="13">JEWELED CERAMICS FROM MEDIEVAL ISLAM "This I achieve by virtue of my sufferings on the day I was cast among the fiery flames."59 Finally the artist of a Mesopotamian silver and gold inlaid penbox draws attention to the beauty of his product by putting the following laudatory phrase into its mouth: if the duration of my time were one day, my beauty would have no constant value. I am the single gem of the time, and there is no gem like me.60 Comparative studies of ideas expressed in poetry and visual art might shed some light on the significance of ornament, its transfer from one medium into another, and its function. In the case of jeweled ceramics we can conclude with two observations. One is that the substitution of cheaper pottery for precious jewelry and jewelry techniques was presumably a way of making an object more valuable, thereby also raising the status of its owner. The other is that artists, like poets, seem to have perceived inanimate objects as living beings. These observations can, I believe, be verified once social, literary, and art historians have put their minds to these questions. Tel Aviv University Tel Aviv, Israel NOTES 1.
