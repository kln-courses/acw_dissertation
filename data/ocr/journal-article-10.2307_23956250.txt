<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE USE OF ANALOGY IN CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY WHAT is analogy ? Bishop Berkeley1 in one of his dialogues gave a clear answer. 'Every one knows', he said, 'that analogy is a Greek word used by mathematicians to signify a similitude of proportions. For instance, when we observe that two is to six as three is to nine, this similitude or equality of proportion is termed analogy. And, although proportion strictly signifies the habitude or relation of one quantity to another, yet, in a looser and translated sense, it hath been applied to every other habitude; and consequently the term analogy comes to signify all similitude of relations or habitudes whatsoever.'1 The prevalence of this looser use is acknowledged in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary which defines 'analogous' as meaning 'similar in attributes, circumstances, relations, or uses'. A recent example of this wider use is in a sentence from the first volume of Professor Tillich's Systematic Theology (p. 226) where he writes : 'Consequently, theology does not surrender its independence when it uses philosophical terms which are analogous to terms which religion has used for ages in pre rational, imaginative language.' Accepting provisionally the loose definition of analogy as meaning some kind of similitude, we may begin by considering the circumstances in which similitudes are observed. There must be an observer to make the observation. Without an observer, there can be no analogy in the sense of a mental act of observing the similitude. No similitude can be observed unless there are at least two objects within the field of observa tion. There can be no comparison where there are not at least two things to be compared. No act of observation or comparison is made without some degree of attention. We may not be paying very much attention but we must be paying some. When our attention is very superficial, we may not consciously notice any particular similitudes in the field of our attention. In fact, the most commonplace similitudes are likely to be ignored just because they are so commonplace. We par ticularly notice a similitude when it has for some reason arrested our attention. We may, for example, be in doubt whether there is a genuine repetition of what we had seen earlier. We may be asking whether the second thing is authentically similar to the first thing. We may be asking whether we may rightly say that the second thing is another instance 1 Alciphron or the Minute Philosopher, 1732 {The Works of George Berkeley, ed. Luce and Jessop, iii, 1950, p. 169). [Journal of Theological Studies, N.S., Vol. VII, Pt. 2, October 1956]</page><page sequence="2">USE OF ANALOGY IN CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY 227 of the first thing. Our concern here is to make a correct definition. We already know what we mean by an 'X' and we are in doubt whether the second thing may rightly be called an 'X'. We want to know whether to call it an 'X' or not. I think that this process of definition is analogical in the sense that we are observing similitudes, but I do not think that it illustrates the most typical meaning of analogy. Analogical thinking is more than classification. It is more than the activity of placing the objects of our experience in a number of prepared mental containers. Its meaning is not exhausted in the process of sorting things according to genus and species. Typical analogy has a more venturesome and ex ploratory character. We approach more closely to the typical use of analogy if we consider the situation when we find ourselves curiously unable to classify what is being observed. It is neither quite like nor quite unlike anything which we have known before. It is not immediately plain what it is. We are in a state of hesitation. We have a sense of liberation if we can suggest that it is something like something which we have observed previously. We have a sense of making progress if we can say that it is like something else which we know more plainly. The obscure is explained in terms of what is plain. It bears some analogy to what we know already. It is analogous to something which is more plainly known. In fact, all explanation is more or less analogical. In each act of explanation the choice of the plain thing may have been obvious and almost immediate but it was not a groundless choice. The plain thing was chosen because it was plain. Other things were rejected because they were plainly not of use as analogical terms. They were seen to be virtually useless for one of two reasons. They were either too similar to the thing to be explained or too dissimilar. If they were too similar they simply repeated an obscurity which they failed to explain. It is no use explaining one pin by analogy with another pin, if they are admitted to be as like as two pins. If they are too dissimilar, the two things are so unlike as not to be natur ally comparable with one another. It is more natural to say that some thing is as heavy as lead rather than that it is as heavy as aluminium, even though aluminium is not without weight. The appropriate analogy is always somewhere between a complete reaffirmation and a complete denial of the thing to be explained. It may be said to move in the twilight between the daylight of affirmation and the night of negation. It is natural for analogical thinking to be perpetually in motion. It approaches without touching the limits of unqualified affirmation and unqualified negation. In attaining either it would cease to be analogy. But between these two points there is a wide range in which analogies may be of greater or lesser appropriateness. Analogies differ in effectiveness.</page><page sequence="3">228 G. F. WOODS We discriminate between them. We discard those analogies which prove disappointing. This process of selection follows a regular rhythm. Confidence is followed by diffidence. Trust in analogy is followed by distrust. Faith weakens into scepticism. But each movement stimulates a contrary movement. When increasing diffidence reaches the point of a complete loss of confidence, a reaction occurs and restores some measure of what has been lost. It is a dialectical movement. There is an endless oscillation. By its very nature analogy cannot reach a point of final stability. When confidence is high, diffidence will return and when diffidence is prevailing, confidence will begin to rise again. We acknow ledge the fluctuating character of analogies by calling them strong or weak, sound or unsound, pure or impure, clear or obscure, close or dis tant, exact or loose, deep or superficial, true or misleading, happy or unhappy, appropriate or inappropriate, and accurate or inaccurate. The variety of these adjectives illustrates the tentative character of analogical thinking. Each pair of adjectives is, in fact, an analogy to explain the meaning of analogy. We prefer one set of adjectives to another because the situation to which it refers happens to be plainer to us than the other analogical situations. They are all rather like arrows shot at a target. Some are closer to the bull's eye than the others. One which is too far to the right is followed by a shot which is too far to the left. If the analogical arrow struck the centre of the target, it would cease to be analogical. But immediately doubts are justifiably arising in our minds whether this toxophilitic analogy is quite appropriate. It could never be so without ceasing to be an analogy. It is quite understandable that the rationalist should be hostile to the use of analogies in reasoning except as an interim policy. He prefers to manipulate clear and distinct ideas which are in clear and distinct rela tions to one another. Analogical thinking lacks the final clarity which he desires. He naturally distrusts a form' of thinking which appears to blur the distinction between likeness and unlikeness. He can see no passage for his logical ship between the Scylla of Ά' and the Charybdis of 'Not-A'. He suspects that he is being asked to follow a via media which is so narrow as to have no breadth at all. His disposition is, therefore, to treat analogy as a transitory situation in which the similarities and dis similarities included in the analogy have not been fully analysed and noted. The distasteful logical vagueness is removed if the analogy is re duced to a list of specific points on which the two things are like or un like. I can easily appreciate this desire to eliminate the vagueness and indefiniteness from analogical thinking, but I am very doubtful whether this procedure discloses the most typical meaning of analogy. The heart of a typical analogy is a similitude which is not reducible to a number of</page><page sequence="4">USE OF ANALOGY IN CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY 229 points of correspondence and difference. I think that an irreducible analogical character permeates even the selected points of similarity and dissimilarity. For example, if the work of the Prime Minister is compared to that of a ship's pilot, it is plain that both are engaged in guiding some thing, but the actual process of guiding in each case is only analogous. We do not grasp the meaning of the analogy if we begin to take a number of points for exact comparison, e.g. the Prime Minister watches the currents of public opinion whereas the pilot watches currents in the sea. The similitude between their respective duties is analogical, but it is not a balancing of points on which their work is precisely similar or precisely dissimilar. I see no way in which analogical thinking can ever be accept able to the rationalist. It will always remain intractable and repugnant. Its use, whether as a form of explanation or as a form of proof will always be less satisfying than the thinking which is limited to the manipulation of ideas which are believed to be, or are designed to be, patient of a purely logical treatment. The only rational justification of the use of analogy is that it is unavoidable. The use of analogy is more congenial to the empirically minded who are ready to accept the facts of human experience even when they im pede a purely rational understanding of the world. The empiricist believes that if there are brute facts in the world which resist rational explanation, we must simply accept them. We cannot get rid of them by saying that they are repugnant to the kind of thinking which we consider to be the purest form of thought. We must be ready to use any kind of thinking which helps to make our world more easily understood. The empiricist is, therefore, not disposed to depreciate or to reject analogical thinking on the ground that it does not fulfil the stringent requirements of purely rational thought. We may be in the position of beggars who cannot be choosers. But the empiricist who wishes to test the meaning and truth of statements by appeal to experience is naturally extremely doubtful about the use of analogy outside the limits of possible human experience. He can admit its value in matters which are open to empirical verification but he is likely to be hostile to its use in any remoter realms. He suspects that it is a kind of india-rubber tape-measure which is used to measure things which are longer than its genuine length. In short, the rationalist feels that the principle of contradiction is threatened and the empiricist feels that the principle of empirical verification is menaced. Within the limits of possible human experience the use of analogy is commonplace and unchallenged. I have already spoken of the use of analogy in acts of explanation which consist in drawing an analogy between two things within experience when one is plainer than the other. In this use, both things fall within the actual field of my observation or</page><page sequence="5">230 G. F. WOODS within the field actually observed by myself and the person to whom I am offering the explanation. I am making quite a fresh use of analogy when I employ it to conceive a situation which lies outside the limits of my present experience. In this case, I am using analogy to support my belief in the existence of something outside my own experience and to develop my idea of the thing which I believe to be in existence. For in stance, if I may take a not very solemn example, I may wish to write to the stationmaster at Mablethorpe. Now, I have never visited Mable thorpe and I know no one who has. My reason for not hesitating to address a letter to the stationmaster is that I see from the map that this town stands on the railway and my experience has always been that towns on the railway have stations and stationmasters. Strictly speaking, I am not entitled to say that there 'must' be a stationmaster there, because the contrary is not unthinkable; and even if there is usually a stationmaster there, the day on which I happen to write may be an interregnum between two appointments. I might do better to address my letter to the 'Stationmaster or the acting-stationmaster'. But my whole action is based upon my confidence that one railway station is analogous to another. I have no need to know the number of platforms or the shape of the buildings at Mablethorpe. It is sufficient to believe that there is the usual sort of railway station with the usual officials. This use of analogy to pass beyond the limits of actual experience is so widespread as to be virtually unnoticed. We are continually making decisions which depend upon nothing more reliable than analogical knowledge. We should perish without it. To continue to live we have to assume that the means and conditions of remaining alive will be analogous in the future to what they have been in the past. We cannot verify empirically the results of an action which has not yet taken place. We live and continue to live by going beyond the limits of our actual experience. If we sacrificed this use of analogy we should soon sacrifice our lives. We are bound to venture by analogy beyond the frontiers of our immediate experience. But it is essential to notice that this does not usually mean going beyond the limits of possible human experience. I may gain my initial belief in the existence of the stationmaster at Mablethorpe by the use of analogy, but my belief is confirmed when I receive a reply to my letter or when I later have the opportunity of meeting him. My use of analogy has not transported me beyond the limits of possible human experience but only beyond the limited scope of my present experience. It has not endowed me with any superhuman powers. The misgivings of the empiricist arise when he believes that analogy is being used to give an appearance of transcending the natural limits of human experience. He can agree that analogy may be a useful device for</page><page sequence="6">USE OF ANALOGY IN CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY 231 making the best use of our powers, but he denies that it can endow us with powers which we do not possess. Like a telescope it is useful to those who possess the power of sight but useless to those who are blind. The extreme empiricist believes that we are imprisoned within the limits of possible experience. Within the prison we are free but we are not free to leave the prison. The analogical key may open many doors inside the prison but it cannot open any door opening upon a world outside. Our notions of a world outside and of ways of escaping to that world are all constructed by analogy from the prison life of our experience. We may by analogy construct worlds beyond experience but we can have no ade quate grounds for believing that any such world exists and probably have no genuine power of comprehending any such world. We can paint windows upon the walls of our cells but these painted illustrations admit no light from any external world of freedom. Some empiricists would deny that there is any transcendent world to be known. Others would say that there is no conclusive evidence either way. And others would say that the whole procedure of posing the question and of giving an answer is no more than a ghostly repetition of the kind of questions and answers which have their proper meaning only within the limits of everyday con versation about everyday things. We may be giving meaningless answers to questions which have no meaning. If this be the truth about our human situation, analogy has no use either in leading us towards a belief in God or in enabling us to speak about God, if we become per suaded that he exists. What can the analogist say in his defence against these criticisms which are made by extreme rationalists and empiricists? I believe that his defence of analogy must consist in denying the power of rationalism to comprehend the real world and in inviting the empiricist to consider the whole range of human experience. I think that the analogist can make no compromise with the extreme rationalist. He must point out the defects of rationalism as a way of reaching the truth about the actual world. He must make a number of direct criticisms of its adequacy. It cannot by the exercise of pure thought distinguish between thoughts which do and thoughts which do not correspond with facts. It is not possible to prove the existence of anything by including existence in its definition. No thing can be necessary by the same kind of necessity which logically binds a conclusion to its proper premisses. There is no logically necessary being. Between the thought of a thing and a thing there is an irreducible distinction. The thing simply is not our thought about it. In thinking of a thing as a 'thing' we are already in danger of failing to do justice to its unique individuality. The particular thing is becoming no more than an instance of thinghood. Reason does not</page><page sequence="7">232 G. F. WOODS comprehend the individual and the unique. If the thing is changing, rational thought tends to reduce the flow of change to a series of momen tary states which are themselves unchanging. If two things are changing in relation to one another, the rationalist has a natural inclination to think that all forms of change must ultimately be reducible to logical change. Causality becomes logical implication. Reason is incapable of comprehending the genuinely novel. What appears to be new is under stood as some kind of reformulation of what was already in existence. Reasoning can establish no values as final. I believe that all its manifold déficiences are most manifest in its inability to comprehend the truth about human personality. It is plain that a criticism of rationalism is not a direct defence of analogy but, if the criticisms are well founded, the authority of the rationalist criticism is reduced. A decision to use analogy cannot be prohibited on the ground that in rationalism we already possess a way of thinking about the world of our experience which is known to be satisfactory. The discussion with the empiricist is perhaps a more serious matter. It is no use giving an answer which has no meaning for him. The only kind of defence which is acceptable to him is an appeal to experience. I think that the analogist should accept this challenge to appeal to experience and seek to show that it is just the appeal to experience which compels him to use analogy. Having rejected rationalism he should try to show that he is loyal to a true empiricism. If the appeal is to be to human experience, how can we know the limits of human experience ? This is a question of fact. It cannot be settled by any appeal to an idea of what these limits must be. We can settle the limits of ex perience only by an appeal to experience. This is easier said than done. Whose experience is to be accepted as genuine? How do I experience the experience of others ? To what extent can I enter into the experiences of those who are no longer living? How can we know that the limits of human experience have already been reached? I can see no way of obtaining indubitably final answers to these and similar questions. But the difficulty of appealing to human experience is no sufficient reason for not making the appeal if there is no alternative. I think that we must con centrate our attention in this inquiry upon a single issue, namely: Is there anything in human experience which may rightly be called an experience of the transcendent ? If we define the transcendent as what lies beyond the limits of human experience, the question is already settled. We cannot experience what is defined as being beyond experi ence. This is as obvious as the affirmation that it is impossible to eat what is inedible. We cannot preclude the possibility of experiencing what is called the transcendent by including in its definition the quality</page><page sequence="8">USE OF ANALOGY IN CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY 233 of being beyond human experience. No definitions must prevent the appeal to experience. I think the most appropriate appeal is to religious experience. No one has the right to forbid a religious man appealing to his religious experience. But such an appeal will have little weight with an empiricist who says quite sincerely that he has no such experience. He can respect the appeal but it makes no direct appeal to him. It is more satisfying to appeal to an experience which is shared by all those taking part in the discussion. I shall, therefore, appeal to sensible experience and moral experience. I have no doubt that I have sensible experience. I believe that others share this experience but I cannot share their experience in the sense of being able to occupy precisely the standpoint which they occupy. I appeal to this sensible experience to determine whether a physical·thing is in existence or not. I make some kind of test to allow the physical thing to give some sensible evidence of its presence. I have no doubt that physical things exist. When I observe them carefully I find that even within the limits of my own experience many of these things are transitory. They come into existence and they pass out of existence. They change and decay. In calling them existent or 'outstanding', I am expressing my sense that they may relapse into that out of which they came. They visit rather than dwell in the realm of the sensible. I experience in them a lack of self-sufficiency. They suggest to me that they owe their existence to some power which is other than their own. I believe that the traditional Thomist arguments for the existence of God direct our attention to this transitoriness of sensible things. They may be interpreted as not strictly arguments but rather as occasions chosen to evoke this sense of the need to postulate a foundation or ground below the diverse patterns of the changing world. It is not their purpose to define some things as dependent and to conclude that this logically implies the existence of other things which are not depen dent. They are invitations to experience the way in which a contempla tion of the changing world leads to the conviction that there must be some source of change which is ultimate. I think that I can in some measure share this experience. A contemplation of any actual course of change leaves me with the impression that that what is changing cannot consist entirely of entities which are devoid of any power to change themselves. I feel compelled to believe that there is some kind of un changing basis of change or some kind of source of change which is not derived from some previous source. I find myself unable to dispense with the notion that the sensible world has some kind of ground or basis which is not dependent upon any profounder ground or basis. My awareness of this, metaphysical realm is not the same as my awareness of</page><page sequence="9">234 G· F· WOODS physical objects. I do not see the world ground through gaps between the things which compose the physical world. It is not like a boy catching a glimpse of a football match by looking through the chinks in the fence. Nor is it a matter of finding one wholly transparent thing through which I can see a sensible foundation of the sensible world. The world ground in which I believe is not a slightly smaller reproduc tion of the physical world which is just below the surface of the sensibly experienced world. I do not think of it by using images taken without qualification from the realm of sensible things. I can only speak of it by analogy. If I am to say anything, I am bound to speak analogically. In referring to a 'First Cause' or 'First Mover' or 'Unmoved mover' or 'World-ground', I am using analogies which are neither wholly satis factory nor wholly unsatisfactory. I use them with the usual fluctuation between confidence and diffidence. I am using analogy, not to go beyond my experience, but to describe an experience which I have. Though many people would be willing to say that they have no ex perience which they can call religious, I suppose that few would deny having some kind of experience which they would call moral. Inter pretations of this experience differ. To appeal to experience is the only way of discovering what it is. In giving my own version, I may not be speaking for others but I have good probable grounds for believing that I do. I feel that I am under an obligation to be other than I am. I am conscious of a duty to do and a duty not to do certain acts. I know that I fail in my duty. I have an immediate sense of guilt when I fail. I can not believe that it was not possible for me to do my duty. The experience which I call moral includes all these particular experiences. Emotion is present in all of them but it is not the whole truth to say that they are emotional. My moral experience is more than the historical fact that I am having it. Making a moral response to a moral problem is doubtless a fact of history, but I believe the fact to be not only a fact but a morally justified fact. My action is corresponding or failing to correspond with a moral standard which I cannot alter. In my moral experience I believe that I am in touch with some kind of moral law which is other than the actual course of historical events but not irrelevant to them. I cannot identify this moral law with any state of things in this present world. Others may dismiss this experience as having no general signifi cance, but I am myself compelled to believe in a moral realm which is known in and through the fact of moral experience. I cannot visualize this realm. I cannot use images to represent it. I am bound to use analogies which are drawn from the world of historical experience and use such words as 'law', 'obligation', and 'categorical imperative'. I am not using analogy to discover a realm beyond my experience but to</page><page sequence="10">USE OF ANALOGY IN CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY 235 describe the experience of being in touch with a moral realm which is other than the actual course of events. Its use is justified empirically but does not provide the justifying experience. The Christian tradition of belief in God is a classic instance of the belief that human experience cannot accept the transitory realm of physical and historical facts as ultimate. The Christian theologian knows that he is bound to speak of the divine in analogical terms drawn from his experience of the present world. But if the use of analogy in theology is inevitable, there is no need to use it carelessly. This duty is equally present in natural and revealed theology. For centuries theolo gians, both Christian and non-Christian, have studied the nature of analogical predication and sought to elucidate the proper and improper use of words in statements about God. All are agreed that our language is primarily relevant to this world and cannot be applied without quali fication to God. All are agreed that statements about God are not entirely without meaning. Words about God and man are not being used in precisely the same sense nor are they so devoid of meaning that it is a matter of indifference what words are used. Both the univocal and the equivocal uses of words in theology are rejected. If theological state ments are made they must be analogical. The duty of theologians is to make a right choice of terms and to use the chosen terms rightly. I believe that our choice of terms is limited and that our use of these terms is beset with many problems. If we choose to say that God 'is', we are bound to think that he 'is' in a way comparable to the way in which some thing 'is' which is known to us. We cannot but choose the minimal terms which we use when we believe that we are thinking of something which is in existence. The thing which we take to be in existence must have at least sufficient character to be more than nothing. If we say that God 'is', I believe that we are already making the judge ments about his existence which we make when we say that a thing 'is', without saying in any further detail what it is. In thinking that God 'is' we attribute to him the basic requirements which any thing has in order to be a thing at all. I believe that even these terms are used analogically. If we are to advance to any ampler statements about him, we must think of his being in terms which have meaning for us. But the only kind of being which is known to us is personal being. We are persons and we understand as persons. Personal being is the chosen source of our theological analogies because we have no other choice. Hobson as a theologian has to submit to his own type of choice in choosing terms for analogical use. But within the range of our experience of personal being, it is our duty to select the terms which are analogically least inadequate. No experienced theologian advocates physical anthropomorphism but</page><page sequence="11">236 G. F. WOODS all use various forms of personal anthropomorphism. This may be in dividual or social. The terms may be drawn from our notions of the structure and working of human personality or from social situations in which a number of personalities are engaged. These social or historical analogies possess a convenient multiplicity of meaning because we can modify the relevance of the analogy by moving our attention from one figure to another. We can imagine ourselves as agents or patients or spectators. Our mobility of standpoint enables us to exploit the manifold potentialities of the analogical model. The Christian analogist makes a further selection of terms out of the whole range of his experience of personal activity, whether individual or social. He naturally chooses those terms which are compatible with the Christian view of God. Christ is the criterion of Christian analogies. But intricate questions arise even concerning the use of acceptable terms. This is not surprising. The reason is that no man can occupy a stand point from which he can survey both God and man. There is no third standpoint open to him from which he can study the operation of selected analogies. He cannot cease to be man and he is not God. He must think about God analogically and he must think analogically of the use of analogy in Christian theology. I see no likelihood of attaining any com pletely satisfactory explanation of the use of analogy between God and man. The fundamental difficulty concerns the 'analogy of being' between them. If there is no kind of similitude, there is no basis for analogy. If there is complete similitude, the final result is to understand God as human or Man as divine. Neither of these conclusions is acceptable to a Christian. Manifold efforts have been made to understand the com munity of being between God and man in such a way as to avoid these results. It is natural to explain this analogy of being by reference to analogies of being which are observable in the world of our present experience. It is, for example, a common practice to apply the adjective 'healthy' both to a man and to a town. But the state of health is attri buted directly to the man and indirectly to the town. Only the man is properly called 'healthy'. The town may be health-giving but it is not 'healthy' as the man is healthy. The adjective is properly attributed only to man. This kind of analogy is often used as an analogy for the way in which a similar quality may be attributed to God and man. It is an analogy of proportion. Some quality such as 'wisdom' is taken to be properly applicable only to man or only to God. Its application to the other member in the similitude is only made with some qualification. If wisdom has its true meaning in man, 'wisdom' in God must mean something rather different. But how is this difference to be understood ? The intention is to say that God is wiser than man. This greater wisdom</page><page sequence="12">USE OF ANALOGY IN CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY 237 may be understood as the perfection of what man possesses imperfectly. But, as God is more than man, it is not enough to say that God has human wisdom in its perfection. He is, therefore, sometimes called 'super-'wise or 'eminently' wise. But what meaning have these words? They are only a negation of the usual meaning of wisdom with the positive intention of saying that God is so 'wise' that he cannot adequately be called 'wise' in the ordinary sense of the word. It has also been said that God is 'virtually' wise, in the sense that he is the 'cause' of all wisdom. But it is by no means plain what 'virtual' wisdom means. What is a 'cause' of wisdom ? If it only means that human wisdom is an im perfect reproduction of divine wisdom, we do not know how it is re produced in us and we do not know whether divine wisdom is the perfection of our own or something which is 'more' than human wisdom. If we lose confidence in our power to understand in what sense divine wisdom is 'more' than our own, we can say that we use the word 'wise' of God only because the alternative is to remain silent. We con tinue to affirm our faith in the thing signified, but we have almost lost confidence in the adequacy of our mode of signification. It is not easy to make this type of affirmation without coming perilously near to the admission that we cannot say whether God is 'wise' or not. The affirmation that God is 'wise' has almost been transformed into a denial of 'wisdom' in God. There is a similar movement in the negative state ments towards the unexpected affirmation of their affirmative elements. 'God is not mortal', does not mean that he may die in a manner which is unlike human death. It means analogically that he lives for ever. I think that these examples show the way in which the analogy of pro portion begins to show weaknesses when it is used in Christian theology. A slightly more hopeful line is to look for some occasion within our experience when we attribute the same quality to several things without meaning that it is improperly or only indirectly applied to any of them. Such a term permits some kind of difference between its various applica tions without suggesting that it is inappropriately applied except in a single case. We have experience of using words in this way. For example, we say that a plant is 'living', an animal is 'living', and that a man is 'living'. It is intended to attribute 'life' to each of them, without sug gesting that only one is truly alive. They all mean the same thing differently. This type of analogy, which is called the analogy of pro portionality, is often used in theology. It is an attempt to preserve the full vitality of meaning in any term which is applied analogically to God and man. For instance, it is legitimate to say that God is 'wise' in his own way and that man is 'wise' in his own way. Wisdom may be genuinely ascribed to both. To attribute 'wisdom' to one does not deny 'wisdom'</page><page sequence="13">238 G. F. WOODS in the other. There is a proportionality between the divine and the human possession of 'wisdom'. It is the same type of analogy which affirms that the 'being' of God and the 'being' of man are neither so dissimilar as to be incomparable nor so similar as to deny the divinity of God or the humanity of man. Both are in 'being' in such a manner that the 'being' of neither is denied. This analogy of being is not rightly understood as indicating a number of types of being because we know of no principle beyond 'being' which enables us to make distinctions within it. There are many kinds of beings which all share analogously in 'being'. This kind of analogy is very fully examined and defended in a book entitled The Bond of Being, an essay on analogy and existence, by J. F. Anderson.1 The author claims that the analogy of proportionality is no mere verbal solution of the problem of speaking about God but a funda mental principle which we must accept if we are to make any statements about God. I think he shows that without this principle, our use of words in speaking of God is always liable to become univocal or equivocal. The possibility of using analogy in theology rests upon the metaphysical principle of the 'analogy of being'. My present conclusion is that we are bound to use analogy in Chris tian theology and that our confidence in the analogies which we use will perpetually rise and fall. It would, I think, be unfortunate if we allowed ourselves to move to either extreme and lapsed into analogical funda mentalism or sank into complete scepticism about the value of using any analogies at all.
