McMurray Oregon Stale University Berber Origins and the Politics of Ethnicity in Colonial North African Discourse More than once during our sojourn in the late 1980s in the migrant boomtown of Nador (90,000-plus Berber capital of northeastern Morocco) we heard people casually comment that Nadoris emigrated to Germany and Holland in such numbers because the Germanic Languages and Tamazight (or Berber) languages were so similar. Linguistic closeness made it easy for the emigrants to learn German and Dutch. On other occasions people mentioned that the cross design tattooed on the foreheads or chins of some older women were souvenirs of the Christian era in Berber North Africa. The presence of lighter skinned children in scattered families throughout the Rif mountains of the north provided further proof, said the locals, of the ancient ties that bound the Rif to Europe One local school teacher even told us ,Vw". his tribal region of Kebdana got its name from a legend about the Roman goddess Diana losing her dog ("Kelb" in Arabic) in the mountains of the area, hence "kelb Diana" or Kebdana. We propose in this paper to provide some political context for these pan Mediterranean Berber ethnic origin legends. First, we want to argue that what appear to the Nadoris as unmediated evidence of an ancient affiliation are more likely popular memory traces or common sense explanations which draw indirectly on a peculiar variety of French and Spanish colonial discourse on North Africa which for over a century did in fact posit the same European connections believed in by locals today and did promote some of the same items mentioned above as evidence. We think of this particular strain of colonial discourse as "peculiar" because, even though it followed the now familiar colonial discursive conventions and allied a body of knowleHo.e with the West's greater power in the world in such a way so as to construct the Other (the Berber, in this case) and make it real" and "true," this line of colonial discourse actually emphasized the familiarity and nearness of "the Berber" - at times even advocating assimilation to the West. On the surface this would seem to fly in iiie face of Said's (1978) famous description of European colonialism as the unremitting Orientalization of the Orient, that is, the continuously dcfamilianzing inscription of nonWestern lands and peoples as lacking, as lesser, as naturally inferior and subordinate. As we will discuss shortly, however, the interest in a potential common Berber/European heritage and the elevation of this colonized people to "civilized" status was</page><page sequence="2">Page 40 entertained at the expense of the Arabs of the colonies who were the ultimate target of the strategy of divide, debase and conquer. We also in this paper want to try to answer why Nadoris show an interest in northern origins now, why there might be a need at present to wonder about such things. Here we will suggest that Nadori Berbers keep legendary colonial currency in circulation because they themselves are presently involved in establishing more durable grounds upon which to claim an autonomous ethnic identity. They seem to be actively interpreting the Moroccan state's quotidian prédations and the harassment of Nadoris by agents of the state as in great part an ethnic conflict pitting the community of northern Berbers against the And» of the Moroccan interior who control the state apparatuses. Interior Arab nationalists reciprocate by denying the bases for any claims to a pluralistic Moroccan national identity. Ironically and as mentioned above, this division draws some of its nourishment from roots sunk keep in the history of North African colonization. A final note before beginning: we seek by way of this investigation of Berber origins to illustrate the importance of historical anthropological studies of colonial discourses because of the way they help uncover "the informal continuities between the colonial past and the new world order present" (Dirks 1992:5). We hope to demonstrate Dirks' point that, "the postcolonial world is one in which we may live after colonialism but never without it. Colonialism continues to live on in ways that perhaps we have only begun to recognize" (Dirks 1992:23). Early French Colonial Discourse in Algeria The pre-conquest French reports concerning the Berbers of Algeria were not in fact very positive, according to Ageron.1 However, several factors intervened after the conquest which led to a change. First, the Berber speaking population of Kabylia (the biggest Berber area in Algeria) did not join the Arabic speaking population in its ferocious resistance to the French in the decades after the conquest of 1830. Secondly, during the decade I860 to 1870 the settler-colonialists (colons) became increasingly frustrated with what they considered to be the too pro-Arab policies of the government of Napoleon III (Morsy 1985:155-157). The government's agents, the native affairs officers of the Arab Bureaux, were seen by the settlers to be sympathetic towards Algerians and Islam and supportive of the Arab tribal chiefs at the expense of the settlers. Furthermore, many of the officers were aristocratic</page><page sequence="3">Page 41 royalists while the settlers were overwhelmingly republican. The settlers thus agitated for an end to military rule, Islamic law and the role of Arab notables, and the establishment of civilian rule and settler domination (Burke 1980.81-82). Most importantly, they wanted the tribes dissolved and their lands confiscated (Ageron:316). To do this the colons, led by their chief ideologue, Dr. Warnier, began an anti-Arab, anti-Islamic campaign based on a strategy of celebrating the Berbers at the expense of the Arabs. The former were now presented as sha&gt;.ng in the European heritage, even if somewhat submerged, while the latter embodied all that Europe stood against. Ageron quotes Warnier as follows: The Berbers are ancient Christians, Isiamized as little as possible ... almost all of them have crosses tattooed on their foreheads or one of their cheeks. They arc ruled by the Kanouns2 the word itself revealing a Roman or Christian origin . . . The Berbers of Djerdjéra seem quite disposed to a complete return to Christianity . .. (Cited in Ageron 1963:317) Warnier also held that where the Arab peasant is indolent, lacking in foresight and destructive, the Berber is attached to the soil and a veritable conservationist Equally in his favor is the fact that the Beiber practices monogamy for the most part and "the woman is a mother of the family and not a piecv of furniture or a beast of burden as in Arab society" (Cited in Ageron 1963:317). The themes of Berber industriousness, crypto-Christian religiousity, monogamy, an anti Islamic legal system, and probable European origins coalesced from its early polemical state into solid dogma, the Berber myth. The depth of belief in the myth is testified to by the fact that such an august figure as Renan weighed in on the side of the Berber myth in 1873 when he wrote. What we know of the constitution of the Gauls reminds us singularly of the social state of the Berbers . . .The qualities of the heart of the Berber race, their human spirit, their gentleness, explain the heroic and moving pages of African Christianity. (Cited in Ageron 1963:319) Earlier colonial policies of the Arab Bureaux that attempted to preserve sonic semblance of Arabo-lsiamic civilization were now recast as the odious work of Arabophilcs bent on Arabizing and Isiamizing the poor Kabyles (Agcron:320)</page><page sequence="4">Page 42 The Berber myth held captive the imagination of the Franco-Algerian public for close to thirty years. However, by the 1890s a new generation of Algerian-born colons started coming of age. They knew nothing of the old policies of the Second Empire. They cared only to distance themselves from the natives socially and to dominate them economically and politically. Arabs and Berbers were not so different after all. Neither deserved an education or appreciated civilization. The idea of ever succeeding at assimilating the Berbers came to be regarded as derisory, or at least Utopian (Ageron: 326-328). But as Ageron makes clear, the real point throughout the latter half of the century had always been first and foremost to divide and conquer. Even as the Berber myth receded in importance policies based on maintaining Arab-Berber distinctions remained. The Science of Divide and Rule Speculation on the origins of Berbers drew on several ideological motives for inspiration. Initially the purpose was to establish the pre-Arab sources of Berber culture. Soon, however, the ideologues sought to locate in prc-history the distinction between Berbers and Arabs. Observers sought also to ally the Berbers with the colonizers by suggesting Berbers came from the north and northwest, or at least that they issued from a Euro-Mediterranean stock and not an African or Semitic one. This ensured the Berbers' evolutionary superiority in relation to their Arab conquerors. Northern origins also had the advantage of suggesting that Berbers were suitable for assimilation to superior colonial societies, a policy put into practice on several occasions. In the end, however, we think interest in the search for distinct, non-African Berber origins stemmed from a combination of Eurocentric racism and a messianic Christian salvation impulse quickened by centuries of competition between Christian Europe and its Arabo-lslamic World Other. Even in more disinterested Anglo-American circles, studies supported northern origins from the Berbers.3 Ripley (1989) exemplified this tradition in his monumental study, The Races of Europe, where he showed little interest in "Blondism", as any sign of lighter skin, eyes or hair was then known (and attributed to northern contact), but came down generally on the side of European origins for Berbers. He writes that the earliest Europeans were thought to have been a dark complected, long-headed race:</page><page sequence="5">Page 43 The men of this epoch were not, to be sure, as diminutive as the modern south Italians or the Spaniards; they seem rather to approximate the medium height of the inhabitants of North Africa. These Berbers and their fellows, in fact, shading off as they do into the Negro race south of the Sahara, we must regard as having least departed from the aboriginal European type. And in Europe proper, the brunet long-headed Mediterranean race is but slightly aberrant from it. (Ripley 1899:466) Sixty-five years later, the famous American anthropologist, Carleton Coon, who spent several months measuring the heads of Berbers in the Moroccan Rif, reconfirmed Ripley's view of general, vague connections between Europe and North Africa. According to Coon: The third discrete racial element in Africa is the Caucasoid, which, as indicated earlier, first entered the continent in massive invasions about 15,000 years ago, certainly from Western Asia and possibly also from Europe The descendants of those invaders who are still fully or essentially Caucasoid are the Berbers. (Coon 1965:115) It is interesting to note that Coon did not consider Arabs and Berbers to be racially distinct They were both Caucasoid subgroups. What determined their differences in his schema were the multiple factors unique to their respective climatic zone of habitation Thus mountain dwellers (Berbers) were lighter skinned than desert dwellers (Arabs), and the latter when they moved to the cities, lightened up in the shadow of buildings, presumably 4 The Anglo-American tradition could afTord to be more vague and general about Berber origins. Their respective governments were not after all engaged in the direct conquest or administration of Berber regions. Not so with the Spanish, whose North African enclaves and designs on northern Morocco helped to whet their appetite for theories propounding Iberian origins for the Bcibcrs. Ruiz Albeniz agitated for the position concerning close racial affinities between Berbers and Spaniards in (he following excerpt: The famous and very wise anthropologist, don Manuel Anton Fcrrandi/ - a man who carried out extensive and solid anthropomorphic investigations &gt;n Morocco - assures that the Berbers form part of the great Libio-lbcrica race that constitutes</page><page sequence="6">Page 44 the base of the Spanish population. This race was later modified by sino-Arab elements, that is to say, by fusions with Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Arabs and Jews. For Seftor Ferrandiz, there is a complete racial identity between Berbersand Ligurians, Iberians and Basques. We arc decidedly inclined to agree with this assertion which we esteem to be of the greatest scientific foundation, instead of others, according to which the origin of the Berber race had to be found on the Asian continent. (Ruiz Albeniz 1930:57) Ruiz Albeniz hints here that he is aware of a school of thought that suggests more distant Aryan or Caucasian origins as opposed to a closer Iberian one for the Berbers. Such a theory was also widespread in France where LaMartiniire (1894-1897.257 fn. 1) cites Broca, inter alia, as proposing a pre-Aryan invasion of northerners as the origin of the Berbers. Obviously, then, the relation between powers directly involved in colonizing the Berbers and the degree of racial closeness in theories of the affinity between Berbers and (proto) Europeans is not a direct, one-to-one relationship. It is suggestive, however. Witness the Spaniard Fernandez's repetition of what must have been another common explanation for Berber "blondism" In the regions of Tafersit (Bern Ulichek) and Bern Touzzine, both of the Rif, it is usual to see individuals with almost saffron-colored hair, very light-skinned and freckle-faced that, it is supposed, are left over from the Vandal invasion in North Africa. (Fernandez 1911;166fn) The Vandal invasion as explanation for Berber origins appealed to the Germans as well as the Spaniards for obvious reasons. Auedenfeldt (1940:28-29) even went so far as to compare the Vandal-ized inhabitants of the Rif to the peasants of northern Germany of his day.5 Fernandez and Quedenfeldt make no attempt to claim any more than common sense opinions as authority for the assertion of Vandal origins of Berbers. Their "blondism" must signify their racial distinctness from their Arab and African cohorts; it must be a difference in need of an explanation. Why not assume it reflected earlier "European" conquests of the region?6</page><page sequence="7">Page 45 Sometimes nineteenth century science, common sense and missionary zeal found a single colonial host as in the case of Lt.-Colonel W.G Macpherson of the Royal An«y Medical Corps who made a voyage to Morocco in 1892. A report on his findings concerning Moroccan Berber origins was relayed by his friend, Dr. George Mackay, to the Third Pan Celtic Congress held in Edinburgh in 1907. Macpherson's report reveals the extremes which Eurocentric diffusionist racial theorists reached in their musings about North African origins. We quote him at length so as to convey a sense of these outer limits: But to speakers of Gaelic the most interesting fact connected with the Berber tribes is that they speak a language called Shloh or shluh, which a Gaclic-speaking medical missionary who had travelled amongst them in the Atlas mountains and Sus country told me he at once recognized as Celtic. Although he had no previous knowledge of it, and had no conception of its being allied to Gaelic, he found himself able to understand much of what was being said the first time he went amongst the tribes, solely on account of the resemblance of their language to his own Gaelic. There is still another interesting point. The tribes live a clan life, and are known by their clan names just as the Highlanders of our own country. They have feuds amongst themselves and unite against a common enemy. Some arc powerful and much feared by the Moors, and the best known have names that closely resemble the clan names of MacTier, Macdougall and Macghill; namely, the famous Berber clans of the MTir, the MTuga, and the M'Ghill, to give them their Arabic spelling. The Moors and Arabs speak of them as the Bini MTir, etc , but the 'Bini,' which is the Arabic for 'children,' is simply a reduplication of the sholh or Gaelic 'M' or Mac, having the same meaning. (Mackay 1907:120)7 French Ethnic Engineering in Morocco As the French conquest of Morocco proceeded in the years after 1912, the Berber myth migrated from Algeria to Morocco. Most of the French Bcrberists in Morocco got their start in Algeria so it was understandable that they would carry with them a sense that the constituent elements of the dominant discourse on the Berbers applied to Morocco as well (Burke 1972:193). Equally crucial to the adoption of the Berber myth in Morocco was the fact that the Middle Atlas Berber tribes put up such obstinate resistance to the French thai special arrangements for their pacification had to be worked out. These took the form of</page><page sequence="8">Page 46 guarantees that the tribes' submission would mean they could keep their customary law and the makhzan would not enjoy direct control over them (Burke 1972 195).* In practice the policy was the first step in the transformation of differences between Arabs and Berbers into a division which allowed the French to play one off against the other. As in Algeria, the Morocco Berbers were understood to be the original inhabitants of North Africa, barely Islamized, fiercely independent of the sultan's authority, relatively mild in their treatment of women, in short, candidates for French schooling, perhaps citizenship, certainly in need of protection from Arabo-Islamic influences (Burke 1972:I96-198).9 To that end Lyautey commanded that Moroccan Berbers were to evolve outside the purview of Islam.10 Furthermore, in 1924, his advisors determined that, "by destroying the unity of the Moroccan judicial system, the Berbers could be strengthened as a counterpoise to the city Arabs" (Brown 1972:206). The ultimate appeal to French colonial power of a division between Arabs and Berbers ~ and the attractiveness and utility of the colonial discourse on the Berbers which legitimized it - had once again surfaced. A former French official in Morocco stated the case this way in 1928: [It is] dangerous to allow the formation of a united phalanx of Moroccans having one language. We must utilize to our advantage the old dictum "divide and rule." The presence of a Berber race is a useful instrument for countering the Arab race. (quoted in Brown 1972:206 fit. 1) Around the same time the French began to recruit Berber soldiers and started strengthening the hand of rural Berber leaders by giving them land and appointing them caids, i.e. rural administrators accigiwt by the Interior Ministry. (Ben Kaddour 1972:260). Finally on May 16, 1930 the French administration passed on to the Sultan of Morocco for his signature the famous Dahir Berbère (a Dahir being a decree of the Sultan). Since it mainly expanded on the separate judicial system of the Berber tribes set up in 1914, the French underestimated the reaction it would create. But fueled by the hardships of the great depression, resentment had been building towards the French policies that privileged French education, attempted to divide the Moroccan people and most importantly, anger was building over the offenses perpetrated against Islam (Brown 1972:207-208). The Dahir</page><page sequence="9">Page 47 Berbère provided the torch that ignited the Moroccan nationalist movement in the weeks following it publication. The movement, begun amongst the young, uiban, Arab males of Salé, quickly became a mass nationalist movement. By the end of the summer of 1930, prayers in support of Moroccan resistance to French colonialism were being ofTered up throughout the Muslim world (Brown 1972:213). 'Alal al-Fasi, one of the main Figures of the Moroccan nationalist movement and one of the leaders of the resistance to the Dahir, quoted approvingly the following statement of a comrade concerning the crisis: In our resistance to the Betber policy we aim to bring closer together and then unite the groups composing the Maghrib nation; we want to fight the Machiavellian principle of division, which the military as well as the religious representatives of France are astutely fomenting; we want to prevent the creation of two blocs having two different cultures and conflicting interests artificially created; we want to secure freedom of conscience and of thought to all our citizens, (cited in Al Fasi 1970:125) The Berber ia Spanish Colonial Discourse Franco's rebellion (launched from northern Morocco) and the ensuing Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939 proved to be a great catalyst for the development of the Spanish discourse on the Berber along assimilationist lines.11 The paternalism of the local colonial press was modified in a direction that stressed the historical solidarity of the Spanish and the Rifls For example in the pages of El Telegrama del Rif a paper of note in Spanish Morocco, northern Moroccan inhabitants were no longer labeled "Moros" or "RifeAos," but "indigenas" or "Musilmanos" — even "Musilmanos Espafloles." References to a person's tribal or ethnic affiliation and the atomistic social structure implied were replaced by emphasis on a common heritage and monotheistic religiousity. El Telegrama del Rif stated that the "intimate fraternity" between Spaniards and Moroccans now reigning was the product of the "felicitous conjunction of the two races" in their mutual "struggle for high ideals" (15 Jan. 1937). Or again, a month later the paper printed the words of a "Mahometano"12 to Iiis fellow Spaniards: "We are brothers of race and blood and because of this we feel a familiar tenderness for you." (23 Feb. 1937)</page><page sequence="10">Page 48 Islamic holidays, which El Telegrama del Ä//barely acknowledged in a line or two in the 1920s and early 1930s, now commanded elaborate front page coverage with accompanying photo. The paper predicted that the celebration of the Eid el Kebir for 1937 "will be more brilliant than ever in this zone due to the service of Muslims to the beloved Patria, which every Muslim cmtsiders and loves as his own true Patria." (22 Feb 1937) The Spanish colonial authorities went so far as to use the pilgrimage to Mecca as a bonus for Rifi recruits, which revealed a level of solicitous sensitivity unheard of in previous years: The Spanish State is awarding with trips to Mecca "Moras" who make sacrifices for Spain. In Morocco there are already various hundreds who have signed up. Many of them if not for this initiative of the National Government would die without attaining this supreme aspiration of every good Muslim . . . With this the legitimate government of Spain recompenses the enormous sacrifices that the "Moros" make daily to defend our country which was once theirs and which now they admire and respect with such veneration. (I Jan. 1937) Note how the Moorish conquest of Spain was refashioned in the above quote to suggest that a kind of joint heritage bound the two peoples to one country. The impact of the legacy of Arab-Berber-Islamic civilization on Spain remains a contentious question even today, so it must have been doubly difficult during the colonial period to acknowledge that North Africans once ruled Spain. In fact, the Republicans fighting for Spain never entertained notions of fraternity and solidarity with North Africans. On the contrary, public fear and hatred of Moroccan troops reached almost hysterical levels during the war. "(I]t was enough...for someone to shout that the Moroccans were attacking for panic to spread." (Fraser 1979.257) The rebel Spanish ideologues represented the participation of Protectorate Moroccans in the Civil War as collaboration in a Holy War. They created a fictional scenario for the war in which the people of God were united in their common struggle against the atheists. The Moroccans themselves appear not to have acted from any such motives. On the contrary, the Spanish paid Moroccan recruits 200 pesetas ($26) as a sign-up bonus and 10 pesetas a day, plus loot. Some from Ifni were also paid with guns and ammunition. Much of the money involved appears to have been provided by the Germans who were repaid with iron</page><page sequence="11">Page 49 ore from the Ouiksan mines near Nador. Those northern Moroccan leaders who did not help in recruitment drives were jailed or shot. (Friedlander 1974:349-356) Some Moroccans did act on their idealistic principles, but not in the name of a common Holy War with the Spanish. They fought with Franco because he offered the Spanish Moroccan Protectorate greater autonomy - if not actual freedom - than the Republican government of Spain was willing to grant. Both sides were approached by ? group of Rifi separatists, but only Franco encouraged them. (Friedlander 1974:351-352) Postcolonial Ethnic Politics in Morocco In Morocco, according to Akouaou (1985:7-20), Berbers have never practiced an explicit "Berber politics" with an enunciated language and culture policy. They have never laid claim politically to more than a defensive legitimacy, though that allowed them to withstand French pacification efforts well into the 1930s. On the other hand, this left them playing the role of subordinate ally to the nationalist intellectuals who commanded the political high ground.13 The profound impact of the Salafiyya Islamic reform movement on tne Moroccan nationalists accounted for their emphasis on the Arabo-Islamic identity of the Moroccan nation in opposition to the French as well as to all nonorthodox discourses. No voice suggesting that the nation was anything but strictly unified could be tolerated, hence their violent opposition to the Dahir Berbere in 1930. In the immediate post-Independence period (late 1950s) the King, Muhammcd V, and his son, Hassan (since 1960, King Hassan II), found themselves in competition for power with the nationalist party, the Istiqlal. The party drew most of its support from urban bourgeois and petit bourgeois factions, particularly in Fez, and some medium-sized landlords. The Monarchy sought to establish its support mainly on the backs of the rural caids, many of whom were Berbers, and on the army, the majority of whose ofTicers were Berbers (Ben Kaddour 1972:263-264). This balance of power led the monarchy to support the creation of a Berber party so as to give some rural notables (Berber caids, etc.) official representation while also heading ofT the desire of Istiqlal (the original Moroccan nationalist political party) leaders to rule a single party state. The monarchy in this way also sought to maintain the rural status quo while presenting the appearance of fostering greater democracy</page><page sequence="12">Page 50 However, the party never adopted an explicit program beyond calling on its followers to rally around the king. (Ben Kaddour 1972:263-265) Arab-Berber differences exacerbated during the Protectorate were thus immediately reproduced during the early years of Independence. The fact that the predominantly rural Berber Army of Liberation and the urban Arab nationalist movement had mutually pursued and achieved Moroccan Independence did not lessen for long the ethnic tensions aroused by earlier Protectorate policies. The French themselves kept the pot stirred right up to their last gasp. Mikeseli (1961:33) reports that in September, 1956 a group called Présence Française put out a pamphlet exhorting Moroccan Berbers to rise up against "Arab imperialism." What is disheartening, as Akouaou again points out (1985:16-17), is that decades later the antagonism shown in political circles to discussion of the position of Berber language and culture in Morocco remains so strong. In 1980 a spokesman for the Moroccan Communist Party (PPS) denounced those who would champion a particular group's identity at the expense of the working class as a whole. The same year the socialist USFP party leaders split over the issue of whether vernacular languages should be taught in Morocco. The now moribund Mouvement Populaire (MP), the so-called Berber Party mentioned above14 continued into the 1980s to decline to express any Berber program of action. As a result their enemies tagged them as "Berberist," determining in the process what it meant, e.g. divisive, separatist, obstructionist, etc. The importance of the Berber component in a Nadori's identity is of course relative. Petty bourgeois and student circles appear in the recent past as well as the present to be the most actively involved in promoting Berber cultural and political associations. The Berber cottage industry in cassette music and the large Berber diaspora in Europe play no small role in promoting ethnic awareness across all class lines. Equally important for the heightening of Berber ethnic awareness was the savage repression of the 1984 riots in Nador. The soldiers' brutality had the king's blessing which was interpreted locally as the product of ethnic fear and hatred. Finally, the proximity to Nador of the Spanish enclave of Melilla, with its large, avowedly Berber population and ethnic politics, continuously influences Nadoris towards a greater awareness of "Berberness" as their ethnic identity.</page><page sequence="13">Page 51 Conclusion As we have tried to show, the place of the discourse on "the Berber" in the Maghreb has maintained its importance despite the end of direct colonial intervention. In the North African debates swirling around the question of the place of Berbers in Arab society, Berberists and Berber nationalists believe now more than ever in their right to identify a region and its inhabitants as Berber based on shared language, history and self identification. Denial of that right by various governmental agents (school teachers, historians, police, border guards, bureaucrats, etc.) registers with Berbers as an act of political violence. Going further, the organized, systematic denial of the validity of claims for Berber ethnicity are often interpreted by Berber nationalists as acts of political repression with cultural genocide as the ulterior motive. On the other side, anti-Berber state policies, practiced to a greater and lesser extent in Algeria and Morocco respectively, have a history and a basis in more than Arab chauvinism. Talk of ethnic divisions with the nation is treasonous to many Arab nationalists, and has been since the beginnings of the anti-colonial movements. Then as now those who declined to acknowledge patriotic adherence to Arabo-Islamic culture formed a fifth column inside the nation-state. Those who claimed that the nation was anything but strictly unified or who claimed that societal divisions existed were the dupes of the colonizer bent on undermining national consensus. Both Berber nationalists and anti-Berber Arab nationalists thus defend their positions by pointing to the unauthentic and illegitimate foundations of the other's position. We hope we have shown that these competitive interpretations rest to a great extent upon various discursive elements inherited from the systematic "observations" by colonial agents of North African Berbers over the last two centuries. These learned pronouncements formed a disorganized corpus wnich nonetheless had and has social "weight." We want to make one final important point: we do not mean to be condescending towards the process of heritage construction, it is part and parcel of the greater cthmcization of the tense relations between Nadoris and the Moroccan state. The bits and pieces of legend listed at the outset of this paper stand at one extreme end of the process Other lists could be made representing more learned, orthodox tendencies. But whatever the tendency, contemporary postcolonial communities such as the Imazighen of northern Morocco may</page><page sequence="14">Page 52 have nothing but colonially mediated pasts from which to construct communal identities. Thus as Shohat (1992:109) puts it, "the retrieval and reinscription of a fragmented past becomes a crucial contemporary site for forging a resistant collective identity." That this process could serve the Berber community without being anti-Arab or anti-nationalist is attested to by Moha ou Said Moukhlis, a Moroccan Berber activist who said recently that confiscated freedom and democracy were the real stakes in the struggle for linguistic and cultural diversity in Morocco. He goes on to make the very appealing claim that democratization of Moroccan social life cannot precede without diversification (Moukhlis 1992:7). Notes 1. This and what follows on the French discourse on the Berbers in Algeria is drawn principally from Ageron's (1%3) extraordinary article which I first saw referenced in Burke ( 1973) and for which 1 am grateful. 2. He is referring here to the Arabic word for law, Qanoun, and is drawing attention to its similarity in sound to the word "Canon." 3. Westermarck (1914:10), in keeping with Anglo scientific views, seems skeptical about the strength of the connection but goes along with a weak version of the European origins model. 4. Coon states, "It has been observed in Arabia and Morocco, which are bright, sunny places and hot in season, that most of the out-of-door people are bmnet except in foggy mountains such as the Rif. Indoor people, however, tend to a higher incidence of all three kinds of blondism The typical Fez shopkeeper seldom exposes his skin to the direct rays of the sun, and his eyes rarely meet brilliant sunlight. He spends his life in shaded shops, latticed streets, and protected courtyards." (Coon 1981.82-83) 5. He was not alone according to Toynbee (1927:107) who stated snidely that: "After the Rifts had begun to display their military prowess against Spanish and French troops, English and American antiquarians, informed of their 'Nordic physique', conjectured</page><page sequence="15">Page 53 that they were descendants of the Vandals or the Visigoths, who had survived to cross swords once again with the descendants of the Roman provincials. In reality, neither the Visigoths nor the Vandals, nor the Romans before them, had ever set foot in the Rif." 6. This logic still had appeal as late as 1977 when Brues (1977:285-286) leaned on it to explain reports of "blondism" in North Africa. 7. We once saw in the home of a Spanish teacher in Nador a pamphlet in Spanish purporting to show the affinities between the Basque and Berber languages. The supposed linguistic relationship was then used as proof of a single lost origin for these two "mysterious" populations. We failed to jot down the reference, alas, so that too has been lost. 8. A 1914 decree stated that "the tribes of the so-called Berber custom arc and will remain ruled and administered according to their laws and customs under the control of the authorities." (Quoted in Brown 1972:205) 9. A pro-assimilationist French administrator in Salé named P Moussard stated: " . . . less vain than the Arabs, less imbued with their claimed superiority over the Christians, the Berbers will be much more docile pupils for us . . something must be done so that. . . they become speakers of French and not of Arabic." (quoted in Brown 1982:206 fn.2) 10. The popular reaction to the manifestations of Lyautey's policy in the city of Sale were chronicled by Brown as follows: "In Salé itself, there was much suspicion when an Algerian convert to Christianity became one of the earliest French teachers and translators in the Berber-speaking areas of Salé's hinterland were Algerian Berbers who had converted to Christianity and that Berber translations of the New Testament were being distributed Many felt that there was a plot afoot. An Arabic biography of Jesus had found its way into many cities, and Christian missions boasted of their achievements among the Moroccans Particularly scandalous to the urban bourgeois was the conversion to Catholicism of the son of one of Fez's most prominent families and his entry into a Franciscan senii ary. These fears grew when the Vicariat Apostolique of Rabat in its journal Le Maroc catholique began openly propagating the idea of converting 'Berbers' to Catholicism and reprinted and circulated a letter written by the famous Père de Foucauld in which he urged that North</page><page sequence="16">Page 54 Africans be Gallicized by becoming Christians, lest they become Turkish-type nationalists (Brown 1972:208) 11. The 25,000 Moroccans and Legionairies who composed the Army of Africa were the only professional troops Franco commanded. (Fraser 1979:108) They may not have won the war, but without them Franco surely would have lost. Friedlander (1974:347) says that by January 1938, Franco had 50,000 to 60,000 Moroccans fighting for him. 12. Long before our sojourn in Morocco in 1986-1987, "Mora" had become a Spanish pejorative term for any Moroccan. Yet in the 1930s during this time of reconciliation the terms "Mora," "Mahometano," "Musulmano," seemed to be interchangeable and without negative connotations. Parenthetically, some women of Nador during our stay referred to men without manners as... Moros! 13. The consequences of this are felt even today, for instance, in debate over the meaning of Abd al-Krim's war. Berberists cast it as the first regional independence struggle or as the first anti-colonial revolt, while Moroccan nationalists view it instead as the last peasant revolt preceding the creation of nationalist consciousness. (Akouaou 1985:12-14) 14. Bounfour (1985:33-38) discusses the Berber credentials — or lack thereof — of various Moroccan political parties.</page><page sequence="17">Page 55 Bibliography Ageron, Charles-Robert 1%3 "La France a-t-elle eu une politique kabyle?"
