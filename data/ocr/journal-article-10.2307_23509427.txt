<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction: American Comic Books and Graphic Novels Daniel Stein, Christina Meyer, Micha Edlich Writing in the pages of this journal almost forty years ago, Walter Kiihnel prefaced his essay on American comic books with a justification of his interest in this popular form: In this article an attempt is made to analyze recurrent prejudices which impair numerous studies in popular culture products. It maintains that there is no fixed relation between quantity and quality, and especially that there can be no ahistorically valid definition of the 'proper' contents, functions, forms, or media which could serve as an incontestable parameter of artistic value. (58) Ktihnel was dissatisfied with literary scholars who either deemed popular culture unworthy of academic attention or sought to legitimize their critical engagement with comic books by placing them in a tradition of respected artists such as Wil liam Hogarth, Rodolphe Töpffer, and Wilhelm Busch (cf. 59). Kiihnel—like the other contributors to the special issue on the study of American popular culture in which his essay appeared—was a prescient advocate of a German academic dis cipline, Amerikanistik, on the move towards incorporating a broader understand ing of its subject. Ktihnel's essay mirrored disciplinary shifts and critical changes in the United States, represented by the Popular Culture Association and its Jour nal of Popular Culture (1968-present), and was part of a larger effort to usher in the acceptance of popular culture studies as a legitimate realm of American Stud ies scholarship in Germany.1 Today, German American Studies is a highly diversified and challenging aca demic field that offers significant contributions to our understanding of Ameri can popular culture and routinely includes analyses of artifacts and narratives in media other than literature, such as music, television, film, and photography. This is reflected in Amerikastudien / American Studies, which regularly features in novative essays on these and other forms of representation and has repeatedly fa cilitated critical engagements with American popular culture.2 Given the broad transdisciplinary scope of American Studies in Germany, it is surprising that very little scholarship on American comics has appeared in the wake of Kühnel's essay. Only a handful of pieces on comics have appeared in Amerikastudien / American Studies since Kühnel's assessment of comic books as a phenomenon of American popular culture, and we are still waiting for the first monograph on comics written by a German Americanist.3 These are but two indications that German American 1 For an early publication on popular culture, see Fluck, Populäre Kultur.

Evidence of this recent interest—most of which postdates the conception of this special issue and its selection of contributors—includes the conference on "Life Writing and the Graphic Novel" at the University of Paderborn (organized by Christoph Ribbat and Erin McGlothlin in July 2010), various comics-related proj ects in the DFG Research Unit "Popular Seriality: Aesthetics and Practice" (since October 2010), a special issue of ZAA: Zeitschrift für Anglistik und Amerikanistik (2011), and a workshop on "The Transcultural Work of Comics and Graphic Nar ratives" at the annual DGfA conference in Regensburg (June 2011).4 The purpose of this issue is to build on this critical momentum by inviting the expertise of an international group of scholars from different disciplines and academic backgrounds and thereby encourage further discussion—particularly in Germany, but also beyond—about the cultural significance of comics as an aes thetically complex, historically rich, and substantially American medium. In the United States and Great Britain, this discussion has been in full swing for at least two decades, and its institutional repercussions have been manifold. Comics are now widely taught in colleges and universities,5 comics scholarship is being pub lished by major university presses6 and in peer-reviewed journals,7 the number of On cartoons in humor magazines, see Dormon. Monographs and essay collections have almost exclusively been published by scholars working in fields other than American Studies; most of this scholarship has appeared in German and has thus made little impact on the international study of comics. An exception is Reitberger and Fuchs. The two English-language essay collec tions produced by German scholars include only a few Americanist perspectives (Ahrens and Meteling; Berninger, Ecke, Haberkorn). For German monographs, see Dittmar; Frahm, Sprache; Grünewald; Krichel; Packard; Platthaus. Essay collections include Arnold and Knigge; Diekmann and Schneider; Ditschke, Kroucheva, Stein; Hein, Hüners, Michaelsen; Leinen and Rings. 4 The DFG Research Unit is based in Göttingen (speaker: Frank Kelleter). The comic-relat ed projects are Shane Denson and Ruth Mayer's "Serial Figures and Media Change" (Universi ty of Hannover) and Daniel Stein and Frank Kelleter's "Authorization Practices of Serial Narra tion: The Generic Development of Batman and Spider-Man Comics" (University of Göttingen); see also the associated project "Seriality and Intermediality in Graphic Novels" by Gabriele Rippl, Stephanie Hoppeler, and Lukas Etter (University of Bern). Two papers from the DGfA workshop are included in the conference proceedings (Denson; Starre, "American"). Other pa pers are part of Denson, Meyer, Stein, eds., Transnational Perspectives on Graphic Narratives (forthcoming). Another workshop on comics, organized by Astrid Böger, Martin Klepper, and Christina Meyer, took place at the 2012 DGfA conference in Mainz ("Autobiographix: Auto graphic Life Narratives in American Studies"). See also Lanzendörfer and Köhler. 5 A Google search produces several dozen syllabi for courses on comics in the United States as well as in Germany and other countries. The didactic potential of comics is acknowledged by Tabachnick's Teaching the Graphic Novel; see also Vanderbeke, "Comics and Graphic Novels." 6 The strongest American publisher is the University Press of Mississippi, whose Comics &amp; Popular Culture series features dozens of monographs and essay collections devoted to the medium and its creators. For a historical assessment of the series, see Heer; an important early publication in the series is Inge's Comics as Culture.

Smith's foundational The Power of Comics: History, Form and Culture (2009) and Critical Approaches to Com ics: Theories and Methods (2011) signal a pronounced interest in the systematic study of comics, while publications such as Graphic Subjects: Critical Essays on Autobiography and Graphic Novels (ed. Michael Chaney, 2010) illustrate the pro ductive nexus between established forms of literary analysis—in this case, (auto) biography studies—and comics studies scholarship. In Germany, such interest is reflected in book projects such as Daniel Stein and Jan-Noël Thon's From Comic Strips to Graphic Novels: Contributions to the Theory and History of Graphic Narrative (forthcoming).11 Acknowledging the ubiquity of comics in contemporary American culture, Charles McGrath claimed in the New York Times Magazine (2004) that "comic books are what novels used to be—an accessible, vernacular form with mass ap peal" (n. pag.). While McGrath may be overstating his case, it is true that comics have come to enjoy an unprecedented degree of public visibility and cultural valo rization over the last two decades. The massive academic interest in comics may be explained to a significant degree by Art Spiegelman's Maus: A Survivor's Tale (1986/1991), the two-part graphic life narrative about a son's conversations with his father, a survivor of Auschwitz and the Holocaust. This comic book almost single-handedly changed the perception of comics among insiders and outsiders alike. When Spiegelman received the Pulitzer Prize for Maus in 1992 and went on to work for such high-profile print venues as The New Yorker, it made a case (MELUS, 2007); Caswell and Gardner, eds., Periodical Comics and Cartoons (American Pe riodicals, 2007); Gardner and Herman, eds., Graphic Narratives and Narrative Theory (Sub Stance, 2011). 8 Journals range from established publications such as the International Journal of Comic Art (ed. John Lent, since 1999), Image [&amp;] Narrative (ed. Jan Baetens et al., since 2000), and ImageText: Interdisciplinary Comics Studies (ed. Donald Ault, since 2004) to the recent British journals Studies in Comics (ed. Julia Round and Chris Murray, since 2010) and the Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics (ed. David Huxley and Joan Ormrod, since 2010). 9 In 2009, Hillary Chute (among others) founded the MLA's Discussion Group on Comics and Graphic Narratives. The 2010 ASA conference in San Antonio featured at least nine papers on comics; the MLA conference in Los Angeles 2011 included seven panels on various aspects of comics and graphic narratives. 10 Art Spiegelman's Maus as well as Paul Karasik and David Mazzucchelli's Paul Auster's City of Glass are excerpted in Postmodern American Fiction: A Norton Anthology (1997), The Norton Anthology of Jewish Literature (2001), and The Norton Anthology of American Litera ture (2007). The thirteenth issue of McSweeney's Quarterly Concern (ed. Chris Ware, 2004) also features articles on comics and graphic artwork. See also Ivan Brunetti, An Anthology of Graphic Fiction, Cartoons, and True Stories (Vol. 1, 2006; Vol. 2, 2010), the Best American Comics series (since 2006), and The Best American Comics Criticism (ed. Ben Schwartz). 11 In France and Belgium, the systematic study of comics has a long history. See, for ex ample, Groensteen's Système de la bande dessinée (published as The System of Comics by the UP of Mississippi); see also Peeters.</page><page sequence="4">504 Daniel Stein, Christina Meyer, Micha Edlich for comics as a medium with serious cultural capital (Spiegelman's most recent publication, the highly informative MetaMaus, further underscores this appeal).12 The subject matter and narrative sophistication of Maus motivated critical analy ses from a variety of academic disciplines and fields of inquiry, including liter ary studies, (auto)biography studies, twentieth-century history, Shoa studies, and trauma theory.13 Maus not only reinvigorated the debate over Holocaust represen tations; its critical acclaim and commercial success also opened up opportunities for other comics artists and writers, including Charles Burns, Joe Sacco, Adrian Tomine, Craig Thompson, and Chris Ware.14 A second factor for the increasing academic interest in comics was the arrival of a new literary genre, the comic book novel, which has brought the subject of comics squarely into the arena of literary criticism. Most notable in this regard are Michael Chabon's The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay (2000), which received the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2001; Jonathan Lethem's The Fortress of Solitude (2003) and his short story collection Men and Cartoons (2004); and Jay Cantor's earlier comic strip novel Krazy Kat (1987). Around the same time, sev eral critically acclaimed comics received prestigious literary prizes and acknowl edgments. Ware's Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth (2000) won the Guardian's First Book Award in 2001; Alison Bechdel's autobiographical Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic was selected as the best book of 2006 by Time Maga zine; Gene Luen Yang's depiction of a Chinese American boyhood in American Born Chinese (2006) earned the award for the best book of the year from Pub lisher's Weekly; while Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's Watchmen (1986/1987) was included among Time Magazine's 100 best novels of all time.15 Coupled with the meta-reflexive works by industry veteran Will Eisner (Comics and Sequential Art, 1985; Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative, 1996) and by Scott McCloud (Understanding Comics, 1993; Reinventing Comics, 2000; Making Comics, 2006), these publications have essentially changed the mainstream perception of com ics. Comics are now viewed as a complex medium whose century-long history calls for critical exploration and whose present creators often publish some of the 12 See Gordon, "Making"; Loman. Parts of Maus were published in installments in under ground magazines such as RAW or, in the case of "Prisoner of the Hell Planet," in Short Order Comix #1 (1973), which underscores the influence of serial forms of narration on texts that are now widely read as non-serialized graphic novels. Spiegelman's most famous New Yorker cover ("9/11/2001," a collaboration with his wife, Françoise Mouly, for the September 24, 2011 issue) depicts the two black silhouettes of the Twin Towers, thus indicating the presence in the memo ries of New Yorkers after the buildings had collapsed. This image was later used as the cover illustration for In the Shadow of No Towers (2004). 13 The secondary literature on Maus is too extensive to be referenced in its entirety here.

Such works not only reinvigorated the superhero genre and paved the way for successful series such as Neil Gaiman's Sandman (1989-1996), McFarlane's Spawn (1992-), Mike Mignola's Hell Boy (1993-), and Warren Ellis's Transmetro politan (1997-2002), but they have also increasingly been received as works wor thy of academic attention.18 While the number of academic studies on comics has grown exponentially in re cent years, it may still be too early to speak of a unified field of critical inquiry. In 2004 Bart Beaty observed that "[t]he scholarly study of comic books and comic strips [...] is, to provide a generous reading of the situation, in a state of infancy" ("Assess ing" 403). Four years later, Hillary Chute noted that "[t]he field hasn't yet grasped its object or properly posed its project" ("Comics as Literature?" 452). Writing in 2011, Beaty insisted that "the academic study of the form is still marginal" ("In Fo 16 Another influential (non-American) text is Marjane Satrapi's widely discussed autobio graphical account of her Iranian childhood in Persepolis (2000). 17 On Arkham Asylum, see also James Wurtz's essay in this issue. On the concept of 'revi sionist superhero narrative,' see Klock. 18 Many of the above-named are British authors who entered American comics publishing with critical agendas and aesthetic convictions shaped by their transatlantic perspectives. See Kukkonen and Müller-Wood; Murray. Another factor for the mainstream public visibility of the comic book aesthetic is the culmination of decades of television and movie adaptations in re cently booming Hollywood superhero blockbusters. Superheroes have migrated from their comic book origins into other media almost from their very inception—especially radio and film serials as early as the 1940s. The first superhero motion pictures include Batman (1966) and Superman (1978), but it was the success of Marvel's X-Men (2000, 2003, 2006, 2009), Spider-Man (2000, 2004, 2007), and DC's Batman (1989,1992,1995, 1997, 2005, 2008) that raised critical attention beyond film studies departments. The list of comic book Hollywood superhero blockbusters is growing, and, apart from the superhero genre, films such as Ghost World (2001) and American Splendor (2003) and television series such as Smallville (2001-) have further transposed comic book material across popular media.

In their Comics Studies Reader (2009)—whose existence is an important indicator of this trend in itself—Jeet Heer and Kent Worcester explain that "[t]he study of comics has become a lively field of inquiry and is no longer merely a topic area" (xi), and they find impressive new biographies and monographs; the construction of a scholarly infrastruc ture (archives, conferences, journals, listserv groups, and so on); greater theoretical am bition and sophistication; the internationalization of comics scholarship [...]; the recov ery of lost classics; and the growing audience for talks, books, and articles on the history, aesthetics, craft, and politics of comics, (xii, xi)20 Considering the diversity of primary sources and the sprawling body of secondary literature mentioned in this passage, and taking into account the heterogeneous perspectives of American Studies, this special issue confronts several conceptual difficulties.21 Looking back on the history of American comics—a popular me dium that, like film, emerged toward the end of the nineteenth century but unlike film has remained understudied for much of the twentieth century—we have cho sen a concept that balances out the Utopian wish to cover a representative range of texts against the reductive focus on a single genre, period, theme, or theoretical concern.22 Although a concentration on, say, the novelistic or literary aspects of graphic novels or on autobiographical modes in graphic narratives would certain ly have garnered valuable insights, we decided to solicit contributions on two of the most influential publication formats, namely comic books and graphic novels, and on works published in the last fifty years. In doing so, we wish to empha size the significance of comics as an integral and influential part of contemporary American popular culture, and also stress the need for critical approaches that connect literary perspectives with a comics-specific view. Nonetheless, our focus excludes the first seventy years of American comics production; in generic terms, it foregoes the earliest enunciation of the comic form, the newspaper comic strip (and the newer phenomenon of webcomics); in terms of territory, it marginal izes the transnational scope and transcultural work that comics have performed around the globe.23 What this focus makes possible, however, is a series of sug 19 For a more positive assessment, see Gordon, "Making" 191-92. 20 In Germany, see Eder, Klar, and Reichert's laudable Theorien des Comics (2011). 21 The idea for this special issue grew out of the panel "Practices of Community and Belong ing: Teaching Graphic Narratives in a post-9/11 World" at the American Studies Association's annual conference in Washington, DC (2009). We thank Alfred Hornung for his suggestions and generous support. Three of the papers delivered in this panel will appear in Dong, Teach ing Comics. See Meyer, "Teaching"; Starre, "Teaching"; Stein, "Black Politics." We also thank Frank Kelleter and the anonymous reviewers for their critical feedback and the Amerikastudien editors and staff in Regensburg and Mainz for their dedication to the project. 22 On comics as a popular medium, see Stein, Ditschke, Kroucheva, "Birth of a Notion." 23 Possible case studies include the postcolonial dimensions of comic books in India as well as Japanese manga, the latter of which was influenced by the American comic books that poured into Japan after World War II and has since become the most popular genre of comics storytell</page><page sequence="7">Introduction: American Comic Books and Graphic Novels 507 gestive engagements with various aspects of recent American comics by scholars from different national and disciplinary backgrounds. In light of these curtailments, we would like to clarify the rationale behind our concept for the present special issue. First, readers interested in the history of American comic strips can draw on an abundance of secondary literature, including Lucy Shelton Caswell and Jared Gardner's special issue on Periodical Comics and Cartoons (2007) and some of our own work (cited throughout this introduction).24 Moreover, while the individual contributions to this issue mostly deal with con temporary comics, we do cover the history—especially, but not exclusively, of early newspaper comic strips—in this introduction. Second, like Hillary Chute and Mar ianne DeKoven, the editors of a special issue on Graphic Narrative (2006), we do not want to limit the analytical scope to the format of the graphic novel because we wish to avoid the tendency of recent—especially literary—scholarship to celebrate the graphic novel as a genre of quasi-literary value at the expense of the commer cially still successful superhero comic book, too often denigrated as cheap formula entertainment for a non-intellectual readership. Third, we conceive of this special issue as the starting point of a wider discussion about comic books and graphic nov els and their relevance for the field of American Studies. Our objective is to build bridges between American Studies—which is, as Winfried Fluck and Thomas Cla viez remind us, "a joint, interdisciplinary academic endeavor to gain systematic knowledge about American society and culture in order to understand the his torical and present-day meaning and significance of the United States" (ix)—and the "expanding and intrinsically interdisciplinary field" that Heer and Worcester designate as "the new comics scholarship" (Introduction xi, xii). In other words, the essays collected in this special issue demonstrate that American comics are more than a topic area of investigation; they also address a panoply of concerns that are central to American Studies. These include the complex mediatization of serial figures; the comic book page as a spatialization of intraserial memory and character psyches; ethnic, racial, religious, and gender ste reotyping; the visual-verbal (re)creation of (autojbiographical memory; intersec tions of race and homosexuality; transmedial storytelling and techniques of focal ization; and the didactic potential of comics and graphic novels. We are convinced that these kinds of scholarship will speak to the concerns of American Studies scholarship in general, as well as to the growing number of German Americanists interested in the study of comics and other forms of graphic narrative. Moreover, we believe that the essays collected here can do their small part in facilitating productive intersections between American Studies and other areas of academic research.25 Before we introduce these essays, we will first provide definitions, a short historical overview, and terminological clarifications. ing in Europe and the United States.

As Charles Hatfield has noted, Comics shouldn't be easy to define, as they are an interdisciplinary, indeed antidisci plinary, phenomenon, nudging us carefully out of accustomed habits of thought and into productive gray areas where various disciplines—such as literature, art, semiotics, and mass communication—overlap and inform each other. ("Defining" 23) Some of the difficulties in defining comics stem, first, from the fact that we are dealing with a historically and culturally diverse medium and not simply a single genre, and second from the fact that comics are a medium in the double sense of being simultaneously material artifact (comic strips in newspapers, comic books published as magazines, paperback graphic novels, hardcover prestige editions, webcomics) and intermedial/multimodal semiotic system.26 So rather than man date a fixed definition and prevent potentially productive dissonances among the definitions offered by our contributors, we would like to outline some of the struc tural principles that distinguish comics from other kinds of images and narratives and also to provide a brief historical account of American comics. Comics have a particular way of generating meaning. Hillary Chute explains: Highly textured in its narrative scaffolding, comics doesn't [sic] blend the visual and the verbal—or use one simply to illustrate the other—but is rather prone to present the two nonsynchronously; a reader of comics not only fills in the gaps between panels but also works with the often disjunctive back-and-forth of reading and looking for meaning. ("Comics as Literature?" 452) In other words, comics are, "in their very structure and grammar, cross-dis cursive; composed in words and images, written and drawn" (Chute and DeKoven 768). As Robert C. Harvey further notes, "comics consist of pictorial narratives or expositions in which words (often lettered into the picture area within speech bal loons) usually contribute to the meaning of the pictures and vice versa. A pictorial narrative [here: comics] uses a sequence of juxtaposed pictures" ("How Comics" 26).27 As these definitions indicate, reading comics primarily as literary texts pos es the problem of overemphasizing verbal elements, while overly visual analyses tend to overlook the verbal textuality of comics. Historically the comics medium has produced different genres that are frequent ly tied to a specific mode of production, to a specific material and textual form, and (in terms of their first appearance) to a specific historical period: the newspaper comic strip; the comic book; and a more diversified narrative format that ranges under a variety of labels, the most widely known being the graphic novel.28 Through 26 On the intermediality of comics, see Becker, Comic; Hoppeler, Etter, Rippl; Schiiwer. On multimodality, see Kaindl; Kress and van Leeuwen. 27 Cf. also McCloud's definition of comics as a medium that consists of "juxtaposed picto rial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or produce an aesthetic response in the viewer" (Understanding 9). For a critical take on attempts to define comics, see Meskin. 28 For reasons of space, the following historical sketch excludes non-American comic tradi tions such as Franco-Belgian bande dessinée and Japanese manga as well as Disney comics (on the latter, see Andrae).</page><page sequence="9">Introduction: American Comic Books and Graphic Novels 509 out the nineteenth century, serial forms of entertainment began to make a lasting impact on American culture. With the establishment of literary magazines such as Putnam's Magazine, Harper's Magazine, Scribner's Monthly, Atlantic Monthly, Century Magazine, and others, many works of fiction were serialized before they were collected in a single book volume—prominent examples are Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and William Dean Howells's The Rise of Silas Lapham, as well as Charles Dickens's The Pickwick Papers, Bleak House, and Great Expectations. Yet one of the most famous serial figures of the late-nineteenth century was the Yellow Kid, who ap peared in the Sunday "Colored Supplements" of Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal. Pulitzer's World was among the first to bring drastic layout changes to the newspaper market. The aim was to attract new readers and sell more newspapers. In order to do so, Pulitzer launched a "Comic Weekly" section, which soon became the most popular part of the paper and its strongest selling point. These supplements included comic strips, then called 'funnies,' as well as amusing short essays, games and contests, advertisements, and sensational news. The first of these supplements was printed on May 21,1893, and "[t]he effect," as comics historian Bill Blackbeard claims, "was electric" (23). Be cause they mediated the ways in which American city dwellers made sense of their rapidly changing environment, and because they offered recent immigrants, work ers, and children a kind of entertainment that conveyed information primarily through visuals and used relatively simple language, the newspaper comic strips assumed an important function for the urban population. As a specific cultural practice—competing narratives in competing mass newspapers—they provided a public forum for social and political debates as well as a serially organized form of entertainment that was able to address heterogeneous and previously untapped audiences over an extended period of time.29 Although two artists, Richard Felton Outcault and George Benjamin Luks, were involved in popularizing the iconic Yellow Kid figure, it was the former who first drew the street urchin. The Yellow Kid was surrounded by other recurrent characters through which Outcault and Luks explored urban city life. By means of words and images, both artists discussed tenement living conditions, poverty, class divisions, America's immigrant population, the growing consumer culture, as well as the effects of technological innovations. Rather than offer explicit po litical commentary for educated readers—as did the editorial cartoons and carica tures printed in humor magazines such as Truth, Puck, Judge, and Life—the early Sunday pages sought to entertain the widest possible readership.30 They managed to do so by producing a format based on the principles of (slapstick) comedy, sequential narrative, intermedial storytelling, and serial production. Most of the situations depicted in early comics were meant to be funny, and they revolved around a more or less stable set of characters (including a recurring main char 29 On early American comic strips as a serial and popular cultural practice, see Kelleter and Stein, "Great, Mad, New." 30 Gordon discusses these issues in Comic Strips and Consumer Culture (see 37-58). See also Blackbeard; Couch; Meyer, "George Benjamin Luks" (forthcoming). On the prehistory and early history of comics, see Kunzle, History of the Comic Strip (Vols. 1 and 2).</page><page sequence="10">510 Daniel Stein, Christina Meyer, Micha Edlich acter) and settings. Especially with the arrival of daily comic strips in the early years of the twentieth century—which differed from the Sunday pages in terms of the frequency with which they appeared (daily instead of weekly), the space they were allotted in the newspaper (a quarter page or less instead of a full page), and the kinds of stories they could tell (longer story arcs developing day by day)—the dominant narrative structure became the endless variation of a single plot told in a few panels. For example, Frederick Burr Opper's Happy Hooligan (created in 1899) portrays a good-natured Irish American klutz who almost always ends up in trouble because of his clumsiness; Rudolph Dirks's The Katzenjammer Kids (cre ated in 1897 and still running) details the pranks the twins Hans and Fritz play on their "Mama," "der Captain," and "der Inspector," as well as their subsequent corporal punishment.31 Visually rendered in a sequence of panels separated by so called gutters, these comic strips demanded heightened involvement on the part of the reader, whom they enlisted in the act of converting individual still panels into a continuing narrative. Operating intermedially, these comics visualized dia logue in speech balloons and introduced a visual vocabulary that includes motion lines and sound words. Like their literary counterparts—Stephen Crane, Frank Norris, and Theodore Dreiser—Outcault and Luks were fascinated by life in America's urban centers. Only a few years after Jacob Riis had published his seminal work of photojour nalism, How the Other Half Lives (1890), they expressed their fascination with the lives of the lower classes and the living conditions of the tenement children in New York City in the new medium of comics. Their detailed pages not only opened windows into situations characteristic of urban life but also displayed a characteristic irreverence toward figures of authority and the political system.32 As Robert L. Gambone concludes in his recent study on Luks, the historical mo ment in which these and other comic strips appeared "raises a host of complex issues involving the relationship between style, aesthetics, and originality, techno logical innovation, and the market context of the comics" (131). Seen in this light, the comic strips of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are important sources of public commentary on the rapid changes that ushered American soci ety into a modern era shaped by industrial mass-production. They further docu 31 The Katzenjammer Kids was inspired by Wilhelm Busch. In 1897 Hearst allegedly hired Dirks, a German immigrant, to produce a comic strip that was "something like Max and Mori tz." Dirks not only modeled his central characters on Busch's two rascals, he even copied key scenes from Max und Moritz (1865), foregrounding the transcultural nature of the early Ameri can comic strips and displaying a sensitivity towards the public interest in funny representations of ethnic stereotypes at a time when urban audiences were becoming more ethnically diverse and socially stratified (see Stein, "Long Shadow"). 32 For further analysis, see Frahm, "Every Window." Before Outcault drew his Yellow Kid series, he published "kid cartoons" for Truth magazine. In 1902 he began his most widely re ceived strip. Buster Brown. Between the Yellow Kid and Buster Brown, he produced Poor LiT Mose, a strip about a series of black "coon" characters that points to the troubled, and often unacknowledged, treatment of racial and ethnic minorities in American comic strips. See Havig; Strömberg. Luks started out as a political cartoonist for Puck and Truth (1890/1891). While he is rarely acknowledged for his Yellow Kid drawings, his Ash Can view on urban life in America is widely appreciated and studied.</page><page sequence="11">Introduction: American Comic Books and Graphic Novels 511 ment an increasing interest in mass-mediated popular entertainment and attest to the growing commodification of comics themselves.33 The early comic strips were more than the result of technological and social changes. They also constituted an aesthetic response to these changes and, in turn, also took an active part in the cultural transformations of the time. They stand alongside more extensively analyzed forms of cultural production such as the literary naturalism of Crane, Norris, and Dreiser; the modernist writings of Gertrude Stein, T. S. Eliot, and F. Scott Fitzgerald; and the filmic engagements with questions of race and national identity in David W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915) and Alan Crosland's The Jazz Singer (1927). As Ian Gordon ar gues, American comics were "an outcome of the process of modernization" as much as they were "a humor-based response to the problems of representation faced by a society in transition" (Comic Strips 6). This transitional phase produced comic strips of tremendous visual and narrative potential, for instance, Lyonel Feininger's group of unruly rascals, The Kin-der-Kids (1906-1907). Feininger's strip was featured in the Chicago Tribune and experimented with bizarre carica tures, innovative page layouts, expressive backgrounds, and a storyline that pro gressed in weekly installments. Designed to tap into the high cultural standing and visual styles of nineteenth-century German humorists like Wilhelm Busch, The Kin-der-Kids was nonetheless produced under decidedly modern circum stances. Feininger drew them first in Germany and later in France before hav ing them shipped to Chicago, where they were printed in larger numbers by the Tribune's huge printing machines. Another example from the same time period is Winsor McCay's Little Nemo in Slumberland (1905-1913), which transposed the European art nouveau styles of William Morris and Alfons Maria Mucha into an American context and medium, and depicted a little child's dreamworld in ways that brought the subject matter of Sigmund Freud's Die Traumdeutung (1900) into the realm of modern popular culture. A third specimen of this peculiar kind of comic modernism is George Herriman's Krazy Kat, a proto-surrealist strip that depicted the anthropomorphic cat character's fruitless attempts to convey his love for Ignatz Mouse by passionately throwing a brick. Ignatz was usually jailed by the clumsy Offisa Pup at the end of an episode, only to be miraculously free again in the next installment. Krazy Kat ran in Hearst's New York Evening Journal (1913-1944) and presented extended self-reflexive and metamedial experiments as well as prolonged philosophical ruminations atypical of the slapstick antics of many other strips. Moreover, it sparked the interest of Gilbert Seldes, whose The 7 Lively Arts (1924) is often cited as the first book about modern American popular culture and as the locus classicus of comics studies.34 In the early decades of the twentieth century, Krazy Kat was read by such liter ary modernists as Stein and Eliot, and millions of newspaper readers followed the 33 The Yellow Kid was not only a popular icon but also one of the first merchandised comic figures: He was printed on postcards, cracker tins, pin-back buttons, and cigarette packs and sold as dolls (cf. Gordon, Comic Strips 32). An even earlier incarnation of such popular comic strip iconicity can be found with the British figure Ally Sloper (see Sabin, "Ally Sloper"). 34 On Krazy Kat's position in American modernism, see Stein, "Comic Modernism."

These strips were not just immensely popular; they also laid the foundation for an aesthetics that still informs works such as E.C. Segar's Popeye, Walt Kelly's Pogo, Charles Schulz's Peanuts, Gary Trudeau's Doonesbury, Bill Watterson's Calvin &amp; Hobbes, Jim Davis's Garfield, and Aaron McGruder's The Boondocks. Within a few decades, the early comic strips produced much of the visual vocabulary and many of the narrative struc tures that would shape comics for many decades to come, including the superhero comic books from the 1930s onwards, the underground comix of the 1960s and 70s, and the graphic novels of the 1980s to the present day. It is, therefore, no co incidence that Art Spiegelman's response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, In the Shadow of No Towers (2004), reprints several of the early newspaper comic strips, incorporates characters such as the Yellow Kid and Happy Hooligan into its visual narrative, and includes an essay on the continued relevance of these works to present-day comics artists.35 By the late 1930s and early 1940s, newspaper comics were no longer the only format for comic storytelling. Comic books were introduced to millions of (most ly) young readers who followed the monthly adventures of superheroes like Su perman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Captain America and helped to establish some of the most long-lived serial narratives in American culture. In their early stages, comic books were modeled in form and content on the serialized stories published in pulp magazines; they were also influenced by adventure, detective, and science fiction newspaper strips such as Hal Foster's and Burne Hogarth's Tarzan (based on Edgar Rice Burroughs's novels), Chester Gould's Dick Tra cy, Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon, and Milton Caniff's Terry and the Pirates. While the first comic books consisted of previously published newspaper strips repackaged in collections like The Funnies (1929) and Famous Funnies (early to mid-1930s), savvy industry figures like Max Gaines, Harry Donenfeld, and Jack Liebowitz soon embraced the new form as a way to sell original material to a young readership hungry for serial entertainment. In 1938 Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel, two Jewish teenagers from Cleveland's lower middle class, managed to find a publisher for their first Superman story (then National Periodical Publications, now DC Comics). Published in Action Comics #1 (June 1938), the story about the alien Kal-El from Planet Krypton who possesses superhuman powers and, as Su perman, protects good Americans against violence and crime, proved a massive success.36 Soon Superman received his own magazine, and new superhero char acters appeared: Batman in 1939 (Bob Kane and Bill Finger), Wonder Woman in 33 See Meyer, '"After all'" and "'Putting'"; Sielke, "Why '9/11 is [not] unique.'" 36 The story of American comic books is also a success story of the descendants of Jewish immigrants, including Max and William Gaines, Harvey Kurtzman, Will Eisner, Stan Lee, and Art Spiegelman, in addition to Shuster and Siegel.

They offered action-packed, brightly colored plots in monthly sequence. Serially produced and distributed like their comic strip predecessors, they "provided emotional engagement, instant identifi cation, and a prefocusing of expectations that reduce[d] the comprehension costs of each new installment" (Boyd 102). Yet they were also different from newspa per strips in terms of their length (usually 32 pages) and in terms of their status as independent material artifacts—artifacts, moreover, that could be owned and collected over the course of years and even decades. In the first years of their existence, comic books were among the most widely read texts on the American market. Individual magazines sold many hundreds of thousands of copies, and market researchers estimated that, in 1945, about half of the American popula tion read comic books (cf. Wright 57). It is virtually impossible to account for the history of the superhero comic book and its role in American culture in more than the most cursory manner.38 Suffice it to say that over the more than seven decades of their existence, comic books have changed substantially from the "oneiric climate" that Umberto Eco found in the Superman comics from the 1940s and 50s, in which past and future events have few lasting consequences for subsequent episodes (153). With the arrival of the flawed (guilt-ridden, impulsive, neurotic) superheroes of the Marvel Universe in the early 1960s and 1970s, and with the growing stratification of different series and storylines into overarching universes and multiple earths, the superhero genre expanded and privileged complex character constellations and extensive backsto ries.39 Marvel's Fantastic Four, the Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man, and the Uncanny X-Men (many of which were created and/or drawn by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and 37 The majority of superheroes has been (and continues to be) male; on the significance of female superheroines, see Robbins, Great Super-Heroines', Robinson. 38 For a generic approach that focuses on questions of serial authorship and authorization conflicts, see Kelleter and Stein, "Autorisierungspraktiken." On visual self-representations of comics authorship, see Stein, "Was ist ein Comic-Autor?" For additional analyses of the super hero genre, see Coogan; Gabilliet; Lopes; Ndalianis; Reynolds; Wright; on aspects of seriality, see Wiillner as well as Gardner, Projections; on narrative structures, see Ditschke and Anhut. A fuller account of comic book history would have to cover genres such as romance, western, and science fiction; the controversy of the horror comics produced by EC Comics; the role that Fredric Wertham's Seduction of the Innocent (1954) played in the establishment of the 'Com ics Code Authority,' an institution charged with monitoring comic books to ensure that their contents would be suitable for children and teenagers; the function of comic books as World War II propaganda; the satirical meta-commentary provided by William Gaines and Harvey Kurtzman's Mad Magazine; the role of comic book fandom; and much more. See Beaty, Fredric Wertham; Hajdu; Nyberg; Pustz. 39 The 1970s also saw a more ethnically diverse cast of superheroes, even if these superhe roes largely stayed within the bounds of stereotypical blaxploitation depiction. In the 1990s, more nuanced types of black superhero characters were established, mainly by the short-lived Milestone Comics (see Brown).</page><page sequence="14">514 Daniel Stein, Christina Meyer, Micha Edlich Steve Ditko) lived and operated in the same narrative universe, which meant that the characters could appear in different series and also that events depicted in one series would have a bearing on all others. Similarly, characters in the DC uni verse began to move freely from series to series, aided each other in their pur suits of increasingly powerful villains, and shared a basic outlook on the narrative worlds they inhabited. The thus accumulating backlog spawned various reboots that streamlined character constellations, settings, and backstories (most notably Marv Wolfman and George Pérez's miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths from 1985, which killed off most of the DC characters and universes), ultimately preparing the ground for new story arcs and character constellations. Currently, DC Comics' rebooting of all of its 52 continuing superhero series and Marvel's new Ultimate Comics Universe Reborn series (which feature an African American Spider-Man) are indicators of these very same processes of repetition and renewal. Following Flenry Jenkins's observations on the genre history of comic books, which focus on the major changes in the way comics were produced and dis tributed, one could argue that superhero comics developed from the "relatively self-contained issues" (20) sold at newsstands from the late 1930s to the 1960s to "more and more serialization as the distribution of comics [became] more and more reliable." This increased reliability was at least in part an effect of the di rect sales system, which was introduced in the 1970s and which organized the distribution of comics via comic book stores. Because this system allowed readers to purchase all installments of a series as well as back issues, it awarded greater significance to the narrative principles of consistency and continuity. Today, as Jenkins argues, "principles of multiplicity are felt at least as powerfully as those of continuity," and "readers may consume multiple versions of the same franchise" (20). We have already cited examples of the first stage (Superman, Batman, Won der Woman, Captain America) and the 'revisionary superhero narratives' of the second stage (Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Watchmen, The Killing Joke, Arkham Asylum, Spider-Man: Torment). The current "era of multiplicity" (29) is marked by a proliferation of publishers and imprints (DC, Marvel, Image, Dark Horse, Vertigo, Wildstorm, Icon) and the appearance of various incarnations of individual superheroes in many formats (graphic novel, magazine, webcomic) and media (television, movies, computer games). These developments have firmly es tablished the superhero comic as the most visible genre of American comics, even though alternative comics, which evolved from the underground comics of the 1960s and early 1970s, and various types of non-superhero graphic novels have become more and more influential. The gradual emergence of underground comics, or comix, in the 1960s and early 1970s can be understood as an aesthetic, generic, and ideological reaction to the cultural pervasiveness of the superhero comics, and it also represents a sig nificant dimension of, and contribution to, the countercultural movement in the United States.40 Influenced by "the irreverent comics of Harvey Kurtzman, the 40 For analyses of underground 'comix,' see Dez; Estren; Rosenkranz. Our focus on Robert Crumb and Harvey Pekar (see below) is not meant to exclude the contributions of women un derground artists, such as Trina Robbins, Aline Kominsky, Diane Noomin, Lee Mars, Melinda</page><page sequence="15">Introduction: American Comic Books and Graphic Novels 515 chaotic-comic music of Spike Jones, the disrespectful and caustic humor of Lenny Bruce, [...] Paul Krassner's anarchic-satiric magazine The Realist" (Gabilliet 63), and the psychedelic artwork of rock posters (Hatfield, Alternative 8), artists such as Robert Crumb "transformed an object that was jejune and mechanical in origin into a radically new kind of expressive object, a vehicle for the most personal and unguarded of revelations," thereby also indirectly preparing the ground for later autobiographical comics (7). Although several noteworthy underground comics were disseminated earlier in the decade through student and underground presses as well as in a number of usually short-lived underground comic magazines (cf. Gabilliet 63-66), the "birth" of comix is frequently taken to be the publication of Crumb's Zap Comix #1 (February 1968), which found fertile ground in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood and appealed to a growing readership in the wake of the "Summer of Love" (65). Crumb's success with Zap Comix was significant because it promoted "an 'alternative' ethos that valued the productions of the lone cartoonist over collaborative or assembly-line work" and instigated "the appropriation of popular (or once-popular) characters, styles, genres, and tropes for radically personal and sometimes politically subversive ends" (Hatfield, Alternative 16, 18). It further represented a financially viable business model for the creation and production of so-called creator-owned comics, which were not restricted by the editorial policies or publishing formats adopted by the main stream industry (16). Zap Comix and other underground comics also contributed to what has become a vibrant subculture (comic conventions, fanzines, and so on), and they aided the shift to direct distribution through highly specialized booksell ers, a development that ultimately proved beneficial to the entire comic industry inasmuch as these stores also stocked comics by established publishers such as DC or Marvel (cf. Gabilliet 66-67; Hatfield, Alternative 21-26; see also Sabin, Adult and Comics). While the anti-establishment impetus behind, and the sociopolitical commit ment of, early underground comics from the late 1960s and early 1970s have slow ly faded away, many of the developments concerning form, content, and mode of production continue to exert considerable influence on the increasingly heteroge neous field of alternative comics and graphic novels. The network of smaller pub lishers (especially Fantagraphics and Drawn &amp; Quarterly) and comic book stores, for example, has provided the much-needed infrastructure for independent artists such as the late Harvey Pekar, who is probably best known today for his autobio graphical comic series American Splendor (1976) and his collaborative graphic illness memoir Our Cancer Year (1994, with Joyce Brabner and Frank Stack). The innovative work of Pekar, the brothers Gilbert and Jaime Hernandez (Love and Rockets, 1981-1996; 2001-), Dan Clowes (for instance, Eightball, since 1989; Ghost World, 1997; Wilson, 2010), Julie Doucet (Dirty Plotte, 1988-1998), Charles Burns (for instance, Black Hole, 1993-2004), and many others has attracted the attention of larger comic publishers, which have either revised older series according to new Gebbie, and Roberta Gregory, who created the Wimmen's Comix anthology (1972-1992). See also It Ain't Me Babe (1970) and Joyce Farmer and Lyn Chevely's Tits &amp; Clits (from 1975).

This development has, in turn, complicated attempts to establish clear genealogies, histories, and typologies. While there is little controversy over the labels comic strip and comic book (even though comic books are not actually books in any conventional sense, but rather slim periodicals), this is not the case when it comes to 'graphic novel,' a term that was first used by fan critic Richard Kyle in 1964 and gained mainstream attention in the late 1970s with the publication of Will Eisner's groundbreaking A Con tract with God (1978). Many scholars understand 'graphic novel' as a marketing term used by the comics industry as well as by independent publishers to convey a sense of production value and narrative sophistication that says only little about the actual content and form of a specific text.42 When we think of some of the most significant American comics—Eisner's A Contract with God, Spiegelman's Maus, the Hernandez brothers' Love &amp; Rockets, Chris Ware's Acme Novelty Li brary—the term is essentially a misnomer: A Contract with God is a short cycle of vignettes akin to a novella or short story collection (if one wants to make a literary comparison) about life in the Bronx during the Great Depression; Maus is an (autobiographical investigation of the Holocaust experiences of the narra tor's father filtered through a self-reflexive narrative perspective; Love &amp; Rockets is an epic series of stories about life in the Latin American town of Palomar; The Acme Novelty Library is a serially published multi-generic collection of narra tives. Moreover, many scholars are wary, and rightly so, of overly literary readings of comics because such readings tend to underestimate the fact that storytelling in comics "offers an intricately layered narrative language [...] that comprises the verbal, the visual, and the way these two representational modes interact on a page" (Chute and DeKoven 767). For these reasons, Hillary Chute and Marianne DeKoven have suggested graph ic narrative as a more fitting term, defining it as "a narrative work in the medium of comics" (767) and as "a book-length work in the medium of comics" (Chute, "Comics as Literature?" 453). We are sympathetic towards this definition, espe 41 As some of the essays in the present volume indicate, mainstream comics and alternative comics are by no means absolute categories. Like many other artists, David Mazzucchelli has worked for comic powerhouses such as Marvel and DC and on his own projects, including the collaboration with Paul Karasik on a graphic adaptation of Paul Auster's City of Glass, which was published in 1994 as Neon Lit: Paul Auster's City of Glass. 42 For various perspectives on the form and history of the graphic novel, see Baetens. On the complex history of the term and concept, see Williams and Lyons, "Introduction" xiii-xv.</page><page sequence="17">Introduction: American Comic Books and Graphic Novels 517 daily since it accommodates non-fictional narratives in ways that the term 'graphic novel' does not. However, we want to retain the terms comic book and graphic novel for this special issue because they are both more culturally specific and more widely used among readers of comics. Moreover, Chute and DeKoven's definition is slightly redundant—if comics are a verbal-visual form of sequential storytelling, then they are, by their very nature, narrative graphic texts—while Chute's defini tion relies, somewhat arbitrarily, on story length as a central criterion. This terminological controversy points to other areas of contention in the emerging field of comics studies. Unlike more established critical discourses, comics studies cannot draw on foundational analytical models, basic conceptual categories, or pre-established terminologies. In this sense, it resembles critical schools such as feminist criticism or environmental literary and cultural studies, both of which adopted and adapted methodologies from other schools before they eventually introduced their own original critical and theoretical models. Given this lack of existing models, comics studies tend to rely on interdisciplinary ap proaches, and this is where American Studies scholarship can offer a whole array of critical perspectives, theories, and methodologies. If one accepts Karin Kuk konen and Gideon Haberkorn's call for a "toolbox" approach and its imperative to draw on "the wealth of thematic and disciplinary approaches that scholars from different academic fields bring to comics" (239), then there should be little doubt that productive intersections between the critical discourse on comics and Ameri can Studies scholarship are not just possible, but necessary. The Contributions to This Special Issue Commenting on the place of comics in American universities, Hillary Chute observes that "[t]o explore today's comics we need to go beyond preestablished rubrics: we have to reexamine the categories of fiction, narrative, and historicity" ("Comics as Literature?" 452). The scholars represented in this special issue en gage in these and similar kinds of explorations and examinations. They do so by combining a theoretical interest in the mediality and narrativity of comic books and graphic novels with close readings and thick descriptions of specific texts and historical contexts. In the opening essay, "Marvel Comics' Frankenstein: A Case Study in the Media of Serial Figures," Shane Denson turns to one of the most in fluential genres of American comics: the serially published, mass-produced comic book. Denson's case study is concerned with the Frankenstein story, its migration across texts and media, and specifically its appearance in Marvel comic books of the 1960s and 1970s. As a serial figure not genuine to the medium, the Fran kenstein monster had evolved through a long history of adaptations and medial transformations by the time it made its entry into comic books. Denson theorizes the medial specificities that account for the shapes, forms, and storylines of the monster in Marvel comics. As such, he also offers a compelling blueprint for a (reassessment of different modes of cultural production, medial exchange, and serial representation of iconic figures in American culture. The iconic turn in dis ciplines such as Bildwissenschaften and the heightened interest in the cultural</page><page sequence="18">518 Daniel Stein, Christina Meyer, Micha Edlich power of icons and iconographies among American Studies scholars have already yielded important insights (see Burda; Haselstein, Schneck, Ostendorf, Iconog raphies'.; Leypoldt and Engler; Reynolds and Hutner). Denson's reconsideration of the serial figure of Frankenstein should further encourage Americanists to re examine how iconicity is created, disseminated, and perpetuated in and across (popular) media. James F. Wurtz's '"Out there in the Asylum': Physical, Mental, and Structural Space in Grant Morrison and Dave McKean's Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth" investigates a particularly innovative depiction of the super hero Batman. Unlike Denson, whose interest lies in processes of serialization and media transposition, Wurtz focuses on a single text, a graphic novel that stands within a long serial continuity while revising central visual and narrative elements of the Batman universe. Wurtz takes a non-'herocentric' approach that focuses on processes of visual and narrative spatialization. In addition, he foregrounds Mor rison's authorial investment with Batman's backstory and McKean's search for an innovative visual approach to this well-known figure. In doing so, Wurtz not only illuminates the mythical appeal of the infamous Arkham Asylum but also exam ines how this revisionary superhero comic self-reflexively interrogates the nature of comic form itself. Turning to a different segment of superhero comics, Fredrik Strömberg criti cally engages with the racial, religious, and gender stereotypes that are espe cially prominent in this genre. Examining a largely marginalized—though cul turally central—textual corpus, '"Yo, rag-head!': Arab and Muslim Superheroes in American Comic Books after 9/11" adds new insights to the growing body of scholarly literature on Arab American lives and cultures (see Hornung and Kohl; Möhr and Mayer; Schäfer). Strömberg pursues a double purpose: He takes stock of Arab and Muslim superhero characters developed in response to 9/11 and then reads these characters as examples of a particular form of 'Oriental Othering' that expresses itself in the names, visual appearances, origin stories, and modi operandi of these characters. Drawing on the theories of Edward Said, he argues that these Arab and Muslim superheroes represent an attempt to produce a more racially and religiously diverse world but also ultimately reveal a failure of the imagination, as these portrayals cannot avoid the pitfalls of racial and religious Othering. In her reading of Stitches, the critically acclaimed autobiographical Künstler roman by American comics artist David Small, Astrid Böger asks important ge neric and aesthetic questions and subsequently reframes them from the perspec tives of (auto)biography studies and trauma studies. By situating Small's account in the intersecting socioeconomic and ideological contexts of Cold War America, Böger's "Conquering Silence: David Small's Stitches and the Art of Getting Bet ter" demonstrates how the tools developed in these critical discourses can be used to unpack the numerous formal as well as thematic complexities and ambiguities explored in Small's graphic narrative. Approaching the text in this manner also allows Böger to assess several insights and methodologies that have significantly affected American Studies and other fields in the last two decades. Her essay suggests that current definitions of autobiographical grief and trauma narratives</page><page sequence="19">Introduction: American Comic Books and Graphic Novels 519 can be productively amended by the analysis of works like Stitches, which self consciously explore the ways in which graphic acts of writing and drawing can generate new senses of self.43 Simon Dickel's '"Can't Leave Me Behind': Racism, Gay Politics, and Coming of Age in Howard Cruse's Stuck Rubber Baby" revolves around issues of ethnic and racial discrimination. In his analysis of Cruse's graphic novel, Dickel focuses on a subject that has gained significant traction in American Studies and that has just begun to be examined in comics scholarship, most frequently in conjunction with Alison Bechdel's comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For (1993-2008) and her graphic memoir Fun Home: namely, the depiction of the personal and sociocul turel significances of homosexuality in American literature and culture, which Cruse combines with an interest in the intersection of homosexuality and race. As Dickel argues, Stuck Rubber Baby negotiates this complex intersection by re calling the narrator's coming of age as well as his coming out in the Deep South during the era of the Civil Rights Movement. The three interconnected narrative levels that structure this graphic novel—a frame narrative in the present, the nar rator's personal testimony of past events, and the visual depiction of emotions and memories—illuminate the many ways in which civil rights activism and the struggle for gay liberation are inextricably linked. That Cruse underscores this interlinkage through visual-verbal strategies unique to the medium of comics and that he combines these strategies with a narrative mode—fictional autobiogra phy—that is commonly associated with literature, attests to the inherently inter medial and cross-generic nature of the graphic novel. In "Graphic Narratives as a Challenge to Transmedial Narratology: The Ques tion of Focalization," Kai Mikkonen applies Gérard Genette's narratological concept of focalization to the medium of comics and assesses both the method ological challenges and the theoretical possibilities this application offers for a transmedial focalization theory. While questions of narrative perspective have been discussed widely in terms of the three major literary genres (narrative fic tion, poetry, and drama), and while a distinct critical apparatus has been devel oped in film studies to address these questions (auteur theory, camera work, male gaze), we are only now witnessing the emergence of a comics-specific narratology. Mikkonen turns to David Mazzucchelli's Asterios Polyp, Eric Drooker's Flood!, Daniel Clowes's Ghost World, and Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes in order to chart the ways in which focalization has been realized in the medium of comics. His analysis suggests that comics share similarities with, but also remain different from, other forms of multimodal narration, thus reinforcing our conviction that comics scholarship cannot do without a sound theoretical basis—that it cannot merely fall back on established literary (and related) approaches to deal with the formal and thematic challenges of comics storytelling. Mikkonen thus identifies a fundamental theoretical and methodological problem that also emerges, in dif ferent guises, in investigations that explore the exchanges and interconnections between different media.

Noting that most didactic work on comics and graphic novels in the past focused on language acquisition and marginalized questions of visual lit eracy, this essay seeks to overcome such lopsided approaches by introducing ex emplary texts that are verbally and visually stimulating for students of different age groups. Hecke details the didactic possibilities that make Chester Brown's I Never Liked You, Aaron McGruder, Reginald Hudlin, and Kyle Baker's Birth of a Nation, and Jessica Abel's La Perdida useful sources for EFL teaching. Draw ing upon her teaching experience at the University of Göttingen, she further discusses the ways in which students pursuing a bachelor of education degree in English can benefit from the practical experience of teaching comics and graphic novels to small groups of high school students (the 'learning through teaching' method). While discussing different approaches to reading and teaching comics and graphic novels, Hecke makes clear that these texts are useful teaching tools for foreign language acquisition, intercultural competence, as well as visual and literary literacy, a point that is supported by the essays collected in Frederick Luis Aldama's Multicultural Comics (2010). The Forum section features media and communications scholar Henry Jen kins's interview with the American comics artist David Mack. "Comics as Poetry: An Interview with David Mack" serves as both a coda and a critical counterpoint to the essays that precede it. Jenkins and Mack pick up—often from different angles—many of the themes discussed by the contributors to the main section of this special issue. These themes include image-text relations, the media-specific gestalt of comics, the heightened self-reflexivity of comic books and graphic nov els, reception aesthetics, transcultural influences, and the productive cross-fer tilizations among comics and literature. Mack has not only worked on superhero comics such as Daredevil, but has also created his own set of graphic novels, the Kabuki series. His reflections on the differences and similarities of the two comic subgenres discussed throughout this special issue build on his personal and pro fessional experience.
