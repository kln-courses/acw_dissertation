THE PACIFIC COAST OF OAXACA AND GUERRERO The westernmost extent of Zapotee script Javier Urcid 2614 39th Street N.W., Apt. 201, Washington, DC 20007, USA Abstract Epigraphic and functional comparisons of carved monuments in highland and coastal Oaxaca are used to address questions concerning (1) the origin and development of writing in southwestern Mesoamerica, (2) macroregional interactions, and (3) past linguistic affiliations of coastal groups. Given the scarcity of known inscriptions, particularly along the littoral of Guerrero and Oaxaca, it is concluded that the writing system in the coast is derived from central (Zapotee) Oaxaca and that the littoral did not play a role in the origins of writing in Mesoamerica. Since most of the inscribed material presently available from the coast dates between a.d. 600 and 900, relatively few traces of interregional contacts can be detected by means of epigraphy. Discernible interactions include contact with post-Teotihuacan sites in the central highlands via Guerrero; central Oaxaca through intermediate regions like Sola de Vega and Miahuatlan; and Tabasco, the latter apparently the result of migrations. The close epigraphic similarities between the coast and central Oaxaca suggest that groups speaking Chatino and other languages of the Zapotecan family had a wider distribution along the littoral in former times. Given its vastness, mostly rugged terrain, and consequent geo graphical isolation, the littoral of Oaxaca and Guerrero is poorly known archaeologically (Figure 1). The few examples of mon umental art and inscriptions that are known from the coast have been often compared with materials from better-understood regions, and similarities between the writing traditions of the coast and highlands of southwestern Mesoamerica, particularly the central valleys of Oaxaca, have long been noted (Brocking ton 1974; Jorrin 1974; Piña Chán 1960). This paper builds upon these observations. It reexamines the available evidence from the coast —including some new discoveries —using as a yardstick recent advances in the understanding of Zapotee writing (Urcid 1992). The discussion exclusively focuses on carved materials that can be stylistically dated to between 200 B.C. and a.d. 900. Specifically, the paper compares the repertoire of calendrical and noncalendrical glyphs from the coast and the highlands together with the architectural context of carved monuments in both regions. These comparisons are then used to address changes through time in scribal practices, patterns of interre gional interactions, and the past linguistic affiliations of coastal groups. THE EVIDENCE Taking full advantage of a comparative method requires an ade quate sample. However, the available iconographic and epi graphic evidence from the coast is relatively small, even if the recent findings from the lower Rio Verde drainage are included (Joyce and Winter 1989; Winter 1986). Compared to the cor pora of inscriptions from other regions of Oaxaca, like the cen tral valleys (570 examples), the Mixteca Alta (20 examples), and the Mixteca Baja (91 examples), only 57 carvings are known from the coast.1 Besides the small sample, there are other prob lems with the coastal materials. First, only five carvings have been found in a primary context, limiting our understanding of the function of the monuments and the rituals associated with them. Also, while the stones themselves cannot be dated directly, their archaeological associations can help reduce the number of chronological possibilities. While the dating of mon uments can sometimes be accomplished on the basis of icono graphic and stylistic comparisons, this requires a corpus of reliably documented carvings. The present study is based on an inspection of published and unpublished photographs and drawings. Although efforts have been made to generate accurate drawings from these images, no claim is made that these are precise renditions. Some photo graphs were not used in the present discussion due to the pres ence of oblique angles and contrasting shadows that obscure much of the detail.2 The majority of the materials mentioned in the paper come from sites along the western portion of the littoral, between Pochutla, Oaxaca, and Piedra Labrada, Guer rero. Only one sculpture, found at El Saltillo, Tehuantepec, is known from the eastern portion. Five carved examples without provenience were tentatively included in the corpus from the coast because of their iconography (Figure 2). 1 These counts include only carvings that contain epigraphic or icon ographic elements. Plain sculpture in the round is not considered. 2These include the photographs of Piedra Labrada Stones 1 and 2 (Piña Chán 1960:Photos 12 and 13), Jicayan Stone 1 (Jorrin 1974: Figure 3a), La Humedad Stone 1 (Jorrin 1974:Figure 4e), and Cerro del Rey Stone 2 (Jorrin 1974:Figure 40). 141</page><page sequence="2">142 Urcid I Teotihuaean \ ^ (£&gt; v Mexican Highlands Xico#'U,:,Pllu&lt;f'\v Cacaxila Teotcnango ) "Cholula / Xochicalco \ ( Chichen Itza GUERRERO VERACRUZ \ \ / \ Picdri Labrada PUEBLA Cosoltepec/i Chilpancingo . ^ wu»uiivpw/ • Mixleca Baja ' jlX&gt; .

COMPARISONS OF GLYPHS WITH COEFFICIENTS Writing in Mesoamerica was manifested on several media, but the earlier the inscriptions the greater the predominance of stone and ceramics as the represented material. In the coast the major ity of known inscriptions occur on stone. Although data on the size of inscribed monoliths are scanty, the carved surfaces that have been measured range from .34 m2 to 5.19 m2. Nothing is known of the geological origin of the carved rocks nor their quarrying sources. One of the most conspicuous traits of the carvings is the rep resentation of human figures and isolated signs. Most of the glyphs are accompanied by coefficients. The possibility that these numerical notations refer to day names of the Mesoamer ican calendar can be tested since the calendrical reckoning sys tem predicts 20 different signs associated with numerals ranging between 1 and 13. So far some 18 glyphs comprising 12 differ ent categories have been documented in the inscriptions from the coast. Since the value of the accompanying coefficients var ies between 2 and 12, the predicted number of signs and the range of the numerals is not exceeded. Thus, those glyphs are either a direct (if chronological in value) or indirect (if nomi native in function) reflection of the ancient sacred calendar.3 Except for one dubious case (Figure 3), the convention for rep resenting numbers is by bars and dots.4 Almost all the signs accompanied by the numerals can be grouped using the arbitrary and descriptive alphabetical classi fication developed for Zapotee calendrical glyphs (Caso 1928; Urcid 1992). Figure 4 presents a partial list of glyphs from the coast using as a model the latest reconstruction of the Zapotee day list (Urcid 1992). One of the premises underlying this table is that the order of day names in all Mesoamerican day lists is invariably the same (Caso 1963, 1967; Edmonson 1988; Seler 3 Glyphs accompanied by numbers can have two functions: chrono logical, if they were intended to indicate the date of an event; or nom inative, if they were meant to designate the name of mortals and supernaturals according to the day on which they were born. 4The only exception, from the petroglyphs at Cerro Tepalcates, Chacahua, is the representation of a five-unit value by means of dots instead of a bar (Figure 3). In fact, this may not be a numeral at all, but rather the remnants of an eroded circle of dots decorating a noncalen drical glyph.</page><page sequence="3">Westernmost extent of Zapotee script 143 Figure 2. Carvings of unknown provenience that might come from the coast: (1) Santo Domingo Tlaitinango (attributed provenience) (Museo Frissell, Mitla, Oaxaca, Stone 8402); (2) unknown provenience (Museo Nacional de Antropología e Historia, Mexico, Stone 12); (3) unknown pro venience (INAH-CRO storeroom, Cuilapan, Oaxaca, Stone 10-140404); (4) unknown provenience (present-day location unknown; drawing based on a photo taken by John Paddock in 1964 at the old Museo Nacional de Antropología, Mexico; now designated MNA Stone 13); (5) greenstone fig urine, ]affe Collection, New York (photo in Easby and Scott 1970:No. 164). Examples not to relative scale. 1904a; Stross 1983). Due to regional variation in the emphasis on metaphorical links associated with the day names, however, calendrical inscriptions present various epigraphic possibilities: (1) day-name glyphs with similar forms and meanings; (2) glyphs with similar morphology and different meanings; and (3) signs with different forms that have the same or equivalent meaning. An example of the first possibility is the glyph representing the seventh day in the calendrical systems of highland Meso america. This glyph is the icon of a deer, and the meaning of that day name in several Mesoamerican languages is "deer." The case of the Zapotee Glyph L and Nahuatl glyph Ollin illustrate the second possibility. Both signs represent an eye with volutes, that is, they have similar forms, but they occupy different po sitions in their respective day lists and consequently have dif ferent meanings. That Glyph L cannot be a semantic or metaphorical equivalent to "motion" or "earthquake" is based on the fact that the seventeenth position in the Zapotee day list (Xoo = Earthquake) — the position of an annual marker —is occupied by Glyph E (the quadripartite division of the earth). The function of Glyph E as year bearer is now well established (Urcid 1992).5 Glyph L, on the other hand, has been correlated with the sixteenth position in the day list, whose Zapotee name (Lao) in early colonial times meant "eye" (Cordova 1987:289). The sign for the third day in the Mesoamerican calendar il lustrates the third epigraphic possibility. The glyph used to rep resent that day in later calendrical systems was the pictograph of a house in the Mixtee and Nahua conventions, and an ab stract symbol probably derived from an opening in the earth in the Maya script. The native names (Cuau, Calli, Akbal) trans late literally as "house," "night," or "darkness" (Seler 1904a; Smith 1973a; Tedlock 1982; Thompson 1971). According to Zapotee scribal conventions, the pictograph for this day was that of an owl. Although the translation of the sixteenth-century Zapotee name for the third day (Laala) remains problematic, and the metaphorical link between the concepts of "house" and "owl" are still poorly understood, the nocturnal character of this bird establishes a link with the notion of "night" and "dark ness."6 Supporting this relation is the chronological function of the Owl glyph as a year bearer in the Mixtee calendar, where the annual markers occupied positions 3-8-13-18 in the day list (Jansen and Winter 1980). Despite the differences in signs, the concepts conveyed by the pictographs of a "house" and an "owl" are metaphorically linked and the signs equivalent. It should be noted that the reconstruction of the Zapotee list in Figure 4, which differs significantly from attempts by previ ous scholars (Caso 1928, 1967; Edmonson 1988, 1992; Leigh 1958; León 1905; Macías Villada 1956; Seler 1940b; Whittaker 1980), accounts for 628 calendrical glyphs from central Oaxaca and is based primarily on internal evidence, that is, on the corre spondence between the iconicity of the glyphs and the meaning of the Zapotee day names recorded by Fray Juan de Cordova in the sixteenth century.7 The partial list for the coast in Figure 4 shows how the writ ing tradition of the Pacific littoral participated in the day-name glyphic conventions prevalent in the central valleys. The only 5Thus, the reading of Glyph L on Monument 3 from San José Mogote as "One Earthquake" (Flannery and Marcus 1991:42) is in correct. 6The expression Ojear el ave la casa—Toloaaya appears in the Spanish-Zapotec vocabulary of Fray Juan de Cordova (1987:289). Also, Stross (1983:246) notes an interesting oppositional pairing in Nahuatl day names Calli (third day) and Acatl (thirteenth day). As a year sign, Calli is associated with the direction west, and the year sign Acatl is asso ciated with the east. In turn, east has qualities of "fortunate," "fertile," and west has the opposite. Cordova (1886:214) states that the owl was (and still is) a major symbol of bad omens among the Zapotee. 'Cordova gathered his information on the calendar in the Tlacolula area of the central valleys some 50 or 60 years after initial contact between the Spaniards and Zapotee.</page><page sequence="4">144 Urcid o o o o Figure 3. Petroglyphs from Cerro Tepal cates, Chacahua, Oaxaca (from Jorrín 1974:F¡gure 19a). notable exception is the glyph in the first position, which is an example of the "Reptile's Eye" (RE) glyph. Whereas the RE glyph in the chart —which occurs on Stela 1 from Cerro del Rey—is the only known example from southwestern Mesoamer ica, the sign is pervasive in the central and western highlands at the sites of Teotihuacan, Xochicalco, Cacaxtla, Tula, Teote nango, Texmelincan, and Piedra Labrada (Figure 5).8 The tentative link of the RE glyph with the first position in Figure 4 differs from the commonly accepted placement of the sign in the second position (Caso 1967; Edmonson 1988, 1992) and agrees with iconographic arguments (von Winning 1961). Caso's correlation was advanced at a time when the Zapotee glyph occupying the first position (Glyph V) had not been ad equately identified in central Oaxaca and the correlation of the Zapotee year-bearer M to the second position in the day list had not been conclusively demonstrated. In fact, the link established by Caso was based on the analysis of calendrical glyphs at Xo chicalco. Having interpreted a reptilian glyph from the site as representative of the "alligator," he stated that "if at Xochicalco a glyph appears with a resemblance to a known sign [in this case to the Mexican Cipactli], then the same position in the day list cannot be represented by a glyph of unknown meaning [in this case the RE glyph]" (Caso 1967:168; translation by the author). This rule, however, contradicts Caso's (1928:44) own obser vation that day glyphs may have alternate forms.9 Thus, the reptilian glyph from Xochicalco interpreted by Caso as the rep resentation of the "Alligator" could have had two variants: the complete reptilian head and the reptilian eye (RE glyph). If so, the variant that followed the principle of pars pro toto would have been much more common at Xochicalco than the entire reptilian head.10 However, since the Xochicalco glyph with the complete reptilian head has all the defining attributes of the Zapotee Glyph M, and Zapotee Glyph V has a variant that is morphologically similar to the RE sign (Figure 6), alternative correlations in the Xochicalco glyphic day list are possible. These include anchoring the RE glyph to the first position and placing the glyph of a reptilian head in the second position.11 Implicitly, Caso's placement of the RE glyph in the second position was also based on the notion that the glyph functioned as a year bearer, a conclusion derived from the inscription on Texmelincan Stela 2, Guerrero. Here the RE glyph appears below an interlaced trapeze (TR sign) (Figure 7). However, it is increasingly clear that the TR motif, which no doubt represents a head diadem (Berlo 1983), has multiple functions in the same graphic system depending on its context. Although used contem poraneously in several regions of Mesoamerica, the function of the TR sign as a year glyph seems to be restricted exclusively to the Ñuiñe writing system.12 Given the epigraphic contexts of the TR sign in the scripts from the central highlands, it seems that in these systems the glyph could not have been intended as a period marker. This conclusion can be illustrated with Stela 1 from Teotenango, Toluca, where the TR sign accompanies glyphs "Serpent," "Deer," and "Water" (Figure 8). These glyphs occupy respectively the fifth, seventh, and ninth positions in the Mesoamerican day lists. Since the year bearers have to be spaced five positions from each other in the day list, the glyphs in the stela —being spaced by 2, 2, and 6 positions —cannot have been year bearers in the same calendrical system.13 8 An example of the RE calendrical glyph is also known from Stela 1 of Piedra Labrada in Veracruz. The monolith must date to between a.d. 400 and 800 (Navarrete 1976:31-34) (see Figures 1 and 5-9). 'Fourteen uncommon calendrical glyphs that function as day-name variants have been detected so far in the corpus of Zapotee signs (Urcid 1992). 10The present ratio of RE glyphs and reptilian head glyphs at Xo chicalco is 13 to 1. "From Maya hieroglyphic materials, and based on phonetic evi dence, David Stuart (personal communication 1992) suggests that the RE glyph is very likely equivalent to Mexican "Reed" (thirteenth posi tion in the day list). Although this position has not been filled in the coastal glyphic list, such a placement would contradict the identifica tion and anchorage of year bearers in the Xochicalco list (Caso 1967: 166-186). 12More data from the Mixteca Baja are needed to detect a possible early shift in year bearers (from positions 2-7-12-17 to 3-8-13-18) and a concomitant retention of the TR sign as an annual marker. I3Edmonson (1988, 1992) postulates the existence of different yet coeval reckoning systems (with distinct set of year bearers) within the same script, but such epigraphic and calendrical practices are without</page><page sequence="5">Westernmost extent of Zapotee script 145 Approximate meaning in English Alligator Lightning 7 Ballgame ?

Since the sign is also known to accompany several different noncalendrical glyphs and representations of prominent mor tals (Figure 9; see also Figure 2, No. 2), its metonymic functions seem to involve the notion of rulership in a political sense (lord ruler) and in a metaphorical sense as applied to time reckoning (a given year as ruler of time). It appears now that the interlaced A-O sign used as the year glyph in the late Mixtee script is either a case of disjunction based on a modified version of the Ñuiñe interlaced trapeze, or a symbol that, despite morphological sim ilarities, had an independent origin. COMPARISONS OF NONCALENDRICAL GLYPHS Calendrical similarities between coastal and central Oaxaca are paralleled by similarities in a handful of noncalendrical signs foundation. To argue that the stela from Teotenango records an equiv alence between different calendrical systems would imply that three dif ferent sets of year bearers were involved, that is, those occupying positions 5-10-15-20, 7-12-17-2, and 9-14-19-4. Except for the last two sets, no Mesoamerican calendrical system is known to have used Set V (cf. Caso 1928:56-57; Thompson 1971:127).</page><page sequence="6">146 Urcid Figure 5.

(Figure 10). The comparison shown in Figure 10 does not in clude common signs like "sound scrolls," representations of "nose plugs," and "shells" since their epigraphic contexts in the coast are unknown. As in the case of the RE glyph at Texmelin can and Cerro del Rey, another apparent loan or reintroduction from the central highlands is the glyph for "blood" that occurs on Stela 3 from Piedra Labrada, Guerrero. This sign has an interesting pattern of representation in central Oaxaca (Fig ure 11). An early version of the sign appears on Monument 3 from San José Mogote, clearly associated with the glyph for "heart" and the depiction of human sacrifice (Flannery and Marcus 1991:42). A slightly later version of the sign —with one to three prongs — appears with decapitated heads that must have formed part of one of the several "Danzante" narrative pro grams at Monte Albán. This variant of the blood glyph fell into disuse in Oaxaca by the Monte Albán II period, and might have been adopted at that time in the Mexican Highlands. Mean while, the earlier variant shown in SJM-3 continued in use as late as Monte Albán Illb in the central valleys and also in cer tain areas of the coast. From the known repertoire in the litto ral, there is at least one noncalendrical glyph on Río Viejo Stela 8 that apparently does not have a counterpart in other regions. This sign has a conical element with a circle on top and a cur vilinear extension that seems to hang down from the circle (Fig ure 10, No. 13). FUNCTIONAL COMPARISONS The scriptural similarities noted above between coastal and high land areas relate not only to epigraphic conventions but to the function of carved monoliths as well. As in central Oaxaca, some of the stones found on the coast formed facades or other architectural elements of public buildings. Two cases, one from Rio Grande 2, the other from Nopala, illustrate this practice. The Carved Monoliths from Rio Grande 2 Figure 12 presents a sketch of the site features mentioned by Jorrin (1974:40), including the highest mound at the locality (A) and a large, low mound southwest of it (B).14 The northeast corner of Mound B has several carved stones that, at the time of Jorrin's survey, were partially exposed by looters' pits. The work of the survey crew was limited to cleaning the area in front of each stone and digging a stratigraphic pit in front of Monu ment 5. Although the spaces between the monoliths were not excavated, the disposition of the human figures clearly indicates that the stones are in primary context and that they constitute a thematic arrangement. Stone 3 forms the angle of the corner and has two carved surfaces. Monument 3b has a standing per sonage in profile, facing east. The carving on side 3a is mostly obliterated, yet it probably contained another standing figure facing north. Monument 2 shows a standing personage facing south, Stones 4 and 5 depict people facing west, and Stone 6 has a figure facing east. Given this pattern, it is probable that the unexcavated areas between Stones 2 and 3, 3 and 4, and 4 and 14A more comprehensive sketch of the site has been published (Zárate Moran 1986:75), but its correspondence to Jorrin's features remain to be determined.</page><page sequence="7">Westernmost extent of Zapotee script 147 1 Reptilian head glyph from Xochicalco Caso's correlation based f -\ 1 Reptilian head glyph from Xochicalco Glyph of the first day-name in the calendars from the central highlands morphological similarity 3 Zapotec Glyph M Comparison of Xochicalco and Zapotec reptilian glyphs Morphological similarity between Zapotec Glyph V and the RE glyph from the central highlands Figure 6.

Stela 1 from Teotenango, Toluca. 5 might have other carved stones, and that at least the north ern facade, if not the entire basal perimeter of the platform, was decorated with carved stones. A staircase may have spanned the space between Stones 5 and 6. Other patterns in the stones are discernible. The three blocks at and near the southwest corner are taller than those flanking the hypothetical staircase. Also, Stones 3 and 4 are not as wide as Stones 2, 5, and 6. Because of their narrow surfaces, the upper torsos of the human figures in Blocks 3 and 4 do not seem to include the arms of the personages. The figures in the other blocks do have arms, and the individuals depicted hold differ ent kinds of objects. The figure in Stone 5 seems to carry a staff in the right hand and a decapitated human head in the left.15 The personage on Stone 6 carries a staff in the left hand, and possibly a banner in the right one. The dress is similar in all figures. Their faces are covered by a buccal mask, their eyes are goggled, and their ears contain large plugs. A cartouche with Glyph E covers their torsos. The three rounded ornaments hanging from each cartouche may rep resent shells, and because of their repetition on all the stones are not likely to be numbers. The individuals shown on Stones 2-4 wear sandals, but the legs and feet of the personages in Stone 5 are zoomorphic, resembling the extremities of a raptorial bird. The figure on Stone 6, only partially excavated, may have the same talons. Despite the different degrees of obliteration, all figures seem to carry the same kind of headdress. Those on Stones 4 and 6 are the most complete, and clearly represent an anthropo-zoomorphic image decorated with a noncalendrical Glyph D. This imagery— which has its counterpart in the Mix tec Yahui and the Nahua Xiuhcoatl —is pervasive in central 15 Joyce and Zeitlin (1992:9) identify the object in the right hand as a sacrificial knife.</page><page sequence="8">148 Urcid Oaxaca, and has great chronological depth (Urcid 1992).16 Stones 3 and 5 also include the representation of a monkey in front, below the human figures. As noted by Joyce and Zeitlin (1992:8), the theme of the Rio Grande 2 program is undoubtedly related to the ballgame cult. Decapitated heads and humans transformed into birds are themes expressed in narratives associated with ballcourts at El Tajin and Monte Albán (Figure 13).17 One form of the Xicani representation in central Oaxaca is as a tenoned head, several of which have been found in the rubble or construction mate rial of ballcourts (Berlin 1951; Caso 1935; Oliver 1955; Wicke 1957). The only two examples of Xicani tenoned heads found outside the central valleys of Oaxaca are from Jamiltepec in the coast, and from Xochicalco in the central highlands (Figure 14). Other Xicani representations from highland Oaxaca occur in headdresses of individuals, or as turtle-humans who carry sac rificial knives. The Yahui imagery in the Mixtee codices also appears as part of ritual paraphernalia and is associated with ballcourts and human sacrifice (Figure 15). The thematic program from Mound B at Rio Grande 2 lacks epigraphic elements. There are no calendrical notations, nor are there glyphs that identify the human figures depicted on the stones. In this sense, the coastal example more closely resem bles the narrative at El Tajin. In contrast, the program adjacent to the ballcourt at the main plaza of Monte Albán has inscrip tions that add an historical dimension to the theme of the ball game cult. The Carved Monoliths at Nopala Decorating a wall near the administrative building in the present-day town of Nopala are 14 carved monoliths (Fig ure 16). Aside from the fact that they were apparently removed sometime in the present century, nothing is known of their dis covery, provenience, or context. However, except for Stones 5 and 7, all the monoliths are stylistically related and might have formed part of an iconographic program. Presumably, all could have come from the same locality, and given their great size and weight, they must have been dragged from a site relatively close to their present location. Although their original disposition cannot be determined, several patterns seem to be present. Six of the 12 stones depict larger human figures (1-4, 11-12). Stone 12 is broken, and only the lower portion is available. Stones 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14 show slightly smaller figures. Three of the larger figures (Stones 1, 2, and 3) wear elaborate headdresses. The main elements of the headgear in the figure on Stone 1 are a knotted band and stripes. The person on Stone 2 seems to wear a jaguar helmet, and that on Stone 3 a serpent helmet. The figures on Stones 1, 2, and 12 have the same posture. With one hand they hold a laurel-shaped knife, and with the other the symbol of "heart." Under the hand of the figure on Stone 1 appears the oldest version of the Zapotee symbol for "blood. ' The personages in Stones 2 and 12 were evidently identified by their calendrical names, but only that on Stela 2 is legible. It seems to represent the Glyph 10L (Eye). Only the numeral 13 can be identified on Stone 12. A common feature of these stones is the body posture, with vertical torsos and arms crossing the chest, the hands resting near the shoulders. Such a posture, interpreted by Judith Zeitlin (1993) as a hallmark of supernaturals, is infrequent on Zapotee ceramic effigy vessels, but there are seemingly coeval examples in other media from central Oaxaca and both neighboring and distant regions (Figure 17). Based on similarities to certain fig urines from the Monte Albán Illb and IV assemblages and some of the Monte Albán V penates, it appears that the posture might be related to the representation of venerated ancestors rather than the depiction of supernaturals. If so, the Nopala program might follow the genealogical emphases so pervasive in highland Oaxaca, where sculptures depict married couples of important lineages over several generations and identify some of these peo ple by their calendrical names. Isolated Stelae The practice of erecting free-standing monoliths within public settings was common and widespread on the coast, with some 70 examples reported so far (De Cicco and Brockington 1956; Jorrin 1974; Long 1974). However, most of these are plain, un carved, stones. In contrast, not a single plain stone and only few examples of carved, free-standing monuments are known from highland Oaxaca.18 There are, however, a number of carved stones from the coast that seem to have been intended as stelae (Figure 18). Stone 3 from Piedra Labrada, Guerrero. This monolith depicts a person with elaborate dress. The standing figure has Glyph 10A at the level of the abdomen and wears sandals and jaguar claw gloves. The head is covered with a jaguar helmet, deco rated at the top with a radiating ornament of stripes. Although the body appears in frontal view, the legs are shown in oppos ing profile. The head faces left. Dangling from the claws and fangs are depictions of the "blood" glyph in the version com mon in the Mexican Highlands. Stone 1 from Rio Grande 1. This monument depicts a person with a jaguar helmet. The headgear, which does not cover the face as in the previous example, is decorated at the top with an ornament of stripes. It also includes a hanging spotted skin with the claws of the jaguar lying on the shoulders of the person. Only the upper body of the figure is shown; it is executed fron tally, with the arms crossed over the chest and the hands rest ing near the shoulders. In the lower part of the carving appear two glyphs: 7S and 3B. These signs are framed within a geomet ric design, giving the impression of some kind of enclosure. The circles might represent the profile view of rods, and if so, the 16Because of its temporal priority in central Oaxaca, the imagery has been arbitrarily named Xicani, the Zapotee term given by Cordova (1987:216v) for "necromancer." The same meaning applies to the Mix tec word Yahui (Smith 1973b). 17Stone NP-5 from Monte Albán is a period 111b carving (a.d. 600 800). It shows a man-bird grasping a humiliated person (sacrificial vic tim), who is then being presented to an important figure in reclining position. This scene suggests that the interpretative sequence established by several authors for the panels in the "South Ball Court" at El Tajin (García Payón 1961; Kampen 1972; Spinden 1933; Wilkerson 1991) is incorrect, since the reclining individual is not the sacrificial victim. 18Carved stelae occur at Monte Albán (4); Yucuita, in the Mixteca Alta (1); and Yaguila, in the Sierra de Juárez (1).</page><page sequence="9">Westernmost extent of Zapotee script 149 Figure 9.

Of the isolated monoliths, those from Río Viejo are the only ones with a firmly documented location. Four stones have been found associated with the largest architectural feature at the site, a complex of two mounds with a plaza between them (Figure 20). Stone 8, the best-preserved monolith, depicts a personage dressed in a sim ple loincloth knotted at the waist, and an elaborate headdress that includes, protruding from its back, a small jaguar head.19 The personage wears sandals. The lower body and the head are in left profile, but the torso is in frontal view with the arms crossed over the chest. The way in which the hands and fingers are treated is anatomically impossible; the thumb flexes over the dorsal side of the hands. The palms rest near the shoulders. The face of the individual seems to be covered with a jaguar mask showing a prominent canine. Nonetheless, the nose is more anthropomorphic than feline. Two glyphs appear along the left edge of the stone. The lower one, which might be a Glyph L, seems to be accompanied by two plain numeral bars. The upper sign is noncalendrical and so far seems to be unique, with no counterpart in the Zapotee corpus. Although apparently coeval, the carved stones from Piedra Labrada, Río Grande 1, Cerro del Rey, and Río Viejo show a wide range of variation, particularly in representations of hu man bodies. Yet, certain themes and conventions cross-cut this variability. All sculptures depict personages dressed as jaguars and accompanied by calendrical glyphs. Joyce and Zeitlin (1992:10) interpret these figures as deities or deity impersona tors, and in the case of the stela from Rio Grande 1, describe the jaguar as being in a "diving-god" position. However, based on iconographic and ethnographic data from several regions of Mesoamerica, an alternative interpretation is that they represent 19 Joyce and Zeitlin (1992:10) argue that the personage appears to be "attired in ballplayer costume, with a knee protector on one leg and what seems to be a scroll-decorated yoke around the waist."

Zapotee iconographic data and Zoque ethnography (Wonderly 1946) suggest that this particular creature may have been associated primarily with males (Figure 21). The allusion to the powers of the elite in transforming themselves into jaguars is best exemplified by Cerro del Rey Stela 1 and Rio Viejo Stela 8. In other monuments, the wearing of feline head, skin, and paws, provide an implied statement of those powers. Other layers of meaning —conveyed by symbols and by the pos ture of the figures —allude to human sacrifice (Stone 3 from Piedra Labrada and Stone 1 from Cerro del Rey), or to the ancestors (Río Grande Stela 1 and Río Viejo Stela 8). The occur rence of two glyphs with numerals on Stone 1 from Rio Grande suggest that both the jaguar-lord and an undepicted consort are being identified by their calendrical name. It is likely that the main intent of these monuments was to depict deceased, vener ated, local rulers as public symbols that legitimized the prevail ing social order. WRITING THROUGH TIME ON THE COAST If similarities in glyphs and in the use of inscriptions can be established between coastal and highland Oaxaca, does it mean that the littoral was part of the cotradition that gave rise to writ ing in southwestern Mesoamerica, or was the region a recipient of already established scribal practices? More epigraphic mate rials and adequate chronological controls are needed to answer these questions satisfactorily, but there is a discernible trend in the available evidence. 20Since nagual is a Nahuatl word, the terra "co-essence" has been proposed for similar concepts among other and much earlier Mesoamer ican groups (Houston and Stuart 1989).</page><page sequence="13">Westernmost extent of Zapotee script 1 53 Figure 14.

The earliest purported evidence of writing from the coast appears on a small jade statuette in a private collection described by Piña Chán (1960). The piece, which represents a seated per sonage whose back is carved with incised motifs, was said to have been found in a tomb at Pochutla. According to Pifia Chán, the facial features and iconographic elements in the fig ure's forehead resemble Late Formative pieces from the central valleys of Oaxaca (Figure 22). However, analysis of the face and carving on the back are hampered by the fact that Pifia Chán's rendering cannot be checked for reliability. The published pho tographs are underexposed and do not include details. From the available drawing, no element of writing comparable to those in the corpus of Monte Albán I —with the exception of an apparent numeral bar —can be seen. The possibility that the carving was a later addition on the figure cannot be eliminated, nor can the possibility that it is a fake inscription on an original piece. But even if the carving is authentic but not coeval with the manufacture of the statuette, the elements do not represent signs of a known early script, either Zapotee or Isthmian. Moreover, we are dealing with a portable object of purported provenience. Available evidence suggests that the coast did not play a role in the early develop ment of writing, a conclusion supported indirectly by the set tlement-pattern data. As observed by Joyce (1991, 1993), there is little apparent evidence of sites or a hierarchy of settlements in the western littoral until the Late Formative period. Based on associated archaeological features suggesting a ter mination ritual and on certain iconographic details, two mono liths from the coastal site of Bajos de Chila (Stelae 1 and 3) have been tentatively assigned to the Late Formative-Early Classic period (Jorrin 1974) (Figure 23). Although the carvings on the stelae are poorly documented, no elements of writing seem to be present. Since the style of these monuments does not resem ble Zapotee (Monte Albán IIIa-b) or Ñuiñe conventions, their chronological placement might be correct. If so, there is still no evidence of a script on the coast at this time.</page><page sequence="14">154 Urcid 2 6 Figure 15.

Most of the known epigraphy from the coast seems to date between a.d. 600 and 900. Such an assessment is based mainly on glyphic and thematic similarities with Monte Albán IIlb ma terials from the central valleys, the Mixteca Baja (Ñuiñe), and post-Teotihuacan manifestations from the Mexican Highlands. Specific links can be established by means of stylistic criteria. For instance, in terms of the conventions for representing the human body, Piedra Labrada Stela 3 resembles certain Ñuiñe carvings (Figure 24). In the case of Stela 1 from Rio Grande 1, Paddock noted the similarities of the personage's headgear to the one on a Ñuiñe urn from Cerro de las Minas (Paddock 1966: 196-197, Figures 226-230) (Figure 25).

There are only a few carved monoliths that postdate the tenth century a.d. known in the coast, particularly at Tututepec (cf. Piña Chán 1960:Photos 5, 6, and 9). However, these carv ings lack elements of the Mixtee script, the last pre-Hispanic writing system in Oaxaca. In summary, and notwithstanding regional peculiarities, the littoral of Oaxaca and Guerrero adopted scribal conventions from highland Oaxaca. Thus, it is likely that these coastal areas did not participate in the emer gence of writing.</page><page sequence="16">156 Urcid Figure 18. Carved stelae from the coast: (1) Piedra Labrada, Guerrero, Stela 3; (2) Rio Grande, Oaxaca, Stela 1; (3) Cerro del Rey, Oaxaca, Stela 1; (4) Río Viejo, Oaxaca, Stela 8. INTERREGIONAL INTERACTIONS The archaeological record from the coast indicates complex pat terns of interactions with other regions of Mesoamerica (Brock ington 1966; Fernández Dávila and Gómez Serafín 1988; Joyce 1991; Joyce and Winter 1989; Zeitlin and Joyce 1992). The in scriptional evidence reinforces these observations, but it is of limited use so far because most of the epigraphic data pertain to a short period between a.d. 600 and 900. Nevertheless, both archaeology and epigraphy should be considered together. In some of the papers in this issue, the evidence and intensity of interaction is usually measured in terms of traceable materials like obsidian. However, a decrease in quantity of a particular item does not necessarily mean that other less traceable elements (in this case scriptural conventions) followed the same trend. Also, the wide interregional distribution of certain traits makes it difficult to establish their origin and subsequent patterns of dissemination. If interaction were exclusively the result of ex change, the relations may not have necessarily been direct. Glyphic, functional, and thematic similarities point to def inite interaction between the coast and the highlands of Oaxaca between a.d. 600 and 900. However, epigraphic data do not show whether contact was directly established with Monte Albán in the central valleys, or whether other areas, like the regions of Sola de Vega and Miahuatlan, acted as intermediar ies. Despite the shared traits, the origin of a few dissimilar con ventions on the coast is also interesting. At least two symbols, the RE glyph and one form of the sign for "blood," appear to be borrowings from the Mexican Highlands, since not a single example of these two signs (except for the early "blood" sym bol at Monte Albán) has been documented in the central valleys of Oaxaca. As determined by obsidian counts, there was a loos ening of ties with the Basin of Mexico between a.d. 600 and 900 (Joyce and Zeitlin 1992); for this reason, the coastal adoption of these scribal conventions must have been from terminal Teotihuacan sites in regions like Cuernavaca, Toluca, and Puebla Tlaxcala. Given that both the RE and "blood" glyphs occur in carved stones from Guerrero, but not in Ñuifie materials, the interaction appears to have been direct and through a western route. It cannot be assumed that shared traits between two distant regions always resulted from exchange. Another scenario for ex plaining similarities is migration, and specific cases of ancient population enclaves have been suggested for the coast (Brock ington 1974). The case for Chontal-speaking groups is partic ularly interesting. During past surveys of the littoral, a ceramic ware designated Talun Carved was found in several localities. The ware, dated between a.d. 600 and 900, shows affinities with ceramics from the Gulf Coast, and its origin has been attributed to the western Maya region (Brockington 1966:266-270, 1974:6; Long 1974:67, 86-96). Talun Carved seems to have a wide geo graphical distribution along the central portion of the coast, though it does not reach as far west as the Rio Verde drainage (Arthur Joyce, personal communication 1992). Thus, the ce ramic distribution partly overlaps with the present-day extent of the Chontal language. The ware, a fine-paste pottery, is char</page><page sequence="17">Westernmost extent of Zapotee script 1 57 Figure 19.

These designs include human figures, icon ographic elements, and glyphs. Although Brockington main tains that the ware evinces similarities with materials from Tabasco, comments by Proskouriakoff, Thompson, Bernal, and Leigh (cited in Brockington 1966:268-269), state that the motifs are only remotely Maya, non-Maya, or Zapotee. The amount of Talun Carved ceramics recovered in surveys is very small (Brockington 1973:Figure 6A; Long 1974:10, Fig ure 3), and only one piece has reportedly been found at Monte Albán (Caso et al. 1967:361, Figure 299c).

Iden tifiable signs with coefficients include Zapotee Glyphs J (No. 2), T (No. 5), Z (Nos. 1-2), and Y (No. 4); noncalendrical signs include Glyphs M (No. 7) and V (No. 9). Some of the fragments depict scenes reminiscent of the Zapotee genealogical slabs (Nos. 1-7). However, other scenes do not follow highland Zapotee conventions. For instance, Fragment 8 shows an individual sit ting cross-legged holding a fan over what seems to be a reclin ing personage whose bent leg is the only remaining portion of the body. Fragment 10 shows a monkey with tail wrapped around a cocoa plant. The panels on the complete vessel (No. 17) show a personage within the jaws of a serpent. Although the ware, or at least its technology, might have originated in Tabasco, some of the decorations correspond to conventions known from highland Oaxaca. Other motifs, how ever, seem to be peculiar to the coast, including fans, monkeys, and cocoa plants. Such a mixture of traits would imply an ad aptation of migrant potters to specific economic circumstances.

Is it then possible to determine the past linguistic affil iations of coastal groups? If we postulate that a script reflects linguistic properties (phonetic and grammatical), an examina tion of the panorama of languages in the region might be in structive. Today, the Pacific littoral along Oaxaca and Guerrero is an ethnic and linguistic mosaic, with speakers of Amuzgo, Mixtee, Chatino, Zapotee, Chontal-Tequistlateco, Nahuat, and Huave (Figure 27). Although the genetic relations between these lan guages have been worked out (Hopkins 1984; McQuown 1967:Figure 15), little is known of the processes that led to their present geographic distribution on the coast. The Chontal, Figure23. Stelae 1 and 3 from Bajos de Chila (after Jorrín 1974:Fig ures I8d and b). Figure 24.

Stela from Río Grande 1 compared with a Ñuiñe effigy vessel: (left) Cerro de las Minas, Huajuapan (Museo Frissell, Mitla, Effigy Vessel 7419); (right) Río Grande 1, Oaxaca, Stela 1. Nahuat, and Mixtee enclaves in the southern Isthmus are appar ently the result of migrations of groups from Tabasco (Chontal Tequistlateco), the central highlands (Nahuat), and western Oaxaca (Mixtee) (Brockington 1974). The archaeological and ethnohistoric data from the Isthmus indicate a late eastern expansion of Zapotees, a concomitant displacement of the Zoque, and the sudden intrusion of Huave (Zeitlin 1978:174). The Amuzgo enclave on the western coast might be the re sult of very early migrations from southern Puebla or northern Oaxaca, since, in terms of common linguistic developments, the language has close ties with Popolocan and Chinantecan (Hop kins 1984:36). Or, alternatively, Amuzgo might represent a lin guistic isolate separated as the result of the expansion of Mixtee toward the south and east. Since Mixtee expanded to the coast during the Postclassic (Fernández Dávila and Gómez Serafín 1988; Spores 1993), Chatino and Zapotee —two closely related branches of Zapotecan —might at one time have had a broader distribution towards the west. Joyce and Winter (1989:256), for instance, propose an in situ development for the present-day speakers of the western portion of the littoral, and Winter (1989:66) specifically suggests that "the large occupation in the Lower Rio Verde region was probably the center of Chatino groups in Early Urban times." Thus, there is a seeming overlap between two closely related languages of the Zapotecan branch and similar scriptural conventions in central Oaxaca and the coastal region. CONCLUSIONS The comparison of the few available epigraphic examples from the coast with inscriptions from highland Oaxaca indicates that writing in the littoral was derivative. The earliest evidence can be dated to the late Formative period, but it involves a porta ble object of uncertain origin. Most of the data pertain to the time between a.d. 600 and 900, when calendrical conventions on the coast were almost identical to those from highland Oaxaca. Since they occur as discrete elements accompanying representations of people, they seem to function as names, iden tifying prominent mortals according to the day on which they were born. This was also a pervasive practice in highland Oaxaca. Both coastal and highland Oaxaca exhibit similarities in the use of composite thematic programs for decorating facades of public buildings. On the coast, however, there is a marked trend towards the erection of stelae, the great major ity of which are plain. Along with certain similarities, there are also conspicuous differences. For instance, in the case of calendrical notations, no examples of the Zapotee year glyph/year bearers (set 2-7-12 17) have been discovered. To detect annual reckonings requires the identification of a consistent association of a special sign (the year glyph) with four signs that are spaced five positions from each other in the day list (year bearers). Yet, this is contingent on a much larger epigraphic sample than is now available. So far there is no evidence of glyphic sequences on the coast, whereas in central Oaxaca several different textual formats and reading orders have been detected (Urcid 1992). Regarding diachronic patterns of interaction, the epigraphic and iconographic data indicate ties between highland Oaxaca and the coast probably as early as the Late Formative period. Because of the lack of data, nothing can be said for the period between a.d. 200 and 500. Between a.d. 600 and 900, however, two routes of interaction can be detected: highland Oaxaca coast (calendrical names of venerated local rulers, ballgame theme, and Xicani imagery) and Mexican Highlands-Guerrero coastal Oaxaca ("blood" glyph and the RE glyph). Interaction with the western Maya area seems to have involved the actual movements of people, who apparently utilized their own tech</page><page sequence="22">162 Urcid Figure 26.

The epigraphic similarities between coastal and highland Oaxaca strongly suggest that languages of the Zapotecan branch were spoken in large parts of the western coast between a.d. 600 and 900. Based on the present distribution of languages, Chatino and Zapotee are the best candidates, although Papa buco or other now-extinct languages could have been also in volved. The absence of monuments and lack of epigraphic data from the eastern littoral might reflect the maximum eastern coastal extent of the Zapotecan languages in antiquity. Given the paucity of known inscriptions, it is necessary to inspect the original monoliths, to survey for more examples, and to concentrate on adequate documentation of partially exposed materials like the program from Rio Grande 2. Mound B at this site seems to have more carved stones in primary context, dec orating the basal wall of the platform. By searching for more data we will eventually be in the position to understand what makes writing from the coast different from scripts in other parts of highland Oaxaca (Zapotec-Ñuiñe) and central Mexico. This in turn will permit further discussion of changing patterns in scriptural conventions along the littoral, assist in detecting the dynamics of interregional interactions, and help us to appreci ate more fully the uniqueness of this region.</page><page sequence="23">Westernmost extent of Zapotee script 1 63 Figure 27.

RESUMEN Este trabajo emplea comparaciones epigráficas y funcionales de monumentos grabados del altiplano y la costa oaxaqueña para tratar problemas sobre (1) el origen y desarrollo de la escritura en el suroeste de Mesoamérica, (2) interacciones macroregionales, y (3) la afiliación lingüística de los grupos costeños antiguos. Tomando en cuenta la es casez de datos epigráficos, particularmente a lo largo de la costa, la evidencia actual indica que la escritura costeña se deriva del altiplano central oaxaqueño y que el litoral no jugó un papel en el origen de la escritura en Mesoamérica. Dado que la mayoría de los datos epigráficos de la costa pueden fecharse entre 600 y 900 d.C., sólo se pueden detec tar algunas interacciones interregionales, incluyendo contactos con sitios del altiplano central a través de Guerrero, con Oaxaca central a través de áreas intermedias como Sola de Vega y Miahuatlan, y con Tabasco, aparentemente debido a migraciones. Las semejanzas epigráficas entre la costa y el altiplano central oaxaqueño sugieren que los grupos de habla chatino y otras lenguas de la familia zapotecana tuvieron una distribu ción costera más extensa en el pasado.
