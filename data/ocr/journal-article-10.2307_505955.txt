ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA AWARD FOR DISTINGUISHED ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT VIRGINIA R. GRACE Virginia Randolph Grace has laid the foundations of a new and productive discipline within archaeology through her lifelong study of stamped amphora handles. Because of her work, wine jars and their stamps now provide a tool for closely dating archaeological contexts and a primary index for tracing and quantifying ancient trade. Excavators, historians, epigraphers, and economists are now building upon her pioneering research. To such scholars around the world she is an outstanding representative of North American archaeologists. Virginia Grace received her B.A. from Bryn Mawr College in 1922, and first went to Greece as a member of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in 1927-1928. She returned to Bryn Mawr as a graduate Fellow for an M.A. in 1929, and then spent three more fellowship years in Greece and the eastern Mediterranean developing her specialty. Her travels and fieldwork included excavations at Halae, Cyprus, and Pergamon, where she studied a deposit of stamped handles that was to prove critical in fixing the order of Rhodian magistrates named in stamped handles. She also dug as a member of the staff of the Agora Excavations, and by 1934 had published in a substantial work (Hesperia 3.3, which became her Ph.D. dissertation from Bryn Mawr) the stamped handles found during the first two seasons of the excavations. American Journal of Archaeology 94 (1990) 293</page><page sequence="2">294 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 Continuing to work at the Agora through 1938-1939, the year she held a Guggenheim Fellowship, Virginia Grace was the last member of the American School to leave Athens in 1940. She spent the war years partly in Cyprus and partly doing war work in Turkey and Africa. From 1945 to 1949 she was a Visiting Member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, after which she returned to Greece as an Edward Capps Fellow of the American School. In that year alone she read and sorted some 20,000 handles at the Agora and in the National Museum at Athens, and in the course of those labors established the catalogue of Knidian Types used in identifying Knidian stamps. In the following decades she classified the handles from numerous other sites. A pivotal point in the study of amphora stamps was her analysis, based on several work-periods in Alexandria during the 1960s, of the massive collection of Lucas Benaki (installed by her in the Mus6e Greco-romain), which enabled her to refine the Rhodian chronology. The research files to which she and her team, including Maria Petropoulakou and Andreas Dimoulinis, are still adding, have grown into unique archives of stamped handles (totaling some 150,000 records) from all over the ancient world. For years, with characteristic generosity and precision, she has answered requests for information that have poured into her office from an international clientele. Besides assisting the publications of many others, she has herself over 40 specialized studies with a chronological and geographical range from the Canaanite jars of the Bronze Age to the Rhodian amphoras on board the ship wrecked at Antikythera early in the first century B.C. Her publication with Mrs. Petropoulakou of the handles found in the House of the Comedians at Delos (Exploration archeologique de Delos 27.14) remains a fundamental handbook for the field. She has also been at pains to make the stamped handles and jars themselves accessible, most strikingly in the large study collection she arranged at the Agora, which includes handles ordered in cabinets for convenient reference, ranks of whole jars in the basement of the Stoa of Attalos, and a display of jars and stamped handles in Shop IV of the public museum in the Stoa. In an analogous way, she thoughtfully laid out in Amphoras and the Ancient Wine Trade (Picture Book 6 in the series of the Agora Excavations), for the pleasure of the non-specialist and for the edification of the scholar, the story of how these jars were used to store and ship wine and oil in antiquity and how the archaeologist mines information from them today. Her excellent relations with archaeologists of many nationalities have resulted in notable collaborations such as the corpus of stamped handles found at Thasos (Etudes thasiennes IV), which she wrote with M. and Mme. Bon of the French School at Athens. A measure of her impact upon the profession was the international colloquium on amphoras held at the French School in 1984. She has helped and encouraged many with an interest in antiquity, not least students at the American School, and has played no little part in creating a sense of community among scholars in Athens. Because of her broad interests, her cordial connections extend beyond the archaeological world as well. The Greeks among whom she has lived for so long regard her as one of their own and esteem her highly. With good reason Virginia Grace has been called "die 'Nestorin' der Amphorenforschung." We honor her for her vision in articulating the significance of this special class of artifacts for students of classical antiquity, her acuity in extracting conclusions from the mass of material she collected, and her perseverance through difficult years. The Archaeological Institute of America is proud to award its Gold Medal for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement to Virginia Randolph Grace.</page><page sequence="3">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 295 POMERANCE AWARD OF THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA FOR SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO ARCHAEOLOGY HAROLD E. EDGERTON Dr. Harold Eugene Edgerton-inventor, scientist, teacher, and friend-it is the Archaeological Institute of America's honor to award you the Pomerance Science Award for the outstanding contributions that have so helped the archaeological community over the past half century. Dr. Edgerton, known affectionately as "Doc," has earned international recognition for his achievements in the fields of stroboscopy and ultra-high-speed photography, as well as the development of sonar. Holder of 45 patents, Dr. Edgerton's pioneering research laid the foundation for the development of the modern electronic speed flash. He perfected the use of stroboscopic lights in both ultra-high-speed motion and still photography, capable of showing objects moving at a speed beyond the perception of the human eye, such as bullets or hummingbirds in flight. His work led to the critical achievement of photographic night reconnaissance for our pilots in World War II and the photography of atomic explosions. His documentary film, Quicker 'n a Wink, won an Oscar from the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Dr. Edgerton's development of watertight cameras and strobes as well as side-scanning sonar and sub-bottom profiling sonar have opened up new doors for both the underwater archaeologist and geologist. With sonar, Dr. Edgerton mapped the entire sunken city of Port Royal, Jamaica, and located the long-lost Civil War ironclad Monitor sunk in 230 feet of water off Cape Hatteras, to mention only a few of "Doc's" sonar discoveries for archaeology. He has worked closely with Jacques-Yves Cousteau in exploring seafloors throughout the world. Currently, he is developing sonar for positioning equipment in the sea and for the exploration of the sub-bottom. Dr. Edgerton was born in Nebraska and graduated from the University of Nebraska before coming to M.I.T. for his M.S. and D.Sc. He is now Professor Emeritus at M.I.T., where many students have loved him and profited from his remarkable teaching over the years. Dr. Edgerton is one of the founding partners of E.G. &amp; G. (Edgerton, Germeshausen and Grier), a company specializing in electronic technology. Dr. Edgerton is the author of many books and articles, including: Moments of Vision (1979); Flash, Seeing the Unseen (1954); Electronic Flash, Strobe (1979); and Sonar Images (1985). When once asked the secret of his long and creative career, "Doc" replied, "Work like hell, tell everyone everything you know, close a deal with a handshake, and have fun." There is no one more beloved by the archaeological community than "Doc" Edgerton. As a scientist we honor you for your unique inventions that have so helped so many archaeologists do their work. As a long-time friend, we thank you and give you our enduring affection. [Professor Edgerton died in Cambridge, Massachusetts on 4 January 1990 at the age of 86, a week after receiving this award-Ed.]</page><page sequence="4">296 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 ARCHAELOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA JAMES R. WISEMAN BOOK AWARD ANNA MARGUERITE McCANN The Archaeological Institute of America is proud to honor Anna Marguerite McCann as the first recipient of the James R. Wiseman Book Award for her outstanding recent publication, The Roman Port and Fishery of Cosa: A Center of Ancient Trade. Anna Marguerite is an internationally renowned scholar, a brilliantly successful popular lecturer, and a master teacher whose infectious enthusiasm for learning and insatiable intellectual curiosity have enlightened and enthralled students at Swarthmore College, Barnard College, the University of Missouri, University of California, Berkeley, New York University, Trinity College, and, currently, at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Her book, which we honor today, represents the culmination of over 20 years of field work and research on Portus Cosanus, a small maritime installation north of Rome. In all ways, it embodies and represents the best of scientific investigation and reporting. It is a landmark work in marine archaeology, a field in which she has pioneered and has helped define during her illustrious career. Rarely, and far less frequently than we would like, a book appears that is immediately recognized as a "classic"- a work that will have an immediate and permanent impact on our discipline. The Roman Port and Fishery of Cosa is such a study. It has been universally acclaimed in a series of glowing reviews in journals around the world and has already received a prestigious award; it was judged the outstanding book of 1987 by the American Association of University Presses. G.E. Rickman, writing in our own American Journal of Archaeology (92 [1988] 302) concluded his review by stating: "McCann has set us a splendid example of such interdisciplinary cooperation and, by her use of pioneering archaeological techniques and the sheer breadth of her approach, has given a wholly new animation to port studies." We can only second his praise. New archaeology demands collaborative research and scholarship. Anna Marguerite gathered a coterie of gifted scholars at Cosa to assist in providing the broadest possible presentation of the archaeological material. Twenty- two contributors appear in her work. Never before has an ancient port received such a creatively detailed and comprehensive study. Such a complex effort might easily have failed if not for her uncommon organizing ability. Her book stands as testimony to this asset. Its many parts became an entity of unparalleled worth. All of her associates are worthy of comment and praise, but, in particular, Joanne Bourgeois, John P. Oleson, Elaine K. Gazda, and Elizabeth Lyding Will prepared chapters of extraordinary importance. The results of their joint efforts is far more than a study of the ebb and flow of life in an early port and commercial establishment on the western Italian coast. It is a tour de force that is now the model for all future port studies and marine archaeological explorations. Anna Marguerite has expanded our vision; she has challenged her peers to meet her standards of excellence and imagination; she has demonstrated what an interdisciplinary approach to archaeology can achieve; she has gracefully told the story of this port site and its trading activities, and finally, she has skillfully edited a massive work with diverse appeal to all who are interested in ancient maritime affairs and port studies. The James R. Wiseman Book Award acknowledges our gratitude to her and her collaborators for their stellar scholarship, creative insights, and cogent writing, and for such a handsome presentation of their research. It has often been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. We end our recognition of Anna Marguerite's exceptional book with our wish that in the future our colleagues will attempt to imitate the scholarly excellence, breadth of vision, integrated research, and insightful prose that distinguish The Roman Port and Fishery of Cosa. There is no finer model to follow.</page><page sequence="5">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 297 ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS The abstracts of the papers appear in the order of presentation and are followed by an alphabetical index of authors. SESSION I: PLENARY KEYNOTE ADDRESS: A PARTNERSHIP: George Rapp, Jr., University of Minnesota, Duluth This paper addresses the importance of the integration of archaeometry into archaeology to prevent archaeometry going its own way as a separate scholarly discipline. The author assumes the following are true: 1) The archaeological record as we know it is vanishing; hence doing archaeology in the 21st century will be different from doing archaeology in the 20th century; 2) Excavation archaeology is destructive of our vanishing cultural resource base, hence nondestruc- tional methods and analyses must be pursued whenever and wherever possible; 3) In order to explain cultural and social change archaeologists observe, measure, and analyze cul- tural and environmental remains, hence (as very minimum) archaeology students must learn to observe, measure, and analyze all the relevant evidence; 4) Archaeology is not a discipline with a single set of related paradigms but rather is a multidisciplinary amalgam requiring concepts and meth- odologies from a host of separate disciplines such as anthro- pology, ecology, geology, geography, art history, economics, and osteology. One might even suggest that the designation archaeologist requires an adjective or prefix, e.g. classical archaeologist, geoarchaeologist, anthropological archaeolo- gist; and 5) Archaeometry will play an ever-increasing role in the analysis and interpretation of archaeological remains. Given these conditions and the current thrust and status of archaeometry it is suggested that the university depart- ment structure in the United States (where archaeology is taught in classics and anthropology departments) is not well suited to the integration of archaeometry into archaeology. To strengthen the partnership of archaeology and ar- chaeometry it is proposed that: 1) a full partnership be established throughout the planning, execution, interpreta- tion, and publication of each archaeological project, and 2) there is a need for the establishment of additional Archae- ology departments and interdisciplinary graduate programs bringing together the various archaeological subdisciplines. SESSION II A: CERAMIC ANALYSIS VARIABILITY-FROM STYLE TO TECHNOLOGY: Geor- geana M. Little, Boston University The stylistic and morphological variability of archaeolog- ical ceramics from most pottery-producing cultures has been studied in detail. The technology of ceramic production, however, has been less thoroughly examined, and the vari- ability within the production cycle has been largely ignored. Since ceramic artifacts are the products of technology, this tendency to examine only the finished product, while ignor- ing the methods of production, can lead to simplistic or erroneous conclusions. This paper focuses on Iron Age pottery from northwest- ern Portugal, where a lack of stylistic and morphological variability has forced archaeologists to examine the technol- ogy of production, in order to supplement the meager data obtainable by more traditional means. Although the pottery appears, stylistically and morphologically, to be fairly ho- mogeneous, suggesting centralized production, an exami- nation of the production process indicates a great deal of variability in the way that it was made, and points, more probably, to local production. In studying any product that results from the application of technology, all aspects of that technology, not just the finished product, need to be analyzed, routinely, to avoid unwarranted conclusions. ETRUSCAN CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY: EVIDENCE FROM A SECOND-CENTURY B.C. CONTEXT AT CETAMURA: J. Theodore Pe&gt;ia, State University of New York, Albany This paper reports the results of a program of composi- tional analysis involving a group of ceramics from the site of Cetamura, a small Etruscan/Roman settlement located in the Chianti Mountains. These materials, recovered during the 1987 and 1988 field seasons of the Florida State Univer- sity/State University of New York, Albany excavations at Cetamura, formed part of a large fill layer deposited inside a building of unknown function during the second half of the second century B.C. The group consisted primarily of utilitarian vessels, with only a small amount of fine tableware (black gloss ware and Volterran pre-sigillata). The utilitarian sherds were examined by binocular microscope and four distinct fabric classes identified on the basis of matrix color and inclusions. In order to test the validity of this classifica- tion and obtain more detailed compositional information, representative sherds were refired in an electric kiln and reexamined, then subjected to petrographic analysis. Each of the four fabrics identified was employed for a well-defined set of vessel forms having a distinct function (e.g., cooking, storage, serving). Three are likely to be of local origin, and analytical results indicate how potters at Cetamura employed locally available raw materials to condition the working prop- erties of ceramic pastes and the functional characteristics of finished vessels. The fourth fabric is a variety of the special- ized cookware referred to as Pompeian red ware. This differs in mineralogical composition and technological characteris- tics from the varieties of Pompeian red ware reported from sites in coastal/southern Etruria, Latium, and Campania, suggesting the existence of a previously unrecognized pro- duction center somewhere in northern or northeastern Etru- ria.</page><page sequence="6">298 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 TRADE AND MIGRATION? GREY BURNISHED WHEEL- MADE WARES OF THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN: Su- san Heuck Allen, Brown University This paper analyzes a corpus of grey burnished wheel- made wares from the eastern Mediterranean belonging to the end of the Late Bronze Age and associated with a north- west Anatolian grey ware called Grey Minyan. By means of macroscopic examination, scientific clay analysis, and tech- nological studies, I define the fabrics and clarify their sources. It is now clear that the material is not homogeneous. Although my study is still underway and scientific analyses (neutron activation and ceramic petrography) have not yet been completed, already, on the basis of my visual inspection of ceramics from sites in Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, and the Levant, four wares have been identified. Northwest Anato- lian Grey Ware is the primary focus of my study. Other wares, mistaken for Northwest Anatolian Grey Ware, are Pseudo-Minyan, Cypriot Handmade Burnished Ware, and Trojan Tan Ware. Through an examination of the Trojan wares, a pattern of sporadic trade and perhaps migration has emerged, from the northeast Aegean islands and north- west Anatolia to Cyprus and the Levant. CYPRIOT RED POLISHED WARE FABRICS IN THE EARLY AND MIDDLE BRONZE AGE: Jane A. Barlow, Cornell University A study of a wide sample of Cypriot EB and MB pottery shows that the predominant ware of these periods, Red Polished ware, was composed of two different types of clay used selectively. An understanding of the characteristics that stem from the technology, which are not reflected in the current typology, may reveal some of the complex regional and chronological relationships in this 600-year span of time. Petrographic and chemical analyses of Red Polished pot- tery from the MB site of Alambra-Mouttes (12 miles south of Nicosia) showed that the two clay types, calcareous and non-calcareous, originated in separate geological rings that encircle the central Troodos mountains (J.A. Barlow and P. Idziak, Archaeometry 31 [1989] 65-76). They were therefore accessible to potters throughout most of the island. A com- mon field test, validated by SEM, used hydrochloric acid to enlarge the Alambra sample and show that the two clays were routinely exploited at a single site. The current report is the result of nine months of field- work in Cyprus during which Red Polished ware from six further sites was tested. The sample of 2000 sherds repre- sents three different regions of Cyprus. Because more than one site was sampled from each location, the results carry not only regional but also chronological information. Preliminary results show that selective use of clays was characteristic of Red Polished ware throughout most of Cy- prus. The two clay sources do not signify different manu- facturing centers as previously suggested. Patterns of clay use vary somewhat among sites. Increasing differentiation probably took place and, as the qualities of each variety of clay came to be appreciated, specialization occurred. Con- nections with preceding and succeeding wares can be traced more clearly. LATE BRONZE AGE TRADE: TRANSPORT STIRRUP JARS: Halford W. Haskell, Southwestern University The speaker, with H. Catling, R. Jones, and P. Day (British School at Athens and Fitch Laboratory), is completing an analysis of Aegean transport stirrup jars. The purpose is to test a representative sample of all Aegean transport stirrup jars, since previously analyzed stirrup jars (inscribed) com- prise a very small proportion of the corpus. Chemical (atomic absorption), petrographic, and typological (shape and dec- oration) studies have been done. Crete produced most transport stirrup jars intended for export. Large-scale export of these vessels began only in LB IIIA2, and tapered off drastically after mid-IIIB. As trans- port vases, they document production centers and trade routes and provide primary evidence for specific historical problems. West Crete dominated markets in the Argolid and Thebes. Central Crete sent a few jars to the mainland, in- cluding the single Cretan stirrup jar found at Pylos. Stirrup jars from these two regions of Crete are typologically distinct, reflecting the regionalism seen also in LM IIIA2/B fine ware pottery. Both Central Crete and the Argolid exported stirrup jars to Cyprus and the Levant. It is possible that at least some of the jars with incised Cypro-Minoan marks were inscribed at the places of manufacture. The implications of these findings for broader historical problems are significant. The focus of stirrup jar export in West Crete, and the Central Cretan interest in Cyprus, bear upon the controversy surrounding the Linear B palace at Knossos and the possibility of second-order centers. In any case, the scale of export from Crete indicates considerable economic strength and internationalism throughout much of the island in the IIIA2/B period. EXPERT SYSTEMS IN ARCHAEOLOGY: CHOOSING AN ARCHAEOMETRIC TECHNIQUE FOR CERAMIC ANALY- SIs: S.U. Wisseman, University of Illinois, Urbana- Champaign,J. Fittipaldi, Construction Engineering Research Laboratory, T. Good, Z. Budic, and T. J. Kim, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign The use of expert systems in archaeology has grown in recent years as archaeologists become more aware of the computer as a diagnostic and decision-making tool. To date, expert systems have been created primarily for interpreta- tion of archaeological data, either of excavation data or of results from materials analysis (e.g., Vitali and Lagrange, "VANDAL: An Expert System for the Provenance Deter- mination of Archaeological Ceramics Based on INAA Data," in Computer and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology 1988, BAR-IS 446:2, 369-75). A recent project at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in conjunction with the U.S.</page><page sequence="7">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 299 Army Corps of Engineers' Construction Engineering Re- search Laboratory (CERL) is a prototype expert system for materials analysis of archaeological artifacts, primarily ce- ramics. SARA (System for Archaeological Research and Analysis) is designed to assist archaeologists and Corps staf- fers in planning and budgeting for materials analysis both before and after excavation and in choosing appropriate techniques based on the types of archaeological questions being addressed. Although originally conceived of as a sys- tem for North American archaeology, the program deals with questions of dating, composition, provenience, and technology which have broad applications in Old World archaeology as well. Our experience indicates that the process of constructing an expert system for this extraordinarily complex intersec- tion between archaeology and science may be as valuable as the end product. The usefulness of the system, both to archaeologists and to non-archaeologists who make budget- ary decisions about archaeometric research, depends on the "knowledge base" contained in the program. What and how much to include, the nature of the logic paths and help screens, and the limits of the program are all crucial decisions that must be made by the expert system team in order to create an efficient and "user-friendly" archaeological tool. BRONZE AGE TRADE PATTERNS IN THE AEGEAN AND ADJACENT AREAS: SCIENTIFIC ANALYSES AND CUL- TURAL INTERPRETATIONS:John F. Cherry and A. Ber- nard Knapp, University of Cambridge Scientific measurement in modern archaeology has be- come a key aspect of material cultural studies, but the rela- tionships between the archaeological evidence, analytical results, and cultural interpretations of them have seldom been set out clearly. This is particularly apparent in the array of provenience studies (e.g., neutron activation, lead isotope, proton-induced x-ray and gamma-ray emission, and atomic absorption analyses) applied to metals, ceramics, and other materials in the Bronze Age Mediterranean. One of the several aims of a long-term, multi-institutional, interdiscipli- nary project sponsored by the Leverhulme Trust and the British Academy (Science and Archaeology: Bronze Age Trade Patterns in the Aegean and Adjacent Areas) is to investigate the utility of multivariate statistical techniques in the verifi- cation, interpretation, and graphical presentation of ceramic and metal characterization studies, and to consider the valid- ity of groupings already achieved by these means-in short, to establish the geochemical, archaeological, and statistical prerequisites of a soundly based provenience study. The project aims to define the conditions under which certain techniques are reliable, and to assess the relevance of partic- ular analytical and statistical approaches in the construction of trade models for the Bronze Age Mediterranean. Using all available analytical data from Middle-Late Bronze Age Cyprus as a case study, this paper reevaluates the statistical relationship between different geochemical techniques used on the same or similar samples (ores, slags, metal artifacts, ceramics), and seeks to understand and verify (or challenge) those groupings of artifacts, ores, or clays already proposed. The evidence is considered in the light of diachronic changes in raw material sources, intensity of pro- duction, and locus of manufacture, as an example of the extent to which science-based archaeology can help arbitrate between alternative cultural hypotheses. SESSION II B: DIACHRONIC STUDIES IN THE ROMAN PROVINCES EXCAVATIONS AT TEL HADAR, 1989: AN EARLY IRON AGE STRONGHOLD IN THE GOLAN: Moshe Kochavi, Tel Aviv University, Timothy Renner, Montclair State College, and Ira Spar, Ramapo College Archaeological investigation at Tel Hadar, a four-acre mound on the east shore of the Sea of Galilee in Israel, began in 1987 as part of a regional project aimed at illumi- nating Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Graeco-Roman occupa- tion sites in the little-explored southwestern Golan. During the period from Joshua through the early Israelite monar- chy, the Bible refers to the region as the land of Geshur. Tel Hadar, Level I (ca. ninth-eighth centuries B.C.) con- tained an unfortified, presumably Aramaean town with ar- chitecture differing markedly from contemporary Israelite sites. Level II, on which our 1989 efforts were concentrated, was destroyed in a fire during the 11th century B.C. That Tel Hadar was an important center at the beginning of the Iron Age is shown by the double ring of massive Level II fortification walls, and by the site's key location on routes between Syria and Palestine. The main architectural finds of the 1989 season were: 1) a distinctively constructed granary complex of six rooms in which one of the rooms, still sealed, was found to preserve large quantities of carbonized grain; 2) a tripartite pillared room complex connected to the gran- aries that housed large amounts of storage pottery. In future seasons we will sample Middle Bronze and Late Bronze Age strata, the presence of which below Level II is clear from occasional finds of displaced pottery. Work will also be expanded to locate the Level II living quarters and cult areas that presumably occupied the highest part of the tell. THE WINTER GARDENS OF HEROD THE GREAT AT WADI QELT: Kathryn Louise Gleason, University of Penn- sylvania Around 15 B.C. Herod the Great expanded the Hasmo- nean winter palace at Wadi Qelt, near Jericho, to include a new entertainment complex in the Roman style. The author excavated its gardens between 1984 and 1987 in collabora- tion with Ehud Netzer, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. One garden, in particular, was laid out in straight rows of plants potted in ceramic vessels, a simple design contrasting with the luxurious decoration of the peristyle. Based on literary evidence and style, the author has earlier hypothe- sized that the garden was a display of Judean balsam, famed for its fragrance (Bulletin of the Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society 7 [1987-1988]). Balsam, currently thought to be</page><page sequence="8">300 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 Opobalsamum gileadensis, has long-since disappeared from the Jordan Valley and, until recently, no archaeological re- mains have been found to confirm the modern identification. This paper presents new evidence that may help identify the potted plants in the Herodian garden and shed light on the precise taxonomy of the balsam. Soil samples from the garden and from inside the ceramic pots have been submit- ted for pollen and phytolith analysis (by Robert Scaife, In- stitute of Archaeology, London, and Dolores Piperno at MASCA, University of Pennsylvania, respectively). The re- cent identification of a flask of balsam oil from the Dead Sea Caves may provide additional information. Rarely do ar- chaeological remains provide unequivocal support of liter- ary traditions; nonetheless, this paper reports on the contri- butions these scientific techniques can make to the history of ancient Roman gardens. SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE ROMAN TEMPLE AT KE- DESH: Jodi Magness, University of Miami The site of Kedesh is located about 10 km northwest of Hazor in the Upper Galilee of Israel, near the border with Lebanon. The site consists of a large mound, or tell, at the western edge of the Kedesh Valley, and a low hill overlooking the valley about 200 m to the east. On this low hill are the remains of a well-preserved monumental temple, to the west of which is a group of Roman tombs and mausolea. The remains of the Roman temple at Kedesh have been under- going excavation since 1981 by a team of archaeologists from Tel Aviv University. A preliminary report on the 1976-1977 survey and the 1981 and 1983-1984 excavations was pub- lished by M. Fischer, A. Ovadiah, and I. Roll in Tel Aviv 11 (1984) 146-72. The report includes descriptions of the ar- chitectural complex and associated inscriptions as well as a discussion of the iconography of reliefs from the temple. On the basis of the epigraphic and iconographic evidence, the structure is identified by the excavators as a temple dedicated to Jupiter/Baalshamin, and its construction is dated to the second and third centuries A.C. This paper demonstrates that the architectural design and iconography of the temple at Kedesh strongly suggest that it functioned as an oracular temple dedicated to the god Apollo. Certain peculiarities in its architectural design can best be understood in light of its function as an oracular temple, while parallels with the temples at Delphi and Di- dyma suggest that the principal Graeco-Roman deity wor- shipped at Kedesh was Apollo. The construction of the temple at Kedesh in the second and third centuries A.C. was part of a widespread trend, for this period witnessed the revival of oracular centers throughout Asia Minor. Two MILITARY INSCRIPTIONS FROM EASTERN PAMPHY- LIA: James Russell, University of British Columbia Located on the shoulder of Cebel Ires Dagi, 15 km east of Alanya, lie the remains of a small Roman city identified as Laertes by its discoverers, Bean and Mitford. The site has proved rich in inscriptions. In addition to the 39 published by Bean and Mitford, I have discovered several more, in- cluding one in Phoenician previously reported (AJA 87 [1983] 246) and now published (EpigAnat 9 [1987] 1-28). This paper concerns two new inscriptions, each providing interesting information on the presence of Roman military personnel in the city. One, a Greek text incised on a statue-base from ca. 200, records the name of the dedicator, a orqLa0o6pQog (standard- bearer) of Legio XII (Fulminata). Permanently stationed at Melitene on the Euphrates, this legion formed part of the defenses of eastern Cappadocia. The inscription thus rein- forces the evidence that this rugged region of Asia Minor was a major source of recruitment for the eastern legions. It also confirms the tendency for soldiers from the eastern provinces to retain close ties with their native cities during their service and to return to them as veterans on retire- ment-a practice quite different from the retirement pattern of veterans in the western Empire who tended to settle close to their garrison. The second inscription, a Latin text, consists of three joining fragments of a bronze auxiliary discharge diploma now in the Alanya Museum. Dated to the last weeks of Hadrian's reign in 138, it contains much important infor- mation on the Roman military garrison of the joint province of Lycia-Pamphylia. Discussion, however, concentrates on the personality of the recipient. An ex-infantryman from Cyrrhus in Syria, he had served with the First Cohort of Musulami, a regiment originally raised in Numidia, but nor- mally active in the east. Using evidence from other diplomas and military inscriptions, I reconstruct this soldier's career to illustrate some typical aspects of military demography in the eastern Empire.

A ROMAN BATH ON CORFU: Rolf Winkes, Brown Uni- versity A synergasia was formed three years ago among the Greek Archaeological Service, Brown University, and the Catholic University of Louvain-la-Neuve to conduct excavations in the town of Corfu. This is done under the direction of the Ephora for Corfu and Thesprotia, Mrs. Kalliope Preka. The field director is Professor Martha S. Joukowsky; the director of research and administration for the American team is Professor Rolf Winkes; and the director of research and administration for the Belgian team is Professor Tony Hack- ens. Professor Mary B. Hollinshead and Dr. Katerina N. Thomas were also part of the excavation team. The area excavated over three seasons is located across the street from Mon Repos (referred to as Kasfiki property) near the ruin of the church Hagia Kerkyra (referred to as Palaiopolis) and a site where earlier excavations unearthed</page><page sequence="9">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 301 part of the agora of Corfu (referred to as Kokotos property). The first two seasons were devoted exclusively to Kasfiki and during the last season excavations began in the Palaiopolis and Kokotos. Excavated to date have been the remains of a Roman Imperial bath with Hellenistic architecture below and arti- facts that date from the seventh century B.C. to the Byzan- tine period. Mosaics, coins, and ceramics are especially abundant from the fourth-fifth centuries A.C. and future seasons will show whether the bath was public or part of a villa. Computer-assisted record-keeping is part of our chal- lenge. With a Macintosh SE on site-its advantage is a Cyrillic font for translation into Greek-we have developed stan- dards of classification and nomenclature through which the excavation artifact analysis and cataloguing process has been regularized both in English and in Greek. The collaborators plan to publish their discoveries in a series called Kerkyra. THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN EXCAVATIONS AT CAR- THAGE: A CEMETERY OF THE VANDALIC PERIOD: Mark B. Garrison, Trinity University In 1989 the University of Michigan (Kelsey Museum) completed the third and final season of excavation on the Theodosian Wall cemetery. Excavation continued in preex- isting trenches, concentrating exclusively on the latest phase of burial activity (ca. A.D. 425-early sixth century). The aims of the final season were to record and lift more burials and to explore problems associated with road surfaces, the robbing of the Theodosian Wall, the presence of an opus africanum associated with an earlier building, and mosaic burials. As only the second post-Punic cemetery excavated at Carthage, and one of the few in the whole of North Africa, the Theodosian Wall cemetery will provide information valu- able not only to archaeologists, but also to anthropologists and students of religion and social history. The concentration of burials continued to be intense. The three seasons of excavation have now produced over 200 burials. Burial types remained varied, ranging from simple pit inhumations to more elaborate mosaic burials. Bodies were placed parallel to the wall with heads generally at the west. At the far southeast area many compacted earth and mortared surfaces appeared. All of these surfaces had been disturbed by later burial activity. These surfaces lay adjacent to an area of the Theodosian Wall that had been robbed out before burial activity began. The road surfaces may suggest some type of passage through the wall at this point, both before and after it had been robbed out. One mortared floor surface associated with the opus af- ricanum wall was discovered and excavated in 1989. This surface lay on the southwest side of the wall, associating it with a concrete wall that stands above modern ground level. Two possible interior partitions to this structure were also discovered in the 1989 season. This structure was perma- nently put out of use by the construction of the Theodosian Wall, which ran through the structure incorporating the concrete wall into its core. The opus africanum wall was systematically razed to a level course, and subsequently be- came the focus of burial activity. The 1989 season also included the excavation of two mosaic burials, the first ever lifted under controlled condi- tions at Carthage. Both burials proved to be double burials. One structure had an intact mosaic preserving the names of two young children (MARTURIA ET MULIO IN PACE). It lay on a bed of fine clay approximately one meter thick. Below this was a single stone-lined cist, in which the two young children had been placed, one atop the other. The mosaic of the other burial had been disturbed by later cem- etery activity. Only one name was preserved (CODBUL- DEUS IN PACE); however, a small part of a serrated fillet suggested the possibility of another name. In this instance the mosaic rested upon a loose rubble fill with much pottery, approximately 1.50 m thick. Both burials were stone-lined cists, one placed above the other. The cover slabs of the lower cist served as the floor for the upper cist. WORK IN THE COUNTRYSIDE OF LATE ANTIQUE AND MEDIEVAL SICILY: Brian E. McConnell and Giuseppe Castellana, Museo Archeologico Regionale, Agri- gento Ongoing excavations by the Superintendency for Cultural and Environmental Resources of Agrigento are increasing our knowledge of the Sicilian countryside in Late Antique and Medieval times. Work on the farm-villa in contrada Saraceno at Favara has revealed structures of the villa's later phases. Abandon- ment of the complex resulting from the Vandal sack (A.D. 455-468) was followed by construction along the same lines in the villa's former garden area during the sixth century A.C. with subsequent modifications. Rooms of uniform di- mension, agricultural implements, and the absence of lux- ury accommodations characterize the revitalized complex as a center for food production in the larger Roman economy. A small chapel of the seventh century A.C. offers evidence for the presence of Christianity in daily life. Scant traces of walls on a different alignment point to reoccupation of the site during the Swabian period (13th century A.C.). The long span of occupation at this site, furthermore, offers one of the most complete sequences of Roman red-slip and other wares on the island. Excavations during the fall of 1989 explored an area nearby where a trial trench has revealed consistent remains related to the complex. At Montevago along the Belice river valley in western Sicily, the excavation of a contemporary stratified farm com- plex of the fifth to 13th centuries A.C. offers a useful com- parison. Material culture of Arabo-Norman date relates the latest phase of occupation to a nearby group of rock-cut tombs. Tomb typology and evidence for Islamic burial prac- tice in these tombs help to further our awareness of the Moslem population in Medieval Sicily.</page><page sequence="10">302 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 SESSION II C: GREEK ART AND CULTURE THE PARTHENON WEST METOPES AND XENOPHON: Katherine A. Schwab, Fairfield University In his treatise, The Art of Horsemanship (6.3), Xenophon describes a position assumed by a horse in its training for its use both in the cavalry and in parades. This horse, because of its superior strength, is capable of rising up into a half- rear with its hind legs spread apart and firmly planted beneath it, with the hocks nearly touching the ground. Ac- cording to Xenophon, a horse in this pose will be more magnificent and spectacular to ride (10), and it is the finest action proper to a horse (11). J.K. Anderson, in his studies on Greek horsemanship and Xenophon, discusses this pose among others, and the pos- sible connection to works of art from the Classical period. One series of sculptural reliefs, not discussed by Anderson, may be worth considering in this context: the west metopes of the Parthenon. These metopes, with an Amazonomachy, are the least well preserved of the four series of metopes on the building. With the help of C. Praschniker's drawings, F. Brommer's photographs, and E. Berger's casts, it is possible, in some cases, to determine the general outline of some of the figures. In metopes V, IX, and XIII, enough of the mounted horse is preserved to reveal a pose close to that described by Xenophon. The horse in a half-rear allows the rider, an Amazon, to maintain her balance while thrusting a lance at the wounded Greek on the ground. The west me- topes of the Parthenon may be among our earliest known examples of this pose in Greek sculpture, which suggests a tradition or knowledge of the training of war horses in specific poses by the mid-fifth century B.C., and which is recorded by Xenophon during the second quarter of the fourth century B.C. NEREIDS AND EUROPA: WEDDING OR FUNERAL? Judith M. Barringer, Yale University Ten of 13 Attic red-figure fish plates of the fourth century B.C. discovered in South Russia were found in funerary contexts. They were placed in graves after being deliberately broken at the time of burial. All the plates are ornamented with the same scene: the abduction of Europa by a bull sent by Zeus. Nonetheless, they are unusual (there are only three other extant examples of which one was also found in a grave) in their inclusion of Nereids among the protagonists. Scholars have already remarked that the Europa myth makes reference to immortality (K. Schefold, Die G6ttersage in der klassischen und hellenistischen Kunst [Munich 1981] 236-37), and that it alludes to the voyage of the deceased to the Underworld (H. Metzger, Les reprisentations dans la cdra- mique attique du IV" sidcle [Paris 1951] 311-12). The ap- pearance of Nereids on the fish plates confirms and expands Metzger's hypothesis. Nereids were regarded by the ancient Greeks as protec- tresses of sea voyagers (Hdt. 7.191.4-192.1; Eur., Hel. 1584- 87; Anth. Pal. 6.349; Ap. Rhod., Argon. 4.833-81), and they were also depicted on vases as attendants in wedding prep- aration scenes and as witnesses to the abduction of Thetis by Peleus. It is, therefore, not surprising to find them on the Europa fish plates. The Greeks apparently regarded the transition from maiden to woman, that is, marriage, as a metaphorical death and a subsequent rebirth. This idea is supported by Greek tragedy, epigrams, and funerary epi- taphs which liken deceased virgins to brides of Hades, and by the rituals used in ancient Greek weddings and funerals. Nereids have also been identified as escorts of the deceased to the afterlife. Thus, Nereids may act as escorts on voyages, whether literal or metaphorical, in this case for Europa who undergoes a literal sea voyage and metaphorical journey from maiden to woman, and from life to death to rebirth. The use of Europa and the Nereids on fish plates found in graves is thus due to the survivors' desire to ensure a "safe" journey for the deceased on their voyage from life to death to afterlife. ARCHAIC STONE PERIRRHANTERIA WITH CARYATID SUP- PORTS AND THE COLAEUS DEDICATION AT SAMOS: Helga Butzer Felleisen, Indiana University To commemorate his return from a voyage to Libya and Tartessus, the seventh-century B.C. merchant Colaeus ded- icated a large vessel and stand at the Samian Heraion (Hdt. 4.152). Herodotus's description of the figural supports bear- ing this vessel has long been considered the best-preserved example, literary or archaeological, of one type of stand associated with detachable, Orientalizing cauldrons (U. Jantzen, Griechische Greifenkessel [Berlin 1955] 87). Because the corpus of material associated with these large stands is so small, scholars conclude that such figural supports rep- resented only a rare form. One special group of objects whose relationship to these stands has not been fully ex- plored is that of the Archaic stone perirrhanteria character- ized by their caryatid supports. By pointing out the typological similarities between the Colaeus dedication and the perirrhanteria stands from Isthmia and Samos, this pa- per proposes that the mid-seventh-century B.C. perirrhan- teria offer a variation of these large-scale figural stands. An examination of the Isthmia perirrhanterion shows that some figural supports imitated rod-tripods in form, place- ment of ornament, and even iconography; that from Samos appears to follow a simpler, less ornate form like the Colaeus stand. In all cases, however, the emphasis is on the weight- bearing function of the figures rather than on decorative detail. While the origin of the perirrhanteria is much disputed, Sturgeon (Isthmia IV [Princeton 1987] 51) stresses the Sam- ian form of the perirrhanterion at Isthmia (ca. 655 B.C.). This object only shortly postdates the perirrhanterion from Samos (ca. 660). Tartessian ivory combs from a context of 640/630 at the Samian Heraion have been associated with Colaeus's journey to that Phoenician outpost (J.G. Cha- morro, AJA 91 [1987] 227), thus placing the historic voyage earlier in the seventh century. The novelty of Colaeus's gift as implied by Herodotus's depth of detail would suggest a recent introduction of large figural stands to Greece.</page><page sequence="11">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 303 THREE GRIFFINS FOR ONE CAULDRON: REPETITION IN GREEK BRONZE CASTING: Carol C. Mattusch, George Mason University By the seventh century B.C., groups of as many as six protomes were being produced to decorate bronze cauldrons that were offered as dedications in sanctuaries all over the Greek world. Scholars have used stylistic affinities to establish groupings of these protomes, but surely the artist who made such a group was more concerned that his protomes all look alike and that they be close enough in size to fit their caul- dron. Denys Haynes has identified one group of griffins evidently made from a single model: master molds taken from it were used to produce a series of waxes, each of which was worked over individually and then cast (JHS 101 [1981] 136-38). I have identified an example of quite a different method by which a series of bronze protomes was produced to dec- orate a colossal cauldron at Olympia. Of the three griffins now preserved (Athens, National Archaeological Museum no. 7582; New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 1972.118.54; Olympia B 145 + B 4315), each was formed separately from an identical set of thin wax slabs which were shaped and melted together. First the palate was modeled; then it was joined to the sides of the head. Scales were punched into each wax head with one set of tools, and then the tongues, knobs, and ears were formed in solid wax and added separately. In the end, each griffin was an original work, but together the three heads were close enough in size and in appearance to fit a single cauldron. These three griffins, all that remain of a colossal tripod cauldron of the seventh century B.C., give us a sense of the scale and im- portance of the dedication, and clearly illustrate the working methods of a seventh-century artist. FUNERARY USE OF DORIC COLUMN MONUMENTS IN SIXTH-CENTURY GREECE: Elizabeth McGowan, Williams College Freestanding Doric columns were used as tomb markers and votive dedications throughout Greece in the sixth cen- tury. What is the origin and significance of this type of monument? The use of the Doric column in funerary con- texts may imitate burial practices described in Homeric po- etry. A Doric capital in the Corfu Museum bears a verse inscription that corresponds in terms of phraseology and meter to several descriptions of burial in the Iliad and Od- yssey. The Doric column may have been adopted for use as a tomb marker in conscious imitation of the burial practices for Homeric heroes in order to add to the prestige of the deceased. The formal significance of the Doric column as funerary marker may have broader ramifications. There appears to be a connection between the idea of the Doric column used as a turning post on a racecourse and the Doric column as tomb marker. Greek vases show isolated Doric columns used as turning posts in horse and chariot races. Literary evidence for the use of a tomb as a turning post is found in Homer's account of the funeral games of Patroklos in the Iliad (23.329-33), and in Pausanias, in his account of Taraxippos, the hero buried at the turning post of the racecourse at Olympia (6.21.15-19; 10.37.4). A late sixth-century Doric capital in the Argos Museum bears an inscription by the wife of a victorious athlete, killed in battle; perhaps significantly the inscription states that the woman set up her husband's tomb by the hippodrome. In a recent article Mark Davies ("Ajax at the Bourne of Life," Eidolopoia [Rome 1985] 83- 117) explores the allusion to life as a racecourse throughout Greek literature: the literal interpretation of this metaphor can be seen in the use of isolated Doric columns as monu- ments at the terma of life. PANISKA: REPRESENTATIONS OF FEMALE PAN IN ANCIENT ART: Aileen Ajootian, Bryn Mawr College At a critical point just before the Battle of Marathon in 490 B.C., Pan appeared to the Greek herald Pheidippides as he raced to Sparta for help, and later the Athenians, assuming that Pan was responsible for their victory over the Persians, established a shrine to him below the Akropolis (Hdt. 6.105). Throughout the Attic countryside during the fifth century B.C., the proliferation of sanctuaries with evi- dence of rites to Pan is assumed to attest to official Athenian gratitude to this deity. Yet the artistic record in the fifth century does not reflect this new civic interest in Pan worship. The god is represented only occasionally in Attic vase paint- ing, making one of his earliest appearances on the well- known name vase of the Pan Painter (ARV 2 550.1) where he pursues a youth, usually identified as the shepherd Daphnis. Satyrs in the fifth century, however, always ubiq- uitous in Greek vase painting, begin to be shown in domestic settings, complete with female satyrs and their babies. The name piece of the Flying Angel Painter (ARV2 279.7, ca. 460 B.C.), one of the earliest examples of this genre, presents a satyr father playing with his son. The private life of cen- taurs was also explored in Greek art, although more rarely. Zeuxis's famous lost painting (late fifth-early fourth century B.C.), described by Lucian, depicted a centaur family; a mosaic of the fourth century B.C. at Pella has a male and female centaur, and a frieze of centaurs, both male and female, decorated the Temple of Dionysos at Teos (second century B.C.). Similar illustrations of Pan's home life are not preserved from the earlier periods, possibly because these other creatures, satyrs and centaurs, though Mischwesen, are not divinities; Pan's iconographical repertoire may have been governed by the stories recorded in literary sources about his encounters with nymphs and shepherds. But a group of Roman representations of female Pans suggests that this aspect of Pan's nature may have been developed later on. At least two sculpted girl Pans play pipes, and other sculptures of female Pans sit in the same cross-legged pose as their male counterparts; a bronze figurine of female Pan holds her baby, and the reliefs on an Antonine sarcophagus now in Naples include two images of young female Pans in erotic scenes with Pan and a herm of the god.</page><page sequence="12">304 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 THE EARLIEST DEPICTION OF AN ARMED ACROBATIC DANCE: THE LAMBROS OINOCHOE: Mary R. Mc- Gettigan, University of Pennsylvania The so-called Lambros oinochoe (Louvre CA 2509), an Attic vase dated ca. 750-725 B.C., bears a single decorative frieze consisting of 16 figures, all helmeted, most bearing arms and some equipped with Dipylon shields. Previous efforts to explain the scene all commence with the assump- tion that the action takes place on a field of battle and that the figures are divisible into two groups of opposing war- riors. Some scholars (G. Ahlberg, Fighting on Land and Sea in Greek Geometric Art [Stockholm 1971] and K. Fittschen, Untersuchungen zum Beginn der Sagendarstellungen bei der Griechen [Berlin 1969]) have interpreted the frieze as a de- piction of post-battle violence involving the disarming, mal- treatment, and murder of the captured enemy. One author (K. Friis-Johansen, Aias und Hektor: ein vorhomerisches Hel- denlied? [Copenhagen 1961]), while retaining the notion of a battlefield setting, has suggested that the figures are par- ticipants in a peaceful interlude. He proposed that the frieze illustrates three successive events recounted by Homer in the Iliad (7.273-335), with a pre-Homeric epic serving as the inspiration for both the vase painting and the poem. A comparison of this frieze with a large number of Geo- metric depictions of fighting and battlefields demonstrates that it differs significantly from those images in its compo- sition, in the poses and gestures of the figures, and in the disposition of armor and weapons. Instead of combatants, the figures should be interpreted as a line of armed men performing a dance that includes acrobatic movements. The horizontal and "collapsing" figures represent not dead and wounded warriors but dancers who execute leaps, somer- saults, and handsprings like those depicted on Attic, Boeo- tian, and Argive vases of the Late Geometric period and on an Etruscan amphora dated ca. 675-650 B.C. The frieze on the Lambros oinochoe also recalls the particular passage from Homer's description of the shield of Achilles (II. 18.593-605) where the dancers, including young men wear- ing golden daggers, are led in their steps by a pair of acrobats who revolve around them. SESSION II D: COLLOQUIUM: ARCHAEOLOG- ICAL RESEARCH AT THE AMERICAN ACAD- EMY IN ROME EXCAVATIONS IN THE ROMAN FORUM: Russell T. Scott, Bryn Mawr College In the Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome by Ernest Nash one reads the following under "Atrium Vestae": "The residence of the Vestal Virgins, with its large court sur- rounded by columns and decorated with three water basins, was built after the Neronian fire of 64 A.D. and restored and enlarged under Domitian, Trajan, and Septimius Sev- erus. Remains of the pre-Neronian structure were brought to light under the northwestern part of the imperial Atrium Vestae. Their orientation, parallel to the Regia and Domus Publica, differed from that of the imperial building." Nash's description of 1961 is substantially based on the work by Esther Van Deman entitled The Atrium Vestae, published in 1909 and still regarded as the essential work on the subject. Not surprisingly, the excavations in progress by the American Academy in the area sacra of Vesta have yielded results that make it necessary to call into question Van Deman's work as well as providing new evidence on the dynamics of the growth and organization of the cults of Vesta in the Republican and Imperial periods. The major phases of development that can be demonstrated thus far occur in the Archaic period, the second and first centuries B.C., and the early second century A.C. ROMAN FISHTANKS OF THE LATE REPUBLIC AND EARLY EMPIRE IN ITALY: ASPECTS OF THEIR DESIGN AND FUNCTION: James Higginbotham, University of Michigan The raising of fish was both a popular pastime and a profitable enterprise in the Roman world. Roman fishtanks, variously called piscinae, vivaria, or stagna, are found scat- tered throughout the Mediterranean in a variety of contexts and exhibit a high degree of architectural variation. The ancient literary record contains several accounts that high- light the sensational and extravagant character of fishtanks attached to the villas of wealthy Romans. During the first century B.C. the possession of a fishtank became an example of conspicuous consumption and carried with it an image of elevated social status. The popularity of the private fishtank continued into the early Empire, dying out by the end of the second century A.C. While the affluent piscinarii enjoyed raising fish for their own consumption and amusement, the ancient treatises on fishfarming attest that commercially profitable pisciculture was widespread. The agricultural manuals of Varro (first century B.C.) and Columella (first century A.C.) treat pisci- culture as a specialized form of farming but offer slightly different accounts of the functional and technical aspects of the fishtank. An examination of the archaeological remains in Italy serves to confirm and amplify the developments suggested in these literary sources. The great seaside fish- tanks belonging to the villae maritimae of the late Republic gradually give way to much smaller tanks often supplied by fresh water. In addition, the contexts in which fishtanks are found tend to multiply. Urban villas and even sanctuaries become sites where a fishtank is an acceptable component. The demise of the fishtank as a prominent feature of the villa has important implications for the change in social status among the Roman aristocracy during the early Empire. TACITUS, MARK MORFORD, AND THE TRUTH: THE Do- MUS AUREA REVISITED: Larry F. Ball, American Academy in Rome The contemporary literary tradition concerning Nero's Domus Aurea is at once substantial and consistent, but also problematic, as pointed out by Mark Morford in "The Dis- tortion of the Domus Aurea Tradition," Eranos 1968, 159-</page><page sequence="13">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 305 79. Morford makes a sage analysis of all the known literary sources, concentrating on Tacitus, Suetonius, and Martial, and draws several conclusions at odds with current ideas concerning the topography and contemporary reputation of the Domus Aurea. In particular, Morford stresses that con- temporary opinion was considerably less impressed with the building and its creators than modern scholars tend to be. In the 20th century the Domus Aurea is usually regarded as revolutionary, whereas the Romans regarded it as merely gauche. Morford also concludes that the building can have caused relatively little inconvenience to the inhabitants of Rome, few of whom it displaced. Instead it seems to have absorbed land owned by the Emperor plus parts of a sparsely inhabited commercial district on the Oppian Ridge. In the 20 years since Morford's article appeared, the apparent dichotomy between the philological evidence and the architecture has remained moot, primarily for want of a more detailed understanding of the remains. This paper offers an updated analysis of the Esquiline Wing of the Domus Aurea, based on a systematic and comprehensive study of the masonry. Some of the conclusions drawn from this new archaeological work seem to indicate that the liter- ary record as analyzed by Morford is largely correct, and that a number of current opinions concerning the Domus Aurea's design, topography, and ultimate impression on the history of Roman architecture require modification. REDEFINING THE "PALAZZO IMPERIALE" AT OSTIA: Joanne M. Spurza, Princeton University Once the centerpiece of the 19th-century Visconti exca- vations at Ostia, the so-called "Palazzo Imperiale" has pre- sented until recently a neglected, overgrown enigma to students of Ostia and of Roman architecture alike. Situated on the banks of the Tiber, less than a kilometer from the ancient shoreline (modern Regione III), the "Palazzo" in its final phase comprised a large bath complex, two courtyards, apartments, shops, workrooms, and a mithraeum. Its great size, and the quality and extent of its decorations, including two dozen rooms with mosaic floors, gave rise to the persis- tent misnomer of "Imperial Palace," despite the lack of evidence or of any resemblance to standard Roman palace typology. A new study of the "Palazzo Imperiale," under- taken in collaboration with the Soprintendenza Archeologica di Ostia, redefines the complex and clarifies its role within the port city of ancient Rome. This paper presents aspects of the "Palazzo's" layout, construction, and decor, and its position within the context of Ostia's urban topography. Close analysis of its masonry reveals progressive expansion from a small city bath in the mid-second century A.C. to a grandiose, multi-story complex joining domestic, commercial, and cultic functions, by the mid-third. Three successive reworkings of the "Palazzo's" Central Cortile typify this evolution: the triporticate palaes- tra of the Antonine balneum later became the heart of a residential unit of the complex, paved with an elaborate lighthouse mosaic. Comparison with similar large-scale structures at Ostia shows the range of mixed-use within these buildings, as well as the exceptional nature of the "Palazzo's" insula-balneum-insula plan. Redefinition of the "Palazzo Im- periale" sharpens our picture of Tiberside Ostia. Vestiges of structures bordering the "Palazzo"-a porticoed street along its west flank, warehouses on either side-attest to dense urban development and regular city blocks extending out along the river to the far western part of town. Its transfor- mation over the course of a century from outlying balneum to hybrid, multi-use complex mirrors the growth of the busy riparian scene of Ostia's heyday. SESSION II E: COLLOQUIUM: CIVILIZING SYRIA AND MESOPOTAMIA: NORTH- SOUTH RELATIONS IN THE MID-THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. THE URBANIZATION OF MARI AND THE MIDDLE Eu- PHRATES RIVER: Jean-Claude Margueron, Universite de Paris The chronology and the modes of urbanization for the middle Euphrates Valley may be posed in new terms as a result of the past 15 years' research in western Syria, the Habur Plains, and the middle Euphrates valley itself. It is now certain that the creation of the city of Mari was the product of an economic complementarity between the Mes- opotamian basin, the Taurus piedmont, and the Mediterra- nean outlet of western Syria. New excavation and survey data from the Mari region now requiring consideration in- clude: 1) the creation, ca. 3000 B.C., of a city enclosed within a rampart of 1.9 km diameter upon the Holocene river terrace and linked to the river by a canal; 2) region-wide construction of several canals; one of these canals was to irrigate the terrace of the river's right bank while another permitted navigation between the Habur and Euphrates Rivers to avoid a stretch of 120 km of river meanders and dry-season low water. The historical consequences that may be derived from these new data also require examination: 1) the situation of the valley at the end of the fourth millennium when these large works were undertaken synchronous with the construc- tion of the city; 2) the role that can be assigned to neighbor- ing sites such as Terqa; 3) the economic significance of these construction projects; and 4) the fundamental function of Mari and the reasons for the valley's urbanization. In conclusion, Mari may be viewed as one example of the modes of urbanization possible in the beginning of the third millennium in Northern Mesopotamia. AAAUR: WHEN AND How DID IT BECOME A CITY?: Dietrich Siirenhagen, Universittit Heidelberg The urban origins of ASiur can be traced back to the later part of the Early Dynastic period (ED III) when, probably for the first time, a public building-the earliest "Ishtar" temple-was built outside the old settlement mound. Unfor- tunately this mound, which is of rather limited dimensions, was never excavated, so we do not know when the site of the later capital of the Assyrian empire was inhabited for the first time nor what the structure and material culture of this</page><page sequence="14">306 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 earliest settlement looked like. From its size we may assume that ASgur had been a rather small village, probably of little importance, until the above-mentioned innovation took place in an enlarged town area. The installation of the cult of "Ishtar" (=Saugga?) must have been an event of special importance for the town's history, because it remained valid for the next 1,900 years in the same place. There is no evidence so far for a palace prior to the Akkadian period. If it is still hidden somewhere, the old mound of A''ur should be considered. Town walls are not attested until the early second millennium. This cannot be taken as a proof for the nonexistence of defense systems in the third millennium, because in A''ur the complete destruction of older buildings was common. More information is available from early his- torical inscriptions of Akkadian date, which were found at AgSur itself. Here for the first time the title of the later Old Assyrian city rulers, PA = waklum, is attested. For this reason we assume that Avlur had become a city state at the latest in the time of the Akkadian kings, while a still earlier date cannot be excluded. The ground plan as well as the inventory of the earliest "Ishtar" temple make it likely that during the ED III period A99ur had become part of a cultural koine, which we may call "Babylonian" in the widest sense. The cella type with its bent axis and the worshiper statues found inside the temple are, no doubt, of southern origin. Urbanization at Assur was therefore not the result of local development: it received its impulses from outside. The reasons for the growth of the settlement and its "Babylonian" material culture may be seen in the reestablishment of long-distance trade between Ba- bylonia and the mountainous areas in the north, which had collapsed centuries ago (during the Uruk period) and re- mained interrupted during the earlier part of the Ninevite 5 period. Located on the west bank of the Tigris, immedi- ately north of the gorge of Gabal Hamrin, A''ur was the right place to control the trade routes leading up to the Mosul area and further northwest. Obviously the site played an important role during the Akkadian and Ur III period when long distance trade along both sides of the Tigris had been established. This may already have been the case in late ED, though good evidence is still lacking. What speaks in favor of this assumption is that ASgur is the only known northern Tigridian site of pre-Akkadian date with strong Babylonian cultural traits. THE URBAN ORIGINS OF EBLA: Paolo Matthiae, Univ- ersitai di Roma The abstract for this paper was unavailable. THIRD-MILLENNIUM URBANIZATION AND STATE FOR- MATION AT TELL LEILAN: Harvey Weiss and Laura Calderone, Yale University At the beginning and in the middle of the third millen- nium the Habur Plains underwent two different forms of exogenous urbanization and state formation. In the first case, during the late Uruk period (Leilan period IV), south- ern Mesopotamian cities established "colonies" on the Habur Plains, and elsewhere across the lowlands and plateaus of "Greater Mesopotamia," possibly to facilitate procurement of utilitarian copper and decorative stone. These colonies were inhabited by and controlled by southern Mesopotami- ans. On the Habur Plains two such colonies, Brak and Ham- oukar, were larger than 50 hectares. Tell Leilan and its sustaining area show some of the evidence for this exogenous urban system. The "civilization" transported from the south to the Habur Plains during this period transformed some local kinship and political systems within which class was probably determined by local or foreign lineage. When the late Uruk societies in southern Mesopotamia and their northern colonies collapsed, the structure of local Habur Plains agricultural production also collapsed. For- merly sedentary village populations, now without an agri- cultural structure, turned to pastoral nomadism. Over the course of the following 400 years, sedentary population grew in size and political complexity but did not overcome the prestate kinship barriers to class formation, nor the dry- farming transport barriers to settlement nucleation with attendant economies of scale, which result in social stratifi- cation, state formation, and urbanization. The "civilizing of the Habur Plains" was effected in the 27th century (Leilan period IIId) by a second southern Mesopotamian intrusion perhaps, as Childe argued, to se- cure access to other Anatolian resources. This intrusion was not accompanied by the implantation of southern Mesopo- tamian colonies with southern Mesopotamian inhabitants. The structure of southern Mesopotamian society and econ- omy during this episode perhaps led small groups of south- ern agents onto the Habur Plains to exchange still unidentified southern commodities with local chiefs for ma- terials that previously had little "value" on the Habur Plains. Local social relations of production were thereby trans- formed from kin to class. The 1987 Tell Leilan excavations suggested that local chiefs mimicked and then adopted the administrative forms of southern Mesopotamia, including centralized cereal stores sealed with cylinders imitating southern Mesopotamian designs. The regional economy was synchronously transformed and highly stratified cities briefly conquered the transport frictions of dry farming. The 1989 Tell Leilan excavations suggest these were "planned" cities with carefully controlled and demarcated residential quar- ters for labor units. The southern Mesopotamian economy, however, was still more centralized and more productive per capita and per hectare of agricultural land than the northern economy. Within three centuries of their transformation of Habur Plains villages into cities, southern Mesopotamian states, now centralized under the kings of Akkad, systematically de- stroyed the Habur Plains' and other dry-farming cities that they had engendered. The reasons for this are not under- stood. EARLY MESOPOTAMIAN DEVELOPMENT: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: Piotr Steinkeller, Harvard University One of the most significant results of recent Mesopota- mian research has been the growing recognition that the Late Uruk period witnessed a far-flung expansion of the</page><page sequence="15">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 307 alluvial population into the neighboring territories-the Su- siana Plain in Khuzestan, the Diyala Region, northern Syria, most of northern Mesopotamia, sections of Anatolia, and perhaps even the Nile delta. It is generally agreed that this expansion had a profound impact on the Mesopotamian periphery, and that, equally important, its effects were at the root of the subsequent (Jemdet Nasr and ED I-II) de- velopment on the alluvium. So far, however, these issues have been viewed from a purely archaeological perspective, largely neglecting written documentation. This paper will review the relevant historical information, as it can be gleaned from the contemporary and later written sources, with the objective of arriving at a unified picture of early Mesopotamian development (Uruk IV through ED III). SESSION III A: DEVELOPING EARLY STATES DIFFERENTIAL RATES OF EVOLUTION IN THE TRANSI- TION FROM CHIEFDOM TO STATE: Robert L. Carneiro, American Museum of Natural History, and Kathryn Bard, Boston University Chiefdoms, which are known archaeologically, histori- cally, and ethnographically, are the earliest form of complex society. On one level chiefdoms represent the transcending of local autonomy; at their most complex level, chiefdoms usher in the state. Although the early state has been a subject of much investigation, evidence for early chiefdoms, which must have evolved within the past 6,000 to 7,000 years, has not been rigorously investigated. Early states that evolved independently in the Old World include Egypt, Sumer, Indus Valley civilization, and China. But all of these early states exhibit very different rates of social evolution. This study offers a hypothetical equation for rates of social evolution of early states, based on variables of arable land under cultivation, length of fallow in years, total population, and the annual rate of population increase. Although this equation cannot explain the phenomenon of the transition from chiefdoms to states, it offers one per- spective for analyzing differential rates of social evolution, which can then be viewed in terms of culture-specific varia- bles known archaeologically. EMERGENCE OF URBANISM IN ISRAEL: Ze'ev Herzog, Tel Aviv University Recent sociological and anthropological studies of urban- ism tend to challenge V. Gordon Childe's traditional model of the "Urban Revolution." It is suggested that cities did not evolve as a result of gradual accumulation of agricultural surpluses which could support the religious, political, and military establishment, but rather as the outcome of social upheavals. Emergence of urbanism in Israel, and the cyclical process of its disappearances and reappearances, lent sup- port to the opinion that cities did not develop out of pros- perity but as a strategy for coping with socioeconomic stresses. Archaeological evidence of large settlements occupied during the fifth and fourth millennia in Israel is impressive: they covered 10 hectares or more at sites such as Teleilat el- Ghassul, Shiqmim, Gilat, Arad, and Beer Sheba. The econ- omy of these settlements was based on dry farming and animal husbandry but the settlements also provide data on specialization in crafts (metallurgy, ivory-carving) and on social stratification. Ceremonial/cultic centers and prestige goods exposed at these sites attest to the complexity of their social structure as well as to their wealth; yet no scholar would consider these Chalcolithic sites to be cities. It is argued that the emergence of urbanism at the begin- ning of the Early Bronze Age was generated by the climatic deterioration at the end of the fourth millennium B.C. The new condition forced a different pattern of settlement dis- tribution, new subsistence economy, and a new system of social order. Organization into an urban framework is regarded as a strategy for coping with socioeconomic stresses caused mainly by unstable agricultural yields. This process is illu- minated through the architectural analysis of the main cities of the period, such as Megiddo, Ai, Arad, and Beit Yerah. The dominant position of temples in these cities and the lack of luxurious palaces manifest the identity of the power elite. Emergence of urbanization in Israel was a process in which the ceremonial/cultic elite was granted political and eco- nomic power so that the community could alleviate the dire situation by controlling the redistribution of grain and ani- mal products. POLITICAL ORGANIZATION IN LATE BRONZE AGE CY- PRUS: Priscilla Keswani, University of Michigan The Late Bronze Age was an unprecedented period of urbanization, metalworking, and long-distance trade on the island of Cyprus. Recent studies of Late Cypriot mortuary data (P. Keswani, Mortuary Ritual and Social Hierarchy in Bronze Age Cyprus, Diss. Univ. of Michigan 1989) suggest that these developments were accompanied by the emer- gence of elite groups employing distinctive complements of status paraphernalia at major coastal centers around the island. The nature and extent of local and regional admin- istrative systems are at present poorly understood, however, and conflicting interpretations (e.g., a unified island-wide kingdom versus multiple independent polities, dominance of religious versus secular authorities) have been proposed (T. Stech, "Urban Metallurgy in Late Bronze Age Cyprus," in J.D. Muhly et al. eds., Early Metallurgy in Cyprus [Nicosia 1982] 105-15; A.B. Knapp, "Ideology, Archaeology, and Polity," Man n.s. 23 [1988] 133-63). This paper addresses the problem of defining the character, scale, and hierarchical complexity of administrative organization during the Late Cypriot Bronze Age with reference to multiple lines of evi- dence. The size and geographical distribution of the prin- cipal centers, variability in official building complexes, and the distribution of the highest-order valuables and politico- religious symbols in mortuary complexes at different sites are considered. A construct of diversified and fluctuating multi-polity organizations is proposed, and problems re- quiring further archaeological investigation are defined.</page><page sequence="16">308 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 BUILDING X AT KALAVASOS-AYIOS DHIMITRIOS: A CYP- RIOT PALACE: Pamela J. Russell, Emory University Museum of Art and Archaeology, and Alison K. South, Vasilikos Valley Project, Cyprus Building X at the 13th-century B.C. town of Kalavasos- Ayios Dhimitrios, Cyprus, provides a rare example of a Cypriot administrative center of this period. The complex of at least 1,400 m2 lay at the northeastern edge of the ca. 10-hectare settlement, probably at one end of the main street, and further large public buildings appear to have existed nearby. Doubtless the administrative center for the Vasilikos Valley agricultural and copper-mining region of ca. 30 km2, it contained impressive storage facilities includ- ing a large pillared hall where at least 47 huge pithoi stood in rows. Important Cypro-Minoan inscriptional evidence, bronze objects, seals, and large quantities of fine imported Mycenaean tableware also testify to its administrative and aristocratic character. Little evidence of metallurgical indus- try occurred in the building (although considerable amounts have been found elsewhere at the site), nor is there any evidence to suggest a religious function. Building X was destroyed by a substantial fire when the town of Ayios Dhim- itrios was abandoned during the widespread disturbances of around 1200 B.C.; there are no traces of later occupation. Massively constructed with the use of much fine ashlar masonry brought from several kilometers away, the palace is a major architectural achievement. The elegant plan, a square subdivided into three parts with a central court, is not precisely paralleled but there are many general similar- ities of scale, ashlar masonry, and other construction tech- niques with buildings at Enkomi and other Cypriot sites, especially nearby Maroni. Some aspects can be compared with Mycenaean and Minoan palaces, but closer affinities seem to lie in Syria at sites such as Ugarit and Ras Ibn Hani. A LEAD SEAL FROM TSOUNGIZA, ANCIENT NEMEA, AND EARLY BRONZE AGE SYSTEMS OF PERSONAL MARK- ING: DanielJ. Pullen, Florida State University A lead seal, unique for the Early Bronze Age Aegean, was recently excavated at the Early Helladic settlement site on Tsoungiza Hill, Ancient Nemea, as part of the Nemea Valley Archaeological Project. The seal has on its oval face the design of a St. Andrew's cross, with nested angles in the quadrants formed by the arms of the cross. Seals are rare in the Early Bronze Age, especially outside of Crete. Materials used for seal manufacture include stone, clay, ivory, and bronze. Lead has not been reported for seals in the Early Bronze Age; only a few lead seals are known from later Aegean contexts. The motif of the angle-filled cross, of which the Tsoungiza example is a variant, is one of the most common motifs in the Aegean, and is found impressed on pottery and hearth- rims, in addition to sealings and seals, throughout the Ae- gean and the eastern Mediterranean in the third millennium B.C. Arguments have been made that seals are a form of signature or mark of possession. The use of the same seal motif for permanent and temporary marking of objects expands the concept of personal possession and supports the hypothesis that other systems of marking, such as pot- marks, are also personal marks of identification and own- ership. THE DEVELOPMENT AND STRUCTURE OF MYCENAEAN INDUSTRIES: James C. Wright, Bryn Mawr College Basic work by many scholars has documented the evi- dence for a variety of industries operating during the My- cenaean period, but little attention has been paid to their evolution. This paper investigates this issue in order to dis- tinguish the different levels of integration of the industries into the sociopolitical framework of Mycenaean society. The following industries are analyzed: gold and silver plate, bronze vessels and tools or weapons, faience, ivory, jewelry, ceramics, and construction; appropriate textual in- formation is also considered. The products are differen- tiated according to the categories of period of manufacture, attribution to workshop, archaeological context, and com- plexity (resources, technology, and personnel). In conclusion, the study proposes that the organization and structure of early Mycenaean industries were primarily for the purpose of elite consumption. These industries pro- duced prestige-enhancing items for the upper echelon of stratified societies. They had little impact on the economy of early Mycenaean Greece but were of great value in the establishment of a structure of authority. They did not re- quire a complex organizational structure for management and depended upon the technology and developed indus- tries of the Minoan palaces. In contrast, many of the indus- tries of the LH III period were trade-based and relied upon a complex interaction of different resources. They are di- rectly related to the emergence of a more complex political economy, the Mycenaean palace system, and are an impor- tant aspect of the process of state formation in the Late Bronze Age Aegean. EXCAVATIONS AT IVLIJE IN YUGOSLAVIA AND THE EMER- GENCE OF THE SERBIAN IRON AGE ELITE: Frederick A. Winter and H. Arthur Bankoff, Brooklyn College, and Aleksandar Palavestra, Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences DuringJuly 1988, Brooklyn College of the City University of New York and the Balkanological Institute of the Serbian Academy of Arts and Sciences excavated an Iron Age tu- mulus at the locality of Ivlije, in the vicinity of Krulevac, Serbia, Yugoslavia. The tumulus was found to contain cop- per/bronze artifacts and ceramics dating from the Early Iron Age/Hallstatt C period (approximately the seventh century B.C.). The tumulus dates from the years shortly before the expansion of Classical Greek trading interests into the cen- tral Balkans. Recent scholarship has assumed that the evo- lution of complex, stratified societies in the Balkans (and</page><page sequence="17">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 309 throughout early Iron Age Europe) came about in large part because of the early Greek merchants, who would have encouraged the emergence of local elites as a means of facilitating trade. The current excavations suggest, however, that the local elites had been established significantly before the appearance of Greek imports/trade goods in the region. The tumulus at Ivlije was part of a cemetery complex of which three similar tumuli have been previously excavated (although never published) and another four are visible within a ca. 0.5 km radius of the current site. This burial complex adjoins a contemporaneous unexcavated settlement from which our team made surface collections in May and July 1988. The excavated tumulus was ca. 19 m in diameter and rose to a maximum of 0.45 m above the surrounding ground surface. Approximately 60% of the tumulus was excavated. Artifacts found in the tumulus were concentrated within a radius of ca. 2 m from the mound's center. Most were found in two symmetrically placed clusters, both of which contained ceramics as well as metal artifacts. Finds included handmade ceramic bowls, copper/bronze bracelets, fibulae, and a dia- dem as well as iron fragments. SESSION III B: EXCAVATION AND SURVEY FROM GREECE TO NINEVEH THE GREVENA PROJECT, 1988-1989: Nancy C. Wilkie, Carleton College,John Rosser, Boston College, Mary Savina and Richard Doyle, Victoria University of Wellington The Grevena Project is an interdisciplinary survey of the nomos of Grevena, Greece. The area was little-known ar- chaeologically prior to the inception of the project in 1987. Since that time, however, we have identified well over 100 archaeological sites ranging from Early Neolithic to modern. Ceramics from prehistoric sites, especially Early Neolithic, are closely related to those in Thessaly. Hellenistic and Ro- man remains are abundant, but there are few sites from the Early Byzantine period. Geomorphological studies have shown that the landscape was incised 120 to 200 m after the final deposition of Pli- ocene and early Pleistocene braided stream gravels and lake sediments. Incision to modern stream levels was essentially complete by about 9000 B.P. Periods of alluviation are not synchronous with those reported in other areas of Greece and only one can be related to human occupation. Soil studies have shown that before mechanized agricul- ture only a few areas of low terraces and hillslopes would have been suitable for farming. Therefore, pastoralism may have been widely practiced due to lack of suitable arable land. This interpretation is supported by the distribution of archaeological sites and the recent settlement history of the nomos. PHILIP V AND THE DEFENSES OF WESTERN AETOLIA: Joseph B. Scholten, Portland State University, and L. Sebastiaan Bommelje, Universities of Utrecht and Leiden Polybius's accounts of the campaign of Philip V of Mace- don along the lower Acheloos river in 219 B.C. (4.63.7- 4.66.3), and of his march on the Aetolian religious capital, Thermon, in 218 (5.5.11-5.14.7), provide rare testimony concerning the topography of Acarnania and western Ae- tolia during the Hellenistic era. Utilizing these accounts, scholars in the past (most notably W.J. Woodhouse in Aetolia, Its Geography, Topography and Antiquities [Oxford 1897]) were able to identify several sites in the region, including the location of Thermon itself. Between 1984 and 1988, the Aetolian Studies Project of the Universities of Utrecht and Leiden has conducted a new survey of this area. This survey reveals that those sites already known from the Polybian report are part of a much larger network of sites, which links the Lake Trichonis basin and the Acheloos river valley by means of visual communication. This network was vital to the defense of the region, which depended upon the rapid mobilization and concentration of scattered Aetolian forces for its protection. The discovery of this network's existence sheds new light on the strategy of Philip V's campaigns in the region. Philip's march along the Acheloos in 219 can now be seen as a methodical attempt to create a blind spot in the Aetolian defensive system, by depriving this visual communication network of key watch-posts on its western flank. This allowed Philip, in the following year, to execute his rapid advance on Thermon, penetrating the Aetolians' defenses before they had sufficient time to react. Philip's campaign along the Acheloos in 219 made possible his sack of Thermon in 218 B.C.. It was probably designed with that very goal in mind. EXCAVATIONS AT KELENDERIS IN CILICIA TRACHEIA: Yasemin Arnold, Cornell University The summer of 1989 saw the third campaign of excava- tions at Kelenderis, sponsored by the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Selhuk University. Kelenderis, a harbor town northeast of Cape Anamur, is one of the oldest settlements in Cilicia Tracheia. Although it is cited in the literary tradi- tion as a colony of Samos, Apollodorus credits Sandokos of Syria with the founding of the city (Apollod. 3.14.3, Pliny, HN 22.92, Strabo 14.5.3). As one of the few harbors along the coast of Cilicia Trach- eia, Kelenderis was well positioned to benefit from trade along the great sea-lane from Syria to the Aegean. The city, which is mentioned in the Athenian tribute lists of 425 B.C., was for a time a member of the Delian League and issued silver coins bearing Greek legends (CIA I, no. 37). Cilicia Tracheia was a bone of contention between the Ptolemies and the Seleucids in the third century B.C. A hoard of golden tetradrachms of Ptolemy II found in Kelenderis in 1974 may indicate that the city was under Ptolemaic control in the second century B.C. Further evidence for relations with</page><page sequence="18">310 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 Egypt is offered by the funerary vessel of Tycon of Kelen- deris, a Hadra hydria now in the Brooklyn Museum. In this campaign excavation continued in the Classical and Hellenistic necropolis of the city. The tombs have been looted for many years and objects from them are now scat- tered among museums in Turkey and abroad. In the West Necropolis we cleaned a number of underground rock-cut tombs, some previously looted. A red-figure lekythos with flying Nike, an oinochoe of the Fat Boy Painter, and frag- ments of white-ground lekythoi are among the grave goods, indicating trade relations with Greece. Canaanite (Phoeni- cian) trade amphorae, hitherto unattested in Asia Minor, are among the most important grave finds at Kelenderis. These amphorae, parallels for which are found in Cyprus (Soli) and Carthage, are further proof of the role Kelenderis played in Eastern Mediterranean trade in the Classical pe- riod. One undisturbed tomb has yielded late Hellenistic material including a trade amphora, lagynos, and glass un- guentaria, which suggests that the city maintained its impor- tance even throughout the period of piracy in the region. This season we continued cleaning and consolidation of a late Roman bath near the ancient harbor. In the same part of the ancient city we also resumed work in what might have been the theater. HIGHLIGHTS OF EXCAVATION AND RESEARCH AT SAR- DIS, 1987-1989: Crawford H. Greenewalt, jr., Uni- versity of California, Berkeley Continued excavation by the Harvard-Cornell Archaeo- logical Exploration of Sardis uncovered more occupation remains of the Late Roman and Archaic periods. At the foot of the Acropolis (sector MMS region) 10 more spaces of Late Roman residential complexes (under excavation since 1980), an outside well, and parts of two colonnaded streets provide further evidence for the pretensions and decline of upper- class living in the last great phase of urban Sardis. Architec- tural features of those spaces (covered rooms and perhaps one or two open courts) included two stone staircases, win- dow mullions and much window glass, and assemblages of spouted tiles from roof edges, as well as more standard features. A lead seal "of Kosmas the Deacon" from one space may signify that part of the complex was a deacon's resi- dence, an identification with which Christian symbolism in the complex and its urban environment (location near a major avenue and public bath) would be consistent. Below the Late Roman buildings is a substantial Archaic stratum, dominated by the huge defense work "Colossal Lydian Struc- ture," which was destroyed in the middle of the sixth century B.C. (as attested by Attic, Corinthian, and Eastern Greek pottery in secure contexts), presumably during the siege and partial sack of Sardis by Cyrus the Great of Persia. An earthwork glacis or agger, which had been piled against one side of the Structure before the destruction (and which still stands 36 feet high) may have been designed to protect the Structure from mining and sapping. Sealed within destruc- tion debris were the skeleton of a young man in his early 20s, whose bone development suggests that he had been a soldier, and a helmet made of iron and trimmed with bronze. The helmet is a prototypal form of the Late Roman-Early Medieval Spangenhelme and Strebenhelme. On the spur of the Acropolis that was enveloped in the sixth century B.C. by a terrace wall of ashlar masonry in white limestone (sector ByzFort), remains of a contemporaneous pavillion (stylobate with supports for two columns) were uncovered. In the Necropolis region a plundered chamber tomb of the Hellen- istic period was excavated. Study and recording projects clarified aspects of Lydian masonry techniques, the Hellenistic-Roman Temple of Ar- temis, Hellenistic inscriptions from the parastades of the Metroon, Roman inscriptions, Archaic installations for refin- ing precious metals (at sector PN), ancient plant remains, pottery, and other artifacts recovered in previous seasons. NEW EXCAVATIONS AT GORDION, TURKEY: Mary M. Voigt, University of Pennsylvania In 1988 archaeological fieldwork was resumed at the site of Yassihbytik, ancient Gordion. This research is designed to examine the nature of the occupation at the site during the late second millennium B.C., and to clarify site function during the first millennium B.C. The initial step in fulfilling these goals was to obtain a detailed stratigraphic sequence from the City Mound or citadel, extending from the Middle Bronze Age to the end of the Hellenistic occupation. Well- preserved deposits dated to the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1200 B.C.) were located by the stratigraphic sounding in 1988, and exposed over a broad area in 1989, providing infor- mation on architecture and settlement pattern for the period of the Hittite Empire. A regional site survey has 1) defined the limits of the extensive "lower town" surrounding the citadel during the first millennium, and 2) delineated changing patterns of site location in the surrounding area. Settlement patterns, taken in conjunction with new information on the local economy obtained from floral, faunal, and artifactual remains recov- ered through excavation, will allow a better understanding of the changing economic and political role of Gordion within central Anatolia ca. 1300 to 200 B.C. This research will also elucidate the nature of "transitional" periods, and the degree to which changes in the archaeological record can be correlated with changes in the ethnic identity of the site's inhabitants ("Hittites" and Phrygians, Phrygians and Galatians) suggested by scanty historical records. THE OUTLYING HOUSES AT GORDION: Gunlog E. An- derson, Wilson College It has long been known that a regular cemetery of the Hittite period exists at Gordion in the area to the northeast of the City Mound and to the south and west of the great tumuli MM, P, KIII, and KIV (M.J. Mellink, A Hittite Cem- etery at Gordion [Philadelphia 1956]). hi the Phrygian period commoners were buried here in simple graves without tomb markers and often without tomb gifts. This paper presents the less well-known finds of domestic habitation that also emerged during the excavation and study of the Common Cemetery and lesser tumuli. Beneath the tumuli is a domestic settlement of about a dozen houses. These houses were one-</page><page sequence="19">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 311 and two-room units with open courtyards. There are storage huts nearby. The houses had stone foundations, mudbrick walls, occasional timber lacing, and stone pavements. Each house was constructed with three walls running into the slope of the hill and with the front of the house turned toward the open valley of the Sakarya River. The floors of the houses were generally set below ground level. Some of these houses had been carefully cleaned out before burial tumuli were built over them. In other houses remains of the domestic inventory were left on the floors. These objects included raised hearths, storage vessels, stone and iron tools, cooking utensils, and household pottery, as well as loom weights, spindle whorls, and small items of jewelry. In one building, a room was devoted to the preparation of food as shown by the presence of a grinding bench with saddle querns, and household and serving vessels. Numerous pits, storage huts, and a couple of small square "reservoirs" com- plete the picture of a rural community outside the walls of Gordion whose inhabitants pursued agriculture and animal husbandry. The paper concludes by attempting to place this domestic settlement in its proper chronological, cultural, and socioeconomic context. ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF GREATER AMMAN (JOR- DAN), 1988: Joseph A. Greene, Chicago Society, and Abdul Sami' Abu-Dayyah, Jordan Department of Antiquities The Archaeological Survey of Greater Amman (ASGA) began in 1988 as part of the Cultural Resource Management (CRM) Project, a cooperative undertaking of the Jordan Department of Antiquities, the American Center of Oriental Research (ACOR), and the United States Agency for Inter- national Development (USAID). The Survey had two aims: 1) to collect archaeological data for a settlement history of the city and region of ancient Rabboth-Ammon/Philadel- phia, the principal ancient site of central Jordan; and 2) to compile a comprehensive inventory of antiquities sites in the area of Greater Amman to facilitate cultural resource pre- servation within the context of planned economic develop- ment in the modern Jordanian capital. Building on results of previous surveys by Conder, Butler, Glueck, and others, ASGA systematically gathered data on the successive regional settlement systems around Rabboth- Ammon/Philadelphia from the prehistoric through Late Ot- toman periods. Simultaneously, ASGA began an exhaustive inventory of antiquities sites within the boundaries of Greater Amman for purposes of cultural resource manage- ment. Phase I of ASGA focused on incompletely investigated portions of the eastern and northwestern sections of the metropolitan area, covering approximately five percent of the more than 570 square kilometers of Greater Amman. Fieldwork was conducted from late August to late October, 1988. In this initial season the Survey recorded some 223 sites of all types-from monumental stone towers to isolated cisterns-and of all sizes and periods. Some were previously known; others were new discoveries. The new discoveries included some Late Antique and Medieval Islamic settle- ments of considerable size and significance, as well as some hitherto rare Early, Middle, and Late Bronze Age sites. Future seasons of the Archaeological Survey of Greater Amman are planned to pursue its twin aims of examining settlement history and cultural preservation. EXCAVATIONS AT TELL TUNEINIR, NORTHEAST SYRIA: Michael Fuller, St. Louis Community College, and Neathery Fuller, St. Louis Society Archaeologists from St. Louis Community College con- ducted a stratified surface survey of Tell Tuneinir during 1986. Extensive excavations were conducted at the site dur- ing 1987, 1988, and 1989. Literary and archaeological evi- dence indicate that the site is the Roman settlement of Thannourin mentioned by Procopius. The most recent oc- cupation of the site was during the Medieval period. Several ruined houses, dated to the 13th century A.C. based upon numismatic and ceramic data, have been uncovered in Areas I and II. A large structure in Area III is more difficult to interpret; its size, features, and a Syraic inscription indicate that it may have served at one point as a church. The step trench in Area I uncovered Roman-Byzantine strata and a Hellenistic destruction layer beneath the Islamic layers. Hellenistic pottery forms discovered in the destruc- tion layer resemble the ceramic assemblage discovered by Oppenheim at Tell Halaf. Deeply buried strata uncovered during 1988 have been identified as Neo-Assyrian and Mid- dle Assyrian. An Aramaic inscription on the rim of a bowl shares several features in common with the Tell Fekheriyeh inscription. EXCAVATIONS AT NINEVEH, 1989: David Stronach and Stephen Lumsden, University of California, Berkeley The second season of the University of California Berke- ley's excavations at Nineveh took place between 28 March and 2 June. Within the limits of a steep-sided gully on the west flank of Kuyunjik-the ancient core mound of Nine- veh-a formidable depth of gully wash was found to overlie a series of undisturbed third-millennium levels. The earliest strata to be exposed so far can be seen to extend back to the Ninevite 5 period, when the mound of Kuyunjik already appears to have covered an area of some 30 hectares. In keeping with the purposes of a project that is designed in part to throw new light on the nature of early urban settlement in northern Mesopotamia, several separate sec- tors of seventh-century B.C. Neo-Assyrian Nineveh were also examined. One operation reexplored the vicinity of the bit nakkapti, close to the eastern limits of Sennacherib's pal- ace, while another, near the northwestern corner of the Lower Town, has revealed the small scale, crowded construc- tions of an apparent industrial quarter. Of equal interest are two further excavated areas. In the first, just inside the Mashki Gate, we recovered a far more spacious pattern of Lower Town construction while in the second, at the en- trance of the once formidable Halzi Gate, we found direct evidence for the very violent conflict that attended the fall of Nineveh in 612 B.C.</page><page sequence="20">312 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 SESSION III C: ROMAN ART AND ARCHITEC- TURE THE MANY FACES OF VENUS GENETRIX: Roger B. Ul- rich, Dartmouth College A cult image of Venus Genetrix, created by the celebrated sculptor Arkesilaos, was dedicated in the Forum lulium by Julius Caesar in 46 B.C. Images of the lost masterpiece may have survived on commemorative coins, sculpture, and painting, but these depictions are far from uniform, and modern scholars have not reached a consensus as to which represent the original of Arkesilaos. Coins and medallions that depict the goddess along with the legend VENERI GENETRICI would seem to be the key to the solution, but in fact they are deceptive. None dates from before the early second century A.C., the depictions are various, and there is no demonstrable connection with the cult in the Forum lulium. Such coins were issued to celebrate the virtues of women of the imperial family. There is also the probability that the principal cult image of Venus Genetrix was destroyed when her temple was consumed by fire during the last quarter of the first century. A Flavian or Trajanic replacement effigy may well have differed from the original. In terms of both chronology and spirit, the search for the Arkesilaon original should thus be limited to evidence dated to ca. 50 B.C.-A.D. 50. Caesar wished to honor the goddess as a bringer of victory (vtxOl6QOog; App. BCiv. 2.76) and as a progenetrix of the Roman people and the Julian line; we should expect the original image to evoke these qualities. Representations of the goddess standing fully draped, in contrapposto and with scepter and attendant putto, appear to represent the interpretation of Arkesilaos most clearly. THE STATUES OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT IN THE FORUM AUGUSTUM AND THE REGIA: Paul Rehak, Loyola University of Chicago The Forum Augustum in Rome has recently received new attention in studies of Augustus's building program in the capital (e.g., J. Anderson, The Historical Topography of the Imperial Fora [CollLatomus 182, 1984] 64-100). One element of the decorative program remains obscure, however. Pliny mentions four statues which were said to have supported the tent of Alexander the Great: two of these were placed before the Temple of Mars Ultor, and the other two were set up in the Regia (HN 34.18.48). Although the use of Roman temples as depositories for rare and unusual objects with a programmatic significance is well documented, the relevance of this dedication has never been fully explained. Even the origin of the figures is problematic. In 318 B.C. Eumenes set up a tent for the worship of Alexander which included his regalia and armor (Diod. Sic. 18.61.1), but no statues are mentioned. A better possibility is the four statues of Victories (Nikai) which adorned the ostentatious funerary wagon of Alexander (Diod. Sic. 18.26.6). Although these seem to have been acroteria and not supporting figures, Pliny may have misunderstood their original use. Certainly, the theme of victory and the persona of Alexander played a significant role elsewhere in the ideology and decorative program of the Forum Augustum, for example in the paint- ings by Apelles showing Alexander and the imagines clipeatae with heads of Jupiter-Ammon above the colonnades. Alex- ander's statues helped underline the temporary use of the temple of Mars for the cult of Augustus after his death and deification, while the templum novum was under construction (Cass. Dio 56.46.4). Finally, Alexander's statues may have been represented on an early Imperial relief, formerly attributed to the "Ara Pietatis Augustae," which shows a sacrifice at the Temple of Mars Ultor. On the relief, parts of two tiny figures, which stood in front of the corner columns of the facade, have been cut away, probably when the relief was installed in the garden facade of the Villa Medici in the 16th century. THE TABULA SIARENSIS AND THE ARCH OF GERMANICUS IN THE CIRCUS FLAMINIUS: C. Brian Rose, University of Cincinnati In 1982 a bronze inscription was discovered near Seville in Spain which records a nearly complete version of the senatorial decree of A.D. 19 concerning posthumous honors for Germanicus. In the first section of this decree, which has been named the Tabula Siarensis, there is a full description of a triumphal arch that was to be constructed in honor of Germanicus in the Circus Flaminius in Rome. The decorative program of this arch is unparalleled in the Roman Imperial period, yet it has been omitted from scholarly discussions of triumphal imagery. The military victories of Germanicus were to have been explicitly conveyed here through the inclusion of personifications of Gaul and Germany. In ad- dition, the attic statuary group featured statues of German- icus in a triumphal chariot flanked by his parents, Drusus I and Antonia II, his siblings, Claudius and Livilla, his wife Agrippina I, and his six sons and daughters. This is the largest known attic statuary group to have been created for a triumphal arch, and the inclusion of the children of Ger- manicus in particular signals a radical departure from the traditional decoration of arches. Such a presentation is in part related to an old Republican tradition, whereby the sons of the triumphator accompanied him in his chariot during the pompa triumphalis. This practice was modified to some extent in the triumphal procession of Germanicus in A.D. 16, during which all of his sons and daughters were featured in the chariot. This triumph was unique in that it was the first known instance in which the daughters of the triumpha- tor rode in his chariot along with the sons. The statues of Germanicus and his children above the Circus Flaminius arch therefore essentially constituted an extension and trans- lation into permanent form of his pompa triumphalis of A.D. 16.</page><page sequence="21">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 313 BIBLIOTECA ULPIA: A NEW RESTORATION OF THE WEST LIBRARY IN THE FORUM OF TRAJAN: James Packer, Northwestern University The West Library in the Forum of Trajan--one of the two, Greek and Latin, which faced one another across the small court around the Column of Trajan-was completely excavated by Corrado Ricci in 1930-1932. Preliminary no- tices appeared at that time, but no full-scale study of the building appeared until that of Carla Amici, Foro di Traiano: Basilica Ulpia e biblioteche (Rome 1981). Amici's restoration of the structure is, however, only schematic, and her plan and drawings of individual architectural elements are fre- quently incomplete or inaccurate. New drawings of the ar- chitectural elements of the four Corinthian orders of the building and a new plan of the Forum of Trajan sponsored by the Getty Center and the City of Rome (AJA 93 [1989] 141) suggest a substantially different restoration. The West Library was a rectangular hall 20.10 m wide, 27.10 m long, with an interior 14.69 m high (about 68.5 x 90 x 50 Roman feet). Of brick-faced concrete, the walls were veneered with white, purple-veined marble (pavonazzetto) and supported a groin vault. Thermal windows lighted the interior, and a columnar screen to the east gave access to an interior framed by a two-story Corinthian colonnade inter- rupted on the west side of the room by an aedicula, also of two stories. On both floors, the columns framed armaria, niches for books. The Forma Urbis and the few excavated remains show that the East Library was an identical structure, and both buildings together, therefore, housed about 22,000 scrolls. THE JEWISH CATACOMBS OF ROME: A REASSESSMENT: Leonard Victor Rutgers, Institute of Archaeology, Free University, Amsterdam Scholars have dealt extensively with literary and epigraph- ical sources regarding the Jewish community of ancient Rome. Four Jewish catacombs and two Jewish hypogea, all located outside the Aurelian city walls, have, however, passed largely unnoticed. A new analysis of all available finds sug- gests that these Jewish burial places are largely contempor- aneous with the Christian catacombs, and that their earliest phase should be dated around the end of the second century A.C. This paper first examines the structural characteristics of the Jewish catacombs of Rome in relationship to their Chris- tian and pagan underground counterparts. A comparative analysis of these Roman burial sites reveals close parallels in their architectural form. In contrast to the Roman setting, no clear similarities exist when comparing the Jewish cata- combs of Rome and the Jewish necropolis at Beth She'arim in the Galilee or, for that matter, other Jewish burial sites in Israel. Furthermore this study argues that other finds from the Jewish catacombs of Rome, such as sarcophagi, wall paintings, and gold glasses-though partly Jewish in con- tent-are not specifically Jewish as far as style and technique are concerned. An examination of the iconographical fea- tures and formal characteristics of these burial objects pro- vides compelling evidence that Jews, Christians, and pagans in Rome employed the same workshops. Therefore, the material culture of the Jewish population in ancient Rome can only be seen against a Roman backdrop. A REDATING OF THE ARA CASALI: Fred C. Albertson, Memphis State University The Ara Casali, a marble statue base in the Vatican Mu- seums, bears an elaborate program of scenes carved in relief on all four sides, apparently honoring the deeds of Mars and his offspring. Scholars have long debated the date of this work, which has been variously assigned to the Flavian, Hadrianic, Antonine, and Severan periods. It is argued here that the original monument, perhaps an altar of a type with corona civica from the Flavian or Trajanic era, was recarved in the early fourth century and trans- formed at that time into a statue base. Of particular impor- tance are the four registers of the back with scenes relating to the birth of Romulus and Remus, whose figures find their closest parallels in images from historical relief and coins of the Tetrarchic and Constantinian periods. The style and arrangement of these figures also suggest this date. For example, Rhea Silvia in the second register looks upward to the figure of Mars in the register immediately above; such a visual link defying a clearly defined spatial frame is common in late Roman art. The recarving of the sides and back of the Ara Casali should be associated with the reign of Maxentius, which marks a time of renewed interest in Rome's legendary his- tory. The reliefs themselves reflect a monumental prototype of the same period, perhaps in the form of a narrative frieze. Adaptations of images from this prototype found during the Constantinian dynasty reinforce the continued use of Ro- mulan iconography during the fourth century. SPOLIA: THE PEDESTAL RELIEFS ON THE ARCH OF CON- STANTINE: Sandra E. Knudsen, Toledo Museum of Art A group of sculptures on the Arch of Constantine must now be recognized as spolia: most of the reliefs decorating the eight column bases. Examination of the 23 surviving reliefs reveals four subjects: eight victories; four trophies; seven scenes of soldiers with prisoners; and four of signifers. Only the four victory reliefs on the south side have intact borders that demonstrate they were created for the specific dimensions of these column bases. All the other reliefs show evidence of recutting for use in their present location. The question must now be asked: What monument(s) do they come from? The seven reliefs with soldiers can be arranged into a symmetrical composition of soldiers pushing prisoners toward the center, while the four reliefs of signifers form two groups of four soldiers framing the center. The four signifers provide the clue to the date: their insignia include four phalera portraits, which must represent four tetrarchs. The space framed by the signifers may have de-</page><page sequence="22">314 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 picted the four emperors: two may possibly be partially preserved in the frontal and now headless cuirass busts set in the walls of the side passages. The most probable date for a Tetrarchic monument in the city of Rome is the vicennalia of Diocletian in A.D. 303. This was also the occasion of a triumph for his victories in both the East and the North; subject peoples with clothing typical of both appear on the reliefs. This previously unrec- ognized monument shows how traditional features of Ro- man historical reliefs continued in Late Antiquity. Even more interesting is the realization that the Arch of Constantine was assembled overwhelmingly of spolia, with less and less of this important monument attributable to Constantine's artistic activity. COLORED MARBLE SCULPTURES OF IMPERIAL ROME: Maxwell L. Anderson, Emory University Museum of Art and Archaeology An exhibition in Atlanta is the first to concern the trade in and use of multicolored marbles from North Africa, Asia Minor, and Italy in Roman sculpture of the first three cen- turies A.C. The origins of the taste for colored marble are to be found in the Greek East and North Africa. The wide- spread importation of colored marbles to Italy began in the first century B.C. The exhibition, and this paper, recount how Roman rulers swiftly took advantage of the propagan- distic value of colored marble as an emblem of international authority. Those who could made a graphic expression of the use of costly materials from remote lands into a political gesture, and the formal use of these materials in public monuments had an immediate effect on the decoration of private residences as well. All of the works are from the storerooms of the Museo Nazionale Romano in Rome. Many are presented for the first time, including three magnificent Julio-Claudian female herms in nero antico, which were excavated on the Palatine Hill. A rare head of a black in bigio attests to the fascination with this exotic material and the ways in which particular marbles were selected for appropriate subjects. The objects include both public and private sculptures, and many have known provenances that enrich our understanding of their original display. FINE SCULPTURE AND THE ROMAN IMPERIAL MARBLE QUARRIES AT DocIMIUM: J.C. Fant, University of Akron New finds from the Imperial marble quarries at Docim- ium in Phrygia support the view that its workshops turned out fine as well as serially produced carving. A recent stylistic study (M. Waelkens, Dokimeion. Die Werkstatt der repriisen- tativen kleinasiatischen Sarkophage [Berlin 1982]) argued that Asiatic columnar sarcophagi and kindred types were pro- duced by the imperial workshops at Docimium. The discov- ery at the quarries of lids fitting these types (Fant, AJA 89 [1985] 655-62) and the subsequent identification of a Dacian prisoner torso in the nearby imperial quarries at Altmnta (Waelkens, AJA 89 [1985] 641-53) have more closely asso- ciated the Imperial workshops with fine sculpture. But the Dacian may have been an isolated work (Dacians were or- dered from other quarries that had no sculptural tradition before or after). And no hard evidence has established that the quarry workshops did not simply turn out sarcophagus blanks for others to finish. During 1987 an over-life-sized figure roughed out with a point was found in debris from Bacakale, the largest of the Docimium quarries. The statue (now in the Afyon Museum) is tentatively identified as a Marsyas, although it is more likely an Apollo or a Dionysus. The second sculptural find is from the Zaymioglu quarries northeast of Bacakale. The figurine of a boy carrying an amphora (?), 40 cm tall but broken at the knees, was seen in an Iscehisar marbleyard in October 1988. Neither find can be dated, but both are types common in the High Empire. Rough-outs of single statues were much less likely to be wholesaled as blanks than stereo- typed sarcophagi, and there is no evidence here that even the sarcophagi were so handled-by contrast, for in quarries where it was the practice, such as Proconnesus, such evidence is superabundant. A gable lid found in the same quarry that had been carried well beyond the roughed-out state also argues that all phases of carving took place there. Two ensembles in the Cleveland Museum (Early Christian figurines, including twoJonahs and an orant, and three pairs of busts of the same couple) are probably made in Docimian marble, according to isotopic tests by Norman Herz. Idio- syncratic details link them to the columnar sarcophagi of the period and suggest some connection with the Imperial sar- cophagus workshop. This evidence, supplemented by architectural elements now at Docimium, suggests that the imperial workshop did a very wide range of carving which now includes not only the fine detail of the columnar sarcophagi but also freestand- ing figures. This vertical integration of the quarry-to-Rome network and breadth of products must prompt a fundamen- tal reevaluation of the role of imperial workshops generally in the marble trade and the art market. SESSION III D: COLLOQUIUM: OLYNTHOS SOCIAL AND SPATIAL ORGANIZATION AT OLYNTHOS: Nicholas Cahill, University of California, Berkeley Short-lived, violently destroyed, leaving largely complete domestic assemblages, and then extensively excavated, Olyn- thos provides an almost ideal opportunity to study the or- ganization of the Classical house, and to consider aspects of the social organization of a Greek city. This paper summa- rizes results of researches into these two problems. The "standard plan" of Olynthian houses has been widely com- mented on, but equally interesting are the differences in house plans and construction in different parts of the city. The layout, architectural details, and especially the contents of rooms allow one to assess the uses of space in different houses, the kinds of activities that went on, and how they were arranged. One can the compare the organization of houses in different parts of the city, and consider problems</page><page sequence="23">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 315 of neighborhoods, districts, and other aspects of city orga- nization. Because Olynthos was occupied for only a few generations, and the houses seem to have undergone rela- tively little modification, one gets a uniquely close view of the original design of a planned Greek city. It may be possible to reconstruct some of the social concerns that occupied the planners of Olynthos, concerns that also influenced the po- litical writings of philosophers like Plato and Aristotle. The blocks and rows of houses at Olynthos show an internal physical coherence that seems to reflect social con- nections among the inhabitants. The plans and details of construction of houses on a single row show similarities that suggest that their builders shared architectural backgrounds. And although each house was apparently built by a different crew of workers, those crews cooperated to construct a block of houses all at once, bonding the walls between houses, and working out problems of common roofs, drainage, and the like. Analysis of the assemblages, and of the design and uses of specialized spaces in houses further suggests that the residents of each block shared common ties. This social coherence within blocks seems to result from the division of the city during its layout into more or less well-defined neighborhoods or districts. OLYNTHOS AND PHILIP II: A REAPPRAISAL OF THEIR RELATIONS: Julia Heskel, Brown University The eloquent Olynthiacs of Demosthenes have long led scholars to regard Olynthos as simply the last in a series of conquests made by Philip II as he methodically built his hegemony in the North Aegean during the 350s and early 340s B.C. A reassessment of the evidence suggests, however, quite a different picture: because of Chalcidice's financial and military resources, Philip was anxious to create and maintain good relations with the League. It was only when Olynthos turned against him that he initiated hostilities, and after its surrender he did not destroy the city. The paper begins by tracing the circumstances of the alliance made by the two powers in 356. The details of the breakdown of relations are then discussed, in particular, Olynthos's harboring of Philip's half-brothers and request for a peace treaty with Athens in 352. Because the king was recovering from a debilitating illness contracted in Thrace he could do no more than make threatening gestures in response: war would require extensive preparations. Philip finally invaded Chalcidice in 349, aware that victory would not come easily. The difficulty of the expedition is reflected in the three phases of operations in Chalcidice and the final assault on Olynthos, which he was able to capture in late 348 only through bribery. Philip treated Olynthos relatively leniently for a rebellious ally: he sold his enemies into slavery and handed the city over to his supporters. Olynthos was now to serve as an important Macedonian power base in the North Aegean. At the Macedonian Olympia Philip proclaimed his victory, which meant the basis for a stabler hegemony. Do THE COINS SUGGEST THE ABANDONMENT OF OLYN- THOS IN 316 B.C.? James A. Dengate, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign No one doubts that Philip II of Macedon destroyed Olyn- thos in 348 B.C., although it is generally accepted that De- mosthenes (Third Philippic 26) somewhat exaggerated the totality of the destruction. Nor has the identification of the site of Agias Mamas, excavated and published by David M. Robinson as the location of ancient Olynthos, caused much controversy. Indeed the material excavated from the de- struction of this site has been regularly treated as absolutely dated from the historical evidence. Unfortunately not enough emphasis has been placed on the witness of Dio- dorus Siculus 19.52.2-3 for 316 B.C. "[Cassander] also founded on Pallene a city called Cassandreia after his own name, uniting with it as one city the cities of the peninsula. . . . He settled in this city those of the Olynthians who survived, not few in number." The epigraphical and literary evidence supports Diodorus Siculus as W.S. Ferguson pointed out in AJA 39 (1935) 154-55: "between a quarter and a third of the datable Olynthians known by name lived after 348 B.C .... Olynthus ... had, perhaps, ceased to be of any importance in the course of the third century. A review of the excavated numismatic evidence supports both the destruction by Philip in 348 and an abandonment enforced by Cassander in 316. This suggests that some of the other, less easily dated, material recovered from the excavations could also date after 348. Care must be taken to distinguish between the more spectacular remains of a de- struction and the more mundane artifacts left behind when a site is abandoned. COINS AND THE HISTORY OF OLYNTHOS: Mark Rose, Archaeology The history of Olynthos constructed by David Robinson was based on the selective interpretation and integration of ancient sources and the results of his own excavations, pri- marily the study of coins from the site. In the formulation of this history, no distinction was made between the analysis and synthesis of the two types of evidence. Here, brief independent evaluations of the ancient sources and the coins are presented. The results suggest that much of the history constructed by Robinson is less certain than he proposed. In particular, the date of the formation of the Chalcidic state, the absolute dates of the silver coins, and the date of the abandonment of Olynthos are not secure. OLYNTHOS AND OTHER DEPOSITS-THE POTTERY: Susan I. Rotroff, Hunter College A terminal date of 348 for objects from Olynthos has long been axiomatic to the study of fourth-century pottery. In recent years the ceramic chronology of the late fourth and early third century has undergone revision, and material formerly placed in the late fourth century has been down- dated by some 30 to 40 years. This leaves a gap in the ceramic</page><page sequence="24">316 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 chronology of the period between the destruction of Olyn- thos in 348 and the end of the century. Two solutions may be proposed: to stretch out the chronology, assuming a much slower rate of shape development in this period; or to down- date the Olynthos material, taking 316 (when remaining inhabitants moved to the new foundation at Kassandreia) rather than 348 as the terminus for materials found there. Comparison of pottery from Olynthos with pottery from independently dated deposits of the end of the fourth cen- tury can help test these solutions. Such comparison reveals a considerable gap between the Olynthos material and pot- tery from Building Z in the Kerameikos, which was destroyed in the span ca. 315-305, and suggests that the 348 terminus should be retained. Rather than downdate the bulk of the pottery, we must seek to identify later pieces used by the inhabitants between 348 and 316. Because of the nature of the habitation, of the abandonment, and of Robinson's publication, we are un- likely to find a large sample of easily datable pottery among the published vessels. A number of black glaze pieces, how- ever, may be placed with some confidence in the second half of the fourth century. OLYNTHOS: THE TERRACOTTA LAMPS: John Tidmarsh, University of Sydney, and Hector Williams, Uni- versity of British Columbia During his years of excavation at Olynthos D.M. Robinson published a number of reports on the terracotta lamps. Since that time they have served as examples of pre-348 B.C. lamp production in the Greek world. Recent work in Athens and elsewhere in Greece has made a reexamination of this date desirable. In particular the Australian excavations at Toroni have provided a wealth of well-excavated comparable ma- terial from the Khalkidiki. This paper examines the effects of these new studies on the traditional dating at Olynthos. OLYNTHOS: A RECONSIDERATION OF THE BRONZES: Beryl Barr-Sharrar, New York Society Bronze objects from those houses at the north end of the North Hill in Olynthos in which coins were found dating between 348 and 297 B.C., suggesting possible rehabitation after the destruction of the city by Philip II, are mostly structural: door fittings, bosses, nails, spikes, etc. Exceptions are decorative palmettes and handles from metal vessels, hinges from small (probably wooden) boxes, weights, keys, fish hooks, beads, sling bullets (many of lead), and arrow- heads (some with the embossed inscription of Philip II). No comparative material suggests that any of these objects should be dated later than 348. A fibula from a house on the North Hill (not one that yielded a later coin) was isolated by Robinson as possibly later than 348 on the basis of Fuirtwangler's dating of fibulae of similar shape ("Zangenfibeln") from Olympia. In the re- cent reassessment and publication of this material, however, (Bronzeschmuck aus Olympia [OlForsch 13, Berlin, 1981]), Hanna Phillip uses the 348 destruction date of Olynthos and the fact that the fibula in question (Robinson's no. 399: Olynthus 10) was found in the cistern of a house built before 420, to date the occurrence of this "pincher" type fibula into the fourth century at the latest. According to Robinson, a late coin was found in one of the houses (ESH 4) on what he called the East Spur Hill. If the hypothesis of W. H6pfner and E.-L. Schwandner (Haus und Stadt im klassischen Griechenland [Munich 1986]) that this and the adjacent "Villa Section" of the city, both just east of the North Hill, comprise an addition to the city built sometime after 379 (and the Olynthian war with Sparta), specific termini are established for the famous mosaics (in agreement with D. Salzmann's stylistic dating of about 370- 360: Untersuchungen zu den antiken Kieselmosaiken [AF 10, Berlin 1982]), but none of the bronzes found in ESH 4 or other houses in this area points specifically to habitation after 348 either. A few selected Late Classical bronze objects of aesthetic interest from Olynthos, including a decorative palmette and two finger rings, can be shown to agree stylistically with dated material from the first half of the fourth century B.C. DATING MINOR FINDS AT OLYNTHOS: Anna S. Benja- min, Rutgers University The published minor finds from Olynthos are not easily placed in their exact architectural contexts on the published plans of Olynthos, so that dating them on the basis of the house and workshop contexts is unreliable. On the rather rare occasion when minor finds are dated explicitly in the Olynthos volumes where miscellaneous finds are detailed, the assumption of an early fourth-century B.C. date based on the destruction of 348 B.C. pervades in that dating. The use of the Olynthos minor finds in a number of later publi- cations is generally restricted to the discussions of the types found and the Olynthos dates are not significantly used to date objects from other sites. The fact that many of the miscellaneous objects are of a kind that does not develop substantially over the passing years has made dating by typology almost nonexistent. The conclusion seems inescap- able that this large, diverse, and widespread group called "minor finds" is not much help in dating archaeological contexts or in aiding the dating of similar objects found at other sites. SESSION IV A: GREEK CITIES AND SANCTU- ARIES GEOMETRIC VOTIVE FIGURINES AND THE RISE OF GREEK SANCTUARIES: Susan H. Langdon, University of Missouri, Columbia The rise of sanctuaries in Greece from the tenth through eighth centuries B.C. is one of the distinguishing hallmarks of emerging Iron Age Greece. Rarely if ever can continuity of religious use from the Bronze Age through the eighth century be demonstrated at any mainland site. Consequently, these sanctuaries remain shrouded in mystery: why was each site selected for foundation and how did its cult develop? Despite an apparent wealth of material for reconstructing</page><page sequence="25">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 317 the history and use of each site (artifacts, legends, historical evidence), the challenges posed by the limitations of this evidence are immense. Incomplete documentation, the wide dispersal of artifacts and loss of provenance, and the ancient deposition of votive offerings in unstratified dumps are among the greatest of the difficulties. This study investigates the origins of the major Greek sanctuaries and the initial development of their cults by focusing on a single class of evidence: the bronze votive figurines of anthropomorphic form. This body of material affords a meaningful approach because of their sole function as votive offerings and their overtly referential nature. Quantified analysis of this evidence offers a clear picture of the distribution of these bronzes by type (based on gender and body position/gesture) across a spectrum of 23 sanctu- aries and some eight different deities. Following a model proposed by this study for early cult development, the evi- dence of the bronze figurines documents a progression of figurine type from generic, multipurpose images of gods and worshipers to increasingly specific references to cult activities and local cult characteristics. Links of certain types to Bronze Age imagery and interconnections among sanc- tuaries according to geographic and cult relationships ex- pand the context of this period. THE "EARLIEST" DORIC CAPITAL AT THE ARGIVE HER- AION: Christopher A. Pfaff, New York University Included among the architectural elements from the Ar- give Heraion that were published by E.L. Tilton (in C. Waldstein et al., The Argive Heraeum I [Boston 1902] 112- 13) is a poros Doric capital, "Capital C," which he associated with the North Stoa. Because of its wide abacus and broadly spreading echinus, scholars consistently date this capital to the early Archaic period. In fact, P. de la Coste-Messeliere in his study of early Doric capitals (BCH 87 [1963] 642-44) places it at the very beginning of the formal development, ahead of the early capitals from Delphi, Tiryns, and Corfu. Closer examination of Capital C and the other remains of the North Stoa shows, however, that the capital was most probably made during the Roman Imperial period in con- nection with a previously unrecognized renovation of the stoa. Other elements pertaining to this renovation are a second capital ("Capital H," now lost) which is similar to Capital C, and an unfluted column drum. These elements clearly indicate that at least a portion of the inner and/or outer colonnade of the original sixth-century B.C. structure was replaced. Evidence of reworking on the east anta sug- gests that it too was rebuilt at this time. Although decisive proof is lacking, it seems reasonable to conclude that the reservoirs built of tiles and mortar at the west end of the stoa were also added during this renovation project. POST-GEOMETRIC TOMB CULTS AND RITUAL BEHAVIOR IN LATER CLASSICAL AND HELLENISTIC GREECE: Susan E. Alcock, University of Cambridge Geometric cult activity at Mycenaean tombs has received widespread attention from Classical archaeologists. It is now generally agreed that the phenomenon is inextricably bound up with the social and ideological transformations which accompanied the rise of the Greek polis. Ancient tombs became a source of power, and tomb cult served as one complex ritual expression-and attempted resolution-of the tensions inherent in a rapidly changing society. Overshadowed by this Geometric practice are signs of subsequent cult activity (most often in the later Classical and Hellenistic periods) at the same locations. Patterns of ritual behavior are not as clear in these later eras; consequently they have received little systematic attention and the question why tomb cult also existed in historical times has scarcely been addressed. This paper reviews the evidence for post- Geometric tomb cult in Greece: its chronology and geo- graphical distribution, the frequency, scale, and type of of- ferings, and what distinguishes purposeful deposition in the context of cult from merely "intrusive" finds. With a clearer idea of the variety of forms the cult took at this time, new interpretations can be advanced. It is argued that late Classical and Hellenistic tomb cult again represents one response to a period of transition and stress for the polis, marked by the increasing political dominance of elite groups and growing socioeconomic polarities. The ritual provided a means both to legitimate and to subvert such changes-an ambiguity also seen in the Geometric period, when reverse processes were in operation. It is interesting that in two very different periods of "crisis," tomb cult became a shared arena for the expression of ideological and social conflicts. Not only was the formation of the Classical polis played out through the ritual of tomb cult, but stages in its dissolution as well. RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ATHENIAN TREASURY AT DELPHI IN THE FOURTH CENTURY B.C.: Frederick A. Cooper, University of Minnesota Seismic shock struck Delphi shortly before 371 B.C. (Po- lyb. 2.4.7; Strabo 8.384; Diod. 15.48.1; Paus. 7.25.4), irre- parably damaging the Temple of Apollo. A Panhellenic subscription raised funds for a new building (FdD III, 5, nos. 1-9). What has never been noted is that the Athenian Treasury suffered in the same disaster; it did not collapse but endured badly twisted wall blocks and column drums. There are excellent reasons to think that this Treasury and that of the Siphnians were then dismantled and reassembled. Foundations of the Treasuries, as those of the Apollo temple, had become vulnerable to seismic disturbance due to settle- ment of backfill in a natural ravine that they straddle. Evidence for reconstruction of the Athenian Treasury in antiquity consists of two sorts. The wall blocks were attached by a form of swallow-tail hook clamp that is not a product of the sixth century B.C. as Dinsmoor (AJA 50 [1946] 86- 121) and others thought; rather, this form represents an extracted double-F or double-T clamp across joints of blocks reset into position after rebuilding or repair. The second sign for reconstruction of the Athenian Treasury is the use of inscribed sigla on blocks to designate correct wall course and position, as an aid in reassembly. For stylistic reasons the Treasury has been dated as early as 510-500 B.C. and therefore an inscribed thank-offering</page><page sequence="26">318 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 for Marathon, placed beside the building, has been consid- ered an addition after 490 B.C. (GHI3 no. 19). The under- pinning design for the thank-offering, however, rewards closer examination. Published vertical sections of the Trea- sury do not extend to the level of the thank-offering nor to bedrock. A revised section shows that a fully supported ledge projects 0.30 m from the south flank of the Treasury ster- eobate in a design meant to support an assembly of stones which can only be the thank-offering for Marathon. The entire Treasury, therefore, represents a dedication of the Athenians after Marathon and cannot be attributed to a period earlier than 490 B.C. SEMI-SKILLED MASONS AND RECYCLED ARCHITECTURE: Lynn Kraynak, University of the Pacific While much is known about professional masons, the identities and abilities of semi-skilled or nonspecialist build- ers have been obscure. A study of reused material in the Xenon at Nemea has produced significant evidence for the exclusive use of nonspecialist labor in a major building proj- ect that allows speculation about the abilities and identity of the workmen. With one exception, the construction is typi- fied by a reluctance to recut spolia and a disregard for symmetry. The builders' tolerance for asymmetry, while great, had a limit: different column bases in one room were unacceptable. Profiles of bases in two rooms match bases of Ionic half-columns from Oikos 9, a building 30 m north of the Xenon. The bases used in the Xenon were drastically, and ineptly, reworked to accommodate round columns. When the supply of bases from Oikos 9 ran out prematurely, the Xenon builders molded crude cement imitations. The workmanship of the recut spolia and the cement replicas show that the primary vocation of these men was not construction. Who might they have been? The ad hoc method of construction most closely resembles work of peo- ple like farmers who would have had some experience in constructing sheds and simple houses, but little or none in carving stone. That nonspecialists built a major building at a sanctuary indicates that semi-skilled workmen, perhaps local farmers, played a larger role in Greek construction than previously suspected. FORTY SAINTS, BUT How MANY GERONTES? Nigel M. Kennell, Memorial University of Newfoundland In the monastery of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste, east of Sparta, there is an inscription of Roman date. It was re- corded by Col. Leake and figured in Seidel's notes, which form the basis for an entry in the Corpus. In its present form, IG V, 1, line 16 has been used as evidence for the size of the Spartan gerousia in the Roman period. As it stands, the restored final line refers to "28 gerontes"-the same number as comprised the gerousia in the Classical era. This text is the linchpin of some modern studies of the gerousia in the Roman period, which attempt intellectual acrobatics to reconcile it with the complete catalogues of members of the Spartan gerousia of that time, none containing more than 23 names (A.M. Woodward, BSA 26 [1923-1925] 174; K.M.T. Chrimes, Ancient Sparta 141-43, 146). Autopsy reveals this effort to be misplaced. The traces on the stone do not admit a restoration that has anything to do with the Spartan gerousia. Instead, it appears to contain parts of two documents concerned with disputes over the occupation of private or public land. Thus, the later gerousia had only 23 members-yet an- other indication of the profound changes this body and the city as a whole had weathered during the Hellenistic period. For now Spartans served annual, not lifelong, terms in the gerousia. Moreover, the gerousia's executive power had been so radically altered that on no occasions do we find it taking action independently of the major magistracies of Roman Sparta, namely the ephors and the nomophylakes. EXCAVATIONS AT THE SANCTUARY OF POSEIDON AT ISTHMIA, 1989: Elizabeth R. Gebhard, University of Illinois, Chicago, and Frederick P. Hemans, Boston University New excavations in the Sanctuary of Poseidon on the Isthmus of Corinth yielded important information concern- ing the organization of the sanctuary from the Geometric period to the second century A.C. In addition, exploration of the shrine and Hellenistic settlement on the ridge south of the temenos revealed deposits unexpectedly rich in coins, metal objects, and architecture. East of the Temple of Poseidon and its long altar a series of terraces gradually extended the area used for sacrifices until the temple burned in about 470 B.C. The earliest surface was found to belong to the Geometric period. It was followed by a much larger, well-preserved terrace that ex- tended the length of the long altar and some 30 m to the east of it. Shortly after construction the terrace surface was covered by a layer of sacrificial ash, sections of which were recovered and analyzed this year. Following the temple fire the large sacrificial area was sharply curtailed by the dump- ing of building debris and the expansion of the stadium embankment. Not until the end of the fourth century B.C. was the terrace again returned to its former extent, and the sanctuary was provided with its first formal entrance. The earlier and later approaches to the temple from the northeast were cleared, together with an additional stretch of the Archaic road from the Isthmus to Corinth that ran along its northwest corner. In the major structures, further work was done on the Archaic Temple, Early Stadium, and the Roman Palaimon- ion. Excavations of the spectator embankments of the sta- dium provided evidence for its several phases and their chronological sequence. The same was accomplished for the three successive enclosures of the Palaimonion that overlay the Early Stadium. Excavation of many blocks from the Archaic Temple together with deposits under its floor and exploration of the series of post holes covered by the floor contributed valuable information for the history of the build- ing. Simply decorated vessels from the sacrificial terraces and elsewhere in the temenos provide additional information on</page><page sequence="27">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 319 the nature of sanctuary activity and the organization of Corinthian pottery production in connection with a major state festival. The appearance of Attic fabrics, especially in the early period, suggests that communities across the Isth- mus played a role in the festival. On the ridge south of the sanctuary the major period of occupation falls within the fourth and third centuries B.C. Earlier activity, especially in the area of a small shrine on the summit, is suggested by a fair amount of sixth and fifth century material as well as a few pieces of Geometric and Mycenaean date recovered this year. With the excavation of several additional house/workshop complexes the extent of the Hellenistic industrial settlement was defined. Destruction debris included large Corinthian roof tiles, marble paving slabs, anta blocks, a Doric capital, and other remains that seem to have belonged to a large public building, the remains of which lie at the north side of the settlement. At least four entrances gave access to small rooms along the length of the building. EXCAVATIONS AT MYTILENE, 1989: Hector Williams, University of British Columbia The abstract for this paper was unavailable. SESSION IV B: PRE-ROMAN ITALY EXCAVATIONS AT NURAGHE SANTA BARBARA: VILLAGE LIFE IN PREHISTORIC SARDINIA: Lenore Gallin, Uni- versity of California, Los Angeles Four seasons of excavation at the fortified multi-towered site of Nuraghe Santa Barbara, Bauladu, reveal a highly organized Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age village with a thriving economy. The size of the nuraghe complex and its monumental circuit wall identify this five-acre village as an important center in a densely occupied zone strategically located between the island's western coast and its interior uplands. The significant first time find of clay molds used in lost wax casting of bronze objects, together with crucibles and casting slag, distinguish Santa Barbara as a major me- tallurgical production center. In addition, hundreds of ob- jects from daily life provide evidence of a full range of communal domestic activities and thriving intra-island ex- change. Great quantities of animal bone document a wide variety of domesticated animals and game, and species never before found in Nuragic contexts. The conservative architectural style and standardized planning of nuraghi (over 7000 towers with basically the same plans and proportions) appear to characterize Nuragic villages as well. Discoveries at Santa Barbara, including spe- cialized houses around a central courtyard and a huge meet- ing house with built-in seating, are seen also at other Sardinian village sites of the same period. Not only are the structures similar in type, but their proportions and juxta- position are almost identical. Santa Barbara's history of reoccupation during Punic- Roman and Roman Republican periods can now be ex- panded to include a very significant Early Medieval occu- pation, a period virtually undocumented in Sardinia. CONTINUITY IN PRE-ROMAN TO ROMAN SARDINIAN SET- TLEMENT: THE 1988 MARYLAND-WESLEYAN SURVEY: RobertJ. Rowland, Jr., University of Maryland, and Stephen L. Dyson, Wesleyan University The 1988 survey expanded on the 1987 survey (AJA 92 [1988] 264) to the north and west, focusing on the river valleys in the territories of Paulilatino and Fordongianus (ancient Forum Traiani); the 1988 survey consisted of two distinct phases, in July and in October. Eighty additional Nuragic sites were surveyed in both areas along with a sample of fields from within a 2-km radius of Fordongianus. As in the 1987 season, nearly all the sites that produced Nuragic pottery also produced Roman material, suggesting strong continuity. More than in the earlier survey, a fairly large number of sites with late Roman and early Medieval pottery, particularly within the ambit of Fordongianus, dem- onstrates the cultural and economic importance of that site, which was the seat of the Byzantine military government on the island. Extensive fieldwalking in the lowlands produced no evi- dence of villa sites, confirming the pattern established in 1987, which is recognizably anomalous for a western prov- ince. Thus, around Paulilatino and Fordongianus, as around Bauladu, the indigenous settlements for the most part con- tinued to be occupied, and the indigenes were incorporated into the Roman market system with no shift in settlement pattern or, probably, in social organization. The survey has amplified previous insights into the Romanization process and even more than in 1987 demonstrated the potential of survey in areas with heavy ground cover. AN ARCHITECTURAL CINERARY URN IN FLORENCE AND THE LATE REPUBLICAN BASILICA: Anne Weis, Uni- versity of Pittsburgh A limestone cinerary urn in Florence (Mus. Arch. inv. 5539: M. Sprenger et al., The Etruscans [New York 1983] pl. 274b) is often cited as an example of a late Etruscan aristo- cratic house, yet no actual parallels for a house of this sort exist. The vertical development of the structure, the fact that its one-and-a-half to two stories are contained under a simple, double-eaved roof, and the open entranceways at either end suggest that the building or building type repre- sented by the urn was a hall-like structure that was com- pletely open. The best parallel for a building of this sort is the Roman Republican basilica, which is known from Vitru- vius (De Arch. 5.1.4-10; 6.3.9) and from excavation. The windows which run below the upper cornice of the building resemble those of the Roman basilica at Pompeii. The wide entrances on the short sides of the urn have parallels in the broad side-entries of the basilicas at Lucus Feroniae and</page><page sequence="28">320 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 Alba Fucens. The Florence urn is generally dated ca. 100 B.C. and is therefore roughly contemporary with the basili- cas at Pompeii, Alba Fucens, and Lucus Feroniae; its iden- tification as a basilica would thus provide us with: 1) an early example of this important building type known in super- structure rather than simply in plan, and 2) a new example from Etruria, an area whose civic architecture is otherwise not well known. An examination of the building illustrated by the Florence urn in light of the other evidence available for the develop- ment of the basilica in this period suggests that: 1) the forms that such buildings could take, and presumably the origins of these forms, were varied. Some were open across the facade, like the Greek stoa, while others, like this one, were covered pavilions or halls. 2) The urbanistic role of the basilica, as an element that defined the boundaries of the forum and was located in opposition to a temple at the other end of the forum space, probably emerged later, in the late first century B.C. A more important relationship existed originally between the basilica and an adjacent temple. 3) Basilicas, or buildings serving a comparable, commercial purpose, were as much at home in northern and central Etruria as they were in Latium and Campania in the period ca. 100 B.C., areas generally thought to have been more commercially active. North-central Etruria was an important supplier of grain and specialty crops to Rome in this period, and may have pioneered a middleman-trade in slaves and other commodities between Latium and the Gallic territories to the north. The urn may in fact mark the final resting place of an Etruscan businessman who gave a basilica to his city. No Etruscan building inscriptions of the sort known from Late Republican Latium exist, but it seems reasonable to suggest that a local patron might have chosen to commem- orate his benefaction by taking a model of it to his tomb. VOTIVE DEPOSITS AS EVIDENCE FOR LUSTRATIO RITUALS IN ETRUSCAN CITIES: Ingrid E.M. Edlund-Berry, University of Texas, Austin According to Latin and Umbrian texts, rituals of purifi- cation (lustratio) formed an important part of the religious calendar. In Rome, these rituals included a procession with sacrificial animals (suovetaurilia) around the fields (ambar- valia) or the city (amburbium). In Umbria, the Iguvine tablets record a procession around the city of Iguvium (Gubbio), with stops for sacrifices of boars, sows, and heifers inside and outside the major gates and at the shrines. While there are no texts describing similar rituals in Etru- ria, a careful evaluation of the location of votive deposits and their contents suggests that, in fact, the practice of lustratio was observed not only by the Romans and the Um- brians, but also by the Etruscans. Votive deposits appear not only near temples and other sacred places, but also inside and outside city gates, and along roads, as seen, for example, at Veii, Vulci, and Saturnia (A. Comella, MEFRA 93 [1981] 717-803). The offerings range from terracotta figurines, anatomical parts, and heads to miniature pottery and animal statuettes. The last category includes pigs, bulls, and other domestic animals. The distribution of offerings in relation to the location of votive deposits suggests that not only healing cults were practiced at the entry to and exit from a city, or at a shrine, as is generally assumed. In addition, animal statuettes were used at these same points as tokens or substitutes for the live animals that formed part of a Roman or Umbrian lustratio. DIVIDING THE CHORA: METAPONTO IN THE SIXTH CEN- TURY B.C.: Joseph Coleman Carter, University of Texas, Austin Few problems confronting the historian and archaeologist have greater significance for our understanding of the struc- ture of Greek society than the question of how the land was divided. Aerial photography in the territory (chora) of Me- taponto by Schmiedt and Chevallier revealed a grid of par- allel "lines" dividing the chora into strips approximately 200 m wide and Adamesteanu dated it to the early sixth century B.C. Excavations of farmhouses by the University of Texas team (1974-1982) and the blanket survey of a large area (42 km2) of the territory (1981-1985) where the "division lines" show up most clearly have given chronological and quanti- tative definition to the system. Doubts about the reality of the "lines" in aerial photo- graphs have been an obstacle to full acceptance of this ar- chaeological data by historians. What were the so-called "division lines" really? Were they roads, or canals? Or both? A 1983 study by Folk, a geologist, argued that they were a natural phenomenon corresponding to the underlying frac- ture pattern for this region of Italy. One discovery has not only proved that the lines existed but also clearly demon- strates their function-they were roads flanked by drainage ditches-and established their date-no later than the first half of the fifth century B.C. A stretch of "line" appearing in the basic aerial photographs of 1954 and running through the Pantanello necropolis was excavated in 1986 at four points. The widths of the division-line road and the main road it intersects (discovered in 1984) correspond precisely to the widths for main and secondary roads described in the fourth-century B.C. bronze tablet from nearby Herakleia. Also in 1986, DeSiena of the Soprintendenza discovered a parallel line 625 m away. At last we have thoroughly con- vincing confirmation on the ground of the grid discovered from the air. ARCHITECTURAL TERRACOTTAS FROM THE ARCHAIC SANCTUARY AT INCORONATA: Sarah Leach Davis, Universitit Wiirzburg The site of Incoronata, in the hinterland of the Greek colony of Metapontum, has been known chiefly for the seventh-century settlement, which yielded abundant colonial and indigenous pottery. Virtually unknown, however, are the remains of a small sixth-century sanctuary which ap- peared during excavations conducted by the University of Texas in 1977 and 1978. Although a representative selection of the architectural and votive terracottas found at the site traveled to Texas in 1977 as part of an exhibition entitled "Ancient Crossroads: The Rural Population of Classical</page><page sequence="29">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 321 Italy," these finds have not been exhibited or described elsewhere since that time. This sanctuary is important not only because it indicates the significance of this site during the sixth century, but especially because the architectural terracottas permit the reconstruction of an unusual Archaic roof. This paper presents the architectural terracottas from Incoronata and relates them to the contemporary produc- tion of southern Italy, Sicily, and Greece. Three types of architectural terracottas have been found at Incoronata: roof tiles, geison revetments, and antefixes. The geison revetments and antefixes belong to types the distribution of which includes southern Italy and Sicily but is in Greece limited to the "Western" treasuries at Olympia and Delphi. The decorative technique of low relief used on the fragments from Incoronata, meanwhile, finds closer par- allels in southern Italy than in Sicily or Greece. The terra- cotta frieze plaques from Metaponto, S. Biagio, and Serra di Vaglio demonstrate the early production of relief decoration for sanctuaries in the territory of Metaponto. It therefore comes as no surprise to find the technique applied to the architectural terracottas from Incoronata. What is surprising, however, is the use of Laconian roof tiles to cover this small building. Laconian tiles dating to the Archaic period are most common in the Peloponnesus, but have not yet been found in Sicily or southern Italy. The architectural terracottas from Incoronata thus provide a unique addition to the archaeological evidence for the di- versity of architectural traditions practiced in the territory of Metaponto during the Archaic period. ROCCAGLORIOSA 1988-1989: EXPLORATION OF THE EXTRAMURAL AREAS: Maurizio Gualtieri, University of Alberta The 1982-1987 excavations at this pre-Roman site in western Lucania have been focused on the central plateau within the fortification wall and have clarified the organiza- tion and functional complexity of the fortified settlement (World Archaeology 19 [1987] 30-46). Thanks to the contin- ued support of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada it has been possible to undertake the systematic exploration of the settlement areas in the lower plateaus outside of the fortification wall located by surface survey. In the summer of 1988, an area of ca. 1 hectare (or 3 acres) on a large extramural plateau southwest of the central gate was explored by both magnetic and electric resistivity survey. The combined results of both surveys have documented the existence of a major north-south paved road with structures along the east side and a large open space of ca. 30 x 20 (market square?) along the west side. In summer 1989, the geophysical survey (conducted by M. Cucarzi and D. Gabrielli, Fondazione Lerici, Rome) was extended to the southern part of the plateau and three test trenches were opened in order to test anomalies. As a result, important new data on the chronology of the extramural areas have been recovered and it has been possible to confirm the expansion of the habitation areas outside of the fortified circuit as a later fourth century B.C. phenomenon, which reached its peak in the first half of the third century B.C. Elements of continuity of habitation into the Late Republican period, although on a much reduced scale, have also emerged. CERAMIC EVIDENCE IN THE THIRD CENTURY B.C. IN SOUTHERN ITALY: SOME OBSERVATIONS: Helena Fracchia, University of Alberta The absence of black-glaze pottery datable from ca. 280 to the late third century B.C. in the hinterland of southern Italy has often been interpreted as evidence for the early third-century B.C. depopulation of fourth-century nu- cleated sites and their territories as a result of the destructive Roman intrusion into the area. The absence of pottery dated to the third century and the concomitant vacuum reflected in the settlement pattern have also been noted in other areas such as southern Etruria (T. Potter), the Cosa region (S. Dyson), and the Liri Valley (E. Wightman). In western Lu- cania, some modification of the perceived ceramic absence, settlement vacuum, and destructive Roman presence may now be justified by new archaeological documentation from both survey and excavations. Numerous local ceramic work- shops appear in the hinterland after the fall of Taranto; new forms and forms imitating Roman products as well as Campanian amphorae are found at western Lucanian sites from ca. 300 B.C. onward. A number of large nucleated sites exists until the late third century when gradual abandon- ment, not destruction, is documented. The early dispersion into the hinterland of Roman black-glaze forms and/or local imitations thereof is the result of contact with Roman colo- nies founded along the western coast and central valley of southern Italy in the first decades of that century. SESSION IV C: SEVEN FIELD REPORTS FROM CRETE PEAK SANCTUARIES IN WESTERN CRETE: THE ATSI- PADHES KORAKIAS PROJECT: A.A.D. Peatfield, British School of Archaeology at Athens Atsipadhes Korakias is the furthest west Minoan peak sanctuary known. Surface investigation confirms the identi- fication of the site and suggests that it merits excavation. The project is the first integrated study of a provincial peak sanctuary, including excavation and survey, and designed to test the author's topographic and historical ideas about peak sanctuaries (BSA 78 [1983] 273-79). As a West Cretan peak sanctuary, Atsipadhes will correct the geographical bias of previously known sites, particularly the concentration in East Crete. Peak sanctuaries are known primarily from the pub- lications of Petsophas (BSA 9 [1903] 356-87) and Jouktas (Prakt 1974) to date; both are unusually rich, and therefore the study of Atsipadhes, a poorer site, will balance knowledge of the character of peak sanctuaries. The excavation records the spatial patterning of the finds, for the chronology and function of the site: e.g., concentra- tions of material to reveal points of specialized ritual activity. The scientific study of the artifacts (pottery, figurines) and</page><page sequence="30">322 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 environmental evidence (faunal/botanical remains, soil) is essential to the understanding of cultic activity on peak sanctuaries. The topographic study explores the relationship between sanctuary and settlements, and features such as routes, water sources, and pastures. The identification of peak sanctuaries in West Crete has been problematic. The character of the Atsipadhes peak sanctuary conforms to that of the East and Central Cretan peak sanctuaries. This reveals a Minoan religious unity from Sitias in the far east, to Rethymnon in the west. Further work is needed to discover whether this extends further west, into the Chania area. The study of Atsipadhes will initiate the scientific exploration of peak sanctuaries in West Crete. 1989 EXCAVATIONS AT MOCHLOS: Jeffrey S. Soles, Uni- versity of North Carolina, Greensboro, and Costis Davaras, Archaeological Institute of Crete In the summer of 1989, 81 years after Richard Seager's excavations of 1908 and 13 years since the last cleaning carried out by Davaras and Soles in the 1970s, excavations were resumed at Mochlos. The Project is organized as ajoint Greek-American excavation, conducted under the auspices of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens and the Archaeological Institute of Crete, and is designed to explore specific problems of Bronze Age civilization in Crete through the excavation of related Bronze age sites on the island of Mochlos and its adjacent coastal plain. Some of these problems involve chronological, architectural, or top- ographic subjects, others involve socioeconomic or environ- mental matters, and still others deal with the way different communities interacted with one another and with sociopol- itical change. During June, July, and August excavations were carried out in two areas on the island, the Prepalatial cemetery and the Minoan settlement, and preliminary investigations were begun at two sites on the plain, the Minoan site at Palia Vardia and the Mycenaean site of Koukoutsia. Three tombs were uncovered in the Prepalatial cemetery, including one monumental tomb that contained a large cylinder seal im- ported from Northern Syria, and one building that was probably used in the burial ritual. Buildings in the Minoaw settlement that had been excavated by Seager were cleaned, and a large layer of volcanic ash, presumably from Santorini, was found between LM IA and IB floors in one of these houses which was substantially rebuilt in the IB phase. A large, unexcavated LM I house and part of a house that was probably built in the MM III phase, which contained more than 10 stratified floors ranging from LM IB to MM III, were also found in the settlement. Beneath the Neopalatial settlement remains of Prepalatial houses were also exposed. The excavation is uncovering well-stratified and extensive remains in the island's settlement for both the Prepalatial and the Late Minoan periods; excavations planned for sites on the plain aim at discovering the relationship of this oc- cupation to that on the plain. EXCAVATIONS AT PSEIRA, 1988-1989: Philip P. Betan- court, Temple University, Costis Davaras, Archaeo- logical Institute of Crete, and Fotini Zervaki, University of Pennsylvania The excavations at Pseira, in eastern Crete, are uncover- ing a Minoan town inhabited from the Final Neolithic until Late Minoan IB, with a small reoccupation in Late Minoan III. In the 1988 and 1989 seasons excavations took place both in the settlement and in a nearby cemetery. Work in the town concentrated on the Plateia House, a large building on the north of the town square. The building was two stories high with an entrance at the northeast corner of the square. Finds provide evidence for domestic use, several industries (including weaving and stone vase manufacture) as well as possible ritual use (stone chalice fragments and a complete triton shell). The building was destroyed in LM IB. The cemetery dates from Final Neolithic to MM II. Tombs include rock shelters, built house tombs, and cist graves with Cycladic parallels. Among the earliest finds are Cycladic imports as well as locally made FN/EM I pottery. Near the tombs was a small court in front of a shallow cave, set off by a low stone wall. INTENSIVE SURVEY OF PSEIRA ISLAND, CRETE: Richard Hope-Simpson, Queen's University, and Philip P. Betancourt, Temple University From 1985-1989 Pseira island was intensively surveyed, by the authors and students from Queen's and Temple Universities. Survey and minor excavations have dated the Minoan agricultural terraces covering most of the island. Two walled agricultural compounds and two cement-lined cisterns were dated to the sixth to seventh centuries A.C., as was at least one of the 10 threshing floors found. Some other agricultural structures, including four sheepfolds and three stone huts, are Late Medieval or Early Modern. Most of the sherds from the over 400 artifact groups collected are Mi- noan, including a large proportion of Middle Minoan. Ex- cept for the monastery and the two walled compounds, Byzantine sherds are few (although widespread) and mainly from closed vessels (presumably mostly water containers). Pottery of other periods is extremely scarce. It appears that full subsistence agriculture was only practiced here in Mi- noan times, and that Byzantine agriculture, apart from the grazing of animals, was mainly confined to the walled com- pounds. In both of the excavated terraces, the earliest sherds were Middle Minoan. One terrace had two distinct levels, the lower of terra rossa, with Middle Minoan sherds only, and the upper of silt with small worn Late Minoan sherds and some volcanic ash from the ca. 1500 B.C. Santorini eruption. Two massive stone dams, each about 3 m thick and at least 3.50 m high, were found across the lower parts of the two main stream beds. These would have provided water for irrigation and silt for replenishing the terraces. They would also have helped to prevent soil erosion from seasonal storms. Partial excavation of their rammed earth cores in 1989 gave a terminus post quem late in the Middle Minoan</page><page sequence="31">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 323 period, a time when a "population explosion" here is indi- cated. The evidence from both survey and excavation dem- onstrates that all the available agricultural land had then already been terraced. NEW EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO (1988-1989): L. Hugh Sackett, Groton School, andJ.A. MacGillivray, Columbia University Excavation was continued in four Late Minoan buildings on the north side of the Roussolakkos town site (Buildings 1 and 3-5). Building 1 was severely eroded but was fully revealed in outline, and good evidence was recovered for its history: founded in late LM IA, it replaced an MM IIB/LM IA structure in which metallurgical work in copper had taken place. Domestic activity (grinding grain and cooking) and some religious functions are among those suggested for the successive periods of later occupation (LM IB, LM II, and LM III). Building 3, adjacent to this, was much better pre- served, up to a height of 1.50 m, and had a similar history. Fine marine style pottery was found in a burnt LM IB destruction level (only partially uncovered); the LM II pe- riod was represented by the fragment of an Ephyrean goblet, not found before in East Crete; later reoccupation was marked by internal subdivision and blocking walls, ending apparently with a late use as an open enclosure. Building 4 was cleared to its reoccupation floors, which contained a fine assemblage of LM IIIA2/B pottery, evidence for a possible house shrine and for industrial activity involving liquids, perhaps washing and dyeing. A rectangular seal with Minoan hieroglyphic inscription came from beneath the LM I floor, and may be associated with an earlier structure that was destroyed by earthquake in early LM IA. Building 5 has only been partially uncovered, but a rich series of finds derives from an extensive LM IB destruction fill. These include decorated pottery, unfinished ivory col- umns, and three clay sealings, one of which preserves the impression of a hunting scene, evidently from a fine gold ring. The chryselephantine statuette, found in the 'plateia' nearby, is thought to have fallen from the upper story of this building. The statuette is a masterpiece of Minoan art, using ivory for torso, feet, and face, gray serpentine for the close-shaved head, rock-crystal for the eyes, and gold foil for decoration. The legs may well have been made from wood, now perished. THE KAVOUSI-THRIPHTI SURVEY, 1988-1989: Mar- garet S. Mook and Donald Haggis, American School of Classical Studies at Athens The Kavousi-Thriphti Survey is being conducted in con- junction with the Kavousi Project excavations in eastern Crete, under the auspices of the American School of Clas- sical Studies at Athens and the Greek Ministry of Culture. Intensive survey was conducted from September to Novem- ber 1988 and continued in the fall of 1989. Work in 1988 was concentrated in the Kavousi plain area and Platys River catchment. The purpose of field work was to 1) locate and make a preliminary record of all sites in the plain area; 2) map soil and vegetation types in detail; 3) make preliminary correlations between site and soil types; and 4) complete a study of modern land use and seasonal habitation. The results are summarized. A total of 22 sites were recovered in 1988, ranging in date from Early Minoan to Venetian, with a proliferation of settlement in the Kam- pos/Chordakia plain in LM I and LM III (14 sites). Evidence for the earliest and most dense habitation and land use was found in the fringe areas on the west side of the Kampos plain in association with silty clay soils (dolomites and phyl- lites) in stable environments. Evidence for habitation in the central plain is restricted to sparse sherd scatters of LM and Roman date and it is now believed that the fluvial deposit of Kampos was the poorest agricultural soil in the area in prehistoric times as it is today. Modern habitation (post 1960) and intensive use of the central plain are a result of the construction of deep wells and automatic-pipeline irrigation. The purpose of work in 1989 was to complete the field- walking in the Avgo and Mylonia catchment, and the Vronda/Kastro areas, and to assess the variation in land use and habitation between mountain and plain areas. Soil stud- ies are being conducted byJohn Ammons and Mike Timpson (University of Tennessee) and botanical studies have been conducted by Richard Hebda (British Columbia Provincial Museum). The problem orientation is to establish environ- mental and cultural criteria for testing historical and archae- ological models of human activity in the transition from the Bronze Age to Iron Age in Crete. EXCAVATIONS AT KAVOUSI, CRETE, 1989: Geraldine C. Gesell, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, William D.E. Coulson, American School of Classical Studies at Athens, and Leslie Preston Day, Wabash College In 1989 excavations took place on the Vronda and Kastro sites. The work at Vronda continued on the summit of the hill and its south, west, and north slopes to clarify the Late Minoan IIIC-SM settlement plan. Houses generally include benches, open hearths, corner ovens, and storerooms. It is now clear that the shrine consists of two rooms with benches. In the north room, it has been determined that the cult material discovered in 1988-six whole snake tubes, kalathoi, and plaques-was lying above the floor level, probably fallen from an upper story. The south room was disturbed by a Late Geometric cist grave, but in the clay layer that ran under the cist grave were found several plaques and the torso of a goddess with upraised hands. Reconstruction of this material has shown that there were at least 17 goddesses, 14 snake tubes, and 21 plaques, several of which are topped with horns of consecration. Late Geometric cremation bur- ials with pottery and iron and bronze objects continue to be discovered in the buildings of the LM IIIC-SM settlement. On the Kastro work continued on the east and west ter- races of the peak. A large megaron-type structure with walls preserved to a height of three meters has been found on the east. On the west is a series of rooms in which blocked doorways and rebuilt walls indicate at least four architectural phases. The stratified deposits of pottery date from LM IIIC</page><page sequence="32">324 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 to Late Geometric. This new evidence indicates that there was inhabitation on the Kastro as well as at Vronda in LM IIIC. SESSION IV D: COLLOQUIUM: RECENT DIS- COVERIES IN CHINA: THE CENTER AND THE PERIPHERIES A DISCUSSION OF THE HEMUDU, HONGSHAN, AND LIANGZHU CULTURES: Anne P. Underhill, University of British Columbia A salient feature of archaeological research in China dur- ing the last decade is identification of cultural diversity. It is clear that cultures developed independently in several re- gions during the Neolithic period. In this paper I discuss three cultures with particularly significant remains, two from the lower Changjiang region, Hemudu, and the late Neo- lithic culture, Liangzhu, and one from the northeast, Hong- shan. I focus on evidence for subsistence strategies: agriculture, housing (particularly with regard to Hemudu), production and consumption of craft goods (pottery, jade), burial and other types of ritual, and in the case of Liangzhu, development of cultural complexity. I compare cultural de- velopments with those in the Central Plain. Also, I discuss the implications of the archaeological remains of these im- portant cultures for future research. SHANG BRONZE STYLES FROM THE PERIOD OF THE IN- TERVENING CAPITALS: Louisa G. Fitzgerald Huber, Harvard University With the discovery of Tomb 5 at Hsiao-t'un, which has provided a benchmark for the stage in the evolution of Shang bronze styles attained by the end of the first century of the Anyang Period, and with the growing consensus of opinion that Cheng-chou is equivalent in time to the first Shang capital known as Po, the archaeologically unattested period of the intervening capitals immediately antecendent to Anyang becomes more precisely delimited, allowing us for the first time to determine with reasonable probability the significant advances in the history of Chinese bronzes attributable to this approximately sixty-year period, which is known as the ta-k'ung, or the "big gap." Among the chief artistic achievements that may now be ascribed to this period is the development of Style IV, char- acterized by images contrasted to a lei-wen ground. It is the intention of this author to treat the evolution of this style from its initial emergence at Cheng-chou to its earliest man- ifestation at Anyang, and to supply evidence for the phases in the development of this style during the intervening period. In the course of this presentation two fundamental misconceptions concerning Style IV will be addressed: 1) the notion that Style IV was the first in which an image-ground distinction was made; and 2) the long-held assumption that Style IV evolved directly from the mature phase of Style III. It will be shown, to the contrary, that the beginning of Style IV preceded the maturity of Style III, and that it originated instead from the integration into one decorative scheme of the combined techniques of Style I and II. Evidence for the beginning of relief decoration (Style V), the introduction of cast inscriptions, and the style of the accompanying jades during the period of the intervening capitals will also be discussed. A CASE STUDY OF SHANG-ZHOU "PROVINCIAL" BRONZES-SOME PROBLEMS IN METHODOLOGY: Wu Hung, Harvard University One major development in recent Chinese archaeology is the increasing discovery of bronze ritual vessels, musical instruments, and other artifacts in so-called "provincial" areas. Lacking enough textual, epigraphic, and stratigraphic evidence, however, people tend to compare these finds with better known examples from the "metropolitan" areas to determine their relative and absolute chronology, but these studies leave questions of history and methodology. Such studies should lead to the formulation of new developmental patterns involving chronology and geography, not chronol- ogy alone. While current studies emphasize stylistic and typological similarities and continuities, differences between "provincial" and "metropolitan" bronzes also demand atten- tion because their divergence could indicate differences in function in differing cultural and religious contexts. An inquiry directed to these problems might even challenge the terms "metropolitan" and "provincial" which are rooted in the concept of a "pan-Chinese" culture. I discuss these issues by focusing on the bell, a well-defined group of Shang and Zhou bronzes. I use examples from different areas to construct a chronological-geographical pattern for the bell, focusing on divergent features to explain the implications of such differences. The method used here may also be employed in studying other groups of bronzes. THE WESTERN ZHOU TRANSFORMATION: Katheryn M. Linduff, University of Pittsburgh The Western Zhou dynasty was a crucial period in Chinese history, laying much of the foundation of traditional Chinese civilization, so classical literature claims. During the era the small but powerful ruling class developed a coherent nation as well as a massive feudal network, and promoted a cultural and political program that had an indelible effect on later Chinese society. At the time of the conquest (ca. 1122 B.C.), the Zhou were a considerable force in north China. Operating from their base in the Wei River Valley, they already had a history as a nation. Traditional literature claims that their founder's lineage was both divine and mortal. Hou Qi was an agriculturist and an associate of the founder of the Hsia. According to the official historians, therefore, he had a lineage that could be justified within the dynastic sequence. After its founding the group's lifestyle was not completely sedentary, for according to the origin myth in the Shiji, the Zhou were forced to move their home base several times. That migration became an</page><page sequence="33">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 325 important factor in the formation of their culture, but the historians consider the change from a settled, agricultural life to a "semi-barbaric," nomadic, or migratory one, a cul- tural deficit. That process is used to point out the inferior status afforded the Zhou when compared to the Shang, often thought of by historians as the "classic" culture among the Three Dynasties. A reconsideration of ancient literature in light of the archaeological record now allows a reconstruction of the route followed by the proto-Zhou people, and examination of their settlement at a site called Qishan prior to the down- fall of the Shang provides a new understanding of the estab- lishment of the Zhou Dynasty. The Zhou were neither an isolated nor unsophisticated group, but rather one with an assimilative character probably gained through contact with many other groups, including non-Chinese, before their rise to political dominance in north China. Such a group, found in the dynamic circumstances of the later second millennium B.C., had the opportunity to accumulate and absorb cultural as well as territorial assets from their neighbors. Their mark on Chinese culture is unquestioned. The view that they were a primitive, semi-barbaric group as proposed in traditional literature must be challenged, however. RECENT DISCOVERIES CONCERNING BRONZE PRODUC- TION AND THE METALS TRADE AMONG THE SOUTH- WESTERN BARBARIANS: Robert E. Murowchick, Harvard University The distinctive bronze metallurgy of the "Southwestern Barbarians" has intrigued archaeologists and art historians since the 1920s. Data uncovered during the past three de- cades of scientific archaeology in southwest China and South- east Asia has thoroughly demonstrated widely ranging interaction among the Dian, Dongson, and other agricultural and nomadic cultures of the area. For many years, research- ers have pointed to interaction with the Steppes, the Zhong Yuan, and with Chu as the underlying source of Southwest China's metallurgical tradition. Recent work, however, suggests that the rise of regional centers of bronze production in the southwest resulted from a complex indigenous combination of military, political, and religious forces that revolved around the production and consumption of bronze. This process was a self-feeding one, with aristocratic control of bronze for agricultural imple- ments, tools, weapons, and ritual paraphernalia, both allow- ing and insuring further exploitation of very unevenly distributed ore sources. Moreover, the control of these stra- tegic ores extended their influence over a much broader area than was previously suspected. New finds of Dian-style bronze halberds in resource-poor southern Vietnam and the discovery of Shang jades and bronzes among the startling cast bronze figures in the sacrificial pits at Sanxingdui, Guan- ghan County, Sichuan, support a postulated metals trade network originating in the southwest periphery. If borne out by future archaeological research, this early commercial exploitation of some of the richest metal ore sources in China will shed new light on long distance cultural interaction in China and Southeast Asia during the second and first mil- lennia B.C. THE BARBARIAN ELEMENT IN THE EASTERN ZHOU STATE OF ZHONGSHAN: David W. Goodrich, Yale Uni- versity Recent discoveries show that Chinese civilization arose in a broad and varied sphere of cultural interaction. The small, "barbarian" state of Zhongshan persisted between powerful neighbors well within the sphere and can be associated with a distinctive set of archaeological remains. This situation, and some spectacular discoveries, make Zhongshan a focus for discussing what is Chinese. More traditional interpreta- tions now cite the Zhongshan royal mausolea as exemplars of Chinese mortuary practices in the Warring States period, and see the grave goods as mostly Chinese; in this view, the barbarian heritage persists only in some decorative styles, representing little more than the origin myth of a thoroughly sinicized people. Partisans of Zhongshan's distinctiveness value any non-Chinese elements the more for simply per- sisting despite the general trend towards homogeneity. Be- tween these poles, and beyond the sumptuous legacy of the elite, the complexion of the local culture can only be found in a broader examination of the archaeological context. SESSION V A: ATHENIAN AND CORINTHIAN VASE PAINTING PROTOATTIC VASE PAINTING: A CONTEXTUAL APPROACH: A. James M. Whitley, British School of Archaeology at Athens Work on Protoattic pottery and vase painting has hitherto confined itself to the traditional fields of stylistic analysis, iconography, and the attribution of hands and workshops, as can be seen in the works of authors as disparate as J.M. Cook ("Protoattic Pottery," BSA 35 [1934-1935] 165-211) or S.P. Morris (The Black and White Style [New Haven 1984]). Protoattic has in the main been treated as a prelude to Attic black-figure. This paper proposes that Protoattic should be considered primarily in its archaeological and social context if its contemporary significance is to be properly assessed. It should first be examined in relation to its context of depo- sition and to the depositional practices of seventh-century Attica (votive, funerary, and domestic) to determine its range of uses and possible meanings. Through an examination of the associations and preferred uses of Protoattic pottery we can begin to place both the pots and their imagery more firmly in their seventh-century Attic context. It is suggested that Protoattic is best understood as an exclusive, elite style, with a restricted range of uses. It represents the revival of the principle of the social rationing of style, whereby the aristocratic elite helped to define itself through a restricted access to the Orientalizing iconography and heroic or myth- ical subject matter.</page><page sequence="34">326 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 GODS WHO SACRIFICE: A PARADOX OF ATTIC ICON- OGRAPHY: Kimberley C. Patton, Harvard University A small but deeply challenging group of early fifth-cen- tury Attic vases continues to present problems of religious interpretation; its best known exemplar is Boston's great kalpis-hydria by the Berlin Painter (Museum of Fine Arts 1978.45, ca. 485 B.C.), depicting six of the Hellenic high gods (Apollo, Artemis, Leto, Iris, Hermes, Athena) converg- ing on an altar with libation and flower offerings. To whom are the gods sacrificing? This unorthodox convention in- cludes images of Dionysos, Eros, the Eleusinian goddesses, and possibly Zeus himself. The athanatoi, in a sacerdotal role, perform the mortal act of worship which is the central cultic mechanism of ancient Greek religion. Within this cor- pus, typological distinctions can and should be made: libation vs. animal sacrifice; altar-oriented, Olympian spondai vs. chthonian choai. Literary correlatives (Hymn to Hermes 128- 29 and Theog. 535-6 1) are considered, as well as the Archaic phiale-bearing cult images (Delphi, Piraeus) and the related reliefs (Brauron, Athens) that postdate the vase paintings. The thought of Nilsson, Simon, and Burkert on the topic is synthesized, and the evidence for a more comprehensive series of solutions set forth. Among them are: 1) sacrifice to a higher deity; 2) the related notion of atonement for the overthrow of an earlier divine generation; 3) divine sacrifice as paradigm for human worship. The question is liberated from a purely Classical context. Our closest Indo-European parallel occurs in the continual Soma sacrifice by the Vedic gods; in these contexts, sacrifice has no necessary object, but is itself a hieratic, universally sustaining action, or else is associated with ancestor worship. Might the Indic help to illuminate the Hellenic case? In Zoroastrian, and later in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic analogues, the paradox of a "worshiping deity" emerges as a cultic structure whose im- mense power depends on its very reversal of canonical sac- rificial categories (sacrificer or devotee, victim, object of sacrifice or devotion). ONE OLD VASE-ONE NEW DANAE: John H. Oakley, College of William and Mary In 1928 the police confiscated a box of antiquities from a former resident of Corinth who had fled an earthquake. These antiquities were deposited in the Corinth Museum and published by L. Shoe (Hesperia 1 [1932] 56-89). In- cluded was an Attic white-ground lekythos (MP 90) of 460- 450 B.C. which was later assigned by Haspels and Beazley to the Beldam Painter's workshop. All three interpreted the scene as a woman seated between columns. An examination of the vase indicates that a crucial detail that leads to a proper identification of the scene was misinterpreted, namely the painted line of large dots running from the top of the picture into a woman's hands. Shoe thought the upper portion was part of an unintelligible inscription, the lower part of an object held by the woman, now mostly lost. In reality there is one line of dots representing Zeus in the form of golden rain coming to Danae. Akrisios, Danae's father, learning from an oracle that his grandchild would kill him, imprisoned Danae. Zeus, how- ever, came to her in the form of golden rain. Perseus was the result. Only 10 red-figure vases show this myth, seven of them Attic. The lekythos in Corinth is the first white- ground vase with this myth, and it has a number of details not shown on the other vases, the most interesting of which are the columns; they give a successful image of the chamber in which Danae was imprisoned, something not shown on the other vases. TYPOLOGY OF THE DIONYSIAC THYRSOS: Dorothy A. D. Rohner, University of Colorado Seven style groups of thyrsos forms have been recognized from 899 Dionysiac scenes on black- and red-figure pottery. These have been catalogued and dated according to stylistic changes in pottery painting. A chart shows the relationship between the seven styles of thyrsos forms, their chronology, and fluctuation of popularity in vase painting depictions. This stylistic analysis of the typology of the Dionysiac thyrsos as it appears in vase painting from the mid-sixth to the late fourth century has revealed the following. Estab- lished workshops are confirmed. Shifts occur in the popu- larity of the thyrsos's iconography though cultic scenes remain popular. Thyrsos shapes develop and new elements are introduced. Based on observed thyrsos depictions as catalogued in the seven styles, dating and attribution ques- tions arose concerning Makron and Hermonax vases. The thyrsos may be used as a dating tool as certain forms do not appear before established dates and conversely others die out or are visually changed. Among the 438 Dionysiac cult scenes on black-figure vases only two depictions of thyrsoi occur and these on a single amphora (CVA Golochow Mus6e, Czartoryski, pl. 13). The bilingual period, 520-490 B.C., represents the first strong visual concept of the thyrsos as an ivy construction. The Ripe Archaic, 490-480 B.C, continues the ivy format and includes the sudden and popular appearance of the thyrsos form with ivy leaves upon a white wool thyrsos head. The Classical period shows a marked decline with only nine thyrsos de- pictions although the representation of cultic scenes remains high with 138 examples. This analysis shows a change in cult at the end of the sixth century B.C. with the introduction of the thyrsos as a cult implement or perhaps the artists' first recognition of it. Based on the dating evidence of the seven style groups the author believes a cup dated 460 B.C. should be redated to be 480 B.C. (CVA Oxford 11.1, pl. 52). The attribution of a column krater to Makron (CVA Villa Giulia fasc. 1, pl. 3) is questioned. Further, as four depictions of men in the Dion- ysiac scene with thyrsoi were found, the question of the male celebrant is again raised. BETWEEN ATHENS AND CORINTH: EARLY SIXTH-CEN- TURY BLACK-FIGURE CUPS: Ann Blair Brownlee, Rut- gers University, Camden An unusual group of experimental and transitional cups, having features characteristic of both the Siana cup and its precursor, the Komast cup, sheds new light on the devel-</page><page sequence="35">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 327 opment of these cup types. The group includes a recently published example from Corinth (Hesperia 56 [1987] 84- 85). The earliest known Siana cups, attributed to the C Painter, appear ca. 575 B.C., and H.A.G. Brijder (Siana Cups I and Komast Cups [Amsterdam 1983]) has recently argued that they were invented by that artist. The newly identified group is, however, associated with the Komast Group, and it pro- vides evidence that the Siana cup originated in that work- shop. Brijder has also challenged the traditional view of the origin of the Komast cup; he believes that its development is an Attic phenomenon, largely unconnected with contem- porary Corinthian vase painting. But this group of experi- mental cups is Corinthianizing--clearly influenced by Middle Corinthian Gorgoneion Group cups. It is suggested, therefore, that Corinthian influence should still be seen as a potent force in the development of Attic black-figure cups. Moreover, the Siana cup, like the Komast cup, had its begin- nings in the workshop of the Komast Group. THE SOUTHEAST WORKSHOP: A KOTYLE WORKSHOP LOCATED IN CENTRAL CORINTH: Julie L. Bentz, Vic- toria University of Wellington Over 80 almost complete black-glazed and black-figure kotylai, all datable about 600 B.C., are among the fill exca- vated from Well 1947-4, below the Southeast Building in the Forum at Corinth. The 24 nearly identical black-glazed ko- tylai are blackened and burned; patterns of misfiring show how they were stacked during burning. The brittle, blistered, nearly vitrified fabric, and the fact that patterns of burning in no instance follow lines of breakage, demonstrate that the kotylai are from a spoiled kiln lot and not, as once suggested, from the shelf of a shop that burned down (0. Broneer, Hesperia 16 [1947] 237-38). As it is unlikely that the spoiled lot was dumped very far from the kiln, the burned vases point to the presence of a manufacturing establishment, to be called the Southeast Workshop, in the central part of Archaic Corinth, far from the Potters' Quarter that flour- ished on the outskirts of town. Attributions of 24 vases to four hands previously recog- nized from this deposit (D.A. Amyx, Corinthian Vase-Paint- ing of the Archaic Period, forthcoming) are considerably rearranged, subdivided, and/or conflated in the current study. Analysis of 60 figured kotylai, most carelessly deco- rated with a frieze of goat, panther, and bird, reveals that all are stylistically connected. Forty-four are attributable to six closely related hands, consistent with production in a single workshop. Each painter displays variations due not to stylistic evolution, but to the relative care, or lack thereof, taken in decorating vases produced within a very brief pe- riod. Though products of the Southeast Workshop are pres- ently known only at Corinth, study of this coherent group of kotylai provides an insight into the working of an estab- lishment involved in mass production of typical Early Cor- inthian pottery. CORINTHIAN CONVENTIONALIZING PAINTERS: Martha K. Risser, University of Pennsylvania The term "Conventionalizing" was coined by Agnes New- hall (AJA 35 [1931] 16) to describe the Corinthian pottery styles that developed around and after the middle of the sixth century B.C. Since Humfry Payne's Necrocorinthia, a survey of Corinthian vase painting, was published in the same year, Conventionalizing wares have been discussed primarily as part of the publication of specific areas or deposits. Through a comprehensive study of Corinthian Conventionalizing wares, however, a typology and chronol- ogy of this pottery are now possible, and this study contrib- utes to our understanding of the painters who decorated Conventionalizing pottery. Particularly important are the members of the Sam Wide Workshop. Best known for human-figured scenes in outline style, they also decorated vases, particularly kylikes, with large distinctive lotuses (JHS 69 [1949] 20-21; BCH 86 [1962] 141 n. 5; Corinth XV.3, 369). There is an example in Reading, and another was found at Perachora, but most of the examples have been found in the Potter's Quarter at Corinth, where a recent examination of context pottery from the American School of Classical Studies excavations has doubled the number of known examples. It can now be demonstrated that these vases were produced and painted by several hands. One such kylix, KV 568 (Corinth XV.3, no. 1739), was among the vases found in Stele Shrine A in the Potters' Quarter, and supports Williams's suggestion that Stele Shrine A was in use later than previously supposed and was not destroyed until after the middle of the fifth century (Hesperia 50 [1981] 415 n. 22; Corinthiaca 22-24). THE "MUSEO MASTRILLI" AND VASE COLLECTING IN 18TH-CENTURY NAPLES: Claire L. Lyons, Getty Cen- ter for the History of Art and the Humanities By the middle of the 18th century, the Kingdom of Naples was already well known to antiquarians and collectors as a rich source of painted "Etruscan" vases. One of the finest private collections of the time belonged to the Marchese Felice Mastrilli of Nola, whose gallery in Naples was a fre- quent stop on the itinerary of Classically-minded visitors. The collection, broken up and dispersed by an heir in 1766, has remained largely unknown, with the exception of several vases noted by Beazley. An unpublished manuscript entitled "Spiega de' vasi antichi" in the Archives of the History of Art at the Getty Center illustrates several hundred vases that can be linked to a contemporary inventory of the Mastrilli collection and often traced to current museum locations, thus supplying an invaluable index of provenance and col- lection history. The "Spiega" consists of a series of essays by noted anti- quarians on the iconography and shapes of the vases, amply illustrated by 200 plates of watercolor and pen-and-ink draw- ings. Dated between 1755 and 1766, it represents one of the earliest attempts to describe and categorize ancient pottery. The manuscript provides important new testimony on the first collection of Sir William Hamilton, who purchased the</page><page sequence="36">328 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 finest examples and later sold them to the British Museum. This paper surveys the initial phases of vase scholarship and assesses the "Spiega" in the context of the historical devel- opment of the archaeological catalogue. SESSION V B: PREHISTORIC MEDITERRA- NEAN CAPO ALFIERE, 1987: EXCAVATIONS AT A NEOLITHIC SITE ON THE EAST COAST OF CALABRIA: Jonathan Morter, University of Texas, Austin Excavations at the site of Capo Alfiere near Crotone, Calabria, have revealed the partially surviving remains of a large structure dating to the late fifth millennium B.C. The associated pottery is of the Stentinello style as defined orig- inally for the Neolithic of Sicily. The structure has walls built of large slabs and boulders and up to a meter thick. There appears to have been an internal cobble floor (possibly sev- eral superimposed). We know of no intact buildings of this period from the Neolithic of the southwest Italian mainland, particularly of this construction. Discovery of the structure was unexpected. The original intent of the excavation at the Neolithic site of Capo Alfiere was to recover floral and faunal economic data for a broader diachronic study by the Institute of Classical Archaeology at the University of Texas. Flotation recovery has proved most successful in providing a significant corpus of seed remains, the first from this kind of site in this part of Italy. Faunal analysis is not yet complete, but preliminary results are discussed. The ceramic assemblage is typical of Stentinello, with impressed decorated pottery of elaborate and finely exe- cuted design. The lithic assemblage contains a high propor- tion of obsidian (&gt;60%), certainly imported. This site, although originally opened for limited purposes, is producing interesting results in every major category of study so far attempted; either the finds are unique or they represent the first major body of data of their type for this area. PREHISTORIC ATTICA: THE OROPOS SURVEY PROJECT: Michael B. Cosmopoulos, University of Manitoba Prehistoric Attica has been well researched, except for its northeast section. A small number of finds from Oropos (B. Petrakos, Oropos and the Sanctuary of Amphiaraos [in Greek; Athens 1968] 12, 18) has suggested that prehistoric remains do exist in the area and that the need to investigate them has become urgent because of rapid touristic development. The Oropos Survey Project, conducted by the University of Manitoba with the permission of the Greek Archaeological Service, aims at discovering new sites and reconstructing the evolution of settlement pattern in the area of ancient Oropos. The area under investigation extends from Amphiareion in the east to Oropos in the west and covers approximately 10 km2. During the summer of 1989 approximately one third of this area was investigated by intensive fieldwalking. Fifteen new sites, nine of which date to the Bronze Age (four Early Helladic, one Late Helladic, four of uncertain date), with numerous pottery sherds, obsidian fragments, and stone and clay artifacts were found. Each new site was re- corded and plotted on a map. Its date, size, territory, and natural resources were assessed, and factors such as geo- morphology, vegetation, and land use patterns were exam- ined. Using this data, an attempt was made to define the function and hierarchy of the sites. All the prehistoric sites seem to have functioned as food- producing stations. During the first phases of the EH period the settlement pattern was nucleated (major and satellite sites), but in the middle phases it became dispersed (one large isolated site in the whole area). These EH sites form part of the chain of EH settlements along the northern coast of Attica and the southern Euboian coast. During the MH and early Mycenaean period the area seems to have been abandoned and only in the LH IIIC period was one site reoccupied. Its large dimensions and the fact that it was the only LH settlement in a large area suggest that it was the major settlement in the region. In fact, a cemetery discovered earlier (B. Petrakos, ArchDelt 1974, A) seems to have belonged to it. Four sites yielded obsidian fragments and Bronze Age pottery that could not be dated with certainty. A "NEW" CHALCOLITHIC FINE WARE FROM THE JORDAN VALLEY: Albert Leonard, Jr., University of Arizona Recent excavations at Kataret es-Samra in the eastern Jordan Valley have produced sherds of a distinctive, poly- chromatic pottery that appears to date to the end of the fourth millennium B.C., i.e., the interface between the Chal- colithic period and the Early Bronze/Proto-Urban Age. Such decorative pottery is exceptional at this time in the Jordan Valley and finds its closest parallels in Phases D and E of the Syrian Amuq Plain and other cultures well to the north of Kataret es-Samra. This paper describes this pottery, defines its stratigraphical placement, and attempts to place it within its own cultural horizon by examining comparanda from the Jordan Valley, coastal Syria, and southeastern Anatolia. THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF FERTILITY AND BIRTH: EXCA- VATIONS AT KISSONERGA-MOSPHILIA, CYPRUS 1987- 1989: Diane Bolger, University of Maryland, and E.J. Peltenburg, University of Edinburgh Nearly a decade of excavations by the Lemba Archaeo- logical Project at Kissonerga-Mosphilia near Paphos have revealed an important center of the local Chalcolithic period (4000-2500 B.C.). In recent seasons the Project has concen- trated upon the middle phase of that period (ca. 3000 B.C.) and in particular upon the unprecedented discovery in 1987 of a pit (Unit 1015) containing fire-cracked and ochre- stained stones, stone tools, a triton shell, stacked pottery vessels, and a group of 19 stone and pottery figurines. Most of the latter represent females, some standing with folded or outstretched arms and others with swollen bellies seated on stools. One of the standing figurines is decorated in an astonishing manner: a child, rendered in red paint, emerges</page><page sequence="37">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 329 from between its mother's broken legs. The evidence thus suggests that fertility and childbirth figure largely in this assemblage. The figurines were found in and around a red- on-white ware bowl shaped like a Chalcolithic circular build- ing and complete with a swivel door. Plastic modelling on the bowl's interior, in particular a rectangular hearth and radiating partition ridges, strongly suggests that the artist had a particular building in mind-Building 855 further to the south, dating also to the middle phase of the site. Al- though building models occur in many prehistoric cultures, they have usually been found in mortuary contexts (such as the renowned example from Vounous 1000 years later), or isolated in general habitation levels. Here, the model's burial in a non-funerary context together with more than 50 other objects makes it highly unlikely that the artifacts are mere children's toys. On the contrary, the concentration of figu- rines and their deliberate placement into the pit demand that we seriously consider the ritual aspects of the entire assemblage, its associated features, and the succession of social actions that may have engendered both. THE "AEGEANIZATION" OF AN INLAND CORINTHIAN VILLAGE: THE TRANSITION FROM MIDDLE HELLADIC TO LATE HELLADIC I AT TSOUNGIZA (NEMEA): Jeremy B. Rutter, Dartmouth College The excavations of 1984-1986 at Tsoungiza (Nemea) have revealed that the site was abandoned toward the end of the Early Helladic III period for some four or five cen- turies. The ceramic assemblage of the initial phases of reoc- cupation at the end of the Middle Helladic era is remarkably parochial: the local shape and decorative repertoires are spare, imports are few, and there is no evidence whatsoever for either Minoan or Cycladic influence except in the form of a couple of probable imports from Aegina. At the outset of the following Late Helladic (LH) I period, some half- dozen new ceramic classes suddenly appear. Most tend to be discrete in terms of their combinations of technology of production, shape range, decorative treatment, and fabric, a fact that suggests that they are the products of discrete workshops, quite possibly located at a number of different sites. With one exception, none is likely to have been locally produced. Highly distinctive biotite-tempered pottery is thought to have been made on Aegina. Because of the Tsoungiza excavations' exceptional standards of artifact re- covery and retention, the percentage of such imported ma- terial, in terms of both weight and sherd count, can be precisely determined for those classes that are visually dis- tinctive, no matter what the size of the fragments to which they have been reduced. The "Aeginetan" material alone accounts for an average of 10% and the combined total for all imported ceramics in LH I levels at Tsoungiza may prove to be as high as 20-25%. Not only is the sheer bulk of these imports astonishing at a site far removed from the sea in an era that lacked wheeled transport other than the war-chariot, but so is the number of distinct production centers repre- sented by them. For the first time since its reoccupation, Tsoungiza was now being introduced by such items to con- temporary Minoan, Cycladic, Aeginetan, and other regional fashions. Determining how this "Aegeanization" occurred- that is, how all these pots were delivered to Tsoungiza, from where, and by whom-is a problem whose solution will have an impact on our understanding of the Aegean at the begin- ning of the Late Bronze Age that goes far beyond the single site of Tsoungiza. EVIDENCE FOR SINGLE GREAVES IN THE LATE HELLADIC PERIOD: C. Diane Fortenberry, University of Cincin- nati In the Greek Bronze Age as for later periods, it has been universally assumed that metal greaves were worn in pairs, one on each leg. While pictorial evidence supports this as- sumption in the case of apparently organic leggings, there are indications that bronze greaves were worn on only one leg. The earliest example is the single greave from Dendra Tomb 12, in which there is no evidence for a matching greave. The single greave from Enkomi Tomb 18 and the two separate, unmatched ones from Tomb 15 may be added to the evidence; the belief that they are the remains of original pairs is due more to the assumption that greaves come in twos than to any evidence. Additional support comes from the Pylos frescoes, which show that while organic leg- gings protected both limbs, a metal greave, indicated by an elliptical line down the shin, was placed only on the right leg, never on both. Later parallels for the use of armor on the limbs of only one side of the body can be found in equipment used by Roman gladiators, who wore combinations of greaves, arm- guards, and shoulder-protectors only on the right or left side, depending on the type of combat to be fought. While these single greaves may originally have had a protective function, ensuring that the vulnerable, unshielded side of the body was reinforced, it is more likely that they were worn as symbols of status or rank, presumably within a military tradition. The evidence of greaves and other examples of "unilateral" armor, such as the single arm-guard from Dendra, add significantly to the impression that much of what has survived of Mycenaean armor was worn as much or more for symbolic reasons as for protection. POLLEN EVIDENCE FOR VEGETATION CHANGE IN WEST- ERN TURKEY: Donald G. Sullivan, University of Denver Pollen analysis provides information on the state of veg- etation in the past, and by implication, on past climate. The usefulness of pollen analysis for palaeoclimatic reconstruc- tion in the eastern Mediterranean is often limited because human-induced vegetation changes may mask the palynol- ogical evidence for climatic change. Climatically sensitive sites, however, can provide pollen and stratigraphic evidence for climatic fluctuations over the past few thousand years. Stratigraphic and palynological analysis of a sediment core from a montane lake in western Turkey yielded a long record of climatic and vegetation change. The evidence suggests that the Early Holocene (before about 8,000 B.P.) was quite dry; the Middle Holocene (ca. 7400 to ca. 2900 B.P.) was</page><page sequence="38">330 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 moister than the Early Holocene, but drier than today. Mod- ern precipitation and temperature regimes apparently be- came established by about 2900 years ago. Comparison with other pollen diagrams from western and southern Turkey suggests that the timing of deforestation differed from place to place, and that the extent of human- induced deforestation at a site varied as a function of dis- tance from population centers. The landscape of western and southern Turkey in antiquity was a patchwork of defo- rested slopes near population centers and along transpor- tation routes, and less disturbed, and even undisturbed, forest in more remote areas. THE THIRD SEASON AT MARSA MATRUH, THE SITE OF A LATE BRONZE AGE TRADING STATION ON THE NORTHWEST COAST OF EGYPT: Donald White, Uni- versity of Pennsylvania The Matruh area, judged by what had been discovered on the small island settlment at the end of its east lagoon, remained open to external contact during at least part of the 13th as well as the 14th century B.C. A significant per- centage of Egyptian wares, together with lesser amounts of Palestinian pottery, have now been recognized in addition to the Cypriot, Minoan, and Mycenaean fabrics first re- ported. Their dates provide a tangible indication that Ma- truh may have played a direct role in Egypt's much discussed frontier relations during the 19th dynasty. The 1989 sum- mer season saw the completion of the University of Penn- sylvania's excavation of the core of the LBA architectural remains on Bates's Island. The latest work increased the island's pottery sample through the addition of Mycenaean "Oatmeal" (or perhaps Levanto-Mycenaean) sherds as well as several Palestinian wares previously not recognized. Pre- viously undocumented Egyptian thick-walled storage vessel sherds were discovered in some numbers. Soil samples from both off and on the island were sent to the University of Cairo to be tested for their environmental and dietary in- formation. The geomorphology of the island, its lagoon system, and the surrounding areas 25 km to the west of Matruh and 7 km to its east were studied in some detail, with particular emphasis on LBA water levels. Pending lab- oratory results, the preliminary indications are that sea level in the second millennium B.C. was as much as 1.3 m higher than at present and may have been higher. Despite these promising signs that other protected 'island' stations were available for use by foreign mariners during the LBA along the lagoon systems that extend to either side of Matruh, surface reconnaissance in 1989 failed to produce any trace of Aegean occupation similar to that known from Bates's Island between Umm el Rakham and Ras Alum el Rum. On the other hand, the coastal ridges connecting the two zones produced additional limited scatters of the "shell-tempered pottery" first discovered in 1987 that seems comparable with pre-Greek Libyan fabrics reported from Cyrene (QAL 12 [1987] 17). If in time laboratory thermoluminescence testing succeeds in establishing a Bronze Age date for these wares, they will presumably serve to provide trace elements for the still unlocated seasonal encampments of the LBA Libyan population argued to have traded with the foreign occupants of Bates's Island and theoretically allied with the "sea peo- ples" during the 13th century reigns of Ramesses II and Merneptah. SESSION V C: TRADE AND SETTLEMENT IN THE ROMAN PROVINCES THE HUMEIMA HYDRAULIC SURVEY, 1989: John P. Oleson, University of Victoria The Humeima Hydraulic Survey has as its objective the analysis of the character and evolution of the system of water supply of the ancient settlement of Auara, in the Hisma, 50 km southeast of Petra, during the Nabataean, Roman, By- zantine, and Islamic periods. Excavations in 1989 revealed the design and chronology of several public and private cisterns, and a bath building. A probe behind the walls of the better-preserved public cistern yielded a significant amount of Nabataean ceramic material. The precise chronology of the types of pottery recovered is still the subject of dispute, but the Nabataean character of the cistern has been established. It may have been built in the first century B.C. when the town was founded by King Aretas III. Excavation also showed that the two public cisterns were filled by separate intake chan- nels, demonstrating Nabataean strategy in obtaining water from run-off. Excavation around two circular cisterns re- vealed that they were located in the courtyards of large houses, carefully roofed and paved over, and surrounded by a curb wall. The ceramics recovered demonstrate that even on the outskirts of the habitation area this type of circular cistern can date as early as the first century A.C. Excavation also uncovered a bath building of typical Ro- man type, probably constructed in the second century A.C. and remodeled in the fifth or sixth century. In the final stage of development it included a large reception room with seven stone beds for undressing and for relaxing after the bath, an adjacent reception room with three similar beds, a cold bath chamber with a basin at which the bathers could splash themselves, a sweat room with heated floor where the visitors could sit in a hot moist atmosphere, and a hot bath room with heated floor and walls where they could wash them- selves at a basin of hot water. A vaulted furnace room built of bricks was well preserved. THE SUBSIDENCE OF CAESAREA MARITIMA'S HARBOR: Robert L. Hohlfelder, University of Colorado Herod the Great's most amazing technical and architec- tural accomplishment at Caesarea Maritima was the great Outer Basin of the harbor complex known first as Sebastos and then later as Portus Augusti. This artificial harbor, built from an unstable coastline on a sandy ocean floor, required great leaps forward in harbor technology. From its dedica- tion ca. 15 B.C., it provided the city and the region of Palestine with an unparalleled facility along the eastern Med- iterranean littoral. For the next 600 years, maritime access</page><page sequence="39">1990] THE 91ST ANNUAL MEETING 331 and trade accounted for the continuing importance of Ro- man, and then Byzantine, Caesarea, capital of Palaestina. When and how did this facility eventually fall from use? The archaeological, historical, geological, and geophysical data relating to these questions defy easy collation and have occasioned diverse and often conflicting scholarly interpre- tations. I examine all pertinent evidence and various schol- arly opinions relating to the issue of the subsidence of Caesarea's harbor and reaffirm my own views on this subject by addressing recent criticism. The thesis of this paper is that the great Outer Basin functioned into the fifth century as the major installation of the port of Caesarea without serious interruption, although the character of the facility changed as the city's geopolitical fortunes ebbed and flowed and natural forces took their toll. Following cumulative neglect and natural deterioration, per- haps associated with earthquake activity, the harbor was refurbished early in the sixth century and continued to serve Byzantine Caesarea's needs until the coming of the Arabs in the mid-seventh century. Only then, when routine mainte- nance was no longer carried out, was the facility permitted to slip beneath the sea. Even then, it was not so much that nature had overwhelmed man, but rather that new economic and political realities in the Arab world ordained the instal- lation's demise. By Crusader times, the Outer Basin was only a giant submerged ruin, marked by outcroppings of rubble from its once daring and splendid past. REGIONALISM IN ROMAN AND BYZANTINE PALESTINE: E. Marianne Stern, Toledo Museum of Art Recent analysis of glass from controlled excavations in Israel and adjacent areas (The Toledo Museum of Art. Cata- logue of Roman and Byzantine Glass, in preparation) indicates that after a period of relative uniformity in glass wares in the first centuries A.C. there was a growing regionalism in the third and early fourth centuries. There is a marked difference of shapes, function, and styles of glass vessels made along the Palestinian coast and in areas further inland. Coastal products are predominantly table wares such as plain, natural green-tinted dishes, bowls, and bottles. The commonest glass further inland consists of small spherical or tubular containers, often decorated with colored thread. This difference can probably be explained by the preferences of the largely gentile population of the Hellenized cities along the coast, whose taste was oriented toward the Classical lands bordering the Mediterranean. This situation did not immediately change with the acces- sion of Constantine, but it began to change under his suc- cessors. During the fifth century the differences between coastal and inland products gradually diminished. By the sixth century simple forms of bottles and lamps were made and used throughout the Mediterranean. The only unusual types made in Palestine were fancy items for personal use such as kohl tubes, which are found mainly in Galilee and the Jordan Valley. Although it is tempting to connect this phenomenon with the shifting importance of Christian, Jew- ish, and pagan population groups in the Holy Land, it is not possible at this moment to determine whether one specific group favored specialized glass. EXCAVATION AND SURVEY AT COPTOS AND EASTERN DESERT: Sharon C. Herbert and Henry Wright, Uni- versity of Michigan A joint University of Michigan/University of Assiut team conducted two short seasons of excavation and survey at Coptos and environs in December and January of 1987 and 1988/1989. The long-term goal of the project is to explore the origin and development of the Coptos-Berenice route to the Red Sea, one of the key links in the system of transport routes that connected ancient Rome with the kingdoms around the Indian Ocean. The survey explored ancient caravan routes east and south of Coptos. Several hydreumata along the routes were mapped and sampled. Soundings were put down in two areas at Coptos. In the first, mudbrick structures of early Roman date were revealed at the modern surface. These were built over a deep deposit of late Hellenistic debris containing much pottery of local manufacture. The Hellen- istic strata lay above the robbed remains of a massive mud- brick wall over 14 m in width. The east face of this wall was exposed and a refuse layer in which the latest datable ma- terials were Middle Kingdom ceramics was found against the face of the wall. The presence of Hellenistic habitation in the area is evidenced by a well-preserved kitchen with a range of Hellenistic ceramics some 4 m to the east of the wall. The second field of excavation contained well-pre- served remains of a large vaulted Roman building, possibly a bath. Stratified layers overlying the latest of the buildings were sampled. These yielded late Roman ceramics including several pieces of Egyptian Red Slip "A" Ware and fourth century coins. Deeper stratigraphical soundings yielded ear- lier Roman and Hellenistic materials. UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE SURVEY OF THE 'ABU SHA'AR-NILE ROAD: Steven E. Sidebotham, Univer- sity of Delaware In January-early February 1989 the University of Dela- ware conducted an archaeological survey of the ancient thor- oughfare between the fifth-seventh century fort at 'Abu Sha'ar on the Red Sea coast and the Nile emporium of Qena. The goals were to determine-as precisely as possible with- out excavation-dates of activity at the various installations along the road and to ascertain the relationships between the forts at 'Abu Sha'ar and Bir 'Abu Sha'ar el-Qibli (sur- veyed and partially excavated by the University of Delaware in 1987), the quarries at Mons Porphyrites (Gebel Dukhan) and the installations between 'Abu Sha'ar, Gebel Dukhan, and Qena. This was done by measuring and planning the hydreumata (fortified water stations) and other sites on or near the route and by collecting, analyzing, and dating di- agnostic surface artifacts (mainly pottery) from these places. The survey also plotted the locations of numerous Roman towers and cairns which marked the route between 'Abu Sha'ar and Qena to establish more accurately the course of the ancient road. The Delaware survey discovered that the quarries at Mons Porphyrites and many of the stations joining the quarries to</page><page sequence="40">332 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 the Nile no longer functioned after the fourth century. Those still operating in the fifth-seventh centuries were some distance from 'Abu Sha'ar and, in several cases, were closer to the Nile than to the Red Sea coast. The project speculates that those forts on the road func- tioning in the fifth-seventh centuries may have been part of a limes defending the Nile at that time. These installations must also have supported traffic and communications be- tween 'Abu Sha'ar and the Nile at Qena and, together with the installations at 'Abu Sha'ar, may have facilitated travel by Christian pilgrims coming from Upper Egypt to visit reli- gious sites in Sinai and the Holy Land. THE PALACE OF THE Dux RIPAE AT DURA-EUROPOS: NEW INVESTIGATIONS: Susan B. Downey, University of California, Los Angeles The palace of the Dux Ripae at Dura-Europos provides an important example of an official residence of a Roman military commander of the third century A.C. The building, excavated in 1935-1936 and published in 1953, has been interpreted as a "porticus villa with corner projections," a type that is common in the western provinces of the Roman Empire. The river wing, organized around a group of rooms centered on an apsidal room and facing onto a portico and terrace, has been interpreted as including also a triapsidal room of a type frequent in late Roman palatial architecture. New investigations in 1988 have shown that the suggested reconstruction cannot be correct. Thus, the wall stub used to restore two of the three apses has now been shown to constitute part of a straight wall continuing the line of the existing portico, which therefore had a single apse facing the Euphrates. Furthermore, the entire group of rooms projecting from the main block to the East is a secondary construction, and the wall spurs used to create the corner projections of the terrace cannot have belonged to the palace. A full reconstruction of the river wing is impossible, since much has fallen into the Euphrates, but the new investiga- tions make it possible to determine with greater accuracy the building's place in the history of late Roman architecture. ROMAN AMPHORAS AT SPLIT: Elizabeth Lyding Will, Amherst College In the summer of 1988, a study was made of Roman amphora fragments that have been found in the joint Min- nesota/Dalmatia excavations (partially funded by the Smith- sonian Institution) in the Palace of Diocletian at Split. While a small group of fragments dates from at least as early as the Augustan age, most of the pieces are late Roman. About half of those belong to the African categories now frequently called "cylindrical" and "spatheia." Datable for the most part to the fourth and fifth centuries A.C., these two types are difficult to distinguish, but study of the collection at Split has helped to clarify their differences and similarities. The large proportion of African fragments at Split also adds to the growing body of evidence pointing to a continuation of the exportation from North Africa of olive products into the fifth century. In addition, the amphoras add to our knowl- edge about the history of the palace at Split after the death of Diocletian and point to activity at the site before the building of the palace. SESSION V D: COLLOQUIUM: THE ROLE OF COSTUME IN ROMAN ART COSTUME AND RITUAL INITIATION: THE HEADDRESS AND HAIRSTYLE OF THE ROMAN BRIDE: Laetitia La Follette, University of Massachusetts, Amherst Special dress plays an important role in the individual's rite of passage and change of status within the community. In Roman society, the most important such transition for the male was the passage from boy to man, which was marked by the assumption of the toga virilis. The female's passage from girl to woman took place at her wedding, and was similarly marked by special garments. Most of the bride's special costume, however, focuses on her hair and headdress. This paper examines the artistic and literary evidence for the appearance of the bridal veil (flammeum) and the bride's complex hairstyle (seni crines), and explores the ritual sig- nificance of this bridal garb, which was worn as well by certain important Roman priestesses, the flaminica Dialis (flammeum) and the Vestal Virgins (seni crines). Monuments for discussion include the first century B.C. painted frieze in the Villa of the Mysteries at Pompeii, the imperial portrait statues of the Vestal Virgins, and third century consular sarcophagi depicting bridal scenes with dextrarum iunctio. HIGH FASHION AND CLASSICAL REFERENCE: COIFFURES OF IMPERIAL WOMEN FROM AUGUSTUS TO HADRIAN: Susan Wood, Oakland University This paper surveys the vicissitudes of fashion in the hair- dress of Roman imperial women, with attention to the evi- dence they offer about the public images those women cultivated, and to the ways artists exploited and adapted their coiffures for artistic and iconographic purposes. An imperial woman's choice of hairstyle, like every aspect of her image, must have been dictated by concerns more serious than personal taste; every emperor was aware of the impor- tance of public perceptions of his family. There were peri- ods, therefore, when sober and restrained coiffures complemented the images of respectable and modest ma- trons, as during the reigns of Augustus, who sought to avoid the appearance of regal ambitions, and of Trajan, who con- trasted his family with the scandal-ridden household of Domitian. There were other periods, notably that of Domi- tian, when imperial women sported more capricious coif- fures, reflecting a taste for pomp and ostentation in the public image of the imperial family. Visual references to Classical and Hellenistic images of goddesses make periodic appearances, while at other times they seem to be deliber- ately avoided. Such references could inspire a woman's choice of coiffure; they could also be introduced into post-</page><page sequence="41">1990] THE 91ST ANNUAL MEETING 333 humous portraits by simplification or alteration of a coiffure of the subject's lifetime, or by concealment of the more contemporary-looking elements with a diadem or veil. COSTUME AS GEOGRAPHIC INDICATOR: BARBARIANS AND PRISONERS ON CUIRASSED STATUE BREAST- PLATES: Richard A. Gergel, Central Michigan Uni- versity The Roman imperial cuirassed statue depicts its subject dressed in the full parade costume of a triumphant general. Through the iconography of its breastplate composition and lappet motifs, the cuirassed statue not only provides a rich visual medium for celebrating the military victories of the Roman emperor, but also documents the course of Roman territorial expansion throughout Europe and the eastern Mediterranean basin. While the greater majority of cuirassed statue breastplates are decorated with standardized subjects, approximately 150 examples bear complex allegorical com- positions that can be associated with specific military victo- ries. With its field of decoration inherently restricted by the natural surface configurations of the breastplate and lappets, cuirassed statue iconography resorts to a combination of allegorical symbols and personifications similar to that found on Roman numismatic reverse types. Using five to eight principal examples, ranging in date from the age of Augustus through the reign of Trajan, the visual language of the cuirassed statue breastplate is exam- ined. Emphasis is placed on the use of costume to identify the national origins of the allegorical figures representing client states, captives, and conquered peoples depicted in breastplate compositions. Ancient Roman literary descrip- tions of foreign dress, as well as comparanda drawn from relevant numismatic reverse types, is used to identify the barbarians, prisoners, and geographic personifications de- picted on cuirassed statue breastplates. The visual evidence demonstrates a Roman reliance on standardized types, char- acterized by readily recognizable features, rather than on archaeological exactitude, in the representation of van- quished nations and foreign peoples. WOMEN'S AND CHILDREN'S COSTUME IN THE MOSAICS FROM PIAZZA ARMERINA: Lucille A. Roussin, Sarah Lawrence College The Roman villa of Casale at Piazza Armerina is decorated with one of the richest finds of mosaic pavements known to date. The mosaics present a veritable encyclopedia of con- temporary costumes, illustrating some of the changes in dress that came about in the closing years of the third century and the first decades of the fourth century. This paper focuses on several of the mosaics for the evidence they afford for the costume of women and children in the fourth cen- tury. While the evidence for men's contemporary dress abounds in the villa's mosaic decoration, the mosaic of Dom- ina and her children in the vestibule to the baths is one of the few scenes in which we see "real" women wearing gar- ments of everyday wear. The question of children's dress is more complicated. Nine pavements are decorated with scenes of children engaged in various activities-playing, hunting, weaving garlands, and as actors and musicians. A comparison of the children and their costumes with the erotes engaged in various activities on several of the other pave- ments of the villa indicates that the same models were used for both. These pavements will be examined with a view to distinguishing between historically attested garments of everyday wear, and theatrical or ceremonial garb. THE LATE ROMAN TOGA: OLD AND NEW STYLES OF CEREMONIAL DRESS: Shelley C. Stone III, California State University, Bakersfield Despite evidence that the toga was declining as preferred daily garb by the age of Augustus, its authority as the cos- tume of the Roman man of affairs insured its survival as ceremonial dress long after that date. During the second century two different styles of draping the toga coexisted. These included the traditional mode of the first century, with its graceful sinus across the torso and drooping umbo. A new style was devised during the second century in which the umbo was replaced by a triangular swatch pulled out from the lowest layer of cloth over the left shoulder. These styles are illustrated together on Trajan's Arch at Beneven- tum and on the panel reliefs of Marcus Aurelius, and con- tinued throughout the third century, as seen on consular sarcophagi. A new style of draping developed during the later second century, however, featuring a band of stacked folds running around the body. The discomforts involved in creating and maintaining this band were decried by Ter- tullian in the early third century (de Pallio V), but the new fashion was popular throughout the third century and is the toga of choice on the frieze of the Arch of Constantine. During the fourth century, the toga is depicted both in the traditional mode of the first century and in increasingly complex versions of the banded toga, yet by the late fifth was replaced as ceremonial wear by Byzantine court dress. This paper examines the modes of and chronology of draping the toga from the second century into the early fifth century. Reconstructions of its various styles are presented, together with evidence for changes in the traditionally el- liptical shape of the toga in its latest forms. SESSION V E: COLLOQUIUM: ROMAN POT- TERY IN THE CONTEXT OF EXCAVATION POTS AND PEOPLE: THE TEL ANAFA COMMON WARES: Andrea M. Berlin, University of Virginia Common ware pottery, the household equipment of a site's inhabitants, is the most abundant type of artifact re- covered in excavation. More than other artifacts, common wares reflect the particular needs of day-to-day life. Most important are cooking vessels, in which variations indicate different modes of food preparation. In the past, as today, individual ethnic groups had culinary idiosyncracies, and</page><page sequence="42">334 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 the variety of cooking vessels found at a site can characterize the people who lived there. Tel Anafa is a small site in Israel's Hula Valley. In three short periods of Hellenistic and Roman occupation three different types of cooking vessels were used. Early third century B.C. kitchens were equipped exclusively with closed, globular cook pots; in the late second/early first century B.C. one third of the cooking vessels were open, round-bodied casseroles; the early first century A.C. assemblage included a number of broad, shallow, flat-bottomed pans. These var- iations probably reflect specific ethnic populations. The cook pot is a traditional Levantine form, and suggests indigenous inhabitants. Casseroles are common only at sites with Greek populations; their abundance at Anafa in the late Hellenistic period implies inhabitants who are at least culturally Greek. Pans are found in quantity only in Italy and the west; known variously as patellae, patinae, fretelae, or sartagines, they are recommended for a variety of dishes in the first century A.C. portions of the culinary manual of Apicius. The ap- pearance of this shape within Anafa's first century A.C. common ware assemblage reflects a new, Roman, popula- tion. ROMAN TO LATE ROMAN POTTERY AND TRANSPORT AMPHORA IMPORTS AT ASHKELON: Barbara L. John- son, Harvard University Semitic Museum Ashkelon, located on the southern coast of modern Israel, was a prominent port city during the Roman to Late Roman periods. Five years of excavation by the Leon Levy Expedi- tion, Harvard Semitic Museum, have produced enormous quantities of pottery. Among these may be noted a wide range of imported fine wares, utilitarian wares, cooking wares, shapes for special uses, and transport amphoras. An important aspect of the material is its use for dating the various levels from which it comes; however, its broader importance lies in providing informaton about and answers to such questions as: What types were imported? Where were they produced? In what quantities did they come to Ashkelon and why? Was their final destination Ashkelon or was the city a trans-shipment point? What internationally and regionally distributed vessels and commodities do or do not appear and why? Is the ceramic repertoire comparable to or different from material found at similar sites in the Levant? What can the imported pottery and transport am- phoras tell us about the social, economic, and ethnic situation of the city? These are some of the questions being addressed in the study of the Roman to Late Roman imported pottery from Ashkelon. A FOURTH-CENTURY ABANDONMENT LEVEL IN THE RO- MAN PERISTYLE BUILDING IN MYTILENE: Caroline Williams, McMaster University In three seasons of excavation in the Roman peristyle building situated at the north harbor in Mytilene a consistent layer of pottery was found over the floor level in all the rooms and in the central courtyard. Two whole amphoras on the floor, many other whole or nearly complete vessels, and the layer of broken tile overlying this stratum suggested the hypothesis that the material represents the ceramic as- semblage in the building at the time of its abandonment. The internal chronological evidence supplied by the diag- nostic material has contributed to an understanding of the architectural history of this particular structure and has provided a chronological framework in which to place the less well dated commonwares. The types of pottery vessels and their relative proportions have been useful for analyzing possible uses to which this building was put since all other evidence, such as inscriptions, is lacking. ANOTHER LATE ROMAN WELL AT SARDIS: Marcus L. Rautman, University of Missouri, Columbia Continuing excavations at Sardis by the Harvard-Cornell expedition have identified a second well in the Later Roman residential quarter at Sector MMS (see AJA 92 [1988] 264- 65). Both features comprise narrow shafts over 22 m deep in which the earliest deposits suggest use during at least the fifth century A.C. Study of their stratified contents can dis- tinguish three primary phases of dumped fill from the late fifth through the early to mid-seventh centuries that docu- ment changing patterns of local ceramic use. African Red Slip and Late Roman C wares provide a consistent chronological framework for the deposits. Both wares appear in abundance in sixth-century levels together with local imitations. The ARS series concludes with form 109 in the seventh-century deposit, a late date reinforced by the fragmentary presence of two lead glaze cooking pots. Surprisingly, LRC does not continue in its late sixth/early seventh-century forms, nor are Cypriot or Egyptian red slip wares represented. A group of vessels in light-colored mi- caceous fabric, often with complex stamped or rouletted decoration, reflects the activities of western Asia Minor work- shops in the fifth and sixth centuries. Imported amphorae come primarily from the east Mediterranean coast but are far outnumbered by local products, especially two types of single-handle jar that continue into- sixth-century levels. Comparison of imported vessels in different strata suggests the gradual waning of Sardis's contacts with wider Mediter- ranean markets in Late Antiquity. CORINTH: DEPOSITS OF CA. A.D. 200 AND A.D. 300 FROM EAST OF THE THEATER: Kathleen Warner Slane, University of Missouri, Columbia Excavations at Corinth during 1980-1988 revealed a se- ries of four buildings terraced down the slope to the east of the theater. The history of this area differs significantly from that of the buildings around the Forum investigated in pre- vious years. Although the two northern buildings seem to have been destroyed in the early second century, at least two of the buildings underwent major remodeling in the last years of the second century and in some rooms the floors were raised as much as 0.60 m. At the end of the third century these buildings were destroyed: their floors were covered with fallen wall plaster and rooftiles in layers 0.3- 1.0 m thick.</page><page sequence="43">1990] THE 91ST ANNUAL MEETING 335 Massive amounts of Roman pottery, totaling between eight and nine tons, were found associated with these build- ings and with the related phases of the theater cavea. This pottery may be dated by the coin evidence, by fine wares and lamps, and by stratigraphic association. It is the subject of a quantified and typological study that began in 1985. In this paper, I present an overview of the fine wares, lamps, cooking-pots, and amphoras from the remodeling of Build- ings 5 and 7 about A.D. 200 and of those in the destruction layers of ca. A.D. 300. It seems most useful to concentrate on the types present and on their sources (if we know them), but the methods of quantification are briefly described and some preliminary results presented. Although the cooking pots of these periods are primarily of local manufacture, the fine wares and amphoras include imports from both east and west, and the local lamps were exported throughout the central Mediterranean. Comparative analysis of the two pe- riods shows that the sources of imported amphoras as well as tablewares changed, that most parts of the two assem- blages are consistently different, and that it is therefore possible to date a deposit even when part of the assemblage (such as fine wares) is deficient or missing. LATE ROMAN POTTERY DEPOSITS AT POSEIDON'S ISTH- MIAN SANCTUARY: Jeanne Marty, Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities Successive seasons of excavations at the Sanctuary of Po- seidon on the Isthmus of Corinth under the auspices of the University of California, Los Angeles, revealed extensive remains of the Roman period use of that site. Between 1970 and 1972 investigations in the area immediately east of the Poseidon precinct at Isthmia (called the "East Field") uncov- ered a jumble of low rubble walls, which appears to be a complex of late Roman houses. Although the architectural remains are less than impressive, the quantity of pottery, found together with coins, lamps, and other small finds, provides important evidence for a view of everyday life in the third and fourth centuries on the Isthmus. Of particular importance are a group of five deposits found at scattered locations throughout the East Field and a related sixth deposit discovered a short distance away near the south wall of the Hexamilion Fortress. Although there was intrusive material in these "open" caches, for the most part the pottery and related finds are sufficiently consistent in overall style and character to give a single date for all the groups and a probable common cause for the abandonment of the buildings in which the pottery deposits were found. The Roman pottery of the East Field and south Fortress area consists predominantly of coarse wares, not earlier than the middle of the third century, based on comparative ma- terial from Corinth and Athens and the fine wares repre- sented in the assemblages. The evidence of the lamps and coins is sometimes puzzling. This paper looks at the signifi- cance of pottery and other finds in the chronology of Roman coarse wares in the Corinthia and considers the implications of these deposits for the history of the sanctuary in the Late Roman period. THE PROBLEM OF ROMAN GRAY WARES: Virginia Anderson-Stojanovid, Wilson College Among the wares recovered from excavations at the site of Stobi in ancient Macedonia and at other sites of the Roman period are those grouped together by their gray fabric and black or gray surface. Most of them were table- wares and many were not items of trade. Production centers for Roman gray wares may be traced along two broad bands extending across the Mediterranean, the first stretching from western Asia Minor to Sicily, France, Spain, and Por- tugal, and the other running across Europe from Macedonia to northern Italy and the Alpine region of Central Europe, up to Belgium and over to Britain. Most of these areas show a preference for gray wares in the Iron Age or Archaic periods. In the Greek world, this class of pottery is related to Greek black glaze and to the Gray Minyan tradition of the Bronze Age. At Stobi the earliest gray wares occur in the fourth century B.C., in both local Iron Age forms and adaptations of Greek black glaze forms. A variety of local and imported gray wares was also popular at Stobi from the first century B.C. through the second century A.C.; they include products of Asia Minor, Campanian C, terra nigra, and terra sigillata adap- tations, some of which may have been fired to a gray color by accident. Then from the late second century to the late fourth, gray wares disappear altogether from the archaeo- logical record at Stobi. By the late fourth century, however, the tradition was revived and a broad range of tableware forms was produced, many with stamped decoration, throughout the fifth century. This paper considers why gray wares occur in some pe- riods and not others at Stobi and why a similar phenomenon may be observed only in certain other regions of the Roman world. To answer any questions about the origin and appeal of gray wares we must describe what has been called the ceramic environment. This includes the cultural and social issues of tradition, aesthetic preference, and practical needs and demands for gray wares. It is also important to describe the natural resources of a given area such as clay and fuel as well as the technology available for the development of reduction firing. Finally we must determine the advantages of wares fired in a reducing atmosphere in a period when red gloss wares were the dominant tablewares. SESSION VI A: GREEK AND ROMAN NUMIS- MATICS THE CLASSICAL SILVER COINAGE OF HIMERA: Carmen Arnold-Biucchi, American Numismatic Society The silver coinage of Himera after the fall of the tyranny has not been reexamined since the work of F. Gutmann and W. Schwabacher ("Die Tetradrachmen- und Didrachmen- prigung von Himera," MittBayNumGes [1929] 101-44, pls. 8-10), and only the larger denominations were considered in that study. More coins are known today and a reconsid- eration of the "Classical period" of the mint seems desirable. A new classification of the tetradrachms has been presented</page><page sequence="44">336 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 by the present author in NumAntCl 17 (1988) 85-100. The didrachms, rare drachms, and smaller denominations are now studied together (the fractional coinage will be the subject of a second article in NumAntCl 19 [1990]). Only a comprehensive study of all issues and denominations can elucidate the activity of the mint in that period and can present its economic and historical development. Were the silver fractions a local limited coinage that helped the eco- nomic life of the city in the transition years between the fall of Theron in 472 B.C. and the restoration of democracy in all Sicily? Or were they part of the new regular coinage of a city that lost its leading role in Sicilian trade after the battle of Himera in 480 B.C., having sided mistakenly with the invaders? Very little is known from the literary sources about the history of Himera between 472 and 409 B.C. when the Carthaginians invaded and destroyed the city. Therefore, the coins of the city are a very important document. THE POSTHUMOUS LYSIMACHI MINTED BY BYZANTIUM AND CALCHEDON: Constantin A. Marinescu, Colum- bia University Commencing around the middle of the third century B.C. the cities of Byzantium and Calchedon struck coins on the Attic standard bearing the name and types of Lysimachos. This extensive coinage has been identified and described by Henri Seyrig (in C.M. Kraay ed., Essays in Greek Coinage Presented to Stanley Robinson [Oxford 1968] 183-200). Sey- rig observed that the two mints followed a uniform minting policy, a pattern discerned not only in the Lysimachi series but also in the local coinage of these mints, which was struck on a lighter weight standard often termed "Phoenician." The present study attempts to verify Seyrig's conclusions through a formal die study of the Attic tetradrachms and staters minted at Byzantium and Calchedon. It confines itself to the Lysimachi coined between the years ca. 260 B.C. (the inception of Lysimachi production as suggested by hoard evidence) and ca. 190 B.C. when Byzantium introduced a trident on the exergue of its tetradrachms, establishing a type that survived unchanged into the first century B.C. The ensuing die sequences are largely complete for the tetra- drachms, but less so for the scarcer staters. From these it becomes apparent that the issue marks often believed to be monograms of yearly magistrates must be reconsidered, for it is unlikely that a single obverse die would be used over a period as long as eight years. Furthermore, some of these marks appear on both the local coinage and the Lysimachi, implying that the two series were struck contemporaneously. The gold and silver of each city seems to have been produced jointly, with the gold minted earlier than Seyrig anticipated. The die study demonstrates the major role that the Lysi- machi played in a complex monetary policy employing two different weight standards where they served as the pre- ferred coin for international trade. THE STANDING ZEUS ON ATHENIAN COINS AND THE CULT OF ZEUS ELEUTHERIOS IN THE ATHENIAN AGORA: John H. Kroll, University of Texas, Austin Certain bronze coins of Hellenistic and Roman Athens (J. Svoronos, Les monnaies d'Athdnes [Munich 1923] pls. 80.22- 24, 81.1-16, 92.5-7) depict an obviously important statue of a standing Zeus that scholars have customarily identified with the statue by Leochares seen by Pausanias in the Sanc- tuary of Zeus Polieus on the Acropolis. This identification can no longer stand. Holding a thunderbolt down at his right side, with his left arm extended straight out in a gesture of command, the Zeus on the coins is posed similarly to the Apollo of the west pediment of the Zeus temple at Olympia and is surely a work of the Early Classical period. The choice of this statue for a coin type attests to its political significance; and since the type was first employed on coins right after the Second Macedonian War, around the time of Flamini- nus's proclamation of freedom in 196, the standing Zeus should be recognized in all probability as the statue of Zeus Soter/Eleutherios that stood before the Stoa of Zeus in the Agora. After about a decade this coin type was replaced with a type picturing a conventional Zeus, striding and hurling a thunderbolt-apparently to make it easier to recognize the god without implying any change in political symbolism. The standing Zeus type reappears in two later issues of Athenian coins, the first struck right after Actium, when Octavian must have been honored as a Liberator of Athens, the other minted under Hadrian, another celebrated Lib- erator and Savior of the city. On the Hadrianic coins the standing Zeus is shown in modified form, with his left arm slightly lowered in the sacramental gesture of sprinkling over an altar. The modification of the statue into one of a sacri- ficing Zeus may be plausibly connected with the general remodeling of the sanctuary of Zeus Eleutherios in Julio- Claudian times, when the sanctuary altar was greatly en- larged and an annex was added to the rear of the stoa to accommodate an imperial cult. THE DUOVIRAL COINAGE OF CORINTH: John D. Mac Isaac, American School of Classical Studies at Athens This past year M. Amandry presented an elaborate ac- count of the coinage produced at Corinth during the century after its foundation as a Roman colony in 44 B.C. (BCH Suppl. 15). This paper calls into question the assertion that this coinage was essentially Roman in character and based on an ephemeral coining standard said to have been used by Mark Antony. I give evidence that the coinage of Roman Corinth was in fact derived from the existing bronze coinage system current in the north Peloponnese since the latter part of the fifth century B.C. Supporting material is drawn from the coin find record at Corinth and discussion of the internal evidence of the duoviral series.</page><page sequence="45">1990] THE 91ST ANNUAL MEETING 337 THE ROMANIZATION OF BRUTTIUM AND THE EVIDENCE OF COIN FINDS: Paolo Visond, University of Notre Dame The pattern of monetary circulation in Bruttium after the end of the Second Punic War underwent fundamental changes. Even though Roman coinage became predominant, it was supplemented for over a century by the bronze issues of three local mints (Rhegium, Copia, and Valentia), whose output was considerable. The coin finds from recent exca- vations at contrada Mella (Oppido Mamertina), an Italic site that appears to have been continuously inhabited between the mid-third and the late first century B.C., further suggest that Locrian, Brettian, and Mamertine bronze issues re- mained in use for local exchanges possibly until the begin- ning of the Empire. A similar picture emerges from a systematic survey of the archaeological record of present- day Calabria. While most hoards of Roman Republican coins interred in Bruttium after 200 B.C. consist of denarii, and are concentrated in areas that received large numbers of Roman settlers, such as the territories of Copia and Valentia, the density of finds of both silver and bronze Roman Re- publican issues throughout the region attests to the impor- tance of a highly monetized economy in the first two centuries of Romanization. SOME USES OF THE RADIATE CROWN IN THE FIRST CENTURY A.C.: Brooks Emmons Levy, Princeton Uni- versity Library Nero has been thought the first living emperor to appear on coinage with the attribute of a radiate crown. Its use on Roman issues after ca. 63 has been seen as a symbol of self- apotheosis or self-association with divus Augustus, who was regularly shown radiate. In SchwMbll 38 (1988) 101-107, I noted that Caligula too appears with a radiate crown-in some provincial coinages, and perhaps even on dupondii from the mint of Rome. All the Caligulan examples can be seen as accession issues, and that is probably the meaning of the crown in this context; it represents the glow which, in ancient literature, was often said to surround the head of a person destined to rule. In fact, Nero too appears radiate on an accession issue, but only at Alexandria. The reason for his belated assumption of the attribute on Western coin- age remains unclear. This iconography of "solar epiphany" has been examined by Kantorowicz, DOP 17 (1963) 119-33, but his account in effect begins with Hadrian. I argue here that it was selectively used by both Julio-Claudians and Flavians, and that its ori- gins are Hellenistic. If this is acknowledged to be one mean- ing of the radiate crown in the first century A.C., a number of enigmatic coin types can be explained: provincial issues showing Vespasian radiate at the very beginning of his reign ("Judea?," RIC 59/374; Crete, Svoronos 340/37); a Roman issue with Sol on its obverse, Vespasian on the reverse (RIC 18/28); and others. SESSION VI B: COLLOQUIUM: THE EASTERN ISLE: CURRENT RESEARCH ON HELLENIC CYPRUS THE INTERPRETATION OF SHIPWRECKED CYPRIOT ARTIFACTS: George F. Bass, Texas A &amp; M University The mechanics of Late Bronze Age trade between the Aegean and the Near East are not well understood, in spite of discoveries of Minoan and Mycenaean pottery in the Levant, and similar, though rarer, discoveries of ivory, Ca- naanite amphoras, and Near Eastern seals at sites in Greece and Crete. The Bronze Age shipwrecks at Cape Gelidonya and Ulu Cape in Turkey raise as many questions as they answer, but both point to the pivotal role of Cyprus in the trade. The Cape Gelidonya ship of ca. 1200 B.C. could have been Greek, Syrian, or Cypriot, but its preserved cargo was mostly Cypriot. The nationality of the 14th- or early 13th- century Ulu Burun ship similarly eludes us, but its west- bound cargo presents a mix of mostly Levantine and Cypriot materials (sometimes hard to distinguish). Did the ship stop in both areas, or did it take on the Cypriot materials in the Levant, where they are found in abundance on land? Or did it pick up its Levantine cargo in Cyprus, where Near Eastern finds are also common, and never actually visit the Syro- Palestinian shore? One hypothesized destination of the Ulu Burun ship was Egypt, where tomb paintings suggest that Cypriot merchant seamen were not major carriers of their own goods, although there is contrary evidence from Amarna tablets. Current neutron activation analyses of the Ulu Burun pottery may provide some clarification of the role of Cyprus in Late Bronze Age trade, as could finds at Ulu Burun in 1989. A determination of the date of the Ulu Burun wreck is also important because by current dating standards the Mycenaean pottery on board is much earlier than Cypriot export pottery in its cargo. CYPRUS AND DARK AGE GREECE: Ex ORIENTE Lux: Nicolas Coldstream, University College, London Recent finds from Cyprus, Euboea, and Crete have helped to transform the traditional idea of an "Orientalizing move- ment" in Greek art and life; the familiar seventh-century phenomena form but the end of a long process going back to the beginning of the Iron Age. What skills and civilized amenities did Cyprus, in particular, contribute toward Dark Age Greece? Periods before and after the founding of Phoenician Kition, near the CG II-III division, deserve sep- arate consideration. CG I-II. Gjerstad's characterization of CG I as a creative and dynamic age is amply confirmed by the rich contents of the Kouklia-Skales tombs. This period began with the trans- mission of iron technology from Cyprus to Greece. There- after, contacts with Greece were rare until well into CG II, when Cyprus contributed toward the revival of a Greek bronze industry, and perhaps also toward some early Eu- boean and Cretan experiments in figured art.</page><page sequence="46">338 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 CG III. The sophisticated gold jewelry of Euboea, Attica, and Crete, exploiting the long-forgotten skills of granula- tion, filigree, and inlay, implies some Phoenician instruction, possibly Cypro-Phoenician. A more surely Cypro-Phoenician enterprise is the export of unguents in Black-on-Red ware, shortly followed by the creation of local unguent factories in the Dodecanese and Crete through eastern initiative. In evaluating the Cypriot contribution, let us not forget three major skills and arts that did not come to Greece from Cyprus: alphabetic literacy, monumental stone architecture, and life-size sculpture. THE PERSIAN SIEGE RAMP AT PAPHOS AND ITS HISTOR- ICAL RELEVANCE: Franz Georg Maier, Universitit Ziurich Among the ancient kingdoms of Cyprus, Paphos alone can trace its history on the same site back into the Chalcolithic period. Until the early Hellenistic period the city with its widely renowned Sanctuary of Aphrodite was the only urban settlement in southwestern Cyprus. Within this framework of a long and variegated history, the North East Gate of Paphos marks a site of outstanding interest, both from the archaeological and the historical point of view. It represents the rare example of a find context dated to the year and at the same time one of the very few ancient sieges that can be reconstructed from the earth. Excavation here revealed in detail the Persian operations of 498 B.C., which Herodotus only refers to in one brief sentence. Yet the results of fieldwork on this site were not confined to the rediscovery of a specific event. The attacking army constructed its siege ramp partly from the debris of a Late Archaic temenos outside the walls. More than 1000 fragments of statues and other votive monuments, some of notable quality, were recovered from the ramp. The sack of Paphos in 498 B.C. constitutes a terminus ante quem for this find group, thus giving it a crucial position in the history of Archaic Cypriot art. The main inspiration of the destroyed sanctuary was Phoenician; the style of the sculptures also exhibits Egyptian influence. This unique find complex thus poses again the problem of the interaction of Greek and Oriental traditions in the Cypriot culture of the Archaic period. LIFE IN CYPRUS DURING THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD: Demetrios Michaelides, Department of Antiquities, Cyprus The strategic importance of Cyprus, situated between three continents, has always been appreciated by the larger powers of this world. For the Ptolemies, rulers of Cyprus for practically the whole of the Hellenistic period, possession of the island not only provided them with a military outpost beyond the shores of Egypt, but also with a conveniently close source of supply of corn, copper, and, above all, ship- building timber. During the Hellenistic period Cyprus prospered, most of all Nea Paphos which, from the mid-second century B.C., became the capital of the island. Until recently though, this period of Cypriot history has been rather neglected. Not much information could be gained from the ancient literary sources, and the excavated Hellenistic remains were rather few. Moreover, a general belief that Cypriot culture of this period, although Greek-influenced, was mostly second-rate and provincial, did not encourage much research in the subject. This picture is changing rapidly, however, as the result of either programmed excavations or other operations, such as the lifting of Roman mosaics for conservation purposes, allowing the excavation of the Hellenistic strata underneath. Another factor that has contributed greatly to our knowl- edge of Hellenistic Cyprus has been the investigation and clearance of very large sections of the ancient burial grounds, made necessary by the rapidly expanding tourist industry. Here, tombs of both the rich and the poor have been exca- vated, and these, looked at as a whole, throw considerable new light on some aspects of life in Hellenistic Cyprus. CYPRUS AND CYPRIOTS IN THE HELLENISTIC WORLD: Peter M. Fraser, Oxford University The purpose of this paper is to consider the role of Cyprus and Cypriots in the context of Greek and Hellenistic history. This is examined with particular reference to Egypt before and during the Ptolemaic period, and to the presence and absence of Cypriots in other contexts, at different times and in different places. An analysis of the individual and collective roles of Cypriots and of Cyrenaeans in Egypt provides a well-documented contrast in Ptolemaic policy at home. Following on these questions others concerning the status of Cyprus itself within the Ptolemaic empire are con- sidered. The principal aim of the paper is to call attention to unanswered questions regarding the role of Cyprus in the fourth century and through the Ptolemaic period, and thus to stimulate further study and research, rather than to pro- vide new conclusions. SESSION VI C: COLLOQUIUM: ROMANS AND OTHERS: THE IMPACT OF INTERACTIONS ANTHROPOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES ON INTERCULTURAL CONTACT AND CHANGE: Peter S. Wells, University of Minnesota Recent anthropological approaches to intercultural con- tact in the human past focus not just on the identification of imported objects and borrowed motifs, but more impor- tantly on the cultural contexts in which the material evidence is recovered. Foci of attention include the significance, in their lands of origin, of the objects that were transmitted between societies, and the role they came to play in the cultural systems of the importers/borrowers. Ongoing archaeological research into relations between Romans and the native peoples with whom they came into contact is producing abundant new information about the character of interactions and about their impact on both the Romans and the other peoples. The new archaeological data enable us to apply consistent techniques of analysis and</page><page sequence="47">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 339 interpretation to instances of Roman-native contacts in dif- ferent parts of the ancient world throughout the Roman Period. An example taken from Roman interactions with native central Europeans-Celts and Germans-illustrates the im- pact of these relations on group formation and on the estab- lishment of group identity among the indigenous populations. ROME AND THE SCORDISCI: A CASE STUDY IN THE ACCULTURATION OF A CELTIC PEOPLE: MichaelR. Werner, State University of New York, Albany The effects on the Scordisci, a Celtic-Pannonian people, of Roman subjugation and territorial occupation are ana- lyzed through a study of representative sites (both habitation and burial) that show continuous occupation through the Roman contact period in the late Iron Age. The results of excavations conducted at Gomolava (Hrtkovci) and Rospi Cuprija inter alia are considered in the context of ethnic identity and cultural change influenced by long-term domi- nation by external powers. The diachronic nature of accul- turation is emphasized to analyze the effects of this ethnic unit resulting from the process generally known as Roman- ization. Topics discussed include socio-political organization, settlement patterns and funerary practices, material culture, and technology. Finally, information available from the lit- erary sources is evaluated in comparison with the conclusions drawn from the archaeological evidence, utilizing the im- portant studies published by Borislav Jovanovi' and Jovan TodoroviL. ROMAN AND NATIVE INTERACTION IN THE ROMAN ALPINE PROVINCES: Curtis N. Sandberg, Harvard University Scholars are divided between those who view Rome as successful in maintaining its empire, a process that was helped along by a fair degree of native acquiescence, and others who see in the literature a history of revolts that constantly threatened the fabric of the empire. Archaeolog- ical research on this question has relied heavily upon infor- mation gathered from ancient burials and settlements located in the Inner Alpine region (X Regio, Noricum, Rae- tia), an area geographically isolated from the powerful cul- tural influences of imperial towns and highways. Imported Roman materials become increasingly common over time in native burials, a phenomenon more likely tied to status acquistion and fashion demands than to a situation of profound culture change. Mountain burials, when viewed comparatively with those excavated in the more "Roman- ized" lowland centers, tend to be quite poor and to lack the glass and high quality ceramic luxury goods found regularly in Roman urban contexts. What is found instead is a mixture of occasional pieces of fine Roman tableware, local imitations of Roman vase forms, and some ceramic pieces of Alpine Iron Age tradition. Roman bronze fibulae are a regular import item, but their placement in burials indicates a con- tinuity of pre-Roman costume traditions. Ultimately, one sees an increase over time in the presence of Roman import goods in indigenous settlements, but these are significantly fewer than the materials of local tradition and manufacture. In the Alpine regions the lifeways of peripheral mountain populations were maintained through- out the Imperial period without either extreme conflict or total assimilation. ROME AND THE DESERT PEOPLES: Colin M. Wells, Trinity University From Syria southward and westward to the Atlantic the frontier of the Roman Empire lay along the desert or pre- desert zone. Except in Syria, where the Euphrates formed the border between the Roman and Parthian Empires, there was no major power beyond the limit of Rome's control. Her interactions were with desert peoples, and her interests in these peoples, differently proportioned on different fron- tiers, can be considered under at least four different heads. There was the trade of which these peoples were a vehicle, the use which Rome might make of them as recruits for her own armies, their potential as a seasonal labor force in the settled lands along the desert fringes, and the need to protect those settled lands against desert raiders. The paper at- tempts to show how the Roman authorities balanced off these interests on the various desert frontiers, and what impact Roman civilization had on the desert peoples, and vice versa. In so doing, it aims to put forward for discussion some of the points raised during the session on the desert frontiers, chaired by the author, at the 15th International Congress of Roman Frontier Studies in September 1989. ROMAN IMPORTS AND ROMAN INFLUENCE IN EASTERN ARABIA: D.T. Potts, University of Copenhagen In recent years excavations conducted by the author at two of the largest late pre-Islamic sites in the Arabian Gulf, Thaj and ed-Dur, have brought to light archaeological evi- dence for the penetration of Roman tastes there on two discrete levels. Roman glass, pottery, bronzes, and coins from ed-Dur attest to the circulation of Roman products in an area that was previously considered untouched by Roman manufactures. At the same time, a look at the indigenous ceramic tradition of northeastern Arabia (including Bahrain) shows that terra sigillata forms began to be copied in locally made wares by the early first century A.C. These develop- ments will be considered in light of the literary evidence for Roman trade with the East. ROMANS AND FOREIGNERS: AN ART HISTORICAL AP- PROACH?: Sheila McNally, University of Minnesota Art historical analyses of the interaction between Romans and foreigners-"barbarians" or not-have concentrated on three issues: the degree to which Roman art derives from Greek art; the way in which Roman art was received in areas of the Empire that had not previously come under Hellenic influence; and, finally, the survival of Roman forms in Eu-</page><page sequence="48">340 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 rope after the end of the Empire in the West. All of these analyses tend to rest on two similar assumptions about the basic nature of Roman art: first, that however diverse its manifestations, it exemplifies general principles, often loosely called "Classical," that radically differentiate Greek and Roman artists from previous or contemporary workers in other cultures; second, that these principles are of great potency, affecting others but not receiving outside influ- ences. The one major argument for a decisive external in- fluence is Stryzgowski's thesis of Eastern influence in the Late Empire, largely dismissed today. Art historians approach these issues using evidence and methods that are not uniquely or even primarily art histor- ical. To the extent that there is a uniquely art historical dimension to their work, it involves style and iconography: the methods of stylistic and iconographic analysis, and the belief that objects carrying stylistic and iconographic mes- sages have a somewhat different history than other artifacts. "BARBARIANS" IN THE LAKE IN THE FIFTH CENTURY: David Whitehouse, Corning Museum of Glass In the fifth century the Western Roman Empire was re- placed by a number of independent kingdoms and other polities ruled by "foreigners." In the sixth century parts of the former empire were reconquered by Justinian. Most of the reconquered areas were lost shortly afterwards. This paper reviews recent archaeological evidence for the effects of these political changes on social and economic life in the Western Mediterranean between the late fourth and the late sixth centuries. In particular, it focuses on changing patterns in the redistribution of consumer products. SESSION VI D: COLLOQUIUM: NEWEST DEVEL- OPMENTS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF SAR- DINIA: TEN YEARS LATER SARDINIA AND ISLAND PALAEOLITHIC: Alan McPherron, University of Pittsburgh Discoveries on Sardinia are revolutionizing the picture of its earliest human occupation, and suggest the need to reas- sess the first occupation of other Mediterranean islands. Previous evidence indicated that Sardinia, like other Medi- terranean islands except Sicily, was first colonized by boat- using people in the Neolithic, about 6000 B.C. It now ap- pears that that date may be 400,000 years too recent. Two archaeological situations are shown. Abundant Lower Palaeolithic tools are being recovered from localities in the northern part of the island. Locally termed "Clactonian" and "Tayacian," the stone tools are like ones from sites in Italy and South France dating ca. 500,000- 250,000 B.C. Second, Corbeddu Cave in the east-central part of the island is under excavation by a Dutch team led by P. Sondaar. Level 3, C'4 dated 11,610 B.C., yielded faunal remains in which frequencies of skeletal elements and their distribution on the cave floor do not fit the picture of carnivore lairs. Some bones appear to show butchering marks. Level 4, considered to date before 23,000 B.C., provides further suggestions of cultural activities. The finds are briefly evaluated from the perspectives of bathymetry, archaeology, biogeography, geology, palaeobo- tany, and palaeontology. A conclusion is that reassessment of chronological assumptions is warranted. BRONZE, SEA, AND SARDINIA: Miriam S. Balmuth, Tufts University Ten years ago the evidence on Sardinia for eastern con- nections amounted to some Phoenician inscriptions and fig- urines, what seemed to be Cypriot influence on metal work, and the presence of copper 'oxhide' ingots with 'Cypro- Minoan' characters. Since 1980, however, the excavation of Nuraghe Antigori in the Bay of Cagliari has been providing datable Mycenaean, Minoan, and Cypriot material from the Late Bronze Age that has added a new dimension to the study of contact between the East and West Mediterranean, and progress toward the definition of that contact. Sardinia has recently been the focus of renewed and reshaped studies and excavation, which it is rewarding with increasing and surprising information. A reassessment of the extraordinary monumental architecture on the island, the nuraghi, produced a redating based both on radiocarbon readings and on new concepts of architectural development. The result has been a rise in the chronology of that civiliza- tion: while it was considered to have had its apogee in the eighth century B.C., these more recent considerations have added more than 500 years, so that there is now no conflict in dates with the Late Bronze Age Aegean pottery found at Antigori. New analyses of the "oxhide" ingots reinforce the idea of an emporion. Together with the Mycenaean, Minoan, and Cypriot material found in Sardinia where Phoenician settle- ment is a later fact, they illuminate the idea of trade and other aspects of the Ulu Burun shipwreck. ON DATING PHOENICIAN INSCRIPTIONS IN SARDINIA AND THE MEDITERRANEAN: Frank Moore Cross, Harvard University The chronology of the Phoenician scripts between ca. 1200 and 1000 has steadily tightened in the past quarter century, and dramatically so in recent years. 1) The Eli Ba'al and Abi Ba'al inscriptions on statues of Osorkon I and Shishak anchor the chronology in the second half of the tenth century (Wente chronology). 2) The sequence of the forbears of Eli Ba'al and Abi Ba'al carry us back at least three generations to 'Ahiram, ca. 1000. His inscription, prepared upon his death, must be dated at the latest to ca. 975 B.C. 3) The era between 1100 and 1000 is represented now by no fewer than 21 inscribed arrowheads and javelin heads, a fad of the 11th century. An additional half dozen texts, including Phoenician inscriptions from Crete, Sardinia, and Cyprus further document this sequence.</page><page sequence="49">1990] THE 91ST GENERAL MEETING 341 4) Another 10 inscriptions from Palestine, for the most part excavated in controlled stratigraphic contexts, date to the 12th century-following the low chronology (Rameses II 1279-1212; Rameses III 1182-1151). The detailed pa- laeographical sequences fixed by Near Eastern chronology require a reevaluation of Phoenician and related finds in the central and western Mediterranean. After all, Mediterra- nean chronologies of this era, including those of Greek wares, depend on synchronisms with Near Eastern chronol- ogy and stratigraphy. SARDINIAN REFLECTIONS ON GREEK AND PHOENICIAN ACTIVITY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN:Jean M. Davison, University of Vermont The imprint of Phoenician trade and subsequent pres- ence can be clearly seen on the island of Sardinia, where there was attestable Phoenician settlement. Greek trade and/ or presence has been harder to define, but over the last 10 years an enormous amount of material has become accessi- ble, both through continuing excavation and through pub- lication of material from earlier excavation and museum collections. An inventory and statistical study of Greek and Etruscan imports during the Archaic period has now ap- peared, and the bibliography of analytical and interpretative studies has increased dramatically, especially concerning re- lationships of Phoenicians and Greeks within the wider con- fines of the Mediterranean. Recent excavations in Sardinia have turned up a handful of Attic fragments dating from the late sixth to the early fourth centuries B.C. (at Tharros), as well as earlier pottery of Euboeic type from Pithecusae (at Sulcis). Semitic inscriptions found in Greek burials at Pithe- cusae have already forced the assumption that Phoenicians were resident there in some capacity. The material found at Sulcis, while not confirming actual Greek presence, implies that there was direct commercial contact between Phoeni- cians and Euboean colonists at Pithecusae; and the Attic ware at Tharros reinforces the presumption of connections at least at second hand with Athens (as already suggested on the evidence of fragments of similar type and date excavated at Sardara in the 1970s). The mythological and literary testimonia that can also be understood to reflect Greek and Phoenician relationships in the Mediterranean, added to the growing archaeological evidence (especially inscriptional), combine to provide mod- els to test in areas where the interconnections are not so clear. SESSION VI E: ANCIENT TECHNOLOGY AND IDENTIFICATION SEA-TRIALS OF THE RECONSTRUCTED TRIREME OLYM- PIAS: S.F. Weiskittel, Trireme Trust, Baltimore Society Olympias is a reconstruction of an ancient trireme of the fifth century B.C., the product of a fruitful collaboration between the British Trireme Trust, which provided the plans and specifications for the ship, and the Greek government, which financed its construction. It was launched in Athens in the Spring of 1987 and commissioned into the Greek Navy later that year. Based in Poros, Greece, and rowed by an international crew, its two summers of sea-trials under oar and sail have provided extensive evidence on the oper- ation of these ships in antiquity. Weighing 40 tons, with a length of 118 feet and a breadth of 18 feet, Olympias has reached a speed of 9.6 knots propelled only by the oar power of its 170 rowers, both men and women, seated on three tiers. It matches the astonishing maneuverability of its ances- tors, famous in antiquity for their speed and agility. It can turn a full 1800 in less than a minute and can accelerate from a standstill to 7 knots in 30 seconds. The trials program was designed to measure the capabil- ities of the ship and shed light on the operations of ancient triremes. Among the matters investigated were the effec- tiveness of the oarsystem, methods of controlling the oar- crew, and battle maneuvers including simulated ramming and backing, keeping station in formation, and rapid accel- eration and turning. THE PURPOSE OF THE PARTHIAN GALVANIC CELLS: Paul T. Keyser, University of Colorado and Wilhelm- Pieck Universitit, Rostock Wilhelm K6nig reported an apparent wet cell, which con- sists of an iron rod inside a copper tube suspended in a clay jar, of Parthian date, now in the Iraq Museum, Baghdad (IM29209-11). Kinig suggested that it and others like it found in association with magical artifacts near Baghdad and Ctesiphon were used for electroplating (FuF 14 [1938] 8-9, and Im verlorenen Paradies-Neun Jahre Irak [Berlin 1940] 166-68, pl. betw. pp. 160-61). Models have been constructed and show that such a wet cell can generate less than a volt at less than a tenth of an amp (W. Ley, Galaxy 9:3 [Dec. 1954] 44-51; H.M. Schwalb, Science Digest 41:4 [Apr. 1957] 17-19; A. Al-Haik, Sumer 20 [1964] 103-104). In this paper I argue that the electrolyte was not copper sulfate (as in the model reported by Ley and Schwalb), nor vinegar or wine (Al-Heik), nor gold cyanide (Kgnig), but rather distilled vinegar (acetic acid). Konig and the model- builders have suggested that electroplating was the goal, but the power produced by the model cells is too small to allow electroplating thereby to be competitive with otherwise at- tested ancient plating methods (just as these cells could not be the basis of a long-distance telegraph which would be competitive with the attested use of fire-signals: Aesch. Ag., Aeneas Tacticus, and Julius Africanus). Furthermore, the cognitive leap from the observation (no doubt by touch or taste) of the galvanic effect of dissimilar metals in an acid to the more abstract ideas of electroplating (or telegraphy) is improbably large. The consideration of the manner of dis- covery suggests what I argue was the true (or at least far more likely) purpose: as a substitute for the attested ancient use of electric fish as a local anesthetic.</page><page sequence="50">342 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 94 THE RIOT OF A.D. 59 AND CROWD CONTROL AT POM- PEII: Christopher Charles Parslow, Duke University Tacitus (Ann. 14.17) describes the riot that broke out in the amphitheater of Pompeii in A.D. 59 during a gladiatorial exhibition between the Nucerians and the Pompeians. The resulting senatorial decree had devastating repercussions for Pompeii both politically and socially: it forbade similar gath- erings for a period of 10 years and ordered that collegia organized contrary to the laws be dissolved; the event's organizers were exiled. Whether the Pompeians had to en- dure the full term of the decree is not clear. Painted notices indicate that exhibitions continued to be held in the amphi- theater but were limited to parades, wild beast hunts, and athletic competitions. Archaeological evidence has revealed at least one measure taken by the city to avert further out- breaks of violence, perhaps in an effort to have the ban lifted. A series of wooden gates were built along the Via dell' Abbondanza and the Via di Nocera at the entrances to the narrow alleys leading from these streets to the area of the amphitheater and the Grande Palestra, effectively sealing off the entire southeast corner of the city. These gates, whose significance has not been noted previously, are comparable to those used to close off the forum and the so-called Forum Triangolare. This paper examines the archaeological evi- dence of the consequences of the riot at Pompeii and the effects these attempts at crowd control may have had on the social and commercial life of the area surrounding the am- phitheater and on later public events held there. ETHNICITY AND DIET IN EARLY EUROPE: THE DIRECT- HISTORICAL APPROACH: Michael N. Geselowitz, Pea- body Museum, Harvard University Three key interrelated questions in the study of the pat- terning of archaeological data can be phrased as follows: "Is ethnicity, in the anthropological sense, a valid concept for the prehistorian?" "Can we recognize 'ethnic groups' in the archaeological record?" and "If so, how?" These issues have been particularly debated in the context of European pre- history, since interethnic relationships played such a critical role in the early history of the region. Identifying these same groups in the protohistoric period has become both a goal and a bane of Europeanist archaeologists. Conventional analysis of the material record has failed, for example, to distinguish even between two such basic and critical groups as the Celts and the Germans. This paper reviews the anthropological literature on eth- nicity, and converges on the use of Barth's classic definition of an ethnic group as one that is self-identifying and in which members share fundamental cultural values realized in an overt unity of cultural forms. The review demonstrates that ethnicity is indeed a concept that needs to be considered by prehistorians, even though the unity of cultural forms may not be directly mirrored in the material forms left behind by the group. The literature does indicate one form of ethnic behavior that would tend to leave a meaningful pattern in the archaeological record--dietary custom. The approach of looking at dietary pattern while controlling for ecological and other factors has already proven quite suc- cessful in looking at ethnicity in very specific cases from American historical archaeology. It is suggested here that this approach should also be applicable to prehistoric archaeology. It is shown that Europe represents an ideal test-case for this proposal, both because the problem of ethnicity is a salient one there and because the direct-historical approach can be applied. Dietary re- mains of ethnic groups within the Roman Empire can be analyzed, and the situation can then be projected back into prehistory. ON THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE "ETRUSCAN" BRONZE CHARIOT FROM MONTELEONE: Jerome M. Eisenberg, New York Society It is demonstrated that the bronze chariot said to have been found near Monteleone di Spoleto in 1902 and ac- quired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1903 is a pastiche of ancient and modern elements. The two small lower friezes, one kouros applique, and part of the wheels are Etruscan. The rest of the chariot, including the three principal panels and one of the kouroi, are of modern origin. They are based upon a number of ancient Etruscan, Greek, and 19th-century bronzes, as well as several ancient vases and terracottas dating from the seventh to the fourth cen- turies B.C. Twenty-eight out of a possible 32 criteria present in an art forgery are shown to occur in this object. These criteria, the "non-aesthetics of the forger," were presented by the author in a paper at the 1970 AIA meeting, using the Vettersfelde gold objects as examples of 19th-century for- geries (AJA 75 [1971] 200). It is shown that the forger of the chariot misunderstood the harmony of the overall design and of the individual elements. His personal style and mis- takes in the technique of execution, as well as the several sources of the forgery, are illustrated. A critical physical examination of the chariot was made by the author two years after a formal monograph was presented to the Museum. All of the author's findings are confirmed except that one of the two kouros appliques was found to be ancient. Details of the recent engraving and chasing of details, drilling of ancient and modern holes, joining of ancient to modern sections, and ancient and mod- ern patinations are shown.
