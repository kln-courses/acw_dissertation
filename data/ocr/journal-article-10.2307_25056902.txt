<plain_text><page sequence="1">"PECULIAR SOIL": MINING THE EARLY AMERICAN IMAGINATION JOSEPH M. THOMAS Rutgers University When Sir Thomas More imagined his ideal society in 1516, he recog nized how important metals would be to the perfect civilization. But he arranged for these materials to be imported, not extracted from Utopia itself.1 While More would have been motivated partly by a desire for authenticity in his plot?newly discovered America was first thought to be short of such resources?his ambivalence about domestic involvement with metals, especially precious ores, was typical. This ambivalence informs American writing, too, even well after the geographical facts of the continent's resources were known. What follows is a discussion of what I take to be a blind spot in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century America's field of vision: the relative invisibility of, or prejudice against, mining activities in discourse about the American venture in the New World. The larger point of interest is that, insofar as mining was an endeavor of obvious material importance, such attitudes suggest cultural blind spots of a more general sort. An activity whose perceived energies and complica tions threatened Utopian visions of society, mining was suppressed?re pressed?from the popular imagination and its representations of early American life. These representations and the pressures operating on them are the subject here. I will approach this topic from two directions: from discourse about the self, seen especially vividly in Puritan writing, and from discourse about social and economic relations, both in New England and Virginia. The two approaches have a common ground in the pervasive contrast in early American writing between mining and agriculture, a contrast that func tioned as a mutually defining dialectic. Mining activities poorly suited American ideologies, both of religious "errand" and of an individualistic, agrarian economy; and, as I shall suggest, they carried a deeply negative psychological significance into these ideologies, most notably in religious writing. Farming and husbandry, on the other hand, represented at all times a more theologically, morally, and socially sound alternative, and provided the early American imagination with a much more acceptable 151</page><page sequence="2">i$2 Early American Literature, Volume 27, 1992 paradigm by which to interpret or construct its aims. Puritan allegorizations of conduct and religious duty depended heavily on the language of agricul ture; similarly, the farmer provided a cultural paradigm for the ideal citizen, whether a New Englander or a southern gentleman. The situation to be described exemplifies how ideological constructions make use of available discourses.2 Mining did not easily fit into what Wayne Franklin has called the "cultural plot" by which America was understood. The dominant "plot" for both Puritans and Republicans cast farming in a redemptive role while it simultaneously demonized mining. This situation seems to me also to show that psychohistorical discussion can enhance ideologically-minded readings. As with most myths and figu rations, those surrounding the nature of metals provide a psychoanalytic reader with material that can hardly be ignored. Before discussing received notions of mining and how they were taken up, colonial America can be drawn into focus with a preliminary indication of its attitudes toward mining and metals. Our current understanding of them is likely to suffer a similar myopia. For most of us, history (that dubious narrator) tells us that the search for precious metals was a primary motivation for Catholic Spanish exploration and conquest, and likewise that the Frenchman Cartier (egged on by the Indians' changeable geogra phy lessons) searched repeatedly for the golden kingdom of Saguenay. But neither older accounts nor our own usual assumptions tend to emphasize a similar motivation for our Protestant English forebears. In fact, however, gold fever was a problem at Jamestown, and New England's John Winthrop, Jr. was a practicing alchemist and natural philosopher, interests which led him to build a successful ironworks preceded in this country only by the one at Jamestown, a colony that based its original hopes on iron at least as much as on tobacco.3 Jedidiah Morse's Universal Geography, to cite an especially visible example of contemporary knowledge, gives only a passing glance as late as 1792 to the continent's mineral resources. Morse systematically discusses the treasures of each part of the new land, its "country, soil, and produc tions" (247); but his only extended look at minerals comes with his consid eration of Virginia, and here he merely quotes Thomas Jefferson's Notes on that state. Even Jefferson, who saw himself as a naturalist who had to defend, in detail, New World geography from Old World detractors like Buffon, was uncharacteristically detached in his review of underground resources, especially precious metals, in Query VI of Notes on the State of Virginia (1787).4 To continue the example of Virginia, Captain John Smith's much earlier description also proves curious. In his A Map of Virginia (1612), the</page><page sequence="3">Mining the Early American Imagination 153 section entitled "Of such things which are naturall in Virginia and how they use them" includes pages of detail on various fauna and flora, but only the last paragraph treats metals, devoting its main energy to debunking the pretensions of the colony's "Refiners" (1:156). That his concern for mining and miners is so disproportionately small seems odd since the original plan for the colony clearly shows the investors' concern for them. Article IX of the letters patent to Sir Thomas Gates addressed expected mining results, and the Virginia Company of London's instructions to the landing party also underscore the fundamental economic importance of this interest.5 In Smith's opinion, mining and miners were inherently threatening; he identi fies their object of desire with "the entrailles of the earth" (1:156). This way of speaking broaches the two subjects that need further discussion before looking more closely at early American talk about mining: historical ideas about metals and mining, and the psychological dynamics that struc ture these ideas. I. MINING EARTH'S BODY: A PS YCHOHISTORIC AL INTRODUCTION The natural philosophy of metals that had currency in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had survived relatively intact from Greek writers such as Aristotle and Pliny. These ancient ideas later filtered through original Renaissance minds such as Georgius de Agr?cola and Vanoccio Biringuccio. The English came to depend heavily on foreign expertise in mining, a pattern that was set early on.6 True to the organic world-view of which the early theories were a part, metals and minerals were thought to be living substances. Two figurai models predominated. In one, metals grew and ripened (like the vegetable world) under the influence of the sun, or of a planet or fixed star; a favorite explanation identified metal deposits with an underground tree of ore rooted at the earth's center, a kind of Stygian flora. The alternative (and more anthropomorphic) model considered the branches of this metallic tree to be, instead, the veins of mother earth's body. In the latter view, to use John Evelyn's terms in his Terra: A Philosophical Discourse of Earth, the earth has passive female "matrixes" and "receptacles" in which subterra nean fluids congeal and then gain the nourishment needed to grow (19-20). By either model, underground fluids (water or some fancier version) served as a masculine principle?the "pansperme" whose resident "seeds of met als" transformed the fluids into a "fruitful menstruum," in Evelyn's lan guage (20). Given this organic starting point, the growth of plants and of</page><page sequence="4">154 Early American Literature, Volume 27, 1992 metals differed in that crops were sown and then later reaped in the light of day, while for underground wealth we supposedly reap without husbandry in the dark confines of the earth. These two paradigms for metals can be illustrated briefly. Peter Martyr, writing in the language of vegetative ore, says that gold is a living tree ... that... spreadeth &amp; springeth from the roote by the softe pores &amp; passages of the earth, putteth forth branches even unto the uppermost part of the earth, and ceaseth not until it dis cover itself unto the open aire: At which time, it shineth forthe certaine beautifulle colours instead of flowers, rounde stones of golden earth instead of fruit?s, and thinne plates instead of leaves.... They say that the roote of the golde tree extendeth to the center of the earth &amp; taketh nourishment of increase. For the deeper that they digge, they find the trunkes thereof to be so much the greater as farre as they may followe it_(Adams, 287) Martyr's rhapsodic arboreal description puts as much life into earth and metal as we find in the more explicitly anthropomorphic paradigm. Will iam Hobbs, illustrating the latter, wrote in 1715 that the earth was generated and converted into a Liveing Body; conformable, in respect of its Vitality unto that of a Liveing Animal: And that y6 Converting the ... fluid matter into Rocks, Stones, ?cc. was gradu ally ... accomplished, as the Body attained, its maturity and perfec tion. (53) This kind of thinking, even moreso than the vegetative model, was stan dard fare for experimental scientists. Mining and its objects were largely considered dubious and dangerous, especially compared to agriculture. Agr?cola was therefore obliged to open his magisterial treatise De Re Metallica with a defense of his subject against critics who, he thought, "glorify agriculture beyond measure," though he had to assure them that "it is not my intention to detract from the dignity of agriculture" (5). The popularly held prejudices Agr?cola hoped to rebut stated, in his rendition of them, that the earth does not conceal and remove from our eyes those things which are useful and necessary to mankind, but, on the contrary, like a beneficent and kindly mother she yields in large abundance from her bounty and brings into the light of day the herbs, veg etables, grains, and fruits, and trees. The minerals, on the other hand, she buries far beneath in the depth of the ground, and therefore they should not be sought. But they are dug out by wicked men....</page><page sequence="5">Mining the Early American Imagination 155 He goes on to cite a host of poetic authorities who speak in a similar vein, among them Ovid, who writes (as John Smith would later) of the "entrails of the earth" and the "incentives to vice" held in their "Stygian shades" (6 7). The prejudices listed by Agr?cola illustrate what Carolyn Merchant terms the historically "normative constraints against the mining of mother earth" (29). Figurations of the body were central to the discourse of mining, and in any discourse such figurations do not long remain neutral. Alvaro Barba, one of the best-known Renaissance authorities on mining, wrote in good Aristotelian fashion that "Reason and Experience teacheth, that the most proper place for the Generation of Metals is the Veins of the Earth, which do run thro' it's great body as principal Receptacles of it's permanent Humidity ... as Blood is in the Bodies of Animals" (73). Barba, however, makes clear that these subterranean veins harbor "malignant juices": [Tjhere is some Matter in the Bowels of the Earth so stinking and abominable, that it doth correspond with the Ordure of Animals: The Truth is, that there be Places in the Earth that instantly kill, with a pestilential smell. (5) (He even provides two first-hand examples of such fatality.) The use of body metaphors predictably carried along with it the psychological con flicts of the literal body. William Hobbs declared, concerning mother earth's body, that She must... accommodate herself, with ... an intrinsick Heat; or otherwise [the primal juices] could not Naturally ... be Quickened &amp; Vivified.... And that such liquid, indijested, or unanimated Mater, will gradually Engender ... such an intrinsick Heat... is Evident from all the Mucculent or Slimy Filth, whence wormes and Vermins are to this day ... Engendred. (55) This language (which is not far removed from some of Emerson's later comments on nature) shows an anthropomorphically projected disgust of the body's materiality, especially that of the maternal body, figurations of which identified either an accessible, beneficent good mother associated with agriculture, or a secretive, dangerous bad mother associated with mining. And while spelling was neither uniform nor careful in the eigh teenth century, a reader notes Hobbs' uncharacteristic rendering of "Mat ter" as "Mater." Such language, especially when it describes precious metals, can best be approached in psychohistorical terms. The connections between mining, wealth, and the mechanisms of sublimation are classic psychoanalytic territory, and theorists such as Freud, Norman O. Brown, D. W. Winnicott,</page><page sequence="6">ij6 Early American Literature, Volume 27, 1992 and Melanie Klein offer several ways to begin talking about such figura tions. Common to all of their psychoanalytic approaches is the issue of symbol-formation, which focuses on language and its figures. Freud and Brown (and to some extent Winnicott) help us see attitudes toward mining and wealth as recapitulating the repression of anality, the early childhood event that, they argue, provides a great deal of the momen tum for the mind's symbol-making ability. Brown asserts a further link to particularly Protestant imaginings of both wealth and diabolism; in Freud's words, gold was known as "the feces of hell" (IX.174). Klein's work implicates both the mining products and the activities that produce them, the latter suggesting the vicious circle of aggression against the mother and ensuing guilt that Klein says is so crucial in infant development. She finds that the child has aggressive (and guilty) fantasies that equate the mother's body with the world, a world whose "burning and corroding" bodily contents must be both feared and destroyed (253).7 Echoing Agricola's description of the prejudice against mining, John Evelyn calls mineral-rich soils "cursed" and their treasures "less innocent and useful" than products of agriculture (11, 2). "Innocent" can be defined in several ways, including psychoanalytically. A revealing Protestant gloss on this lack of innocence is Milton's description of diabolic Pandemonium: There stood a hill not far whose grisly top 670 Belched fire and rolling smoke; the rest entire Shone with a glossy scurf, undoubted sign That in the womb was hid metallic ore, The work of sulphur_ 674 ... Mammon led them on, 678 Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks and thoughts Were always downward bent, admiring more The riches of heav'n's pavement, trodden gold, Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed In vision beatific: by him first Men also, and by his suggestion taught, 685 Ransacked the center, and with impious hands Rifled the bowels of their mother earth For treasures better hid. Soon had his crew Opened into the hill a spacious wound And digged out ribs of gold. Let none admire 690 That riches grow in hell; that soil may best Deserve the precious bane. (Paradise Lost I. 670-92)</page><page sequence="7">Mining the Early American Imagination 157 The passage begins in the first five lines (670-74) with a demonic, anal version of Spenser's paradisical mons veneris in the Garden of Adonis?a mons diaboli?and goes on, using the "Liveing body" model of the earth, to indicate the degraded impiety of Satan's miners. The posture of Mam mon ("the least erected spirit ... always downward bent") is significant, since for Freud anality is not only inextricably linked to money and mam mon, but its repression leads phylogenetically to our gait becoming erect. A further result for Freud was the decline of the sense of smell, a sense relied upon a great deal in locating mine sites, according to manuals and treatises on the subject.8 II. MINING AND PLANTING THE AMERICAN EDEN If by this point the discussion seems to have strayed far afield and clear out of history, keep in mind that the thinking of this period made explicit a literal connection between metals and the earth as a living (maternal) body. The Ovidian worry of John Smith over Virginia miners's concern with the "entrailles of the earth" was an expression along these lines. Smith was not, he says in his Proceedings of the English Colonies in Virginia (1612), "inamored with their durtie skill... to fraught such a drunken ship with so much gilded durt" (1:219). Gilded dirt is exactly how Freud, Karl Abraham, and Brown view gold and the "money complex" in general. The prejudice against mining was perhaps even more prominent in the New World, both for material reasons and because mining provided a powerful figurative resource for representing some psychological and social conflicts. The prejudice continued until it began to fade under the light of more empirical theories about geological science. Afterwards it resonated in metaphorically less direct but ideologically potent ways. This language of mining, however, did not exist in a vacuum. As Agr?cola recognized, it was defined by its relation to the language of agriculture. When John Evelyn compared farming with the "less innocent and useful" products of mining, he voiced one of the enabling contrasts by which the American imagination saw itself. The language of agriculture pervaded and even structured thinking about the American "errand." As the Virginia Company's instructions and letters patent make clear, the colonies were "plantations" after all, "to be planted in Virginia" (Brown, ed., 1:76). The metaphor was so routine it has sunk into literality. Yet such language was a powerful, even determinative, figurai resource, inseparable from Protestant understandings of selfhood and society and from Republi can visions of a proper social and economic polity. In Wayne Franklin's words, by European lights the virgin continent was merely "languishing</page><page sequence="8">i$8 Early American Literature, Volume 27, 1992 from the lack of an informing vision."9 The white man brought this vision and cultural narrative, which put to extensive use the related discourses of agriculture and mining. Lying behind the letters patent and charters which called for a "plant ing" was a divine model?God, whom Milton calls the "sovran Planter" (PL IV.691). John Caryll, writing in 1655, speaks triumphantly about America in such terms, and illustrates the religious use of this language: O let old England rejoyce in this, that our brethren who with extream difficulties and experiences have Planted themselves in the Indian Wildernesses, have also laboured night and day with prayers and tears and Exhortations to Plant the Indians as a Spirituall Gar den, into which Christ might come and eat his pleasant fruits. (Introduction, n.p.) For Caryll the work of colonization (including the subjection of the natives) and of spiritual cultivation are both conceived in agricultural terms. Each falls under the same allegorization of labor?sowing tares and reaping wheat, as the Bible might say. (The English would, said Sir George Peckham, relieve the "miserable and wretched estate of these sillie souls," the Indians, by showing them that "God did create lande, to the end that it shold by Culture and husbandrie, yeeld things necessary for mans lyfe."10) Humankind was planted in the first garden and after the Fall has been forced to keep re-planting itself; but America was different, the new Gar den, and it awaited only righteous cultivation in a spirit of cooperation with the Creator?unlike the hubristic meddling of mining. "The husband man casting his seed upon the earth waiteth upon God untill Harvest for a fruitful crop," wrote Alexander Whitaker in Good Newes from Virginia (Brown, ed., 2:582). Agriculture was redemptive in significance, a powerful American and Protestant overlay to the timeless celebration of cyclical rebirth. As Caryll's exclamation implies, this rebirth and renewal was first and foremost self-renewal. Hence Cotton Mather could write some 800 pages in Agr?cola, or the Religious Husbandman about spiritual cultivation. (Consider in this light, too, Thoreau's later statement in Waiden that he hoed for tropes, not beans.) The need for this spiritual cultivation depended on Protestant ideas of sin and depravity, which in turn relied upon a language of contaminated interiority that was often cognate with the language of mining. Ideas of the guilty inner self can be seen, for example, in Augustine and Calvin, two central sources. Augustine was in "shame and horror" at "how foul ... , how deformed and defiled, how covered with stains and sores" was the inner man (193-94); and Calvin had warned</page><page sequence="9">Mining the Early American Imagination 159 that "everything within and around us [is] exceedingly defiled" (4). Philip Greven, who devotes part of his The Protestant Temperament to early American beliefs of this sort, writes, "At the very core" of Protestant religion "there existed a profound alienation of individuals from their own bodies and an intense hostility toward their own innermost natures." The inner self was "polluted and filthy," and included "bodily functions ... [which] were daily reminders of the inner corruption of human nature." Greven cites Jonathan Edwards and Mather among others; according to Edwards, in his Images and Shadows of Divine Things, nothing really distinguished the contents of the bowels from those of the inner heart (Greven 65-67). If cultivation under God's sun and son yielded renewal and renovation, then tampering with the corrosive innards of self and world yielded dross and spiritual danger. Farming required the nurturing of life and the sense of righteous and humble cooperation with one's God in the wide and public world that so aptly corresponded to spiritual growth; mining required none of this. As an activity it was exploitive and violent, and its products were those of a contaminated interiority that triggered psychological and theo logical proscriptions. Religious writers made explicit judgments against mining, and helped cement the identification of the polluted human interior with the interior of the terrestrial globe. Samuel Willard, an early pastor of Boston's Second Church, wrote in admonition of metals that God would not so much as give them a Name or Mention in the Works of Creation, but passed them over with silence.... God laid them low, placed them in the bowels of the earth, to be trodden upon; But Man adores them.... (117) Later, William Pryce spoke similarly of mining: It is very probable that the nature and use of Metals was not re vealed to Adam in his state of innocence: the toil and labour neces sary to procure and use those implements of the iron age could not be known, till they made part of the curse incurred by his fall: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; in sorrow shalt thou eat it all the days of their life." (2-3) This kind of labor was considered hellish, even impious, and Pryce's religious reading of mining as a postlapsarian toil underscores its unacceptability. Mining could be connected with private and dangerous interiors and was "remote from the publick observation which commerce and agriculture so deservedly attract," he says in his Preface. Godly Ameri cans understood themselves as a nation of righteous husbandmen, in con</page><page sequence="10">16o Early American Literature, Volume 27, 1992 trast to Catholic Spain's savage conquest of the New World as a means of amassing glittering subterranean wealth.11 The proscriptions against this labor, given a Biblical rationale by Willard and Pryce, had more tangible sanction as well. There were concerns about its social effects: corruptibility by easy wealth, the use-value of precious metals, and the nature of the labor itself. At the heart of all these issues was the perceived interdependence of the moral health of the individual and that of the polity as a whole. If mining corrupted the soul, judgment, or behavior of its devotees, the society would suffer too. As Robert Mulholland states about Puritan New England, mining and its related activities threatened to "undermine the Utopian character of the Puritan colonies" (60). Mining contradicted early American social vision as well as its religious vision. This threat to utopia was not restricted to the Puritan "city upon a hill." I mentioned already John Smith's disapproval of mining; he understand ably found obsessiveness for this kind of wealth irrelevant or even danger ous to the pressing needs of a fledgling wilderness society. Smith's Proceed ings complain that our ordinairie was but meale and water.... [T]he worst mischiefe was, our gilded refiners with their golden promises, made all men slaves in hope of recompence; there was no talke, no hope, no worke, but dig gold, work gold, refine gold, load gold, such a brute of gold, as one mad fellow desired to bee buried in the sandes, least they should by their art make gold of his bones.... (1:218) Smith was worried that the colony would think more about gold than about its food supply, that agricultural work was being slighted for empty "golden promises." Smith was necessarily pursuing, as Cecilia Tichi says, an "ethic of industry and not of edenic leisure" (4). The work of coloniza tion was the hard work of survival, not of supposedly easy wealth by way of "durty" gold, whose intrinsic worth for survival was nil. A contempo rary, Robert Johnson, counseled settlers in the Nova Brittania (1609) that the "dreame" of gold was therefore a "bitter roote" best untasted in favor of God's blessings from the land (n.p.). More than a Biblical warning against serving two masters, this response, like Smith's, has in mind sur vival by means of a true sense of social and economic value. When Jared Eliot wrote in his Essays Upon Field-Husbandry in New England over a century later that "Husbandry is the true Mine from whence are drawn true riches and real Wealth" (99), he voiced a similar concern. Eliot emphasized the second half of the formula stating that mining is "less innocent and useful" than agriculture.</page><page sequence="11">Mining the Early American Imagination 161 Wealth or Riches may be considered as nominal or real, natural or artificial: Nominal or artificial are those Things which derive all, or the greatest part of their Value, from Opinion, Custom, common Consent, or a stamp of Authority ... ; such as Silver, Gold, Pearls, precious stones-(98) Eliot illustrates what More's Utopians liked to say, if in other terms, that precious metals have only exchange value, not real use (hence their predi lection for making gold chamber pots, a use Freud would have under stood). William Byrd of Virginia shared Eliot's misgivings and sounds like a latter-day John Smith: [T]here is a bad distemper rages in those parts, that grows very epidemi cal. The people are all mine mad, and neglecting to make corn starve their families in hopes to live in great plenty hereafter. As you ride along the woods, you see all the large stones knocked to pieces_Our con versations ran altogether upon this darling subject_(304-5) Byrd makes explicit here the conflict between use values and exchange values. Like Smith earlier, Byrd harps on the problem of misplaced priori ties and misplaced labor. Mining is pestilential not just from its foul vapors but because it infects the judgment and the wills of its practitioners, infecting the body politic. The question of labor itself also proved to be an important liability of mining, eventually in more visibly social and economic ways than identified by Willard and Pryce in their biblically-inspired language about the Cre ation and Adam's toil. The fact that mining entailed a labor economy gave its perceived lack of economic innocence a highly ideological basis, just as the nature of the work implicated buried prejudices of a religious and psychological sort. Agriculture, on the other hand, was God's own labor, as Milton's "sovran Planter" reminds us. Thomas Jefferson writes: [W]e have an immensity of land courting the industry of the hus bandman. ... Those who labour in the earth are the chosen people of God, if ever he had a chosen people, whose breasts he has made his peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue.... Corrup tion of morals in the mass of cultivators is a phaenomenon of which no age or nation has furnished an example. (165, my italics) It is interesting to note how Jefferson uses some of the language of mining here in his encomium of farming; perhaps this suggests either how far mining is from serious consideration, or how near?and repressed?it is. For Jefferson, farming's labor not only figured renewal, but was the literal agent of moral regeneration. His famous remarks on the godly influences of</page><page sequence="12">I?2 Early American Literature, Volume 27, 1992 agriculture go on to celebrate what he considers truly American, declaring that moral corruption is a mark set on those, who not looking up to heaven, to their own soil and industry, as does the husbandman, for their subsistance, depend for it on the casualties and caprice of customers. D?pen dance begets subservience and venality, suffocates the germ of vir tue_[L]et our workshops remain in Europe. (165) Here the work of farming is equated with an upward heavenly gaze, an implicit contrast to a downward-directed involvement with infernal min ing. Jefferson also justifies here in implicitly ideological terms John Stilgoe's decision in The Common Landscape of America to treat mining and manufacturing under one category?"Artifice"?that drew the fear and aversion of the husbandrymen.12 Jefferson uses agrarianism as a metaphor for a certain vision of personal and civic virtue and for a particular kind of American independence; they are perhaps even more visible in Michel-Guillaume de Cr?vecoeur's con temporaneous statements on American social relations. Like the New Yorker cartoon map that depicts Manhattan's self-aggrandizing view of the rest of the country, Cr?vecoeur's perspective saw America as one huge tillable field with woods and towns foreshortened to the periphery. He ends the essay "What is an American?" with the solemn injunction, "Go thou and work and till" (68), and this command has universal scope: Some few towns excepted, we are all tillers of the earth, from Nova Scotia to West Florida. We are a people of cultivators, scattered over an immense territory.... We are all animated with the spirit of an industry which is unfettered and unrestrained, because each person works for himself. (Letters, 40) This work proves tonic and pleasant, according to Cr?vecoeur, unlike the degrading and even impious mining labor described, for example, by Willard and Pryce, and implicated in Jefferson. As in Jefferson, Cr?vecoeur's ideal "we" not only farm, but are totally self-sufficient. Jefferson identified "virtue" with independence, and Cr?vecoeur is just as strident in his assertion of "unfettered" freedom. Thus, in Eighteenth Century Sketches of America, Cr?vecoeur can write that once land is secured, all one needs is "a team and a negro" to enjoy farming's beautiful simplicity (91). The question of labor and "artifice" remains, in all these expressions, suppressed. Later in the Sketches, Cr?vecoeur describes American labor relations as a redeemed version of those in Europe:</page><page sequence="13">Mining the Early American Imagination 163 As to labour and labourers,?what difference! When we hire any of these people we rather pray and entreat them.... They must be at your table and feed, as you saw it at my house, on the best you have. (82) This farmer needs only a team, a negro, and a small fraternity of laborers, who will be welcomed virtually into the family. His reader might think that more material goods must be needed to run a working farm, and Cr?vecoeur does supply to a correspondent the "detail of our implements of husbandry" (138). But he lists only a wagon and plows, then moves on to various built structures like hog-pens and barns. Where the plows and wagons or more basic (and unmentioned) tools originated, we do not hear; one wonders if they came with the mysterious "negro."14 There are several things to keep in mind about the social vision typified by Jefferson and Cr?vecoeur: the idyllic, golden-age quality of labor and employment, the pastoral oblivion to the lack of tools needed to do the work, and the seemingly unoriginated and unmanufactured sources of what tools there are. Cr?vecoeur's farmer has virtually no real material basis for his work. Revisionist American historiography has rightly stressed Jeffersonian and Republican concern not only for constitutional and political ideas but for a viable social paradigm, the need to cultivate a citizenry and political economy that was morally and ideologically able to sustain a fragile repub lic. The discourse of agriculture, as Jefferson and Cr?vecoeur show, played a large role in such cultural work. That of mining threatened society's Utopian social paradigms. It challenged in obvious ways the exemplum of social, political, and economic relations seen in agriculture. Stilgoe's "arti fice" might better be termed "labor," understood not in the quasi-redemp tive, individualist sense of Locke, but as a necessary system of social relations entailed in mining or manufacturing. As revisionist critics have amply shown, the individualist pretensions of this Jeffersonian ideology merely hid its complicity in the growing industrial and market economy on which its well-being depended.14 Further, the repressed material founda tions of social life are at least congruent with, and may resonate with, the repressed material foundations of psychic life examined earlier in more metaphorically-determined discourse. * * * As an inadmissible underside of the American errand, north and south, it is little wonder that mining was either condemned or elided from view. William Byrd's account of his mines illustrates how inimical mining was to early American social vision. Consider this portrait of a miner from Byrd's A Journey to the Land of Eden:</page><page sequence="14">164 Early American Literature, Volume 27, 1992 After staying here an hour, with some of Diana's maids of honor, we crossed Miles' creek a small distance off; and at the end of eight miles were met by a tall, meager figure, which I took at first for an apparition, but it proved to be Colonel Stith's miner. I concluded that the unwholesome vapors arising from the copper mine had made this operator such a skeleton, but upon inquiring understood that it was sheer famine had brought him so low. He told us his stomach had not been blessed with one morsel of meat for more than three weeks, and that too he had been obliged to short allow ance of bread.... I saw ... one peck of good ore above ground, and that promised to be very rich. The engineer seemed sanguine, and had not the least doubt but that his employer's fortune was made. (269) Again one notes, arrestingly in this case, the contrast between use and exchange values. This man cannot eat because he is producing copper; consequently he looks like an "apparition" more suited to the underworld. Rather than providing self-renewal, this labor is self-destructive, and it yields copper for another whose fortune depends on relations with this demeaned worker buried underground most of the day. Stith's miner hardly presents Cr?vecoeur's and Jefferson's ideal either of tonic, happy labor or insular freedom. When slavery became more involved in mining (as in the coal industry) the official paradigm of American life conveyed by the language of agriculture was even further removed from fact. Cr?vecoeur remarked in "What is an American?," using this language, that "Men are like plants; the goodness and flavour of the fruit proceeds from the peculiar soil and exposition in which they grow" (44). The historical consensus has been, for a range of reasons suggested here, that the "peculiar soil" present with metals and mines was noxious and barren. Colonel Stith's miner in Byrd's account is himself the blasted, withered plant the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, especially in America, ex pected to grow from that kind of life. Mining embodied psychological and ideological taints which could in no way provide the right soil for America's peculiar self-imaginings to grow. NOTES i. Thomas More, Utopia, Book II, p. ioo. Utopia is to import iron and precious metals for use. Robert Mulholland notes More's assertion in the introduction to his A History of Metals in the Colonial America. 2. This formulation is misleading if it suggests a disjunction between discourse and ideology. For a useful discussion of the vagaries of this term, see Myra Jehlen's introduction to Ideology and Classic American Literature, pp. 4-14.</page><page sequence="15">Mining the Early American Imagination 165 3- For Cartier, see the account in Hakluyt's Principal Navigations, VIII: 183-272; for more on Saguenay, see remarks by Joseph King in "The Golden Kingdom of Saguenay." For Winthrop, see volumes 4 and 5 of Winthrop Papers. Probably the best general study of early American mining is Mulholland, A History of Metals in Colonial America, which discusses Jamestown's Falling Creek ironworks on pp. 18 ff. See also Louis Wright, The Dream of Prosperity in Colonial America, lectures about America as an "economic utopia"; Wright, however, does not explore prejudices against mining. 4. For the dating and textual history of the Notes, see William Peden's introduc tion to his edition, pages xi-xxv. Jefferson's detachment seems curious when considered in contrast to his entangled explanations about the growth and nature of the vegetable and animal wealth of the state, later in the same Query, or even of non-precious mineral deposits. The most discussion he gives for minerals concerns competing hypotheses about fossil shells, which themselves represent a defunct life-form rather than mineral matter. Jefferson is writing, too, from the empiricist point of view of the new geological science. For this shift see John Greene, American Science in the Age of Jefferson, especially chapter 9. 5. The Virginia Company instructed the following: When you have discovered yourselves as far up the river as you mean to plant yourselves ... you shall do well to divide your six score men into three parts, whereof one party of them you may appoint to fortifie and build ... ; the other you may employ in preparing your ground and sow ing your corn and roots.... The other forty you may employ ... in dis covery ... ; when they do espie any high lands or hills Capt. Gosnold may take twenty of the company ... carrying ... pickaxes to try if they can find any minerals. (Brown, ed., 1:82) A third of the party, equal to the number whose task is agriculture, is for "discovery," the most important type of which (in the eyes of the English backers) was looking for possible mine sites. 6. Probably the two most important works were Biringuccio's Pirotechnia (1540) and Agricola's De Re Metallica (1556). Mulholland, for one, mentions English dependence on German mining expertise, which rescued the troubled Company of Mines Royal (n-13). There was not even a translation into English of Biringuccio until the 19th century, nor of Agr?cola until the 20th. Helpful sources on the history of metals and mining are Frank D. Adams, The Birth and Development of the Geological Sciences; Leslie Aitchison, A History of Metals; and the first chapter of Carolyn Merchant's The Death of Nature. For remarks on mining in the American scene see Mulholland; Wright; Greene; John Stilgoe, The Common Landscape of America; John Conron, ed., The American Landscape; and Wayne Franklin, Discoverers, Explorers, Settlers. The primary literature is large, especially in exploration literature; see my bibliography and those in Adams, Aitchison, and Mulholland. 7. This is part of what Freud calls the "money complex": "the connections between the complexes of interest in money and of defaecation, which seem so dissimilar, appear to be the most extensive of all" (SE, 9:73). Hence, "filthy lucre." Brown sums up his version of these symbol-formation issues by saying that "when infantile sexuality comes to its catastrophic end, non-bodily cultural objects inherit the symbolism originally attached" to the body and bodily products (191). He also recognizes that "the history of... criticism ... shows that repression weighs more</page><page sequence="16">i66 Early American Literature, Volume 27, 1992 heavily on anality than on genitality. Psychoanalytic theorems on the genital function have become legitimate hypotheses in circles which will not listen to what Freud has to say about anality_" (180). The details of these writers's theories of identification, object-choice, and symbol formation cannot be elaborated here. See Brown, Life Against Death; Klein, "The Early Development of Conscience in the Child," "The Importance of Symbol Formation in the Development of the Ego," and "Mourning and Its Relation t? Manic-Depressive States"; Winnicott, Playing and Reality; and Freud, "Character and Anal Erotism," Civilization and Its Discontents, "The Excretory Functions in Psychoanalysis and Folklore," "From the History of an Infantile Neurosis," "On the Transformations of Instinct as Exemplified in Anal Erotism," "New Introduc tory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis," and "Three Essays on the Theory of Sexual ity." 8. This is a commonplace for early writers on mines; see, e.g., Barba (4 ff.) and Evelyn (n-12). Carolyn Merchant cites a few of the Milton lines used here, and also takes examples from Spenser and Donne (pp. 38-41). 9. This kind of insight is at the core of revisionist views of New World explora tion and settlement. An early approach of this sort is Edmundo O'Gorman, The Invention of America; more recent ones include Franklin, Discoverers, Explorers, Settlers and Jehlen, American Incarnation. 10. Quoted from chapters 1 and 6 from an unpaginated facsimile edition of Peckham's A True Reporte of the Newfound Landes. Peckham himself rather celebrates than denigrates the promise of mineral wealth, but he has a promotional aim directed at potential colonists. 11. The case of Sir William Phips is of interest here. Phips, initially a respected leader in Boston who became governor in 1692, was celebrated by Cotton Mather for an "enterprizing genius" that culminated in his expedition to recover sunken Spanish treasure totalling, supposedly, hundreds of thousands of pounds. Hence Phips becomes a heroic English type of the conquering Spanish, and Mather compares him, without irony, to Francisco Pizarro. But Phips ended his career in less repute, and Mather scandalized many (notably Robert Calef) with his celebra tion of the treasure-seeking Phips. See Mather's "Life of William Phips," in book 2 of Magnalia Christi Americana. 12. Stilgoe, in his historical study of American land use, adduces (though without psychoanalytic intent) Bunyan's Delectable Mountains and the lime kiln in Hawthorne's "Ethan Brand" as literary examples of the aversion to infernal mining (267). He elsewhere notes that "Artifice poisoned the land, perhaps for eternity, and husbandrymen feared the greenish soil and water that lay about mines and furnaces as much as they feared the dark pits and shafts from which fire sprang" (288). 13. See Drew McCoy, The Elusive Republic; Joyce Appleby, "Republicanism and Ideology," American Quarterly 37 (1985): 461-73; and Linda Kerber, "The Republican Ideology of the Republican Generation," in the same AQ special issue on Republicanism, pp. 474-95. The citations in Appleby and Kerber, especially, include many standard sources on the topic. 14. One can partly trace this invisibility of labor back to Locke himself, for whom "labor" in the strict sense denotes not only what one does with one's own hands, but also what one's servants do, thereby subsuming the material base of production into the master's managerial skills. See his Second Treatise of Govern ment, section 28.</page><page sequence="17">Mining the Early American Imagination 167 WORKS CITED Adams, Frank D.
