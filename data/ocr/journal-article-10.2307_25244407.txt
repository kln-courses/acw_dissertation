<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN ILLUSTRIOUS VISITOR. Our Berlin correspondent writes:?I understand that the London season will be enlivened by a distinguished visitor from this city, whom the good people of Berlin will sorely miss, for he is, perhaps, the most popular, as he is certainly the most unique, inhabitant of the city, and the one who has received now for many months the most numerous and affectionately admiring visitors. I have been spending the morning with him, and have been infinitely diverted by his amusing and lively ways, his frolicsome and friendly games, his grave courtesy on occasions, and his childlike good-nature and docility. If I add that he has been alternately drinking claret and water out of a glass with excellent grace and propriety ; then turning over head and heels, shaking hands at frequent intervals ; then drumming on his breast and on'the floor; chasing a little boy and a dog (his two favourite com panions) round the room ; handing wine to his cousin ; and swinging on a trapeze, seated by the side of his boy-friend,?it becomes recessary to explain that I have been received in private audience by the Gorilla, the much prized possession of the Berlin Aquarium. He is the only living gorilla ever seen in Europe, and much coveted by the Zoological Society of London, who offered, I believe, as much as .?2,000 for him. He is as like a little Negro boy in the face as a being not absolutely human can be ; his hands are most startlingly human ; and in many of his childish ways and solemn courtesies he is almost more than " anthropomorphic". He was brought to Europe by Dr. Falkenstein as one of the spoils of the Prussian expedition to Africa, and motives of patriotism determined the people of Berlin to retain him there. Dr. von Hermes, the Director of the Aquarium, is about, however, to bring him to London "for the season"; and I do not doubt that he will have a reception as enthusiastic as he has received here, and as is due to his distinguished character as an unique individual and an ape of the most gentle disposition and agreeable manners. His "cousin", a very lively chimpanzee, who is on the best possible terms with " Pongo", will probably accompany him ; for the semi-human tricks of the two, and the extreme politeness with which they share a friendly glass of wine and water, add a good deal to the zest of " Pongo's" audiences. To see the gorilla " Pongo" gravely and politely tilting over a glass half-full of wine and water to enable his cousin " Tschego", the chimpanzee, to share his draught, while he gravely watches his enjoyment of it, is really a startling spectacle. It is not a trick which he has been taught, but the effect of his politeness. " Pongo" has presented me with his photograph ; but it is by no means so delightfully ugly or so gravely intelligent as he is, and really does not do him jus tice. He is the most delightful beast of my acquaintance, and, if he were allowed to go into society, would be, I think, the lion of fashion able salons during the season.</page></plain_text>
