<plain_text><page sequence="1">Max Frisch's Man in the Holocene: An Interpretation By MICHAEL BUTLER The initial German recep- tion of Der Mensch er- scheint im Holozdn (1979; Eng. Man in the Holocene) was characterized by an almost universal obsession with biographical data of the most banal kind. The fact that the protagonist, Herr Geiser, is not so much older than Frisch himself and that the story is set in the same Ticinese valley where the author also has a house immediately gave rise to the confident assumption that Herr Geiser was a disguised self-portrait and that the story itself was a continuation of the so-called confessional work Mon- tauk (1975) - a book whose subtitle, "Eine Erzahlung" (A Story), is also persistently ignored. In an interview with Fritz Raddatz for Die Zeit of 17 April 1981, Frisch sharply attacked this elementary critical blunder. In the valley there was an old man called Armand Schul- thess, a former civil servant, a hermit, who now that he was old suddenly wanted to know everything. Like the two foolish encyclopedists, Bouvard and Pecuchet. And like my Herr Geiser, who papers his living room with incoherent information from encyclopedias. To feel at home in this world! Armand Schulthess went about things differently; he wrote everything down on the lids of old tins and nailed these to the trees on his property - the Einstein formula, literary quotations, statistics, and so on, accompanied by his own perceptions. . . . Whenever anyone came near, he would throw stones at them; he wanted to be alone in his tiny encyclopedic forest, and he died a few years ago. Armand Schulthess: the model for my Geiser. No, the reviewer cannot, does not have to know such facts, but how is it that every second one of them arrives at the assumption that the whole thing is once again autobiographical?1 Frisch's complaint goes to the heart of the matter: a myopic reduction of the story to its supposed autobio- graphical origins prevented many critics from reading</page><page sequence="2">BUTLER 575 accurately and sensitively what is in fact one of Frisch's most delicate and subtle texts. The theme of Man in the Holocene is hardly a novel one for Frisch. As with his last play, Triptychon (1979; Eng. Triptych), here too the fascination for the reader lies above all in the book's structure and narrative technique, in the remarkable fusion of form and con- tent through which a gradual loss of coherence is ex- pressed with an ironically brilliant articulacy. Thus no account of Frisch's story can be considered adequate without a critical assessment of the technical precision with which he solved the formal problems it pre- sented. That this solution was far from easy can be deduced from a remark in Montauk which clearly re- lates to Holocene: "A story set in Ticino has gone wrong for the fourth time; the role of the narrator is not yet clear."2 A glance at the only portion published of this initial 1974 conception, "Fragment einer Erzahlung " (6:522-34), reveals the difference. In the earlier ver- sion a peremptory but disembodied voice interrogates Herr Geiser and creates a quasi-courtroom atmo- sphere. Herr Geiser is being called to account by an undefined but vaguely hostile authority in a manner reminiscent of Kafka. The rigidity of such a narrative stance proved incapable of sustaining a story of this length without the risk of monotony. The problem was eventually solved by the introduc- tion of the peculiarly dual perspective of the erlebte Rede or "narrated monologue " technique. Having re- moved the unsuitably minatory interrogator, Frisch was free to create a more flexible narrative position, which could easily oscillate between detachment and empathy. This technique enables the reader both to share Herr Geiser's own experience of progressive disorientation and simultaneously to observe it almost clinically. The resultant dry but humane tone is the source of much of the book's characteristic irony and skeptical humor. In this respect, Man in the Holocene has less in common with such forebears as Hemingway and Beckett, who were hastily - and somewhat pre- dictably - adduced by the first reviewers, than with the German narrative tradition so marvelously ex- emplified by Georg Biichner's Lenz. Indeed, the par- allels between Holocene and Lenz are so obvious that it is surprising they were ignored. Biichner too depicted a hero caught by a debilitating sense of absurdity, a man suffering from a double alienation: from himself and from his immediate environment. That both Lenz and Herr Geiser (we never discover his Christian name) are similarly on the edge of mental imbalance is revealed on the first page of each story: in Lenz we read, "It was just an unpleasant feeling that he could not walk on his head"; Herr Geiser's story begins, "It should be possible to build a pagoda of crispbread." Above all, however, it is the narrative technique of erlebte Rede which reveals the greatest similarity. Like Biichner's Lenz, Herr Geiser suddenly experi- ences the collapse of an environment which he has hitherto taken for granted as stable and adapted to human needs. On the one hand, he grows gradually aware that his brain is no longer operating with its accustomed efficiency ("Obviously brain cells are ceas- ing to function "; p. 32); on the other, the house itself refuses to function properly, and the valley, it appears, is about to be engulfed by a primordial Flood. The incessant rain has deprived Herr Geiser of his normal routine of gardening, and thus his daily rhythm has been drastically reduced to a vacuum which is all the more frightening because the other villagers refuse to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. His pre- dicament is clear: "Geiser has time to spare" (3), and time must be killed. With classical severity, the book maps out the protagonist's uneasy attempts to suppress his growing awareness of overwhelming absurdity. At first Herr Geiser tries to keep fear at bay by the persistent use of linguistic cliches aimed at bolstering his self-assurance: "bloB" (merely), "noch ist es nicht" (it's not yet), "wenigstens ' (at least), "eigentlich" (actually), "alles in allem" (all in all), and so on - all speech fragments typical of the erlebte Rede tech- nique. In order to fill the threatening vacuum effec- tively, however, he suddenly decides upon a peculiar- ly eccentric strategy: to undertake "a kind of second creation in the head"3 - that is, to reconstruct single- handedly the scientifically known world via the ency- clopedias, dictionaries, and textbooks on geology and local history that he has collected during his lifetime. Like a spiritual older brother of Walter Faber, he significantly excludes the imagination from his enter- prise ("Novels are no use at all on days like these"; p. 8), for he senses that there is no solid foundation for creative literature which deals primarily with man and his social relationships, all of which are fatally relativ- ized by natural phenomena beyond his control and furthermore are characterized by ambiguity and am- bivalence. Thus, as nature appears to disintegrate around him and his home becomes increasingly un- predictable, Herr Geiser puts all his trust in "facts": Der Grofie Brockhaus, Der Grofie Duden, histories of the Ticino, and volumes on natural history are con- sulted, extracts copied or cut out and pinned to his living-room wall: "Knowledge is reassuring " (12). What all these books have in common, of course, is their aura of unshakable confidence, and it is precisely this sense of certainty - the verb wissen (to know) is the story's dominant leitmotiv - that attracts Herr Geiser rather than the uncertainties and open-endedness of literature: "Geiser papers his living room with in- coherent information from encyclopedias. To feel at home in this world!" This of course is the point: the promise embedded in such works of the mind is rooted in the Enlightenment, in the confident belief of the original Encyclopedists that man can master the world by the use of his innate intelligence. Geiser's textbooks thus represent the opposite of fragmentation: classifi- cation and synthesis are the hallmarks of such in- tellectual activity. Like Flaubert before him, Frisch presents metaphorically the collapse of the classical</page><page sequence="3">576 WORLD LITERATURE TODAY ideals of the Enlightenment. Knowledge has not proved to be the key to unlock the mystery of man and his environment, or a guarantee of justice and toler- ance. Geiser's scraps of paper represent in a most visually effective way the reduction of a once-humane science to a conglomeration of disparate facts. Reality is atomized into narrow specialisms, and these in turn have unleashed an uncontrollable flood of intimidating information. Thus Herr Geiser, in his panic-stricken attempt to restore an acceptable meaning to the inchoate sense impressions crowding in upon him, aims at nothing less than the maintenance of his own identity as an individual. The key to this he correctly recognizes as memory. Unlike the narrator of Montauk, who is plagued by memories which prevent him from enjoy- ing the immediacy of the moment, Herr Geiser is terrified of losing his. There is "no knowledge without memory" (6), and "no knowledge" equals the oblivion of consciousness: death. That the fear of losing his memory is at the basis of his bizarre, comic undertak- ing is made clear from the beginning. It is neatly caught in the delay Frisch inserts between the two sentences, "It is not so much the bad weather - " (5) and "What would be bad would be losing one's mem- ory - " (6). Between that harmless-sounding first sen- tence and the fearful subjunctive of the second is an almost audible catch of breath, only half disguised by the comically exact list of types of thunder culled from Der Grofie Brockhaus. In this way Frisch immediately introduces the story's characteristic dual viewpoint, in which an abstract "narrator" constantly accompanies Herr Geiser and relativizes his perspective with a gentle ironic humor. The battle to locate and reassemble random aspects of the "world" and thus secure his dominant position in it soon threatens to overwhelm the protagonist. As the objective assertions of the textbooks are steadily un- dermined by his own subjectivity, Herr Geiser turns his attention first away from the information itself to the nature and quality of the surfaces which he wants to "paper" with his cuttings, then to the location of par- ticular pieces of information and how to prevent them from curling. Finally, Herr Geiser ceases to be capable of distinguishing the intensely trivial from the highly significant. In this way Frisch brilliantly presents a mind at the end of its tether. The reader absorbs the tension from the very configuration of the page itself as he observes the ironic interplay of the confident schol- arly contents of the Zettelwand and the rapid dis- integration of Herr Geiser's sense of identity, which they were meant to underpin. At the same time Herr Geiser is well aware of the oddity of his behavior: "In any case, [Geiser] does not want anyone to come into the house and see his papers on the wall" (55). The juxtaposition of eccentricity and sharply skeptical in- sight ("Man remains an amateur!"; p. 60) is another reminder of the similarity between Frisch's protago- nist and Buchner's. Frisch's narrative method enables him to portray the struggle between "enlightened" optimism and a specifically contemporary skepticism within, as it were, the confines of one man's skull. The outcome of this struggle is predictable; Herr Geiser falls victim to an all-embracing fear: "Probably there are whole Milky Ways without a trace of brain matter" (68). It is this sense of cosmic aloneness which prompts Herr Geiser to summon up his last reserves of strength and to break out of the claustrophobic valley. The climax of the story is the description of this flight. Herr Geiser's climb reads almost as a parody of Lenz's famous journey through the mountains. He experiences a similar disjunction between himself and nature. A valley which Herr Geiser had persuaded himself was "picturesque" (30), "all in all, a green valley" (43), "all in all, no deserted valley" (45), "all in all, a quiet valley " (47) has now taken on a frighteningly unqualified aspect: "It is a tangled sort of a valley" (78). As Buchner did with Lenz, Frisch here has Herr Gei- ser project onto the landscape his own fear; and it is fear of being ultimately swallowed up in a nameless labyrinth which forces Herr Geiser to attempt to es- cape from his solipsistic retreat back to his old identity (usurped, he indicates, by his know-all son-in-law!) in Basel. In this marvelous section, in particular, it is difficult to distinguish clearly between the narrating voice and the consciousness of Herr Geiser. The preterite (objective narration) and the present tense (subjective mood of protagonist) continually shade into each other. Furthermore, Frisch's idiosyncratic use of the normal- ly distancing pronoun man (one) is itself colored with subjectivity. Herr Geiser's decision is clearly underpinned by the hope that the physical strenuousness of the climb will check his debilitating thought processes and thus bring him into a more elemental contact with reality, much as Buchner's Lenz sought physical pain in order to confirm that he too was still alive. However, escape back into the former, more vital existence is not so easy. Fragments of his Zettelwand continue to re- emerge out of Herr Geiser's subconscious: "At times Geiser is beginning to think - " (77). Clearly, what has once been thought cannot be unthought; it can only be partially forgotten4 - unless one loses one's faculties, a possibility which especially worries Herr Geiser. Re- lief therefore comes only when he falls into an ex- hausted sleep and thus momentarily escapes his frag- mented thoughts. The unspoken decision to return to the valley is marked by a subtle shift of punctuation, whose preci- sion is only possible via the technique of erlebte Rede: "What use would Basel be to him?" (80) becomes "What use would Basel be to him!" (83). The question mark becomes an exclamation point as a sign of a momentary gain of confidence, a paradoxical reasser- tion of the self. Typically, however, this mood is promptly undermined by the lie the protagonist tells himself: the flight from the valley - with all its aspects of fear and panic - is harmlessly explained away as "an outing" (83). It is difficult to interpret Herr Geiser's</page><page sequence="4">Eigentlich kann nicht viel feeschehen, auch wenn es/wochenlang regnet, Monate lang; das Dorf liegt am Berg, das Wasser lauft ab, man hort es gurgeln den ganzen Tag und nachts.

Frisch charac- teristically leaves the matter open. There is a distinct echo of the Sisyphus myth in the image of Herr Gei- ser's striving toward a goal, only to lose his grip at the last moment. However, the relatively robust human- ism which caused Camus forty years ago to imagine his Sisyphus a happy man is shown as deeply questionable in Frisch's hero. Whatever insights the journey has given Herr Geiser, they do not lead him to any form of permanent enlightenment. Standing once more before his Zettelwand, he is confronted in an even more urgent manner with the basic question of human reality. His eye - and the reader's therefore - falls immediately on the centrally important Zettel: the extract from the Bible which points to man's creativity through the gift of language. Simultaneously, however, and in stark contrast, he glimpses his handwritten list of prehistoric monsters, ending with a laconic "etc." The concept of a God- centered creation is thus set ironically against that of biological determinism, in which, for example, the weather, far from reflecting human moods, actually controls the human nervous system. Faced with this perception of the vastness of geolog- ic time compared with the trivial span of human his- tory, Herr Geiser transfers his attention from the written word to illustrations; abstract rational "expla- nations ' give way to the concrete immediacy of visual images, in which in one case (chosen for the cover of the German edition) the minuscule human skeleton is dwarfed by the airy structure of the nine-meter-long spinosaurus. This shift in the type of Zettel indicates Herr Geiser's progressive loss of confidence in lan- guage and the knowledge (Wissen) it is supposed to mediate: "Now and again Geiser finds himself wonder- ing what he really wants to know, what he hopes to gain from all this knowledge" (90). It is at this precise mo- ment of doubt or despair in the narrative that he suffers his stroke - an individual catastrophe, but one with clear symbolic undertones of the original biblical Fall. The skillful juxtaposition of such apparently random texts continually reveals further layers of meaning. For example, an important group of notes in his encyclope- dic "gallery" point inexorably to Herr Geiser's fear not just of senility - real though that is - but of a final senseless petrification. Indeed, the only Zettel to be reproduced twice in the text, and thus play an especial role in Herr Geiser's consciousness, is a handwritten note which includes the information, "Changing of human beings into animals, trees, stone, etc. See: Metamorphosis/Myth" (24, 56). For Herr Geiser, the stories of creative metamorphosis (myth) are over- shadowed by the stark reality of the fossil remains which appear to underline the utter insignificance of man. They drastically relativize, indeed negate his anthropomorphic concept of history. That man first makes his appearance in the Holocene period merely renders him the newest in a vast sequence of absurd natural phenomena. A kind of inverted Faust, Herr Geiser is paralyzed by such knowledge. The promise of the humanist thirst for knowledge proves a hollow one; the fate which he foresees and desperately tries to resist is the humiliating regression to the evolutionary stage of the lowly lizard. In reality, the scraps of ran- dom information which make up his "gallery" reveal most clearly the nervous leaps of Herr Geiser's over- strained mind. His fragmentary thoughts anid increas- ing incoherence are accurately reflected - dnd there- fore directly experienced by the reader - in the broken narrative structure and the typographical layout. However, before his (presumed) death, Herr Geiser is granted one single moment of intense clarity: the memory of his Matte rhorn climb with his brother Klaus some fifty years ago. The linguistic Coherence which characterizes this impressive piece of narrative underlines still further the shifting uncertainty of Herr Geiser's current experience, for despite its ijmreliabil- ity, memory is indeed the only true basis of identity. The essential feature of the Matterhorn episode is the fact that at one point in his life Herr Geiser stood at the edge of a real abyss, dependent entirely oh a "Du ': "That remains in his memory" (104). It is not the information stored up in encyclopedias and the rest which constitutes a humane existence, but solely hu- man relationships, whose depiction in imaginative literature he had previously scorned. Shut off in his valley, Herr Geiser must now suffer the tragedy of aging, as one of the Zettel sharply indicates: "[The] deterioration of the faculty of adding new experiences to the store of memories" (39). Thus the Matterhorn memory remains indelibly intact, whereas he has dif- ficulty in recalling the names of his grandchildren. The end of this ironically colorful episode is signaled by an abrupt return to reality, marked by the arrival of his daughter Corinne, who presumably has been wor- ried by her father's confused telephone calls (97). Frisch brilliantly conveys the impact of this invasion of Herr Geiser's hermetic world by bringing the nar- rative voice and Herr Geiser's subjective perception into close proximity. Thus the reader experiences con- cretely how Corinne's arrival destroys her father's at- tempt at a "second creation in the head. " With a single gust of wind, as Corinne opens the shutters, the whole painstakingly assembled fabric comes tumbling down: "The slips of paper are lying on the floor, a confused heap that makes no sense" (106). Through thexiimming consciousness of Herr Geiser we see his daughter treat him like a child; we share the agony of a mdn who is aware of this humiliation but unable to convey either in words or actions that he is still an individual who can feel and think. The "normalization" of the situation is carried out at the cost of the human dignity of the protagonist. His predicament is that of the most appall- ing prison - a bitterly ironic reversal of the name Gei- ser, with its association of hot springs of eternal renew- al. A last glimmer of consciousness produce$ in Herr Geiser a final perception: his desperate attempt to re-create in his head an overarching and convincing meaning to life is in fact meaningless. Man with his pretensions, his illusions of mastery over nature, has in</page><page sequence="6">BUTLER 579 fact no privileged position in the order of things: "Na- ture needs no names. Geiser knows that. The rocks do not need his memory" (107). In this final moment the dual perspective of narrator and protagonist fuses. A single eye, as it were, falls on the last scattered fragments of the Zettelwand, and these deal significantly with "erosion," "chestnut can- ker," "eschatology, i.e. the final fate of the individual human being and the world," the definition of "coher- ent/coherence/coherence factor/principle of coher- ence," and finally, "Apoplexy, known popularly as a stroke." From this point of (presumed) death, the nar- rating voice falls silent. It has accompanied Herr Gei- ser to the last like a faithful shadow. Now it too fades away. The last three pages of the story are not in fact narration at all, but rather a collage made up of frag- mentary sentences from earlier pages. What Frisch presents the reader with here is in no sense an "idyll" or a "happy end,"5 but the restoration of a pseudo- coherence, a Schein-Ordnung. Life does go on, but as so often in Frisch's fiction, "normality" is depicted as a flat, impersonal, lifeless routine. Language has de- clined into a stale repetition of trivial quotations. Only slowly do the threads of this complex text come together to reveal the full pattern of Frisch's invention. Frisch is not merely concerned with the private fate of a sick old man who misinterprets his demise as a reflec- tion of a climactic natural catastrophe. Indeed, Man in the Holocene is a subtly extended metaphor which points to the wider fate of mankind in general.6 The nature of this dimension is suggested at the very start of the story, when two books are mentioned as the favor- ite reading of Herr Geiser: Robert Jungk's Heller als tausend Sonnen (Brighter than a Thousand Suns; pub- lished in 1956 at the height of the Cold War) and Scott's last logbook from the Antarctic, published posthu- mously in 1913. That these two books are the only ones not to fall victim to Herr Geiser's scissors gives them paradoxically a special, if easily overlooked signifi- cance. Jungk's book is subtitled "The Story of the Atomic Scientists" and warns the world of the appalling dangers of the new nuclear age; Scott's logbook, on the other hand, is the archetypal study of the individualis- tic bourgeois hero with whom Herr Geiser momentari- ly identifies (20). It is, however, precisely the im- minent end of a civilization based on the bankrupt ideals of bourgeois individualism that Jungk's book forecasts and Frisch's own suggests. The final stage of human evolution is quite likely to be a nuclear apoca- lypse. If man is incapable of adapting his behavior to his natural limitations, he will inevitably succumb to the laws of Darwinian determinism, as the dinosaurs and the rest did before him. The biblical extracts bring in yet another strand of meaning which is closely related to such apocalyptic concepts. For almost two thousand years the Christian interpretation of the world has shaped and given mean- ing to the Western world, and it is Christianity which most obviously underpins the inalienable value of the individual. The absurd paradox that God chose to re- veal Himself in human history via the refracting mirror of human intelligence is clearly a contributory factor to Herr Geiser's mental crisis; but by relying exclusively on reason as enshrined in his encyclopedias and text- books and thus ignoring the possibility that truth might be located through feeling and the imagination, he can see only the sterile circularity of the argument for the existence of God: "The Bible and the fresco of the Virgin Mary do not prove that God will continue to exist once human beings, who cannot accept the idea of a creation without a creator, have ceased to exist; the Bible was written by human beings" (78). Herr Gei- ser's Ticinese neighbors are no better off in spiritual terms. They have long since settled for a flat, routine Catholicism whose ominous vacancy is aptly sym- bolized by "a faded Virgin Mary behind rusty wire netting, a rusty can containing withered flowers in front of it, frescoes under the porch eaves, some of them spoiled" (48). From the religious point of view, man's refusal to acknowledge his status as God's crea- ture betrays a fatal hubris which will inevitably lead to the punishment of a second and final Flood.7 Man in the Holocene is a masterpiece. Its highly original narrative structure fixes the story's com- ponents into an impressive esthetic whole. Despite the bleak "private" story of one old man's decline and fall and the even bleaker "public" meaning behind it, the text in no way conveys pessimistic despair. Frisch's struggle to give accurate expression to his experience extends his readers' awareness of reality, for the ostensible "privatization " of the crucially public theme serves to catch the reader out in the secret corners of his own thought. It is the subsequent shock of recogni- tion that gives the book its deeper social and political significance. Christa Wolf's hope for Holocene is amply fulfilled: Frisch's narrative reveals that "strange kind of courage beneath the mask of obstinacy at the end of the world" which she had demanded.8 The author indeed seemed to don such a mask when he said half a decade ago: "He who writes today is aware of his own impotence. The destruction of the human world is in full swing. . . . Reason has already failed." He shows a special cour- age, however, when he nevertheless continues: "And still we go on writing. . . . Why not?"9 Once again we can hear that paradoxical note of "pugnacious resigna- tion" which Frisch first sounded in his 1958 Buchner Prize speech. His individual commitment to truth is as clear in this text as in all his work. Despite the charac- teristic note of ironic skepticism and occasional ambiv- alence, Man in the Holocene can be situated clearly in the tradition of a sober, contemporary humanism: "A path is a path even at night" (82). University of Birmingham</page><page sequence="7">580 WORLD LITERATURE TODAY 1 Frisch might have reminded Raddatz of a more distinguished, if less eccentric predecessor, Michel de Montaigne, who, after with- drawing to the solitude of his tower (at the age of thirty-eight!) to meditate on old age and the end of the world, had classical maxims and biblical quotations burned into the ceiling beams of his library to remind him of the vanity of the human intellect in the face of God.
