Zachary Wollard's jewel-box work can be understood as visual verse; the artist was originally on a path to becoming a poet when he shifted to painting and a poetic sensibility remains. In fantastical pastiches, he gives form to the hidden and symbolic aspects of our world, cre- ating unexpected juxtapositions. His narrative images are compiled of color- ful, recognizable elements that are not tethered to a traditional Western sense of scale or perspective- he recently cited Rajasthani miniature painting as an influence. He also frequently includes poetry- either his own or 42</page><page sequence="2">Zachary Wollard, Open Axis (2011). Art in Print January - February 2012 quoted- in his compositions. Wollard studied with Kiki Smith and shares her biological and narrative con- cerns. Etching suits Wollard's sensibil- ity, replacing the intensity of his paint- ings (whose vivid colors are informed by the carnivalesque palette of Indian and Persian miniatures) with a deli- cacy that just escapes being precious. The intimacy rendered is like that of a sonnet- a formally precise, private pleasure that speaks of the world. Following a 2007 print that centered on the cost of human intervention on natural systems, Wollard continues his investigation of ecology in Open Axis. In this etching, which is related to a gouache of the same subject, the artist envisions the transformation of spring in animistic terms. At the center of the composition is what he describes as a "crystalline raining toadstool," inspired by 19th-century glass architecture and mushrooming. It nurtures the loam beneath, in which Wollard "animat[es] what happens underground." Stems that emerge from jewels in the earth blossom into small human heads and Rorschach blot butterflies, while a parade of anthropomorphic insects and plant material awaken from win- ter slumbers below. The idea continues with separate panels at right in colors both subtle and judicious. At the upper left is Wollard's own poem on the theme: So far they come in drones Awakening fields of atomic-scented mud Heart full of waylaid transmission mist Wheatfield, torn lanes of jasmine's asps You , daughter of the night adorn the helmet of cone with spectral shatter. In its intricacy and literacy, Open Axis recalls the work of William Blake (like Blake, Wollard also publishes and illustrates books of his own poetry), as well as contemporary artists such as Walton Ford and Mark Dion. Like them, Wollard borrows from the visual cul- ture of the Enlightenment era to ques- tion the scientific, economic, and politi- cal landscape it has spawned. ■ -Sarah Kirk Hanley ■ Dominique portfolio 201 www.bleuacier.com Bleu 1 , of photogravure Labauvie, 10 images Acier RockWoodWaterEarth, irt and an woodcut, Inc. edition www.bleuacier.com Dominique Labauvie, RockWoodWaterEarth, ļļggfojffiaļ '*¥'*£ •&gt; , .vt 201 1 , photogravure and woodcut, portfolio of 10 images irt an edition of 10 43</page></plain_text>
