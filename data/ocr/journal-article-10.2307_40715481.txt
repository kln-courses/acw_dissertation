<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT EXHIBITIONS 7 for 67: Works by Contemporary American Sculptors October 1 to November 12 Organized by City Art Museum and selected by the Museum's curator Emily S. Rauh, 7 for 67: Works by Contemporary American Sculptors offers St. Louisans the opportunity to see the most important recent developments in American sculpture. Each of the seven sculptors - Christo, Mark di Suvero, Donald Judd, Claes Oldenburg, Lucas Samaras, George Segal and Ernest Trova - is represented by three to eight pieces of sculp- ture and, in some cases, by drawings as well. With the exception of the sculpture of St. Louisan Ernest Trova, little of the work of the artists in the exhibition has been publicly exhibited in this city. Although each artist works in an individual way, par- allels can be drawn between their approaches. All of the seven make use of materials, such as steel, alumi- num and plastic, which, although new to sculpture, are familiar products of 20th-century technology. The de- velopments of technology and industry are reflected in their subjects as well. Trova deals with the mechanical accoutrements on which man has become dependent. Segal provides insight into daily scenes, and Oldenburg transforms such familiar items as a bathroom scale, a hamburger and a light switch into anthropomorphic objects. Sculptors have always confronted the problems of space, but the spatial solutions of the artists in this exhibition are innovational. Di Suvero activates the space surrounding his works, slashing through it in a dramatic fashion, whereas Judd's objects seem pre- cisely to displace only the space they occupy. The artists are concerned with creating a total environment: for example, Christo with his mysterious store fronts and Samaras with his mirrored room reflecting the viewer's image infinitely. 7</page></plain_text>
