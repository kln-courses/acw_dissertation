<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Hittite Seals in the Walters Art Gallery By HANS G. G?TERBOCK Chicago It was Dorothy Hill who, in 1937, surprised the world of orientalists by the announcement that the so-called seal of Tarkondemos, long be lieved to be lost, actually was in the Walters Art Gallery.1 This seal, the first bilingual, or rather digraphic, document found, played an important role in the decipherment of the Hittite hiero glyphs. Strangely enough, it has still not revealed all its secrets, so that a review of the various attempts at interpreting it may be in order even now. Apart from it there are three more stamp seals bearing Hittite hieroglyphs in the Gallery. All of them were published by Cyrus Gordon in 1939.2 While these, too, are still not fully readable a fresh look at them may also be worthwhile. Summaries of what is, and what is not known now seem to be a subject suited to be offered to Miss Hill on this occasion. The four seals (figs. 1-4) represent several of the major types and periods of Hittite stamp seals. No. i (57.1513, fig. 1) is the oldest, with a handle that seems to be between a "knob" and a "hammer";3 no. 2 (42.352, fig. 2) is a fully developed "hammer" of the type with circular base; no. 3 (54.264, fig. 3) is a tripod, and no. 4 (57.1512, fig. 4), the "Tarkondemos" seal, most probably once was part of a tripod. The last two belong to the Hittite Empire period (ca. 1400 1200 b.c.), but the first two are certainly older. These darings are based on the shapes of the seals, the hieroglyphs and, where applicable, the decora tive or representational motifs on them. Thus, this small collection is actually quite representa tive of the development of Hittite glyptic art. Comments on each of the four seals follow. 1) Stamp seal, 57.1513, fig. 1, Gordon no. 72, made of silver (erroneously called iron by Gor don). Circular base, eight-sided tapered stem; on top of it a somewhat extended "knob" or under developed "hammer" head, perforated lengthwise. The seal surface is flat. It is divided into a wide outer zone and a circular center field. In the center there is one symbol or hieroglyphic sign not identified with any known sign of the fully developed script. With some stretch of the imagi nation one may think of a sign in stamp im pressions on pottery, g 200,4 on handles from Bogazk?y,5 which again may or may not be the same as g 199 = l 173. The latter occurs on seals as a title; it is the picture of a kind of spear car ried by men on reliefs from H?y?k near Alaca.6 Whether the sign on the seal should really be equated with l 173 and, if so, whether it means that the seal belonged to a man with this title ("bearer of the spear?") remains doubtful. The outer zone is made up of three sections of different guilloches: one regular tress pattern, one tress divided in two, and one, a double row of running spirals. In the intervals between these patterns there are anthropomorphic figures in 1 Dorothy Kent Hill, "The Rediscovered Seal of Tarqumuwa King of Mera," Archiv Orient?ln? 9 (Prague, I937)?3?7"-IO?pl-XXVI 2 Cyrus H.

Between the two tresses is a female seated on a chair with high back and wearing a long robe. She holds an unknown object or symbol vaguely resembling a fleur-de J?5. Both the other two figures turn their back on the spiral bands, their face toward one of the tresses. One, seated on a cross-legged stool, has a horizontal crescent on his head or round cap, and holds a spear of the kind just men tioned, point up. He seems to be male; perhaps the moon god? The other is standing with raised hands as if in adoration; he wears a long dress and a headdress with protruding point. The style of the figures is reminiscent of that of the so-called Tyskiewicz seal in Boston and the eight-sided stamp in Berlin;7 the combination of different tress and spiral patterns also recurs in that group. The particular arrangement of single figures between sections of different pat terns recurs on a number of seafs: one "hammer" from Alishar;8 one from Bogazk?y9 coming from Lower City level 3, Old Hittite; one in the Biblioth?que nationale in Paris,10 and an impres sion on clav found at Korucutepe.11 This whole group can be safely dated to the Old Hittite period. 2) Stamp seal of haematite, 42.352, fig. 2, Gordon no. 70, with "hammer" handle and cir cular base, first seen at Avdm and often illus trated.12 7 W.

Note that Laroche identifies m 346 and 347 under l 327. Even if the top part is seal, the added curve must somehow change the logographic value, and, by its position, this logogram must be part of the name. 8</page><page sequence="3">HITTITE SEALS W?f. **mi. FIGURE 2 WALTERS ART GALLERY Haematite seal (42.352) and impression (actual size and enlarged), Old Hittite period The seal surface is again flat and divided into an inner field and an outer zone; this time the two zones are separated by a tress pattern. The center contains a name, the title scribe (l 326) and the symbols for good and life (l 370, l 369). The name cannot be read. While the second sign is na (l 35, m 36 in its most plastic shape), the first is hard to identify.13 The outer ring is filled with a great number of elements, including only one anthropomorphic figure. The others are either known hieroglyphs or likely to be symbols or ideograms even though they are not known from the fully developed system. Since those signs that are side-oriented all face in the same direction as the seated figure it is safe to apply the principle known from in scriptions according to which signs "look" toward the beginning of the line. Thus the sequence is counter-clockwise in the impression. This seal should be viewed in connection with two or three similar ones kept, respectively, in the British Museum, the Albertinum in Dresden, and the Louvre.14 Their outer zones show multi ple libation scenes, among them one to a seated god holding a bird. Behind the god there are five signs or symbols (or combinations of such) on all three seals, including (1) a stag's head over two lines (the head missing on the Louvre piece! ) ; (2) an unidentified sign above a triangle; (3) the ligature later known as "Hattusili" (in Dresden (2) and (3) are interchanged, in the Louvre garbled); (4) two upright spears, points down; and (5) a tree in a pot or stand. This recalls the frieze on the neck of the silver stag rhyton in the Schimmel collection, which shows the two spears behind the seated god with bird, and a dead stag and a tree following(!) the spears.15 On the Walters seal the only pictorial element is the seated figure, presumably a god here too. The long row of symbols or signs has completely replaced the libation scenes. Of the symbols found in London and Dresden we have here only the stag's head, but with a double curve beneath rather than the two lines (cf. l 102, last form), and in front, instead of in back, of the god. Whether the fourth sign after the god is a tree is not clear. Other identifiable signs are (counting signs or columns as first, second etc. after the god): (2) GREAT KING; (5) ANTLER (l 103 in horizontal position as in the Schimmel rhyton) over king;16 (9) the donkey head (l ioo); (ii) la (l 175) over l 3oo(?); (12) a group recurring in a stone inscription from Bogazk?y;17 (13) k? (l 56) over town (L225); (14) the stag head already mentioned; and (15) good (l 370) over scribe (L326), a combination frequent on seals (cf. g 105). Its presence here, directly in front of the god and expressing something like "blessing for the scribe," can be understood since the seal owner has the same title in the center field. Pic 9 '</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF THE WALTERS ART GALLERY FIGURE 3 WALTERS ART GALLERY Silver alloy seal (54.264) and impression (actual size and enlarged), Hittite, 1400-1200 b.c. tures not immediately identifiable with hiero glyphs are: a Hittite adze or ?rmchenbeil in position 3, surmounted by two tiny town signs, and two different pots. Although there are a number of vases among hieroglyphs (l 333-357) ours rather recall the objects in the bottom row of the Tyskiewicz seal mentioned above. As a result we have to admit that, while the outer zone must be conveying some meaning or mes sage, we are far from comprehending it, and it cannot be "read" in the sense of later hieroglyphic inscriptions. 3) Stamp seal, 54.264, fig. 3, Gordon no. 71, tripod type, made of metal (Gordon: "brass?"). The feet of the tripod show the toes by parallel incisions. Soldered to the top is a loop. The cir cular base is flat and bears an inscription in incised Hittite hieroglyphs. The type is fairly frequent. All examples be long to the Empire period. Some show the figure of a man along with the inscription, others have only an inscription. The material of two tripods in the Ashmolean Museum is described as "base silver," that of an example in Brussels as "argent bronz?."18 Two tripod seals from sites in the Salt Lake plain are close in type: one, from Corea near Cihanbeyli19 was described as having a silver base and an iron tripod; the other, from ?ardak near Aksaray,20 was thought to be bronze having a whitish-yellow sheen. It would seem that most of these seals are made of a yellowish silver alloy, including the "brass" one in the Walters. In the inscription, the center row must be the name. The first sign is not known in this form. It could be a very sketchy bird facing right, head down, one wing lifted to rear. But this is by no means certain, nor would it be safe to read it ar.21 The sign made of three vertical lines here in the middle of the center row must be part of the name, hence most probably a syllabic sign: tar or tra? (l 388 or 389?). The last sign, li (L278), is clear. In the secondary groups, the triangle good stands over the pomegranate (l 155) on the right; on the left, the lower sign is un identified. I must confess that I can read neither the name nor the title of the seal owner. The cursive script also connects this seal with the others of this type. 14 British Museum 17804; Dresden zv 1769; Louvre a 1037. All three together illustrated and discussed by L.

This is only part of a stamp seal, the calotte-shaped silver seal surface. As described by Miss Hill, its back only shows traces of re pair, not of having been soldered to another metal part. Yet it must have been somehow con nected with a handle. It is particularly regrettable that the Corea seal (mentioned above) is lost, since a silver surface on an iron(?) tripod might have given an idea of how the Tarkondemos calotte was mounted! The shape of the handle of the latter can only be conjectured, but a tripod seems the most likely because there is at least one example of a tripod handle of a hemispheroid seal (HS 191) and because the Walters piece seems to be ill-suited for the only other known metal type, the seal ring. The curvature of the surface, which was taken by earlier observers as an indication that the piece could not have been used as a seal, is no longer an obstacle; many strongly concave impressions are known, espe cially of royal seals,22 and experience has shown that impressions of the Walters seal can be easily made. The figure of a man in the center of the seal is very well executed in the purest New Kingdom style. The cuneiform signs are also clearly those of the same period. That the maker of the seal misrepresented some only betrays his ignorance and does not mean that the seal was made after the downfall of the empire. The whole type, in the same style, is well represented among the seal impressions from Ugarit, which belong to the thirteenth century.23 This shows that rulers and individuals in the outlying territories used seals made in the same Hittite style, most prob ably by employing craftsmen trained in the same tradition. As mentioned before, this seal, first published in 1863, was the first known digraphic document and enabled A.H. Sayce to determine the mean ing of the two hieroglyphs for king (l 17) and country (L228). But, ironically, the seal that gave the first decisive clue for decipherment poses so many problems that its usefulness hardly goes beyond those two word signs. These problems concern not only the hieroglyphic but also the cuneiform inscription. The names of both the king and the country are faultily written in cuneiform in the outer ring, and the unfamiliarity of nineteenth-century Assyriologists with the Hittite type of cuneiform writing added to the difficulties. After the dis covery and decipherment of the Hittite texts of Bogazk?y some of these difficulties were over come. Thus, the use of kur "country" and uru "city" together, which seemed impossible then, is quite common in Bogazk?y. And the existence of a country called Mira or Mera led to the correct emendation of the geographic name. W.F. Albright was the first to propose the reading *me-ra. This was improved to *me-ra-a, the form attested in the texts, by J. Friedrich,24 (see fig. 5). The name of the ruler, however, is much more 16 If one is daring one may "read" this: Inara (for lama) -|- hassu ("king") and equate it with the name Inarahsu known from K?ltepe: E. Laroche, Les noms des Hittites (Paris, 1966), no. 455. But I doubt that this is permissible! 17H.G. G?terbock, in K.

The only sign that is clear after the vertical wedge introducing the personal name, is the first, tar. The next group of eight wedges (two horizontals, two Winkel hakens, and again two horizontals and two Winkelhakens) was usually taken as the sign best known as qu (kum in older periods).25 In fact, however, a normal qu, in Bogazk?y as elsewhere, should have only one Winkelhaken (the sign that looks like a triangle on edge) in the middle. While the form with two occurs rarely in Baby lonia, it is not used at all in Hittite cuneiform. Thus the reading qu (kum) must be considered an emendation. Without any change, the eight wedges in question are bi.bi.26 A.H. Say ce emended the group into rik, although that sign ends in one Winkelhaken and two verticals, look ing like Bi+is, but later he accepted the reading qu?1 The next group of wedges (fig. 6) was divided into possible signs in different ways: -u-tim-me was the most commonly accepted interpretation. It was this reading, Tar-*qu-u-*tim-?ne, which led to comparison with Greek Tarkondemos, the name of a ruler of Cilicia mentioned by Plutarch. But here again, shapes of tint resem bling the wedges on the seal are rare in Baby lonia while the Hittite form is quite different. Other readings rendered the existing elements more accurately: -u-a?-se-me of P. Jensen and -u-mu-me of A. Amiaud and H.V. Hilprecht.28 The proposal made in 1927 by W.F. Albright (see above) to emend this section into *mu-iva was a welcome step because it yielded a name of a known type. It was hailed as "richtige Lesung" by Friedrich (see above), who pointed out that in Hittite the only reading of the "qu" sign is kum and took the sequence kum-mu- as confirmation for Albright's reading. There is a slight difference in direction between the last pairs of Winkelhakens in this group, an observa tion that favors combining the last pair with the following vertical and horizontal wedges into toa, although this leaves the *mu with one pair too little. But this could be the kind of conflation assumed also for *ra-a as mentioned above.29 Even though the new reading tar-*kum-*mu *njoa was welcomed by many, it was not accepted by all scholars. I.J. Gelb went from tar-qu-u tim-me to tar-kum-mu-iva and back to the former.30 P. Meriggi, too, went from mwwa back to timme,31 and in 1950 S. Alp also decided for timme?2 Obviously at that stage the choice of reading for the cuneiform version was influenced by considerations of the possibilities for inter preting the hieroglyphs.

The long oblique sign was known somehow to express a vowel, even though its exact value is still debated (L450). This, then, is the name of Mira, which may be transliterated as mi-\-r-?, or mi-\-ra-, or mi-\-ra-?. The name of the ruler is written with the two signs seen above king in front of the man. In the repetition behind him only the first sign is above king while the second is above the mi-\-ra. This is a typical example of the free arrangement of signs in the system. The early decipherers were naturally confused by it, but now that we can read the name of the country there remains no doubt that the personal name consists of only the two signs. The problem is how to "read" or interpret them, and this problem is, of course, closely connected with that of reading or emend ing the name in cuneiform. Whichever reading is accepted for the latter, it has more than two syllables. Hence at least one if not both of the hieroglyphs must be logograms. Accepting tarku(m) as the first element of the name in cuneiform, most scholars took the animal head as the logogram for this word. This par ticular animal head is rather rare;33 it can best be described as that of a he-goat with only one horn shown and a stylized goat's beard below the jaw. Gelb (HH 1, 34) considered Greek tragos and Akkadian turahu as cognates of the assumed underlying word.34 Alp (see above), connecting tarku with Tarhu(nt), the name of the storm god, argued that the animal must be the bull, known as the s?cred animal of that god. But the picture does not look like a bull's head, nor does it resemble the known hieroglyph depicting one (l 105); thus, the idea that lioi might be the same as l 105 should be given up. If the buck's head is tarku, then should not the other sign be mwwa} This was considered by Meriggi in 1932.35 In contrast, Gelb at first thought that the second sign was a ligature of L319 and L 391, tt-\-mi,se corresponding to the reading of the cuneiform as tarqutimme. Meriggi then followed Gelb by also accepting tarqutimme and rendering the hieroglyph di-m[i]. The bracket apparently was meant to express his cor rect observation that the small strokes emanating from the sides of the sign on the seal are 3+3, not 2+2 as they should be if they were mi. Gelb (HH in) observed the same and therefore re jected the idea of a ligature with mi. By adducing the inscription of Su vasa (fig. 7 b) he showed that the sign l 320 (fig. 7 a) with the 3-(-3 strokes is equivalent to the sign without them (fig. 7 c); in other words, that the sign on the seal is simply L 319. He read it zi (for reasons we cannot dis cuss here) and offered a form Tarhu-zi as cor responding to Tarqutimme.57 At this point the present writer entered into the discussion.38 I took the emendation of the Bi.Bi group to kum for granted and argued that, since the old reading qu was out and kum could only be followed by a syllable beginning with m, the second part of the name could only be muiva. I then followed Gelb and Meriggi in taking l 320 as a form of l 319, because the sign with the ad ditional 3+3 lines occurs in Suvasa in the word usually written l 387-319 (fig. 7, b ande). Now this word, written l 387-319 (fig. 7 c), had just 33L ioi: "T?te de ch?vre ou d'?ne." We shall discuss the second possibility below. The sign on the other two seals cited there is lacking the "beard," and its function is not clear. 34 The Samsat inscription mentioned by him for lldtarku(gu)" is hardly usable; if there really is a goat's head it rather seems to be l 104 (part of Sausga}). 35 P. Meriggi, "Sur le d?chiffrement et la langue des hi?roglyphes 'hittites'," Revue hittite et asianique 2 (Paris, 1932), 3-57, esp. 32 and Orientalistiche Literatur zeitung 35 (1932), 564. 36 As read now. In HH 1, he wrote tu-\-me. (In HH 11 he changed this to Tarki(ki)-\-me corresponding to Tarqumuwa). 37 S. Alp, op. cit. (supra n. 32) p. 11, thought of a ligature of l 488 with 2X4(1) strokes (twice me), to be read ti-me. But neither does our sign look like l 488, nor is there any trace of additional strokes. 38 H.G. G?terbock, "Die Elemente muwa und ziti in den hethitischen Hieroglyphen," "Symbolae Hrozny," 3 = Archiv Orient?ln? 18, 1-2 (Prague, 1950), 208-38, esp. 212-14; briefly anticipated in "Die Bedeutung der Bilinguis vom Karatepe f?r die Entzifferung der hethiti schen Hieroglyphen," ?ranos, Acta Philologica Suecana 47 (Uppsala, 1949), 93-115, esp. 108. 14 *</page><page sequence="9">HITTITE SEALS then been shown by the Karatepe bilingual to mean "servant," Phoenician %bd. While this, up to this point, was correct, my next step was fatal! Since I thought that the second sign on the seal must be read munjoa I had to take it as a word sign. The fact that here it stood alone while in the word for "servant" it was preceded by l 387, I explained by taking l 387, which looks like the word divider, L386, written twice, as a "double word divider" introducing the logogram L 319. In this I followed the example of Meriggi.39 Thus I arrived at positing a word muiva "servant" which seemed to make good sense as second element in theophorous names but did not fit other occurrences of the word or element muiva, so that I had to posit two homonyms. This was rightly rejected by others,40 and I myself have, of course, given it up. What, then, is a better solution? A variant in Karatepe, word 293, showed that L 387 could be used for the syllable mi, normally written with L391, the four lines. This led scholars to a syllabic reading of the word for "servant" as m?-t?-.41 For the name of the seal owner this means that the second sign is t?, which rules out mu-iva for the cuneiform version. In this I now agree with the others. But from here on I again prefer a different solution. While *mu-iva is out, Him-me is not much better. For one, the Bogazk?y form of tim looks too different from what is on the seal, and sec ondly the slight difference among the last four Winkelhakens and the frequency of names end ing in -wa strongly argue for reading -iva, not -me. Since the hieroglyphic t? calls for some thing similar in the cuneiform, I propose to re arrange the wedges preceding wa so as to form a ti, an emendation requiring not more reshuffling than mu and less than tim (fig. 6, last line). The resulting Hi-iva yields an acceptable sequence of sounds (and possibly a meaning, as will be dis cussed presently). I still maintain that qu is out and that kum is possible only if followed by an m. Since now muiva is out, kum must also be abandoned. It should be remembered that the alleged kum really looks like bi.bi, and that the sign bi has another reading kas which does occur in Bogazk?y, especially in proper names. Concern ing the hieroglyphic name, Meriggi long ago saw that the only occurrence of l 101 is in one of the lead strips from Assur, where it is followed by the full phonetic writing tar-ka-s-n?-s.42 In the cuneiform version one can easily read tar-kas . . . without changing anything. Following a suggestion of M. van Loon, I propose to start from these two syllables and to emend the next group of wedges to *na. This requires relatively little change: omission of the upper horizontal of the second bi and taking the small wedge, hitherto either read u, or used in some reshuffling, for an undersized vertical. This, then, would yield cunei form mtar-kas-*na-*ti-iva, hieroglyphic tarkasna-tL In this form the lack of the last syllable in the hieroglyphic spelling is odd. I therefore propose the hypothesis that L320 is logogram for tiiva. This word looks like the bare stem form of the Luwian word for "sun," tiivat-, with the known loss of the dental in word-final position. One could even imagine that the six small strokes 39 Gloss.1, p. 160 left top, where kk is his convention for a double word divider and DI in capital letters means L319 (m. 266,1) used as logogram. In Gloss.2 under M.266 he says "ob auch Ideogramm, ist fraglich." 40 Apart from Gelb, Meriggi, and Alp already quoted, see J. Puhvel, " 'Servant' in Hieroglyphic Hittite," Journal of the American Oriental Society 77 (New Haven, 1957), 137-39. 41 Or the like; see under l 387,2 (where ta5 is a mistake for t?) and Meriggi, Gloss.2 p. 83 s.v. miti(a)s. Laroche correctly remarks that it is difficult to under stand why mi occurs almost exclusively in this word; one may also say: why this word is exclusively written with mi, never mi. Having argued that in the empire script, the old form of L386 seemed to mean "man (vir)," (K. Bittel et al., Bogazk?y V: Funde aus den Grabungen 1970 und 1971, Abhandlungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft, 18 [Berlin, 1975], p. 74 sub. d), I wonder whether L 387 might not originally be a logogram, "man (of a) man" in a sense comparable to our saying "my man" when speaking of a subordinate. So, l 387-319 would be MiTi-ti, and the phonetic use of l 387 in Karatepe word 293 would be derived from there. This does not affect the main argument and is offered here only on the side as a hypothesis. 42 Thus the present reading of Assur f, iv, 3. Meriggi, Revue hittite et asianique (1932), 32 read this (k)ivi-r-ga-s na-s, but in n. 38 already said "Le mot rapelle en quelque sorte le nom Targasnallis." See now Gloss.2 s.v. tarkasna and P. Meriggi, Manuale di Eteo Geroglifico, 11/1 (Incunabula Graeca 14, Rome, 1967), p. 140, frfase] 19-20. * 15 '</page><page sequence="10">THE JOURNAL OF THE WALTERS ART GALLERY emanating from its upper edges are rays.43 Turning from the proposed meaning of the second element to that of the first, it will be noticed that we called the animal of l 101 a goat (or buck), that we follow Meriggi in taking the animal in the Assur letter f, col. iv, as the same, but that tarkasna- is supposed to be the word for "donkey"!44 The point is that the same letter has in col. in a clear sign l ioo, the donkey head, with phonetic complement -na which is not sufficient proof for reading the whole word * tarkasna-, whereas in col. iv the full spelling tar-ka-s-n?-s accompanies an entirely different picture, an animal's head with a curved horn, not two long ears, and the little protrusion under the chin as on the seal. My explanation is that the two sections of the letter refer to different ani mais. The context as interpreted by Meriggi45 does not require that the animals be the same; Meriggi even writes "asini" in the first, "muli" in the second place. Thus I contend that targasna is a (he-)goat, not a donkey, and that the word for "donkey" is a different word ending in ... -na. With the new meaning, targasna- would also be a nicer base for such proper names as Targasnalli, ruler of Haballa, and our *Targasna-Tiwa, king of Mira.46 This is my present attempt at interpreting the famous seal inscription. I dare not call it "final"! Whatever better reading the future may bring, let us enjoy the beauty of the seal, one of the treasures of the Gallery, in gratitude to the scholar who first recognized it! 43 Could the sign depict a "sun disc" of the kind known so far only from the Early Bronze Age tombs of H?y?k, e.g. the diamond-shaped example, E.
