<plain_text><page sequence="1">Personal Logic and Christian Affirmation DOUGLAS A. Fox WO of the strongest influences upon the Philosophy of Religion at the present time are Existentialism and Linguistic Analysis. This being so, it is strange that so little has been done with the "logical form of the personal" which John Mac- murray proposed in his Gifford Lectures of 1953 and 1954, for in them he sought to speak to a contemporary philosophical situation in which both Existentialism and Analysis are symptoms of a problem which neither alone can solve. Existentialism, he argued, cor- rectly sees the crisis of the present time as the result of philosophy's failure to overcome the Cartesian dualism and to speak cogently and profoundly of the personal. Linguistic Analysis is also correct in that it perceives the need of this day to be the discovery of an adequate logical form. But each has failed to meet that aspect of the total problem to which the other particularly addresses itself. Macmurray's attempt was to analyse the nature of the self in such a way that a logical paradigm would emerge for the discussion of that which had to do with the self - of that which was personal and relational. It is impracticable to follow the closely woven thread of his argument in a paper of this size, and readers are referred to his two volumes, The Self As Agent and Persons In Relation. Our present purpose is to take his conclusion, the proposal of a logical form which will be adequate to carry personal propositions, and to explore ways in which it may help us to analyze certain significant religious terms. In short, then, Macmurray saw the self as primarily active and secondarily reflective. This reflection existed, so to speak, within the acting and for its sake, determining its shape. But it is action which brings us into contact with others and which, therefore, causes the emergence of a self in the first place. The mistake of traditional philosophy has been to begin with a concept of the self as reflective, and thereupon to fall into the Cartesian dualism of subject and object. The self is an agent within whom is a subject; its subjecthood is a "negative" pole constitutively engaged with the "positive" pole of its agenthood. From this conception Macmurray moved on to suggest that the logical form of personal affirmations must parallel the structure of the self. A personal statement must be so made that it represents a "positive" which contains and is constituted by its own "negative" pole. It may seriously be questioned whether what we have in this proposal really represents a "logical form," and there appears to be some danger that in affirming this form as proper to "personal" propositions we shall be too arbitrary, unnecessarily forcing all personal statements into a stereotyped pattern. Nevertheless it does appear that Macmurray has at least provided an interesting tool for the analysis of propositions and terms which have to DOUGLAS A.

Even limiting it to this function it may be possible for us to over- work this form. But if we remember these dangers it may be vastly profitable to explore some of our most common (and therefore, probably, abused) personal and religious terms to see what light can be thrown upon their meaning. It is to an experiment in the analysis of some Christian concepts, then, that we now turn. Since it is not altogether clear how Professor Macmurray would proceed to use his "logical form of the personal" in the elaboration or exploration of religious doctrines, he cannot be held responsible for what follows. Our purpose will be to pursue his suggestion, and by means of it to analyze two Christian concepts which have seemed to some to be involved in paradox or confusion, hoping to show that neither paradox nor confusion truly exist there. As a piece de resistance I should like then to make a suggestion concerning the ancient and honorable problem of the "two natures" of the Christ, again following the form of the personal. Firstly, then, let us consider the concept of Christian love. We shall begin by thinking about God's love for man, and shall then move to reflection on the nature of an ideal love (agape) of man for God and for his fellows. First, however, we should note that in thinking about these two loves problems arise for a coherent system from two main sources, re- spectively from theology and psychology. Theologically we face the task of reconciling the notion of God's love with his judgment, for it has seemed to some that these are antithetical characteristics. Psychologically (in regard to man's love) we must reckon with the fact of experienced ambivalence, for it is entirely possible for us to love and, at times, to resent or even hate the one whom we love. In each of these cases we may, of course, attempt to resolve the conflict by dialectic. Love and judgment, or love and hate, are then seen as thesis and antithesis and we try to reach a synthesis either by fusion or by choosing one to dominate the other. Neither of these solutions is really adequate, however, for a fusion would result in something which is not love, and it is unrealistic to suggest that a man can simply choose the domination of either love or hate, at least without first having a clear understanding of the structure of their relationship. Let us, then, turn first to the problem of God's love, and apply Macmurray's paradigm to our conception of it. If he is correct this, being a supremely relational and therefore personal phenomenon, will be expressed by a term which must itself be understood under the categories of the form of the personal; that is to say, "love" must be seen as a polar concept, and we must search the only resource available to us - human experience - for some clue to the nature of the constitutive poles. In so doing we must be aware, of course, that we are speaking of God anthropomorphically, and every Tillichian warning about this proceeding is important. But if we are to speak with understanding at all we must be willing, however tentatively, to resort to symbols drawn from experience, attempting to keep them open to the unconditioned reality to which they are intended to refer. Let me, then, suggest that the positive pole in love is perhaps to be expressed by the idea of "concern" when that word is understood as meaning an outgoing to the other with respect for his otherness and responsible intention of his authentic well-being. The negative pole is, I believe, judgment. Now, it is important to recognize that judgmnent, as we are using it here, does not mean condemnation. It means real knowledge plus evaluation of the person loved and his various characteristics. If this is not present then love itself is not present - at least not love for this other person in his authenticity. We may be "in love" with a false image which we</page><page sequence="3">328 DOUGLAS A. FOX have projected on the other, but to love him as he is in himself is to know him accurately; and to know him necessarily means either to judge him or to be indifferent to him. That is, we know his characteristics, his habits, his peculiarities, and either we simply do not care or we know that we approve or disapprove of them. When we know that the other person is truly another and no mere extension of ourselves, and we know him deeply, accepting gladly his otherness, we may truly love him. But that love will be love for him only because it contains and is shaped by our judgment of him. We have said, then, that love consists of the poles "concern" and "judgment," and we must go on to affirm that concern, as we have defined it, is the positive which contains forma- tively its negative pole, judgment. Immediately, however, we must beware of a possible misunderstanding. Let us be clear that although our paradigm of the form of the personal, the self, offers us as its poles action and reflection, we are not now saying that concern is active and judgment is merely reflective. Rather, we transfer the "polarity" concept to new ground and simply try to understand the inner structure of love, recognizing that both concern and judgment may find expression in action and reflection. Let us turn now directly to the problem of God's love, and its relation to his judgment. It should become clear, as we look at love from the present perspective, why it is not necessary to say that God's judgment of us is cancelled by his love; his love contains his judgment just as the self as agent contains the self as subject in Macmurray's scheme. Love which is divine concern for man assumes precisely the shape it has because it contains judgment, but the judgment in no way diminishes the love. This is precisely why the cross is such a poignant symbol in Christianity, for it represents a love which is undeceived, which contains and is shaped by a true judgment, but being love assumes for our sake the burden of expressing itself ultimately. Mere judgment would simply condemn us; a con- cern which lacked judgment might ignore our sin. Agape can do neither of these things and must suffer. How much more clearly does the tragic inevitability of the cross and the depth of its meaning appear when we rid ourselves of the false dichotomy of concern and judgment and see that both are necessarily part of the one fundamental reality, love. Macmurray is right: to take away either of these poles and to speak of God as exemplifying mere judgment or mere favor without judgment is truly to depersonalize him, for the per- sonal truth about God is love in the fullness of its dipolar complexity. Does our paradigm help us, further, to understand human love, especially in its am- bivalence? I believe it does, for if our love contains judgment, that judgment consists in part in a recognition of the otherness of the other. Now, this means that in loving we recognize ourselves to be limited by the other as well as enhanced by him, and there will almost inevitably be times when the limitation looms larger than the enhancement. In other words, any relationship less than love leaves us somewhat free to ignore the claims of the other and therefore may give us less cause to resent him; but if we love, we are bound to the one whom we love, and that bondage will seem at some times to be a golden chain and at others to be of iron. It is here that we must be particularly careful to separate our assertions about God's love and man's. In dealing with the love of God we did not mention his judgment of man as implying his limitation by the other, yet in speaking of man we do not hesitate to affirm this. Not wishing to be drawn off into an extensive detour I shall only observe here that where man, being finite, is inevitably limited by any other, God, being infinite is not so limited and his love (and judgment) of man is therefore different in nature from man's love for his fellows. Herein, of course, lies the danger of anthropomorphism and the reason for</page><page sequence="4">PERSONAL LOGIC AND CHRISTIAN AFFIRMATION 329 our warning above about literalizing symbols drawn from human experience and applied tentatively to God. We have merely raised the question of the relationship of an infinite God to persons who are, in some respect, "other," and cannot attempt to settle the prob- lems raised by it here, issuing as they would in a discussion of the possibility of the actual finitude of God, of pantheism, and panentheism. I shall say only that I am assuming through- out an essentially panentheistic stance. To return, then, to the question of man's love and the sense of limitation it implies, we may say that in some moments it is probable that awareness of the limitation will produce either hatred or fear, depending upon whether we feel ourselves to be held in the relation- ship by our own motives, desires, or feelings, or dominated and constrained by the other person. If we feel that we could escape if we would, we are more likely to hate: if we feel escape impossible because of some power or influence of the other (e. g., we dare not be without their strong leadership) then fear or a combination of hatred and fear is likely to ensue. It may be argued that this analysis flies in the face of the biblical statement that perfect love casts out fear. This is not so, however, for we are not now talking about perfect love. Such love is possible only to a perfect Being, so that it is quite reasonable to suppose that fear is unknown to God. Indeed, as our analysis of the love of God made no mention of his being limited by the other, so it said nothing about either hatred or fear, for these are inappropriate there. But man, imperfect in his egoism as in everything else, cannot love perfectly and is therefore subject to the ambivalence we have been describing. Perfect love - agape at its richest --takes no account of self-enhancement or self-limitation; it is not qualified, it simply is. But we are now speaking of love as man knows it and in this con- nection ambivalence, like the poor, is always with us. Next let us turn to the problem of the relationship of faith and works in the Christian life. This is no mere academic problem, for a great deal of what is said and done in the name of the Church implies the selection of either one or the other as the primary factor in man's salvation. It may be said, for instance, that most contemporary liberal Protestant philosophies of religious education show a distinct preference for a doctrine of salvation by works in their emphasis on involving the pupil in activity, and in stressing his re- sponsibility for acting and deciding in a vast range of matters. Nor is the problem of a new one, of course. It is, indeed, dignified by the participation of some of the greatest figures in Church History. Yet I want to suggest that it is largely a pseudo-problem which dissolves when we learn to ask the right question instead of the wrong one, and when we apply Macmurray's form of personal logic in making our reply. The issue has been confused because we tend to begin our inquiry from the wrong place and in a manner which already begs some of the subsidiary questions. Customarily we begin with an existing notion of "faith" and of "works" and we ask in what way, or by what combination and arrangement of them, we are brought into relationship with God. It would clear the ground a little if we were to begin by asking simply, "How does man find acceptance with God?" In response to this question a great deal might be written, and we must unashamedly cut some comrners, for the sake of brevity, by resorting tenta- tively to Paul Tillich's suggestion that man must accept the acceptance of God. In other words, man's privilege and task is to respond to God's proferred grace, and that response is to be understood as a polar phenomenon, containing an attitude of trustful responsiveness and an active expression of this attitude. So, then, our proper response to God is an attitude of heart, mind, and will which</page><page sequence="5">330 DOUGLAS A. FOX finds constant expression in action which is, before all else, a giving of oneself to encounter with him. What else will be contained within this action is conditioned by what we under- stand to be the nature of God and of his will for man in general and ourselves in particular. The important thing to remember is that the attitude and the action are inextricably inter- twined - are, indeed hardly to be separated at all as parts of the one reality, our response to God. If we try to talk about which of them is the more important we immediately in- volve ourselves in false dichotomies, for it is clear that the trustful attitude without any expression is purest subjectivity with no external reference and therefore not really a rela- tional phenomenon at all; on the other hand, activity apart from the trustful attitude is simply not specifically Christian. This last point becomes clear when we reflect that all action must have some motivation (as distinct from a mere conditioned reflex), and action which finds its motivation outside the attitude of trustful response to God is not properly to be called Christian, though, of course, it need not therefore be anti-Christian. To be sure, much that is called Christian "work" finds another motivation, and it is probably true that no action is entirely pure in its source, but there is a clear distinction to be made between acts which are performed for their own sake (into which category much of the pointless "busy work" of Christian Education fits), acts which are performed for the self's sake (whether as self-gratification or in order to "win" or manipulate God) and acts which are truly structured and informed by a sincerely trustful response to God. If one wishes to call the trustful response "faith," and the active expression of it "work" there can be no objection, but we must not forget that each is incomplete without the other, and together they constitute the one really fundamental reality, response to God. In Macmurray's paradigm of the self, we say that while the self as a "whole" is the fundamental entity, it is to be understood as an agent which contains a subject. The parallel between this image and that of the Christian's response to God is a striking one. While, as we have said, it is dangerous and unprofitable to apply relative value-judgments to the poles of this response, it may be useful to note that as the self is firstly agent, so the re- sponse may be thought of as firstly act because it is essentially a form of relating, and relationship must always be action. But it is an act which, from the beginning and through- out its career, is structured internally by the attitude of responsive trust. To give oneself to another is to act; to pray is to act; to accept acceptance is to act. But these actions are radically altered if their internal structure, or negative pole, is not that trustful orientation of heart, mind, and will to the other which God's grace can and should elicit. One illustrative consequence of this analysis is that in Christian Education we must not be content with activity for its own sake or even for the sake of the knowledge it im- parts or the skills it perfects. Knowledge and skill are important, but of primary importance is the cultivation of response to the numinous whenever encountered, and the encouraging of those activities which arise spontaneously as expressions of even a fleeting moment of gratitude, awe, or love for God. Having performed a sort of preliminary canter through two lesser problems, let us now turn our attention to the hoary and vexed question of the relationship of Jesus Christ to God. We shall discover that there are two questions here: the relation of God to Christ, and the relation of Christ to Jesus of Nazareth. We shall begin by considering the former. The problem of the relationship between God and the Christ becomes acute only if we see a uniqueness about the latter which precludes our describing him simply as an unusually saintly man. If, in faith, we are led to affirm that God himself is somehow present here as in no other life (the difference being, so to speak, qualitative and not merely quantitative)</page><page sequence="6">PERSONAL LOGIC AND CHRISTIAN AFFIRMATION 331 then we are bound to give some account of the way in which the holy God is here united with the life of a Palestinian peasant. To say that Jesus was inspired in the same manner as other prophetic figures will not satisfy the essential Christian experience. But to say that God and man are united in this figure presents enormous and familiar difficulties. There has been a long struggle to find a way in which the union of the divine and human "natures" of Jesus Christ can be described, but our best efforts leave some of us, at least, with the suspicion that we (and not God) have created here a monstrous hybrid which only by a struggle of faith can be called either man or God. For Christian thinking, the ultimate Reality (I would contend, the ultimate personal Reality) is surely God. Man's dilemma consists in his alienation from this God and there- fore from the deepest reality of all life and meaning, and we have customarily said that the Christ in some way is the renewer of the divine-human relationship. Further, from the Johanine "Logos" Christology we have long since learned to think of the Christ as pre- existent, and from various New Testament sources we have acquired a conviction about his post-existence in relation to the earthly life of Jesus. This has led to the charge that conventional Christians must either postulate two Gods (Father and Son - to say nothing of a third, the Holy Spirit, if this term represents another entirely separate entity) or must fall into the heresy of patripassianism by crucifying the one God. It is at this point that an attempt to understand the term "Christ" under the logical form of the personal may, I believe, guide our thinking about the concrete reality to which the term refers. "Christ," then, as standing between God and man, is a dipolar concept containing a positive element which is divine and a negative which is human. That is to say, we have here something which participates in divinity but which contains and is shaped by humanity. Put in this way we seem to be faced with a quite unacceptable and even absurd proposition. Let us acknowledge, however, that what is supremely important about the Christ is that we are met here by an act (and not merely a word) of God. Now it becomes possible to see that the phrase "Jesus as the Christ" signifies an act of God, per- formed for and among men, and structured internally by humanity - specifically the humanity of Jesus of Nazareth. In other words, the Christ is an act of God, aiming at a divine intention which has always, eternally, been a part of God, but owing its precise existential form to the humanity formatively within it. Now, Being and Act are not to be separated in too radical a way. In a real sense we are what we do. To say that one pole of the Christ-concept is divine act is therefore to say with St. Paul that "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself." In the Christ we con- front no mere prophet, but God acting. Christ is in no sense, then, an appeaser of God; nor does he represent simply an ultimate in human goodness who by his splendid life per- suades God to change his attitude to man. He is not a divine Spirit merely parading as a human figure. The Christ is God's act for man's salvation and he is nothing less than that. But this acting of God is borne, so to speak, by a human life. It is, indeed, minutely structured in its material, existential manifestation by that life so that it is quite conceivable that the act might have looked different in many respects had it been borne by someone other than Jesus of Nazareth. And this brings us to consider the relation of the Christ to this man Jesus - the Christ-bearer. Jesus is not God. He is the Christ only in the sense that it is by his life that God's Christ-act (the concretion in history of an eternal love-principle) is able to be performed. In this sense it may be said that while the Christ is necessary to man's salvation Jesus was not. It is not important, ultimately, who is the bearer of the Christ-act; what is important</page><page sequence="7">332 DOUGLAS A. FOX is that it should be borne. Or rather, what is important above all else is that men should recognize the Christ somewhere. It would not even matter if the man Jesus were, in fact, less perfect than we have commonly imagined; he could even be a scoundrel, but so long as he is perceived by his fellows in such a way that he is and remains the vehicle by which the divine act - the Christ - is received among us, he has done his work. Of course, if Jesus were an unworthy type of man it is incredible that he should be seen as the actual bearer of the Christ, but it is important to place our values where they belong, or we find ourselves plunged into a sort of Jesus-cult in which the vehicle is wor- shipped instead of the God who has acted by means of it. "The Christ," then, means the union of two poles, God's act and a man's life. Christ is the act of God for the redemption of the world, that act being shaped in its particulars by the life of the man who is its bearer. One may now ask, does not this structure suggest that the Christ is a clearly secondary entity, and God and man stand alone as primary? In one sense the answer must be Yes, and in another, No. We have already said that to act is, in a real sense, to be, so that God is his act of redemption and (conversely) the Christ is God. Moreover, in the state of estrangement from God in which man finds himself the Christ becomes of unexcelled im- portance, since he is the divine channel by which man may move into renewed relation- ship with his God. Yet it must be conceded that the God whose act the Christ is, and man for whom God has acted are, in a sense, the basic realities in the situation. It is hard to see, however, how one can be accused of devaluing the Christ when one has described him as the very act or self-expression of God! A further question may arise. What is the difference between a Christ and a saint? The answer is that in the saint the poles of the divine and the human are again operative, but this time in reverse order. Here we have as the positive pole "manhood," but it has come to contain and be shaped (or reshaped) in some sense by the divine. In this sense it may be said that Jesus of Nazareth is, as a man, a saint at the same time as he is, in his saintly humanity the negative pole of the Christ. Thus, both those who have advocated a Jesus-cult and those who have lost the fullness of a Christ-concept and have merely revered Jesus as a saint are mistaken. Jesus is a saint, and as Jesus deserves precisely that quality of reverence. But he is also the bearer of an act which was the necessary and liberating con- cretion of God's intention for man's reconciliation with himself, and as such he is part of an event which deserves infinitely more reverence than does a saint. But if the humanity of Jesus exists for the sake of the divine act which is performed by means of him, it remains to say something more of what it means when we say that this divine act is shaped by his humanity. This does not mean that the intention behind the act is influenced in any way by humanity; the intention is wholly and eternally God's. There is intended here an invasion of the temporal by the Eternal for the sake of man. But the shaping or structuring aspect of the humanity of the Christ-event means, at the simplest level, that this divine invasion is intelligible to us. The Old Testament recognized the impossibility of a human perception of the divine when it observed that no man can see God. But an incarnation in which the divine is structured by the human becomes both a revelation and (as Barth clearly shows) a concealing of the divine. It becomes an expression of the divine which human perception can receive, but (as adherents of a simple Jesus-cult never realize) it becomes a translation of the divine into a new form in which something of the original is inevitably veiled. Yet the translation is authentically of the divine, and</page><page sequence="8">PERSONAL LOGIC AND CHRISTIAN AFFIRMATION 333 the intention which is at the heart of it is unaffected. We must therefore go beyond Ritschl's affirmation that Jesus has the value of divinity for us and say that Jesus as the Christ is the true bearer of divine action for us, and that through the Christ God is able to communicate with man in a new way, able to make effective among men the eternal divine principle and intention of reconciliation. In the discussion above I have tried to follow the implications of John Macmurray's "form of the personal" without particular regard to any recognized theological stance. It will be apparent (and is inevitable) that I have at all times been under the influence of those theologians to whom I am most indebted for my usual ways of thinking and amongst these must be named Rudolph Bultmann, Paul Tillich and Karl Barth - although all of these would certainly be uncomfortable with some of the contents of this essay. In the main, however, I have aimed at following only the natural course of the discussion as it issued from Macmurray. Thus John Macmurray, regardless of whether he has really given us a new form of logic, may have provided an invaluable tool for the analysis of theological concepts. He may have shown us how to talk about the incarnation without resorting to discussion of the two natures in one being (a form of discussion which seems to me often haunted by ancient and discredited notions of immaterial substance). Mystery, of course, remains - as it must. But at least it is genuine mystery and not mere nonsense.</page></plain_text>
