<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHURCH HISTORY ported by the text from Deut. 4.19 that God "gave the heavenly bodies to the na- tions"); that polytheism, with its anthropomorphic deities and mythic narratives, came later and thus was an innovation, indeed, was not even a native growth in Greece but was imported from the barbarians of Phoenicia and Egypt (quite naturally, then, the Hellenes ought to abandon it in favor of the more philosophical truths contained in the Hebrew Scriptures); and that the allegorizations of the Stoics are a hopeless muddle, because they interpret thle polytheistic myths, which came later, in terms of the earlier religion of nature. If subsequent volumes of this ledition have the same detailed commentary, the fifteen books of the Praeparatio will not be finished in less than half a dozen volumes. But the commentary justifies its length by offering helpful discussions of Eusebius' often slippery grammar and style, and above all an important interpreta- tion of Eusebius' achievement as an apologist. The Divinity School, Vanderbilt University EUGENE TESELLE The Byzantines and Their World. By PETER ARNOTT. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1973. xi + 286 pp. $8.95. Mr. Arnott, who is professor of Dramatic Arts at Tufts University and who has already produced books on the Greeks and the Romans, writes "to give a taste of things" (p. ix). The dust jacket makes a more ambitious claim for the book, calling it "a social history of the period from the foundation of the Eastern Empire in the 4th century A.D. to the fall of Constantinople." We had best judge the author's accomplishment against his own stated purpose, for the book lacks at least two elements of sound social history: a governing idea according to which the cha- otic information available for a particular society is sorted out and organized, and a theory of the relations between thought and action, religion and society. Arnott's ready eye and ear for the dramatic unquestionably lends a live- liness to the telling of familiar stories. Moreover, by frequent and illuminating typological sweeps from antiquity through Byzantium to the present he not only alerts us to familiar analogies with unfamiliar situations, but also reflects some- thing of the Byzantine's own characteristic sense of time-collapsing tradition. And he can transform the eccentricities of the voyager and yarn-spinner Cosmas Indicopleustes (pp. 145-152) into a cosmography of the Byzantine mind. Sketches of life in Constantinople, Rome, Ravenna and Thessaloniki are well-differentiated, illustrating the variety of urban life in the Empire. Still, one can suspect that the "taste of things" Arnott has served up is more spice than meat. Anecdotal history written by the non-specialist is certain- ly a respectable genrie of literature, and can occasionally be "truer" than the more myopic productions of the expert. But Byzantium jealously exacts from those who would understand and explain her a kind of patient commitment to intricate detail to which Arnott makes no pretensions. There is a rhetorical integrity to his presentation, but he is, necessarily, eclectically dependent on several mod- ern writers, none of whom is acknowledged. The absence of a bibliography, even for the sources cited very sketchily in the footnotes, is a serious flaw. There are some careless errors of fact and judgment; for example, Julian is put in the fifth century (p. 11); there was "no sense that the Bishop of Rome enjoyed superior status" even as late as the beginning of the fourth century (p. 37); the pagan his- torian Ammianus Marcellinus is called "a good Christian" (p. 63); a hundred of the 137 corpses in the Basilica of Sicininus (not Sicinius) following the Damasus- Ursinus riots disappear (p. 63); 1054 is trotted out yet again as the point in time at which the rift between East and West was at its widest (p. 184). Much more damaging for anyone who wants to comprehend Byzantine so- ciety, and especially for readers of this journal, is the author's Protestant (see p. xi) prejudice against theology. As Arnott insists at the beginning, there was more to Byzantium than religion, and there was more to religion than theology. But it is not true that "we think of the Byzantines as obsessed with religion be- 532</page><page sequence="2">cause there is nothing left to look at but their churches" (p. viii). They were, as a society, self-consciously Christian and theologically preoccupied to a degree per- haps unmatched in Christian history, and the time is long past for Gibbonian dis- missals of the Iconoclastic controversy, for example, as a "long and pointless squabble" (p. 184). Arnott claims to be "fascinated by saints" (p. ix). True fascination must surely extend to a genuinely historical distinction between squab- bles that are pointless in themselves and those whose point, if not readily apparent to our enlightened sensibilities, was a matter of life and death to the saints. Swarthmore College PATRICK HENRY A History of the Diocese of Cork from the Earliest Times to the Reformation. By EVELYN BOLSTER (SISTER MARY ANGELA). New York: Barnes and Noble, 1972. 48 + 548 pp. This substantial book bears a foreword by the Most Reverend Cornelius Lu- cey, Bishop of Cork and Ross, to whom it is dedicated and whose picture forms the frontispiece. As the bishop indicates and as the author explains in her "Acknowl- edgements", the book owes much to the researches of Canon Patrick Cahalane, who died in 1965. But clearly a great amount of independent work has been donle by Sister Angela, who makes the book her own in a masterly use of a wide range of source documents in Latin and Gaelic. A nun of the Sisters of Mercy, she holds a doctorate from the National University of Ireland. The diocese of Cork is spread over southern Ireland from Cork harbour to Bantry Bay, with the small diocese of Ross occupying a patch along part of the south coast. Our author threads her way through records bearing on the early tribes and families of the region as well as the legends of numerous early saints. Amnnng the latter, chief prominence is given to St. Finbarr (Bairre or Barr), the founding bishop of Cork (d. 623). Somewhat hampered by "imaginative hagiography gone wild", Sister Angela establishes some facts and probabilities of his life story. The church of Cork was founded (606) in the period of the eclipse of the episcopate and transition to mo- nastic control in the churches of Ireland, a change which she associates with "the grafting of the new shoot of Christianity on to the older strain of Celtic pagan so- ciety." Actually the successors of Finbarr were not designated bishops until 875. As elsewhere in Ireland, the ascendancy of monks was mairtained until the twelfth century when a series of national synods ending with that of Kells (1152) established a system of episcopal government. But for a long period after the An- glo-Norman invasion (1169) appointments and policies were subject to the will of the kings of England exercised with the pope's approval but with little direct papal intervention. Freshly informing is the chapter on "Early Post-Norman Religious Founda- tions" where Hospitallers, Templars and Cistercians arle chiefly treated. Later we come to the multiple activities of Dominican and Franciscan friars and to the "Ob- servant Reform" of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The Observant move- ment was first promoted among the Augustinian Hermits, but deeply affected the earlier friar houses. Whereas the friars came to Ireland originally from England, the Irish Observants of different orders were under continental and largely Italian influence and had most success in Gaelic-speaking parts of the country. At the be- ginning of the Reformation the very numerous Franciscan preachers were in full activity and in the view of the author and a quoted authority were effective de- fenders of "the Catholic faith." This review cannot be extended to deal with the complicated story of diocesan and parish administration, all of which is searched out in detail; ror can we bring to notice the many noteworthy personalities-bishops, priests, monks and laymen- here presented and described. For human interest in this context we may men- tion the Blessed Thaddeus MacCarthy who, returning from a successful plea before Pope Innocent VIII at Rome, died at Ivrea nlear Aosta (1492) in circum- BOOK REVIE`WS 533</page></plain_text>
