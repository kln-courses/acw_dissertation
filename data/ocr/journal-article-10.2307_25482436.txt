<plain_text><page sequence="1">STEPHENNIE MULDER THE MAUSOLEUM OF IMAM AL-SHAFICI This blessed cenotaph was made for the Imam (al-Sha fici)...by cUbayd the carpenter, known as Ibn Ma'ali, in the months of the year five hundred seventy-four. May God have mercy on him; may he [also] have mercy on those who are merciful toward him, those who call for mercy upon him, and upon all who worked with him?the woodworkers and carvers?and all the believers. ?Inscription on the teak cenotaph at the grave of Imam al-Shafici For at least ten centuries, in a city replete with holy sites, the mausoleum of Imam al-Shafici (d. AD 820) has been perhaps the most beloved and popular of Cairene shrines. Like the humble woodworker Ibn Macali, whose entreaty for himself and his fellow car penters has sealed the scholar's grave since the end of the twelfth century, pious visitors have continuously gathered at this site to pray and petition the saint's intervention. Crowds of supplicants still press against its iron grille each Friday to deposit small tokens, requests, and letters; to sit and read in the cool darkness of the tomb under its high dome; and to visit with friends and family, pray, and receive the saint's baraka (bless ing). The mausoleum is a solemn and moving space, sobering in its hushed vastness, a beloved center for the popular religious life of the city. Two buildings have stood at this site, located in the Qarafa al-Sughra cemetery south of Cairo (fig. 1). The first was built by the Ayyubid Sultan Salah al Din (known in the West as Saladin) in 1180. The sec ond?the extant building?was endowed by his suc cessor, al-Malik al-Kamil, in 1211 (figs. 2 and 3). Only three physical elements remain from Saladin's con struction: a marble column at the head of the grave,1 the teak cenotaph mentioned above, and the founda tion inscription, now in the Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo.2 Although the original construction is gone, the mausoleum, expanded by al-Malik al-Kamil, remains the largest freestanding mortuary chamber in Egypt, its dome only slightly smaller than that of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.3 Despite the limited physical evidence for Saladin's building, medieval travelers' accounts, topographical works, and chronicles provide considerable primary evidence about its foundation, constitution, and struc ture. We know, for example, that it was the first build ing Saladin completed after the fall of the Fatimids in Cairo.4 We also know that adjacent to the mauso leum Saladin built a massive complex that included a magnificent madrasa for the study of Islamic sciences. Based on these facts, it is often assumed that this build ing embodied the Ayyubid ambition of ihya al-sunna, the reinvigoration of Sunni orthodoxy, following two centuries of Shiite Fatimid rule, and that al-Shafici's mausoleum thus played an important symbolic role in the revival of Sunnism in Egypt. But the story of how and why this pious complex was created and the pos sible reasons for its expansion just thirty years later under al-Malik al-Kamil are complicated and intrigu ing. Although the restoration of Sunnism could have been part of what motivated the construction of a madrasa at the grave of this important Sunni jurist, a statement against Shiism does not seem to have been the primary incentive for either Saladin's building or that of al-Malik al-Kamil. Indeed, a close examination of the history, inscriptions, and decorative programs of these buildings suggests no direct evidence that the mausoleum at the grave of Imam al-Shafici was part of an effort to combat Shiism. Rather, if we can dis cern any ideological focus to the construction of the mausoleum, it appears instead to have been a bitter intra-Sunni conflict, one between Shaffi Asharites and their rivals, the Hanbalis. In addition to its ideological significance, there are at least two reasons the Shaffi complex is impor tant for our broader understanding of the architec ture of medieval popular piety: First, its initial con struction by Saladin instigated the creation of a new ritual center by sparking a general shift northward in cemetery construction.

Second, following al-Malik al-Kamil's intervention in 1211, al-Shafici's mausoleum was crowned by one of the largest domes in the Islamic world, an issue that is perhaps also connected with the movement of the cemetery northward. Why was there a need to build such a large dome? What was it about the city of Cairo, or the grave of this scholar, that required monumentalization to such a degree? Was it merely the prestige of al-ShafTi, or was this building meant to make a statement with more com plex associations? The evidence suggests that al-Kamil's monumental reconstruction was principally intended to provide a dynastic mausoleum for himself and his family. If so, it was probably concerned only sec ondarily, if at all, with doctrinal matters. Indeed, its architecture and decoration seem to express little in the way of universal ideology, for as we shall see, al Kamil's building is first and foremost a testimony to the strength and tenacity of local style in Ayyubid Cairo. Given the reputation of the mausoleum as a symbol of Sunni revival in Egypt, however, the pres ence or absence of any sectarian semiotic charge is significant for our understanding of the building itself, its history, and its historiography, and also for our knowledge of sectarian and interconfessional con flict in this period. ARGUMENTS FOR A SEMIOTICS OF ISLAMIC ORNAMENT In the past two decades, the field of Islamic art history has seen the publication of several studies presenting semiotic interpretations of architectural forms. These studies argue for political or ideological interpreta tions of the meaning of Islamic sacred space and its ornament, and are focused primarily on Syria and Egypt from the tenth through the twelfth century?a pivotal period during which the Islamic world was divided politically between two competing caliphates, the Fatimid Isma ill Shiites in Egypt and the Sunni Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad. The Abbasid cause was subsequently strengthened under the Seljuqs, Zangids, and Ayyubids. This political division was also an ideological one, and the period is often described as one in which Sunnism, threatened by the appearance of a powerful Shici dynasty on its western front, formulated a clearly defined, state-sponsored program of doctrinal coun terpropaganda, with the aim of strengthening Sunni orthodoxy.5 For the arts, the implications of this pro gram may have been far-reaching: one recent author asserts that it was "the primary motivating force behind many of the cultural and artistic changes of the elev enth and twelfth centuries."6 According to this argument, the main tool of this anti-Shiite program, usually termed the "Sunni revival," was the sponsorship of the madrasa for the teaching of Sunni legal theory. Building on this claim, recent research argues that certain forms, such as cursive writ ing, muqarnas (stalactite vaulting), and some types of vegetal or geometric decoration may have been con sciously exploited by eleventh- and twelfth-century Sunni partisans as potent carriers of symbolic?specif ically Sunni?meaning.7 Other research suggests that the appearance and spread of these forms, which par ticularly proliferated in areas ruled by Sunni dynasties acknowledging the suzerainty of the Abbasid caliphs, may be interpreted as visual expressions of allegiance to the Abbasid capital at Baghdad.8 Some have further interpreted this phenomenon as an organized response to an even more overtly propagandistic visual agenda formulated by the Fatimids, who, it is proposed, had exploited symbols of Ismacili esoteric doctrine and the Shici practice of the visitation of tombs to pub licly proclaim the dynasty's Shiite allegiance.9 Politi cally speaking, the ultimate victors in this struggle were the Sunnis, and the sweetest moment of that victory is traditionally reserved for Saladin, who defeated the Fatimids in 1171. As noted above, following this suc cess, the first architectural project that Saladin com pleted was the mausoleum and madrasa at the grave of al-Shafici. In view of the assumptions that have been made about this building and its meaning, it is notable that, subsequent to K. A. C. Creswell's architectural survey of some forty years ago, there has never been a careful study of the building itself.10 Considering the importance of its interpretation in the historio graphy of Ayyubid architecture, and its centrality in the world of medieval popular piety?for, as noted above, it was and remains among the most beloved of Cairene shrines?such a study seems overdue.11 As we shall see, the ShafYi complex provides an oppor tunity to investigate the evolution of popular practice in Egypt and to explore many of the recent semiotic arguments about the political and ideological use of the sacred.</page><page sequence="6">20 STEPHENNIE MULDER THE SALAHIYYA MADRASA AT THE GRAVE OF AL-SHAFICI In the year 1178, the carpenter cUbayd b. Macali com pleted work on his extraordinary teak cenotaph.12 Commissioned by Saladin, it is still considered a mas terpiece of medieval woodcarving, an exquisite and fitting tribute to adorn the mausoleum of the revered Sunni jurisprudent.13 In its original form, however, al-Shafici's mausoleum was only one part of a larger complex focused on a madrasa and attendant struc tures. This college, known as the Salahiyya Madrasa, became the most prestigious in Egypt during the Ayyubid period.14 In addition to its size, two features assured that prestige: its location at the grave of al ShafTi, and the extraordinary salary that was endowed for its rather singular professor, a pious and ascetic sheik named Najm al-Din al-Khabushani.15 But al-ShafTi's grave was a potent holy site long before the arrival of the Ayyubids. Indeed, it had even been an object of pilgrimage for some Shiites.16 Though we know little about the appearance of pre vious structures on the site, by the time Saladin con structed the Salahiyya complex there, the grave of al-Shafici was already established within the sacred landscape of the cemetery as an important locus of blessed emanations, or baraka. Numerous stories are told of the people's love for the grave. In the elev enth century, when building the Nizamiyya madrasa in Baghdad, the Seljuq vizier Nizam al-Mulk had wanted to transfer al-Shafici's bones to Baghdad to be rein terred as the centerpiece of his new school. He wrote to the Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali, who was willing to grant his request. When the vizier went to the grave to begin the exhumation, however, there was an imme diate demonstration of protest from the population of Cairo, which got a bit out of hand and culminated in the assembled crowd throwing rocks at the vizier. The uprising was brought under control, and the vizier proceeded to exhume the bones, but as soon as the workmen began to remove the bricks (libn) around the grave, there arose an intoxicating perfume that immediately drove everyone mad. This seems to have been quite enough for the workmen, who refused to continue, citing the perils of flouting divine interven tion. The Imam's bones stayed put. Nizam al-Mulk, for his part, far from being displeased that his wishes had not been fulfilled, was so astonished by the miracle that he decreed an official account of it be read in all the mosques of the Seljuq lands. The event undoubt edly increased the prestige of al-Shafici's grave.17 According to Ibn al-Zayyat, when al-Shafici died and was buried in 820, the area was the family plot of the historian Ibn cAbd al-Hakam. Thus the con struction of the Salahiyya complex there at the end of the twelfth century involved the relocation of many tombs. Their occupants' bones were reinterred in the Maqbarat al-cAyna' when Saladin built the madrasa.18 Ibn Taghribirdi provides contrary evidence, and writes that the area was an open courtyard before Saladin began construction.19 In either case, the building of the mausoleum and madrasa was an impressive under taking, begun around 1176-77.20 Given the Ayyubids' tendency to favor the ShafYi school, and considering the affection of the people of Cairo for the grave of the Imam, Saladin's decision to build the Madrasa al Salahiyya there seems an obvious choice. The earliest Arabic source to describe the madrasa complex was the Spanish pilgrim Ibn Jubayr, who visited it in 1182-83, shortly after its dedication. He writes: The mashhad (shrine) of Imam al-Shafici?may God be pleased with him?is among the most magnificent, cel ebrated, and expansive that there is. Facing it (bi-izaihi) was built a madrasa the like of which has never been constructed in this country, there being nothing more spacious or more lavishly built. He who walks around it will believe that it is a separate town (annuhd baladun mustaqillun bi-dhdtihi). Facing it (bi-izaiha) are a bath and other fine public facilities. Construction continues to this very hour, and the expenditure on it is measureless. The shaykh, imam, ascetic, and man of learning called Najm al-Din al-Khabushani is personally responsible for it. The sultan of these lands, Salah al-Din, generously pays for all of this, saying: "Increase in splendor and elegance; we shall provide for all." Glory to Him who made him "salah dinihi," like his name."21 From this text, we learn several things about the physi cal constitution of the buildings. First, the madrasa complex was of extremely large size. Ibn Jubayr's assertion that it resembled a separate town, though likely an exaggeration, still leaves little doubt about the foundation's impression on its contemporaries. It seems that Saladin spared no expense in ensuring that his madrasa would be among the finest Egypt had ever seen. Furthermore, the use of prepositions such as izaa indicate that the tomb and the madrasa were very close or even attached to each other, and there could well have been direct communication</page><page sequence="7">THE MAUSOLEUM OF IMAM AL-SHAFICI 21 2-^r , n -\&gt; %1 Muhammad 1 -' I ^**-^r rf^sT3* 59X\N r^^ Atjd al-Hakam, Sultan al-Kamil '^^sS* A\ T I===4 L The mother of ^ ,\ .. ! |fa^ |f Sultaq al-Kamil u, i \ :; ' M Imam #V *?.] V ^_(J j ash-Shafi'i Mosque J?f^ I \ss??L_* ' ! _&lt;? 130911(1891/2) |||| I TT W v\\;J sov.-cs^'.o ; ; .: : : '; ? yM ': : Bakrtya Mausoleum Fig. 4. Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafici, plan. (After K. A. C. Creswell, Muslim Architecture of Egypt, vol. 2, fig. 30) between them. This supposition is strengthened by the fact that the original entrance to the mausoleum on the northwestern side (today a window) is on an axis that does not correspond to that of the central mihrab (fig. 4) ,22 Rather, the entrance is somewhat unusually situated to the left of center, such that it corresponds directly with al-Shafici's cenotaph. It is a modest entrance for such an imposing structure, a small door with a wooden lintel bearing an inscrip tion so worn it is now unreadable. Such an entrance makes sense if al-Kamil, in the process of expand ing the mausoleum, were attaching it to the already extant madrasa of Saladin. It thus seems likely that the college was originally on the northwestern side, in direct communication with the tomb. If so, the Imam's cenotaph would have been visible to one facing the qibla wall of the adjoining madrasa. Ibn Jubayr's description is augmented by a later one from al-Maqrizi, who adds that in addition to the baths, the complex was provided with an oven oppo site the madrasa that produced sixty rath of bread a day?enough, according to one estimate,23 to feed at least a hundred students?and a large number of shops attached to the building. Income was provided</page><page sequence="8">22 STEPHENNIE MULDER from the shops and from the cultivation of an island in the Nile. Al-Maqrizi also tells us that in addition to the professor, the endowment provided for the sup port of ten muids, or teaching assistants.24 It seems a reasonable guess that this madrasa was large enough to accommodate between 100 and 150 residents. Furthermore, the location of Saladin's project would only have accentuated its already considerable size, for in the late twelfth century this area of the cemetery was relatively empty?not yet the "great medium of divine blessing," in the words of Ibn Battuta,25 a veri table city of the dead that to this day plays a rich role in the lives of the inhabitants of Cairo. Although the Fatimids had built extensively in the Qarafa al-Kubra to the south, when the Shafici complex was built, that cemetery, as well as much of Fustat, still lay in ruins after being intentionally burned by the Fati mids in 1168.26 Thus, the domes of Saladin's founda tion would have been the most visible markers on Cai ro's southern horizon; indeed they are likely to have been the only ones. This supposition is bolstered by the fact that the construction soon attracted other buildings, instigat ing a northern shift in the development of the ceme tery, away from the older Qarafa al-Kubra and toward what now became known as the Qarafa al-Sughra. This movement echoed the migration of the general population from Fustat to Cairo proper.27 This shift in construction indicates that the focus of building activity was, at least for a time, not on the repair and restoration of ruined buildings in the old cemetery but rather on new construction in the northerly area. Indeed, al-Maqrizi confirms that the development of the new quarter proceeded in tandem with the decline of the older cemetery area.28 Al-Maqrizi further records that the area between the tomb of Imam al-Shafici and the Bab al-Qarafa below the Citadel was, at the time of the building of Saladin's complex, the location of a spacious maydan, or hippodrome. This open area existed well into the fourteenth century when, during the third reign of al-Nasir Muhammad b. Qalawun (r. 1309-40), it was extensively built up, apparently for the first time.29 Thus, when the ShafTi complex was built, the view of the mausoleum and madrasa from the city of Cairo would have been wholly unimpeded by other construc tion, and its situation would have remained so for at least the first 125 years of its existence. This careful attention to the siting and location of the madrasa, and later to the mausoleum of al-Kamil, is significant for our understanding of the visual effect intended by the patrons of these buildings. Most par ticularly, they may have considered the view from the Citadel; perhaps, on a clear day, Saladin could have seen the crowds of legal students and pious suppli cants from its walls. Furthermore, unlike his predeces sor Saladin, al-Kamil actually took up residence in the Citadel in 1207. Four years later, in 1211, he decided to expand the mausoleum.30 When it was completed, with nothing but a wide mayddn between the Citadel and the madrasa complex, the image of the soaring dome on the horizon must indeed have been inspir ing (fig. 5). THE SHEIKH AL-KHABUSHANI AND INTRA SUNNI COMPETITION IN MEDIEVAL CAIRO There is evidence to suggest, however, that Saladin was not the primary force behind the remarkable nature of the appearance, size, and location of the madrasa. Returning to Ibn Jubayr's account, we find that his description of the madrasa is followed by mention of the executor of the funds of the foundation, the ascetic shaykh Najm al-Din al-Khabushani. It is also here, in the biography of this shaykh, that we may first begin to discern a possible ideological motivation behind the building of the expansive madrasa. Al-Khabushani, who according to Ibn al-Zayyat was buried "under the feet of Imam al-Shafici,"31 was a well known scourge of religious innovation, and he par ticularly targeted the Hanbalis. Ibn Jubayr certainly knew who al-Khabushani was and eagerly called on him after visiting the new madrasa, "to be blessed by his prayers, for we had heard of him in Andalusia. We found him at his mosque in Cairo, in the closet in which he lives...and what a narrow closet it is! He prayed for us and we departed. Of all the men in Egypt, we saw no one else like him."32 Indeed, Ibn Jubayr probably hadn't seen the likes of him anywhere, for the shaykh was apparently a singular character, with a reputation as an arrogant, stubborn, and pugnacious enforcer of piety. It seems likely that the instigation for the building of the complex was al Khabushani's own, and that Saladin merely provided the funds.33 The strongest evidence for this assertion is in the foundation inscription for the madrasa itself. It reads: This madrasa was built at the urging (bi-istiddc) of the shaykh, jurisprudent, imam... [and] ascetic Najm al-Din,</page><page sequence="9">THE MAUSOLEUM OF IMAM AL-SHAFICI 23 ^Itlf^if^S^^^^i"^ ^%i /" ^,i^H ^ ^" -***V ' ^ ^ ' ^ * " mmmmmmmmmml yi^W - ^ \ ^ ^"r^" : mmmmmmmmmml Fig. 5.

This is in vivid contrast to virtually every other foundation inscription by Saladin, and indeed completely goes against what was by then the well established Zangid and Ayyubid practice of embla zoning founders' names, and their seemingly ever more elaborate titles, on the exteriors of buildings. Here, the only person ostensibly to be credited for building the madrasa and mausoleum is the shaykh al-Khabushani, and we are specifically informed that it was built at his urging (bi-istida al-shaykh), presumably meaning his urging of Saladin. This vague implication is the closest one may come to understanding that someone besides al-Khabushani himself was behind the creation of the complex, and indeed, if not for the textual sources, we would likely have no clue as to the identity of its actual patron. Other sources confirm that it was certainly within the power of the shaykh to instigate such a project. Not only had he pressed Saladin to build the madrasa next to the grave of al-Shafici, but he had also issued a legal opinion sanctioning the execution of the last</page><page sequence="10">24 STEPHENNIE MULDER Fatimid caliph (who passed away before such action became necessary) and the pronouncement the khutba, the Friday sermon, in the name of the Abbasid caliph.35 Saladin apparently hesitated in enforcing this, and according to some sources al-Khabushani of his own volition ascended the minbar and, threatening the preacher with his cane, ordered him to pronounce the sanctioned khutba.36 Al-Khabushani was a bold and colorful figure who seems to have had a strong influence over the sultan. Many anecdotes told about the shaykh illustrate the respect Saladin had for him, and the extraordinary license he was allowed. One day, when Saladin was preparing for battle, al-Khabushani went out to wish him off and used the opportunity to ask the sultan to abolish some taxes he felt were unjust. When Saladin refused, the shaykh became enraged and, disregard ing all propriety, began to beat the illustrious sultan violently on the head, shouting, "May God not grant you victory!" and causing his headgear (qalansuwa) to fall to the ground. Shocked and speechless, Saladin left for the battle, in which he was defeated. Upon his return, he rushed straightaway to al-Khabushani and kissed his hand, begging for forgiveness, for "he knew it had been because of [al-Khabushani's] curse" that he had lost.37 Who was this powerful shaykh, who clearly had both the ear and the purse strings of the sultan? We will focus here on one aspect of his biography, his strict devotion to ShafVi Asharite theology and his conse quent blind hatred of the Hanbalis. The main aspects of the debate between the Sunni legal schools revolved around a number of key doctrinal questions, includ ing the createdness of the Qur'an and the nature of divinity. The traditionalist Hanbalis advocated a strictly literal reading of the Qur'an; to use the most famous example, they held such Qur'anic imagery as the "Throne of God" to entail that because God could sit on a throne He must therefore have cor poreal form. For the Asharites, this literalism was the basest of heresy. Asharism?integrated with the ShafVi school by al-Ghazali in the eleventh century? represented the compromise between the traditional ist view on one hand and the radically rationalizing tendencies of groups such as the Muctazila on the other. For the Shafici Asharites, the overly literal read ings of many traditionalist Hanbalis could only lead to bidca, or innovation, particularly the bidca of giv ing God attributes, which was to their way of thinking tantamount to anthropomorphism (tashbih). Asharism proposed a middle ground, adopting some aspects of Muctazilite rationalism, particularly the use of kalam, or rational argument, but also introducing the con cept that some theological points could not be fully understood by humans and must be accepted bi-la kayf, without speculation.38 Thus, because of the Han bali insistence on only the most literal readings, the Asharites branded them the worst sort of innovators: "anthropomorphists." These debates were not merely academic, for there exists more than one report about bloody riots in the streets of Cairo over theological issues.39 These were so disruptive that Saladin's successor, al-cAziz, went so far as to try to have the small but troublesome Hanbali community of Cairo expelled.40 The roots and orga nization of such factional discord, sometimes called casabiyya*1 or simply fitna in the Arabic sources, are not clearly understood. For Baghdad we have a fairly complex picture, but for other cities the phenomenon is only beginning to be explored.42 We do know that such conflict was limited temporally and spatially: it appeared sometime toward the end of the tenth cen tury in the eastern Islamic lands and never seems to have spread beyond Egypt into North Africa. By the Ottoman period, it had all but died out.43 Within these four to five hundred years, however, intra-Sunni confessional discord was a profound force shaping Islamic society and urban life?a force at least as powerful and perhaps even more immediately dis ruptive than the schism between Sunnism and Shiism; given the weakness of the later Fatimids, the Sunni-Shici conflict had perhaps ceased to be a true threat even before Saladin quietly put the Shiite dynasty to rest at the end of the twelfth century. Indeed, most cities accommodated at least two warring Sunni factions.44 As Richard Bulliet has demonstrated for Nishapur, such violent differences had the potential to rend the fabric of society, at times devolving into outright intra-urban war. In Nishapur, this strife escalated throughout the eleventh century, ultimately leading to the destruction and abandonment of the city.45 Similarly, when a large population fleeing the Crusaders and Mongols entered Damascus in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a series oifitnas erupted between these mostly Hanbali refugees and resident ShafYi elites over theological issues.46 The schism could also take a more subtle but no less pointed form: in thirteenth-century Damas cus, for example, a ShafYi founded a madrasa with a waqf that specified that "no Jew, Christian, Magian, or Hanbali" could enter, a juxtaposition implying an</page><page sequence="11">THE MAUSOLEUM OF IMAM AL-SHAFICI 25 animosity so great that the ShafTis hardly considered the Hanbalis to be Muslim.47 Further, this internal Sunni conflict was an essen tial feature not only of medieval urban life but also of the Sunni revival, which was concerned as much with eliminating erroneous Sunni confessional adher ences as with responding to the threat posed by the Shici Fatimids. Thus Makdisi repeatedly insists that the Sunni revival was "not merely a Sunni revival, but a Traditionalist Sunni Revival...a religious revival in which the forces of Traditionalism fought against the forces of Rationalism of all shades," including Ashcarism. Indeed, the most famed document of the Sunni revival, the risdla al-qadiriyya, or Qadiri Creed, was not directed against the Shfa alone but was "anti Shici, anti-Muctazili, and anti-Ashcari."48 Issued in 1018 by the Abbasid caliph al-Qadir bi'llah (r. 991-1031), the creed was a profession of faith that defined official Abbasid doctrine. Inspired by Hanbali ideas, it con demned all forms of Shiism but also, as noted above, took aim at Muctazilism and Ashcarism, doctrines that had been embraced by certain Sunnis and that were now unambiguously placed outside the realm of "offi cial" Sunnism. The Qadiri Creed, Makdisi writes, "was a Sunni creed, because it opposed Shici doctrines; but it also opposed rationalist Muctazili and Ashcari doc trines; and for this it may rightly be called a Tradi tionalist creed, and the religious triumph it symbol ized, a Traditionalist triumph."49 Thus we see that from its inception, the revival was concerned with the ref ormation of Sunnism as much as the condemnation of Shiism.50 This official stance undoubtedly encour aged intra-Sunni competition, and as it evolved, the revival indeed became a complex and much-contested phenomenon. The Asharite shaykh al-Khabushani certainly did his part in opposing the "anthropomorphist" Hanbali traditionalists. One of his exploits took place before the building of the Salahiyya complex. A few years before al-Khabushani's arrival in Cairo, a certain Ibn al-Kizani, a scholar infamous among the Ashcarites for his alleged anthropomorphism, died and was buried next to al-Shafici. When al-Khabushani arrived and heard of this, he was enraged. Unable to contain him self, he went to the grave, dug up the unfortunate Ibn al-Kizani, and, while flinging his bones in all direc tions, shouted, "a siddiq [righteous man] and a zindiq [heretic] should not be [buried] in the same place!" The Hanbalis immediately "attacked [al-Khabushani] and rallied against him, and there occurred between them warlike attacks and riots,"51 i.e., they promul gated difitna. Clearly, al-Khabushani had a close rela tionship to Saladin not only as a legal and doctrinal advisor but also as a scholar with a very particular anti-Hanbali ideological agenda, which he wasted no opportunity to demonstrate. Thus it would seem that these preferences put him at the center of the intra confessional conflict that plagued Cairo in the late twelfth century. With this in mind, we return to the building's foun dation inscription, the text of which, as mentioned above, credits only al-Khabushani for the construc tion. There is another notable aspect of this inscrip tion: it makes no mention of the relation between Sunnism and Shiism, and in fact its only reference to doctrinal orientation is a clear declaration of alle giance to Asharite theology. But a closer reading reveals its message to have been even more pointed, for the word used to describe the group to which the Asharites were opposed, al-hashtviyya, translated liter ally above as "vain reasoners," actually had a deeper meaning. Al-hashwiyya was an insult with specific con notations; it was commonly used by medieval polemi cists as a nasty epithet for the Hanbalis. As stated in the Encyclopaedia of Islam entry on the term, it was "used by some Sunnis of extremist traditionists...[and] in a narrower sense, of the Ashctb al-Hadith who, uncrit ically and even prompted by prejudice, recognize as genuine and interpret literally the crudely anthropo morphic traditions."52 Given that the Ismacili Fatimids were about as removed as a theological school could be from the literal interpretation of God's word, it is impossible that the term referred to them. Here, in this most important of documents from the original building, is strong evidence that if Saladin's founda tion had a doctrinal component, it had little to do with any statement against Shiism, and was instead appar ently focused on the intra-Sunni conflict between the Hanbalis and the Asharites.53 The specificity of the message in the foundation inscription of the madrasa can be appreciated more fully when it is compared with Saladin's inscription on the western portal of the Citadel, under construc tion at precisely the same time as the Salahiyya com plex. This reads: The foundation of this brilliant citadel, next to the well guarded city of Cairo, was ordained in accordance with the resolution that unites utility with beauty and [as] the space for protection for [those] who would take refuge in the shadow of his kingdom, by our lord al-Malik al</page><page sequence="12">26 STEPHENNIE MULDER Nasir Salah al-Dunya wa-l-Din.. .Yusuf Ibn Ayyub, the reviver of the empire of the Commander of the Faithful (muhyi dawlat amir al-muminin), under the direction of his brother and heir apparent al-Malik al-Adil...54 This is the sort of foundation inscription one might expect to find on the exterior of a madrasa designed to proclaim Sunni identity in the face of Shiism. It names the founder Saladin as the reviver of the sphere of Sunni authority by making explicit reference to the "Commander of the Faithful," the Caliph in Baghdad. Furthermore, as Nasser Rabbat has argued, its use of the title muhyi dawlat amir al-muminin had no prec edents, although it would appear as a feature of many of Saladin's later inscriptions.55 The deliberate use of the word muhyi is perhaps significant, considering Saladin's reputation as a leader particularly commit ted to the ihya , or revival, of the faith. The Citadel inscription is a proclamation of the triumph of Saladin as a Sunni ruler, emphasizing reunification and revital ization of Sunni political authority after a prolonged period of Fatimid rule. Clearly, had it been Saladin's intention to promulgate such a message through the foundation of the madrasa at the grave of al-Shafici, the means and ideological language were available. The issue then becomes why he did not do so. MADRASAS IN EGYPT DURING THE FATIMID PERIOD So far we have seen that the evidence of the founda tion inscription for the Salahiyya Madrasa, against the backdrop of conflict between various Sunni groups in medieval cities throughout the Islamic lands, compli cates the assumption that the complex was conceived primarily as an ideological instrument against Shiism. But to what degree may we say that the particularities of this building are representative of a wider phe nomenon? George Makdisi argued almost forty years ago that the madrasa in general was not to be seen primarily as a tool of Sunni revival.56 In the 1970s one of Makdisi's students, Gary Leiser, surveyed the first 150 years of madrasa construction in Egypt, finding that the first madrasa in Cairo was built in 1096-97, long before Saladin arrived there in the late twelfth century.57 Leiser concluded that the foundation of religious institutions such as the madrasa had more to do with the consolidation of Sunnism than the elimina tion of Shiism. His conclusions have been reiterated recently in the new Cambridge History of Egypt, where Michael Chamberlain argues, The Ayyubids were undoubtedly attached to Sunni Islam and exerted themselves to see it flourish. However, the relationship between this general commitment and their patronage of religious institutions is more intricate than the notion of Sunni revival can account for.. .insofar as we can discern an ideological objective in Ayyubid religious policy, it seems to have been directed at Sunnis as much as Shicis...There is little evidence that the foundation of madrasas was an anti-Fatimid policy, or that Sunnism, the religious affiliation of the majority of the Muslim population, required new institutions to flourish on the levels of belief or communal identity. Madrasas existed in Egypt well before Salah al-Din, some sponsored by Fatimid wazirs.58 Indeed, it seems that the first madrasa in Egypt was founded sometime around 1096 by an Andalusian immigrant, a Maliki faqih (jurisprudent) named Abu Bakr Muhammad al-Turtushi.59 This scholar traveled extensively after leaving his native country in 1083, eventually making his way to Baghdad, where he came within the orbit of the great Seljuq vizier Nizam al Mulk. He was greatly impressed with the educational and religious facilities the vizier had constructed in Baghdad, reserving special admiration for the Niza miyya. After spending some years studying in the city, al-Turtushi traveled to Syria, from which he set sail for Alexandria, arriving around 1096. The people of the city were greatly taken with him and encouraged him to settle in Alexandria permanently. He acqui esced, and shortly thereafter met a pious and affluent woman whom he married. He converted her large, two-story house into the first recorded madrasa in Egypt, using the upstairs as the living quarters and the lower floor with its large reception hall (qaa) to teach fiqh and Hadith.60 At least some students were lodged there, and the income from al-Turtushi's wife provided for the maintenance of the building. The number of stu dents may have been rather large; one account says that when al-Turtushi went for walks, during which he often discoursed on legal matters, he was some times accompanied by hundreds of students.61 His fame and stature grew, and during his nearly thirty years there, many luminaries studied with him. Al-Tur tushi's foundation, though not purpose-built, meets the basic requirements for a madrasa: an indepen dent Sunni residential college supported by private funds, with a live-in professor oi fiqh. It seems likely</page><page sequence="13">THE MAUSOLEUM OF IMAM AL-SHAFICI 27 that many early madrasas were of this somewhat infor mal character. Following this precedent, and perhaps in reaction to the adherents that this Spaniard?with whom he had a longstanding quarrel?had attracted in his city, the Maliki qadi of Alexandria, Ahmad b. cAbd al-Majid b. Hadid, erected the first purpose-built madrasa, also at the end of the eleventh century. It was still in exis tence in the thirteenth century, and is therefore likely to have been endowed.62 Ibn Hadid's title, Makin al Dawla, granted to him by the Fatimid caliph, gave the madrasa its name, the Makiniyya. At about the same time, a third madrasa, cited by al-Safadi in his biog raphy of a student who studied there, was founded by Abu '1-Husayn Yahya b. al-Mufarrij al-Maqdisi, the ShafTi qadi in Alexandria. As his name implies, al-Maq disi was an immigrant from Jerusalem, and he estab lished a college for the Shaficis that seems to have been transitory but probably helped to prepare the way for future Shaffi madrasas in Egypt.63 There is little infor mation about the physical form of these two schools, but their founders' stature as judges appointed by the Fatimid caliph suggests they may have been reason ably significant architecturally. The fourth madrasa, however, had inarguable pres ence. It was founded in Alexandria in 1137-38 by a Sunni Fatimid vizier, Ridwan b. al-Walakhshi, who expended considerable energy in strengthening his ties to the Sunni community; this may have been his moti vation for constructing a madrasa. The first, though not the last, Fatimid vizier to establish a madrasa, al-Walakhshi was by then the de facto leader of the country, given the limitations of the later Fatimid rulers.64 The foundation document still exists and, in perhaps the strangest turn of events in the history of the institution of the madrasa, is written in the name of the Fatimid caliph al-Hafiz. Although this is likely to have been a mere formality, the document goes so far as to state that the caliph, rather than the vizier, decided to construct the madrasa65 and even gives its name as al-Hafiziyya. It seems likely that Rid wan had hoped to gain support from the Sunnis of Alexandria, and that al-Hafiz would also have found this politically expedient.66 This madrasa became the most famous in Egypt until the construction of the one at the grave of al-Shafici, in no small part due to the fame of its mudarris (professor), the imam Sadr al Din Abu Tahir Ismacil b. cAwf, a student of the above mentioned al-Turtushi. In the end, the madrasa came to be named after Ibn cAwf, who, after al-Turtushi's death, became the best-known Maliki in twelfth-cen tury Egypt. He taught for fifty years and had hundreds of students, the most famous of whom were Saladin and his sons al-cAziz, al-Zahir, and al-Afdal. Although a great deal is known about the teachers and students at this madrasa, there is again little information about its constitution or physical appearance. It was, how ever, a fully endowed residential college sponsored in part by the Fatimid caliph, and its longevity?it lasted for well over a hundred years before being eclipsed by grander institutions?indicates that it was a school of considerable consequence.67 A fifth school was founded in 1151 for the ShafYis, by yet another Sunni vizier for the Fatimids, Ibn Sal lar. It was called the cAdiliyya after Ibn Sallar's title "al-Malik al-cAdil" but was soon nicknamed "al-Silafi" after its mudarris, Abu Tahir al-Silafi. He too was a famous and well-respected teacher, who taught in Egypt for sixty years. In 1177, Saladin and his sons paid him a visit in his madrasa, where they studied Hadith.68 Once again, we know little of the physical structure of the madrasa, but from its staff we may speculate that it was a substantial foundation: it had a muezzin and two or three mucids, one of whom was in charge of forty young men.69 Al-Silafi also kept his large library there. All told, at least eight madrasas are known to have been established in Egypt in the Fatimid period, and there may have been more. Most of these were in the Sunni stronghold of Alexandria, but one was also established in Fustat.70 Thus Saladin did not introduce the institution of the madrasa to Egypt; rather than being forcibly implanted by a single ruler, this insti tution seems to have followed a natural model of dis persion, spread by scholars who had studied or taught in the East as they made their way west. Thus we see that the Nizamiyya in Baghdad was built in 1067 and the first madrasa in Damascus in 1097-98. If the first Sunni legal school was indeed the one built in Alex andria by al-Turtushi shortly after his arrival in Egypt in 1096, then the madrasa arrived in Egypt at about the same time it arrived in Syria: nearly eighty years before the advent of Saladin. While Saladin's founda tions were undoubtedly more sumptuous and archi tecturally significant than preceding ones, the intro duction of the institution itself cannot be credited to him. Rather, he seems to have been astutely capitaliz ing on popular support for an already existing institu tion. Still, the paradigm of Sunni revival and its Egyp tian genesis in Saladin's foundation at the grave of</page><page sequence="14">28 STEPHENNIE MULDER al-Shafici has a long genealogy and has played an important role in scholarship on the Ayyubid period.71 Given the above discussion, one may well ask how the idea of the madrasa in Egypt as an Ayyubid import has become so important historiographically? Modern authors are not solely responsible for link ing this building with the Sunni revival. Given Sala din's subsequent fame and numerous achievements, medieval writers tended to credit him retroactively with the introduction of the madrasa into Egypt. Lei ser, too, was puzzled by this phenomenon and offered the following explanation for it: After all, he became the great Sunni hero of his time and the madrasa was a Sunni creation. In this respect, some authors even contradicted themselves in an attempt to add more glory to the Saladin legend. For instance, in his biography of al-Silafi Ibn Khallikan clearly states that Ibn al-Sallar built a madrasa...in 1151-52, some twenty years before Saladin became vizier.... In spite of this, when he comes to the life of Saladin, he feels compelled to declare that there were no madrasas in Egypt when Saladin took over the country. Al-Maqrizi does the same thing...[reporting that Ridwan built a madrasa in 1137-38]. But then for the year 1170-71, in the same work, he mentions Saladin's first madrasas and states that until they were built, there was not one madrasa in all of Egypt.... Modern writers also frequently attribute the madrasa to Saladin. This is because they usually rely, indirectly or directly, on Ibn Khallikan's life of Saladin or the Khitat [of al-Maqrizi].72 Thus, because Saladin was the great reviver of Sun nism in Egypt and the idea of building madrasas is historiographically associated with Sunni revival, seeing Saladin's foundation of the Salahiyya as the first Egyptian example of the type seems to have its own internal logic and momentum. This conventional misapprehension of course does not rule out the pos sibility that a madrasa built by Saladin after his con quest of Egypt was part of a Sunni program to combat Fatimid influence, or that such concerns were part of the implicit mandate for its foundation. We may at least be certain, however, that there is no specific information in the history of the Shaffi complex or its foundation inscription to support the proposition that these concerns were foremost in the minds of its founders. SEMIOTIC INTERPRETIVE FRAMEWORKS AND THE MAUSOLEUM OF AL-MALIK AL-KAMIL The building that now stands on the site of Saladin's original foundation dates to 1211 and, as mentioned above, was built by Saladin's eventual successor al Malik al-Kamil, who was buried there along with his mother (figs. 2 and 3). It is remarkable to note that the foundation of al-Kamil?though constructed at what is often regarded as the high point of Sunni revival in Egypt?does not bear signs of an overtly Sun nite orientation. This fact is significant in light of the research by art historians on the semiotic dimensions of the architectural programs of both the Fatimids and the Ayyubids. We will now look more closely at these arguments and their implications for the ShalTi mausoleum, for this subject has by now generated considerable literature. Caroline Williams and Irene Bierman (for the Fati mids) and Yasser Tabbaa (for the Ayyubids) have pre sented evidence for the symbolic function of certain building types, decorative elements, writing styles, and architectonic forms. These, they have argued, were deployed on the facades and interiors of buildings in programs of ideological propaganda for the strength ening of their respective doctrinal orientations and the consolidation of political hegemony. According to Williams, the Fatimids' patronage of a "cult of cAlid saints" was a key "adjunct of state policy."73 This cult was promulgated through a campaign of constructing tombs for Shiite martyrs and saints, with the intent of generating support and loyalty for the Imam Caliph.74 Williams was the first to elaborate the idea that the Fatimids, following a series of crises in the latter half of their rule, had consciously appropriated the Cai rene cult of saints in an orchestrated effort to appeal to local groups and interact with their largely Sunni population. In two studies, one focused on the ico nography of the mosque of al-Aqmar and the other on a series of tombs constructed in this period, she argues that the Fatimids were trying to reach out to their subject population through the use of architec tural forms and symbols with Ismacili meanings.75 Fol lowing Williams, Doris Behrens-Abouseif has proposed that Fatimid ritual was the impetus for the placement and iconography of Fatimid buildings. In an article on the Aqmar Mosque, she demonstrates that the build ings in the Bayn al-Qasrayn, the main street between the Fatimid palaces in Cairo, were conceived almost as elaborate stage sets for ritual and procession.76</page><page sequence="15">THE MAUSOLEUM OF IMAM AL-SHAFIT 29 Bierman has subsequently argued that the Fatimids made use of a variety of artistic media to promulgate their message of Shfi identity, particularly that of "writ ing signs"? propagandistic messages on coins, tirdz fabric, and architecture. The Fatimids' ability to com municate these messages was dependent on a central aspect of Ismacili doctrine: ta'wil, or interpretation. This system was used to manifest the esoteric meaning of phenomena hidden within certain external symbolic forms. The most common of these symbolic forms con sisted of concentric circles, symbolizing Fatimid cos mological understanding, that were displayed on coins and architecture.77 Writing style is another key element of Bierman's argument: the Fatimids, like almost all other architectural patrons before the eleventh cen tury, wrote their public inscriptions in Kufic script, and particularly in floriated Kufic, a difficult-to-read style that would have obscured the overt meaning of messages?a kind of deliberate ambiguity particularly resonant with Fatimid esoteric doctrine.78 Tabbaa argues for a similar kind of symbolic mean ing for certain types of ornamental, formal, and ste reotomic innovations of the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries in Syria and Egypt. He builds on the work of Gulru Necipoglu, who, in The Topkapi Scroll, assembles an eloquent case for the semiotic content of Timurid and Turkoman architectural orna ment, particularly the two-dimensional girih, or "knot" mode, subsequently defined by Tabbaa as interlacing vegetal forms and interlocking geometric shapes,79 and its three-dimensional counterpart, the muqarnas. Unlike Necipoglu, who argues for the general unify ing role of the Abbasid capital for succeeding Sunni dynasties, rather than proposing a direct correlation between the geometric mode and a specific school of Sunni theology, Tabbaa suggests that these forms, like their Fatimid counterparts, may have been the bearers of specific sectarian meaning?in this case Ashcari Sunnism as expounded by Nur al-Din's chief apologist, al-Baqillani. This theologian generated an atomistic theory of the universe and argued for an all powerful, all-knowing God who controls everything, in opposition to the Muctazili theological rationalism favored by the Isma'ili Fatimids, which, though accept ing God's absolute sovereignty, nonetheless validated the autonomy of independent causes and the free will of human beings.80 This program, Tabbaa argues, also included the adoption of naskhi (cursive) script, the elaboration and transformation of vegetal arabesque and the girih mode, and the use of muqarnas vaulting. These signs proclaimed the Sunni orientation of the Zangids and Ayyubids in much the same way that Fatimid forms had expressed hidden aspects of Ismacili doctrine.81 The change in writing style is perhaps the most impor tant of these symbolic markers: Bierman is in accord with Tabbaa when she maintains that "the style of writing, a cursive script, visually signaled the contrast with earlier practice."82 However, Williams, when describing the mausoleum of Shafici, writes that the Ayyubids "did not efface the cult places of the cAlid dead. Instead, the Ayyubids themselves, in a triumphant assertion of their own orthodox rule, built in the midst of the cAlid tombs the largest single-domed mausoleum in the Qarafa... which was architecturally, decoratively, and functionally a successor to the Fatimid mausolea."83This introduces a paradox, for if we accept Tabbaa's argument that certain forms had come to be associated with Sunni revival in Syria, it seems contradictory that the Ayyu bids in Egypt would pronounce orthodoxy using the same visual signals that, according to Williams, Beh rens-Abouseif, and Bierman, had recently been asso ciated with heterodoxy. Nevertheless this borrowing of Fatimid forms is among the most pronounced fea tures of Egyptian Ayyubid architecture generally. Why, if the Ayyubids were invested in asserting ideological difference from their Fatimid predecessors by sym bolic means, would they choose to build in Egypt in a style that was in almost every regard derived from Fatimid buildings? Indeed, a careful look at the mausoleum built by al-Kamil shows that this building has more in com mon with the Fatimid mosques and mausolea that pre ceded it than with any Sunni Ayyubid architecture in Syria. The one way it seems to have diverged from its Fatimid predecessors was in sheer size: even today, its brooding presence towers over the tombs that surround it. It has the largest freestanding dome in Egypt; at 29 m in height and more than 15 m in diameter, it is, as mentioned above, only slightly smaller than that of the Dome of the Rock.84 In plan, the building is a square with sides measuring over 15 m internally and 20.5 m externally, its stone walls almost 3 m thick (fig. 4) .85 Just off center, marking the grave of the Imam, and on a direct axis with the original entrance to the north, is the extraordinary wooden cenotaph com missioned by Saladin, made of teak imported from India.86 Also buried within the tomb, near the grave of al-Shafici, are the patron, Sultan al-Kamil, and his</page><page sequence="16">30 STEPHENNIE MULDER Fig. 6.

Though the interior has been renovated repeatedly, one feature is original to the construction of al-Kamil: carved wooden brackets that support a wooden octa gon for the hanging of lamps and that bear, on fields of scrolling vegetation, inscriptions in an archaizing form of floriated Kufic (fig. 6) ,88 a style that would be perfectly at home in a Fatimid building. The exterior elevation of the mausoleum (fig. 3) consists of two stories, the first approximately 10 m high and surmounted by a parapet 1 m in height.</page><page sequence="17">THE MAUSOLEUM OF IMAM AL-SHAFICI 31 Fig. 7. Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafici, post on the parapet with Kufic calligraphy. (Author's photo) Below the parapet, from the springing of the dec orative blind arches downward, the building is con structed of large ashlar blocks. This lower story is divided in two by a torus molding that runs around the building at a height of 6.03 m. The beveled cor ners of the lower story taper to a point above the torus molding, and the niches formed under these cham fered corners are decorated with muqarnas. On each side, four blind arches rest on the molding, arranged in pairs around a single window at the center. From the springing of the blind arches upward, the build ing material is brick. Above them begins the parapet, which is surmounted by the second story, 6.16 m in height.89 The parapet rests on a band of simple interlaced geometric orna ment and consists of four rectangular brick panels on each side, also decorated with geometric inter lacing executed in stucco. Interspersed irregularly between these panels are five brick piers or posts (fig. 2). Each of these is decorated with one of two types of stucco frieze, the end and center piers bear ing Kufic calligraphic ornament on an arabesque field (fig. 7), and the intervening two featuring veg etal arabesque contained within a frame (fig. 8). On the second level, above the parapet, the decoration consists of a series of keel-arched blind niches with</page><page sequence="18">32 STEPHENNIE MULDER Fig. 8. Mausoleum of Imam al-Shafici, post on the parapet with arabesque ornament. (Author's photo) ribbed hoods. Between these niches are rosettes or lozenges (fig. 2). Virtually every element of the exterior decorative scheme is derived from earlier Fatimid constructions; a systematic comparison of the most important elements demonstrates the imitative nature of this ornamental program and its strong perpetuation of local style. Proceeding from the bottom of the elevation, the tripartite, keel-arch-shaped muqarnas crowning the chamfered corner above the torus molding (visible in fig. 3), has its closest parallel in the mosque of al Aqmar of 1125 (fig. 9), where we find precisely the same feature, although with its muqarnas decoration in better repair. Similarly, the flat and pointed blind arches on the first story of the mausoleum, resting directly on the torus molding, are reminiscent of those on the al-Aqmar facade (fig. 10), and one of the pointed arches, on the far right in Creswell's draw ing (fig. 3), retains its ribbed hood after the manner of the arches there. Further, the two flat arches on either side of the central window of the mausoleum (fig. 3) are each decorated with a miniature arcade of trilobed arches. This is another typical Fatimid form, to be seen, for example, in a window from the mau soleum of Sayyida cAtika of 1120 (fig. 11).

Creswell Archive, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, neg. no. C. 3848) story of the mausoleum is also a common feature of Fatimid buildings. Perhaps the most obvious paral lel, though simpler in design, is the star-interlace pattern of the parapet of the mosque of al-Hakim (990-1018) (fig. 12). Furthermore, the friezes on the posts of the al-Shafici parapet (figs. 7 and 8), as Cres well remarked,90 are most closely related to a num ber of late Fatimid mihrabs, including those of the mausolea of Sayyida cAtika (fig. 13) and Ikhwat Yusuf (1125) (fig. 14), and the mashhad of Sayyida Ruqay ya (1133) (fig. 15).91 The strongest correspondence here is in the pattern of scrolling palmettes and half palmettes contained within a frame, powerfully rem iniscent of the stucco decoration from the mihrab of Sayyida cAtika.92 Furthermore, in the stucco decora tion surrounding a window at the northeast end of the sanctuary in the ca. 972 mosque of al-Azhar (fig. 16), palmettes scroll in compact circles, growing out of a central "vases," themselves fashioned of leaves, in composition nearly identical to the friezes on the posts of the al-Shafici parapet.93 To the upper story, with its sequence of fluted, keel arched niches resting on engaged colonnettes, inter spersed with circular saucer and lozenge forms (fig. 2), the courtyard of the mosque of al-Azhar also offers a direct comparison. The primary features of the deco ration along the internal facade of the mosque court yard, which belongs to the 1138 renovation by Caliph al-Hafiz, are virtually identical to the exterior deco ration of the mausoleum of Imam al-Shafici, produc ing a strong visual parallel between the mausoleum and the most prestigious of Fatimid buildings. Fur thermore, in the mausoleum, just as in the courtyard of the mosque, this sequence of motifs is crowned by step crenellation on the cornice.

More interesting still, in light of the semiotic argu ments previously cited, is the fact that the ribs of the blind arches in the ShafYi mausoleum emanate from a central motif strongly reminiscent of what Bierman has suggested was the essential Ismacili motif of con centric circles, such as are found in the mihrab of Sayyida Ruqayya and on the facade of the al-Aqmar mosque.94 Although the concentric circles have been replaced by vegetal ornament,95 from afar?the only way these motifs, located very high on the elevation, could have been viewed?this small distinction was probably not clearly apparent. The overall visual effect is that encircling the facade of this Ayyubid building are what appear to be Fatimid mihrabs, bearing what ever associations they may have had for twelfth- and thirteenth-century Cairene visitors. Such a program calls into question the degree to which this decorative language was associated with Fatimid esoteric doctrine, at least by the early thirteenth century. Certainly if it were, al-Malik al-Kamil would not have used it to adorn the grave of the founder of one of the most prominent Sunni law schools. At the same time, if there were an Ayyubid architectural lan guage fully developed in Syria that was clearly associ ated with the Sunni revival, why wouldn't elements of that architectural style have been employed here? In the end, two conclusions suggest themselves: either that language was not seen as necessary, at least by the early thirteenth century, for the expression of Sunnism outside Syria, or this building was not the monument to Ismacili defeat it is often argued to be. From the comparisons noted above, it is at least</page><page sequence="26">40 STEPHENNIE MULDER Fig. 17. Mosque of al-Salih TalaY, 1160, couryard facade. (Photo: K. A. C. Creswell, ? Creswell Archive, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, neg. no. C. 228) clear that the iconography of this building is a dem onstration of the primacy of local style over univer sal ideology in Ayyubid Cairo. So what, if anything, is original in this building? Is there any trace of a political or ideological message in its iconography? As mentioned previously, its one remarkable innovation was its extraordinary size. Per haps for this reason alone it was, in its day, the "most famous mashhad built on the cubical domed plan."96 With the exception of the Dome of the Rock, at the time of the building of the al-Shafici mausoleum there was simply no other dome of comparable scale any where in the region;97 no surviving Fatimid building comes close to attaining its span or height.98 It inspired imitations: al-Maqrizi relates that in 1269, when the Mamluk Sultan Baybars al-Bunduqdari built his congre gational mosque north of the city of Cairo, he specified that the dome was to be "the same size as the dome of al-Shafici."99 Indeed, the al-Shafici mausoleum might have been the largest freestanding domed structure that had ever been seen in Cairo. Is it possible that this extraordinary dome was itself the message? Although we lack enough evidence regarding al Kamil's specific motivations to draw clear conclu sions, two points about the al-Shafici dome are sug gestive. One is its resemblance to that of the Dome of the Rock, whose scale it approaches, and whose construction technique?two wooden shells, covered on the exterior with lead?it moreover imitates quite directly. Although the current al-Shafici dome dates to</page><page sequence="27">THE MAUSOLEUM OF IMAM AL-SHAFICI 41 a restoration begun in 1480 by the Mamluk sultan al Ashraf Qaytbay, its resemblance to the pointed profile of the Ayyubid dome of the mausoleum of al-Salih, of 1250, suggests that the fifteenth-century restoration followed Ayyubid precedent. This parallel is notable considering that, along with the elimination of the Fatimids, Saladin's other great victory was the eviction of the Crusaders from Jeru salem in 1187. Al-Kamil's father, al-cAdil Abu Bakr b. Ayyub (r. 1200-18), repulsed another German incur sion in 1198.100The particulars of the scale and con struction of the ShafTi dome, given the recent capture of Jerusalem, suggest a dialogic relationship of this building to the third-most holy of Islamic sites, now once again restored to Muslim hands. If so, it would not be the last time a Cairene building made refer ence to Jerusalem: just over sixty years later, the octag onal plan of the complex of Sultan Qala'un (1284 85) would consciously echo that of the Dome of the Rock. Is it possible that the Dome of al-Kamil was to be seen, not as a victory monument to the eviction of the Shiite Fatimids from Cairo, but rather to the evic tion of the Christian Crusaders from Jerusalem? The evidence at this point is only suggestive. The second possibility, however, is easily confirmed by the textual sources, as well as by evidence from the building itself. It is immediately apparent that al Kamil's building was intended to function not only as a mashhad for al-Shafici but also as a dynastic mau soleum for al-Kamil, his mother, and perhaps others of his family. The one unambiguous indication of al Kamil's intentions comes from al-Maqrizi, who tells us that "...when al-Malik al-Kamil...buried his son [sic] in the year 608 [1211] next to the grave of the Imam... [he] built the great qubba over the grave of al-Shafici and brought water to it from the Birkat al-Habash by means of an aqueduct leading to it."101 As both Cre swell and Wiet have observed, the word "son" (ibnahu) is an obvious copyist's error for "mother" (ummahu), "for it was al-Kamil's mother (the Princess cAdiliya) who died on 25 Safar of this year (8th August 1211), and it is her cenotaph which is the second most impor tant in the shrine."102 The fact that al-Kamil's mausoleum was built the year of his mother's death suggests that the sultan's motivation for the expansion of the mausoleum was a desire to commemorate his mother and provide a dynastic mausoleum for his family at the grave of a saintly figure. In that sense, it is a building that fits directly into the Cairene practice of burial close to a holy person's tomb.103 The steady stream of suppli cants to al-ShafTi's grave and the proximity of the adjoining madrasa would assure perpetuity of mem ory for the sultan and his mother. Indeed, al-Kamil's mausoleum foreshadows the intensely competitive late Ayyubid practice of private foundations by individu als.104 The building is thus among the first examples of the architecturally dazzling monumental dynastic mausolea favored by members of the ruling house in the later Ayyubid and Mamluk periods. In this context, its Fatimid-inspired decorative vocab ulary was perhaps meaningful simply as an expres sion of pious princely opulence, utilizing the already extant and highly developed local stylistic idiom. Here, however, the Fatimid idiom is reconfigured and rein vented to serve new and individual functions. Carved stucco adorning the interior of the prayer hall of the mosque of al-Azhar is now enclosed in small panels high on the exterior of the imposing al-Shafici facade, as if they were tiny mnemonic devices?decorative quotes?eliciting memory of the tradition as whole. The keel-arch and saucer decoration of the interior courtyards of public, congregational mosques such as al-Azhar or al-Salih TalaY becomes the exterior sur face treatment of a building devoted to the memory, glorification, and sanctification of a few individuals. All of these elements were positioned on the surface of a building of enormous scale. Though the mausoleum of al-Shafici may have been among the first to employ such a method, this process of borrowing, reconfigur ing, and investing with new meaning was to be a hall mark of architectural style in Cairo throughout the Ayyubid period.105 It is remarkable that al-Kamil built this building before he became sultan, while he was viceroy under his father, al-Malik al-cAdil. The year of his formal investiture as viceroy, 1207, is the year he moved into his new residence in the Citadel.106 Four years later, the expansion of the mausoleum was com pleted. From his residence in the citadel, across the wide may dan, al-Kamil's view of his mother's lofty rest ing place at the grave of al-Shafici would have endured until he too was laid to rest there. The evidence presented here?including the back drop of intra-Sunni competition in Cairo; the details of the shaykh al-Khabushani's biography and particu larly his doctrinal conflict with the Hanbalis; the close reading of the foundation inscription for the madrasa, with its unambiguous condemnation of Hanbali the ology and lack of anti-Shici polemic; the presence of the institution of the madrasa before the arrival of</page><page sequence="28">42 STEPHENNIE MULDER Saladin; and finally the Ayyubid borrowing of Fatimid style in al-Kamil's mausoleum?suggests that, rather than being a statement against the vanquished Ismacili Fatimids, Saladin's intent in his foundation of the madrasa and mausoleum at al-ShafTi's grave had to do with gaining the control and allegiance of particu lar group of ShafTi Sunnis in the context of a highly competitive medieval polemical environment. It is unclear whether he pursued this goal for purely ideological reasons, as did the shaykh al-Khabushani, or for more earthly ones: the Shaficis were more numer ous, and he must have seen them as more easily con trolled than the troublesome Hanbalis, who always remained a tiny though vocal minority. Perhaps, as Chamberlain has suggested, the "overall pattern of relations between ruling households and the warriors and shaykhs upon whom they depended was more significant than the direct importation of institutions [such as the madrasa]."107 What is clear is that there is little in the remaining evidence from Saladin's complex, or in the architec ture or decoration of al-Malik al-Kamil's mausoleum, to argue for the symbolic role of this building in a campaign of Sunni revival against the Ismacili Fati mids. These conclusions do not, of course, necessarily mean that such forms, in other times or more distant lands, were not evocative of the associations attributed to them by the semiotic arguments cited above. Nor does it mean that the al-Shafici mausoleum itself was devoid of symbolic associations: as has been shown above, it simultaneously communicated a polyvalent network of such associations, ranging from the proc lamation of intra-Sunni polemic to the visual expres sion of pious princely opulence. In fact, the virtue of semiotic theory is its very flexibility as an interpretive framework, and the borrowing, reconfiguring, and investing with new meaning of Fatimid forms in this building illustrates nothing less than such a semiotic process at work. The al-Shafici mausoleum is a prod uct of a distinct moment and location in Islamic his tory: an early-thirteenth-century building in Cairo. As such, it cannot prove or disprove semiotic theo ries about buildings more distant in time or space. The evidence here suggests, however, that such sym bolic associations were limited both temporally and spatially?mutable, fluctuating, and subject to change and intervention over time.

A Cairene friend once confided that he thought of al-Shafici</page><page sequence="29">THE MAUSOLEUM OF IMAM AL-SHAFICI 43 as a kind of "patron saint" for the city. Perhaps the best index of Egyptian devotion to the Imam is to be found in the thou sands of letters that are continually deposited in the grille around his cenotaph and even mailed through the regular post, often simply addressed to "Imam al-Shafici, Cairo." In the 1970s these letters were the subject of a sociological study: see Sayyid cUways, Rasd'il ila al-Imam al-Shafii: Zahirat irsal al-rasa'il ila darih al-Imam al-Shafii (Cairo, 1978). 12. RCEA, vol. 9, no. 3331, 89-90. 13. Saladin brought this woodworker from Syria, most likely from Aleppo, where his family was already renowned for their skill. His father was probably Macali b. Salim, who in 1165 carved the now-lost mihrab of the Maqam Ibrahim in the citadel of Aleppo. cUbayd was thus likely the brother of Salman b. Macali, the woodworker who made one of the most extraordinary examples of this technique of mor tice-and-tenon construction: the minbar of the mosque of Jerusalem, finished in 1168-69. See Wiet, "Inscriptions," 172-73. 14. Saladin's college was also called the Madrasa al-Nasiriyya. 15. According to al-Maqrizi, the sultan "paid [the professor] every month a salary of forty dinars for tadris (instruction)": al-Maqrizi, Mawd'iz wa 'l-ictibarfi dhikr al-khitat wa 'l-athar, 2 vols. (Bulaq, 1270 [1853]), vol. 2, 400. This was a remarkable sum, nearly four times that paid to the mudarris of the Suyu fiyya Madrasa, founded by Saladin in the same year; the latter professor received only eleven dinars per month. See Gary Leiser, "The Restoration of Sunnism in Egypt: Madra sas and Mudarrisun, 495-647/1101-1249" (PhD diss., Uni versity of Pennsylvania, 1976), 213. 16. According to the medieval pilgrimage guide written by Ali al-Harawi (d. 1215), who in the opinion of Sourdel-Tho mine was probably a Shiite: Janine Sourdel-Thomine, Guide des lieux de pelerinage (Damascus, 1957), xx-xxii. Many pil grimage places?though in theory belonging to one sect or another?were visited by Muslims from across the reli gious spectrum. Shiite visitation of nominally Sunni shrines, and vice-versa, should probably be interpreted in the con text of the essentially ecumenical character of popular reli gious devotional practices, a subject that deserves further exploration. For examples of how Muslims and Jews shared popular pilgrimage sites in the medieval period, see Joseph Meri, The Cult of Saints among Muslims and Jews in Medieval Syria (Oxford, 2002). 17. al-Maqrizi, Khitat, vol. 2, 462. 18.

This is assuming that al-Kamil's mausoleum preserved a plan resembling Saladin's original. In any case, Saladin's madrasa was still in existence when al-Kamil enlarged the mausoleum, and the irregular orientation of the door must indicate that there was some preexisting building on this side of the tomb. 23. al-Maqrizi, Khitat, vol. 2, 400.

As Bulliet has demonstrated, the term casabiyya had two mean ings: a positive one denoting a fundamental bond of social solidarity (as such, the word was made famous by Ibn Khal dun's usage), and a negative one implying factional strife or fanaticism. A person called mutacassib was a fanatical devotee of a particular group, in this period usually a legal school, or madhhab. See R.

Like the Hanbalis, Christians and Magians were also often accused in medieval polemic of anthropomorphism or even polytheism {shirk). Perhaps this explains their being grouped together by the building's patron, although it is not then clear why Jews should be placed on this list of forbidden entrants. 48. George Makdisi, "The Sunni Revival," in D. S. Richards, ed., Islamic Civilization 950-1150 (Oxford, 1973), 155-57. Most legal scholars identified not solely with their madhhab but also with diverse theological schools, for example, Rafidi, Muctazili, or Ashcari; see Makdisi, Ibn cAqil, 294-97. For a dis cussion of the complicated and shifting relationships between the various Sunni creeds, see Y. Ibish, The Political Doctrine of al-Baqillani (Beirut, 1966), 54-83. The seeming incon sistencies generated by these allegiances often seem bewil dering; for example, the theologian al-Baqillani (d. 1013), who was the chief Maliki qadi in Baghdad, is nevertheless buried at the grave of Ibn Hanbal. An ardent defender of Sunnism against Shiism and the Mu'tazila, he would there fore have been in agreement with the anti-Shici provisions of the Qadiri creed, but at the same time he is Ash'ari and wrote the famous Ash'ari treatise on the imamate entitled al-Tamhid. 49. Makdisi, "Sunni Revival," 168. 50. The Sunni revival seems to have been an extremely com plex and shifting phenomenon, and its means and ends as initially formulated under the Abbasids in Baghdad devel oped considerably?sometimes in very different directions? over time and distance. Thus, although the revival began under a traditionalist caliph, later?perhaps as a result of al-Ghazali's synthesis of opposing doctrines?it was carried on in twelfth-century Syria and Egypt under the banner of the largely ShafTi-Ash'ari Ayyubids, whose tolerance for tra ditionalist Hanbali troublemaking in Cairo or elsewhere was rather limited. 51. Leiser, "Hanbalism," 166. 52. EI2, s.v. "Hashwiyya"; see also "Nabita" and "Sunna." 53. This, of course, does not prove that a desire to eliminate remaining traces of Shiism was not also part of the intention behind the founding of the madrasa. Certainly the intransi gent shaykh al-Khabushani would have been no more toler ant of Shiism than of what he perceived as deviant forms of Sunnism. But this seems not to have been his most pressing concern when building the madrasa. Because the remaining elements of Saladin's original construction are so few, the evidence of his intent is partial, but fortunately the foun dation inscription, perhaps the most important indicator of the patron's intentions, is among the surviving evidence. Its statement against the Hanbalis cannot, of course, con firm the absence elsewhere in the building of contempo rary anti-Shici polemic, but the failure to mention or even allude to Shiism in the foundation text is striking, and, I would argue, constitutes strong evidence that the expres sion of such sentiments was not the founder's immediate priority. 54. RCEA, no. 3380; Tabbaa, Transformation, p. 68 invokes this cursive {naskht) inscription and those on the wooden ceno taph in the tomb of al-ShafTi as further evidence of Saladin's propagandistic intentions in his foundations in Cairo (see n. 80, below). He also remarks on the naive quality of the cur sive of the Citadel inscription, arguing that it is suggestive of the "inexperience of local calligraphers in the new calli graphic style." None of these inscriptions, however, seems visually prominent enough to have been intended as a true counterweight to the bold inscriptional programs on Fatimid buildings. In fact, the only visible inscriptions on the exte rior of the al-Shafici mausoleum are Kufic. We will return to this point below. 55. Rabbat, Citadel, 71. 56.

The history of the madrasa in Egypt has been meticulously documented by Leiser ("Restoration"), but since his disser tation is unpublished some of his findings are summarized here. The following section is based on his work. 60. Leiser, "Restoration," 115. 61. Ibid., 119. 62. Ibid., 129. 63. Ibid., 131. 64. As did Jews and Christians, Sunnis functioned in important roles in the Fatimid administration, several as Fatimid viziers. Always the majority in Egypt, the Sunnis, in the later years of weakened Fatimid rule, had a great deal of freedom. This is why when Saladin arrived there may have been little need to actively stamp out Shiism, which had long before ceased to be a real political or ideological threat. See above, Cham berlain, "Crusader Era," 232. 65. Leiser, "Restoration," 133. 66. Ibid., 135. 67. Ibid., 150. 68. Ibid., 159. 69. Ibid., 175. 70. A chronological list of pre-Mamluk madrasas can be found in Leiser, "Restoration," appendix 5, 471. 71. The monument is nearly always discussed in terms of its role in instigating, representing, or embodying the Sunni revival in Egypt. For example, Gaston Wiet, in his descrip tion of the ShafTi complex, wrote that Saladin introduced the madrasa into Egypt, reasoning that it was the logical outgrowth of his "Sunnite reaction"; see Wiet, Cairo, City of Art and Commerce (Norman, OK, 1964), 53-54. Accord ing to Doris Behrens-Abouseif, Islamic Architecture in Cairo (Cairo, 1989), 85, Saladin's complex "can be considered as symbolic of the reinstatement of Sunni Islam in Egypt." Wil liams, Islamic Monuments, 137, states, "it was here that Salah al-Din founded the first madrasa in Egypt as part of his effort to combat the Fatimid Shica." This reading of the building and its meaning is so well established that it has become a commonplace when discussing Ayyubid architecture. 72. Leiser, "Restoration," 113-14. 73.

See also Tabbaa, Transformation, 56-57. 79. This is Tabbaa's gloss {Transformation, 8) on Necipoglu's more technical definition, for which see Topkapi Scroll, 9. Tabbaa has proposed that the girih ("knot") style of deco ration was "at least partly introduced" to Egypt in the early Ayyubid period, citing al-ShafTi's cenotaph as an example {Transformation, 96). He also suggests that Saladin may have been intentionally importing the girih mode to Cairo because it was already associated with Sunnism in Syria. As he him self notes (81-82), however, prior Egyptian examples exist in the wooden mihrab of the Fatimid shrine to Sayyida Na fisa and the minbars of Qus and Hebron?this last com missioned by Badr al-Jamali for the shine of the head of al Husayn?which date from the mid-to-late twelfth century. Both Necipoglu and Tabbaa dismiss these as less developed, rare, and/or intrusive examples, but it is possible that they are no more rare than the few surviving eleventh-century examples of such ornament in the Eastern provinces of the Abbasid empire, which both Tabbaa and Necipoglu (Topkapi Scroll, 99-100) have convincingly argued are our only remain ing record for the early development of the form in Sunni realms. Though these forms are not identical to contempo raneous forms further north and east, they are still, it seems to me, attempting to evoke a similar decorative idiom?a combination of vegetal arabesque with increasingly sophis ticated geometric strapwork?that may perhaps have been a universal courtly style of the period with associations of lux ury and refinement. If so, it undoubtedly was not yet devel oped as fully in Cairo, which, as the Shafici mausoleum and other Ayyubid examples demonstrate, remained conserva tive stylistically well into the thirteenth century, even long after the Sunni Ayyubid takeover. A similar conclusion might be drawn from Saladin's patronage of the woodworker Ibn Macali to carve the cenotaph for the Shiite mashhad of Imam al-Husayn, at or about the same time as he was working on al-ShafTi's cenotaph. Saladin's commissioning a single arti san who employed a nearly identical decorative vocabulary for a nominally Sunni shrine and a nominally Shiite one could indicate that Saladin's intent may have been sectar ian conciliation or appropriation rather than the expression of ideological supremacy through decorative form. Caroline Williams, "Quranic Inscriptions on the Tabut al-Husayn in Cairo" Islamic Art 2 (1989): 3-14, argues for the Shiite char acter of the inscriptions of the Husayn cenotaph. 80. M.

Tabbaa also notes that the al-Shafici cenotaph and the foundation inscription from the madrasa are the earliest instances of naskhl writing in Egypt {Transformation, 68). Though this is certainly the case, the most notable feature of the cenotaph is the fact that it bears historical inscriptions in both Kufic and naskhl; see Wiet, "Inscriptions," 172. 82.

The Dome of the Rock is approximately 30 m. in height and 20 m. in diameter. 85. Creswell, MAE, vol. 2, 65, points out that this is quite suffi cient to support a dome of brick or stone and adds that it is thus surprising that the dome is built of wood. This raises the possibility that the original was indeed built of more durable material. The present wooden dome dates to a res toration by Sultan Qaytbay, begun in 1480: idem, MAE, vol. 2, 73. It seems originally to have been covered with green tiles, some of which Creswell saw when the lead coating was removed briefly during repairs in 1951: MAE, vol. 2, 71. 86. Williams, Islamic Monuments, 123. 87. However, al-Kamil is also said to have been buried in the Citadel; see EI2, s.v. "al-Kamil." 88. Creswell, MAE, vol. 2, 68-69. As far as I am aware, these inscriptions have not been published. 89. Ibid., 65-66. 90. Ibid., 66. 91. Ibid. 92. The combination of Kufic with interlacing uprights on a field of vegetal arabesque, visible on the al-Shafici post in fig. 7, appears in the mosque of al-Hakim, on a small win dow to the left of the mihrab. Creswell argues that this win dow grille shows Maghribi influence, which made itself felt in Cairo around the middle of the thirteenth century; he therefore concludes that the window of the mosque of al Hakim dates to a thirteenth-century restoration: MAE, vol. 1, 82, n. 2. The presence of the same motif at the mauso leum of al-Shafici, however, suggests a slightly earlier date for the appearance of this style in Egypt. It is perhaps the sole element of the mausoleum facade that is not directly derived from Fatimid precedents, although it is neverthe less notable that the inscription is in Kufic and not naskhi. 93. Tabbaa proposes that this style of scrolling vegetal orna ment declined in popularity in Syria under the Ayyubids in favor of a more highly rationalized vegetal arabesque that, he suggests, was more expressive of Sunni revival: Tabbaa, Transformation, 80-81. Another example of decorative con tinuity can be found on the walls of the citadel, near Sala din's naskhi inscription discussed above. Despite the pres ence of this inscription, the decorative ornament, like that of the mausoleum, is again essentially Fatimid. This is partic ularly true on the Burj al-Zafar, which, according to Lorenz Korn, "seems to indicate the survival of Fatimid decorative traditions under the reign of Saladin." For this and further elaboration of the long survival of Fatimid motifs in Ayyu bid architecture, see Korn, "The Facade of as-Salih Ayyub's Madrasa and the Style of Ayyubid Architecture in Cairo," in Egypt and Syria in the Fatimid, Ayyubid and Mamluk Eras III: Proceedings of the 6th, 7th, and 8th International Colloquium Organized at the Katholieke Universiteit, Leuven (Leuven, 2001), 101-21, esp. 107.

The same is true oi several Fatimid buildings, for example the mihrab of Sayyida Ruqayya, which has at the center of its ribbed hood a six-pointed star on a field of vegetal ara besque (fig. 15).</page><page sequence="32">46 STEPHENNIE MULDER 96. Taylor, Vicinity, 27. 97. To my knowledge, the only other domed mausoleum any where that exceeded it in dimension at that date was that of Sultan Sanjar at Merv, built in the 1140s. Another pos sibility is the qubba at Bab Ibrahim in Mecca (destroyed), built in the tenth century and also praised for its extraordi nary height. It was said by Ibn Jubayr to be "almost as high as the adjacent minaret"; see Jonathan Bloom, "The Intro duction of the Muqarnas into Egypt," Muqarnas 5 (1988): 27. 98. The one Fatimid possibility, which although destroyed by the Ayyubids would certainly have been alive in memory, was the famous tomb of the Fatimid caliphs, the turbat al-zacfardn, which had been built in the Western Palace around 973. Though we do not know its exact dimensions, the building was extolled for its height. However, the turbat al-zacfaran was not a freestanding mausoleum, since it consisted of a separate room incorporated within the fabric of the pala tial complex; see EI2, s.v. "Turba," 674. 99. Maqrizi, Khitat, vol. 2, 299-300. Creswell has translated this passage in full; see MAE, vol. 2, 155. See also Jonathan Bloom "The Mosque of Baybars al-Bunduqdan in Cairo," Annates Islamologiques 18 (1982): 54, 64. Bloom has shown that like the al-ShafTi mausoleum the mosque of Baybars was the focus of an intra-Sunni dispute. According to ShafTi law, only one congregational mosque could be used for the Fri day khutba, and the Ayyubids had designated the mosque of al-Hakim for that function. During the reign of Baybars, however, an attempt was made to reinstate the khutba in the Mosque of al-Azhar. The ShafVi qadi reacted strongly in opposition. Bloom argues that the building of the mosque of Baybars was an attempt to placate ShafTi opposition to the pronouncement of the khutba in al-Azhar by providing a new congregational mosque for those adherents of other legal schools who were not bound by the ShafTi restriction, and who therefore wished to give the khutba elsewhere. Bay bars's well-known decision, in 1264, to elevate the qadi from each of the four schools of law to the rank of qadi al-qudat, a position held since Ayyubid times only by the ShafTis, was also the cause of conflict; see Bloom, "Mosque of Baybars," 62-64. 100.
