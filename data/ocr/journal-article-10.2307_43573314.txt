<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME GREEK COINS IN THE AMERICAN NUMISMATIC SOCIETY COLLECTION (See Plate XIII) The following selection of coins from a few widely-scattered mints is composed of recent acquisitions together with related pieces from the Newell Collection.1 Many of the types are apparently unpublished; other specimens have been included as variants or because they permit corrections in the descrip- tion or attribution of known issues. Cibyra, Cilicia ( ?) I. Head of Augustus r., bare. Rev . C€BACTOC around capricorn to 1., looking back. M (?) below. Border of dots. JE Î 17 mm. 3.75 grms. (From Pozzi Coll. but not listed in sale catalogue) A study of the coinage of Elaeusa- Sebaste led to the recon- sideration of this piece in the Newell Collection. The type is published by Mionnet (III, p. 660, No. 631) who gives the legend as C€BACT...ON and assigns the issue to Elaeusa. Imhoof-Blumer in his discussion of the coinage of that town (Revue suisse , 1898, p. 28) corrects Mionnet's reading to CCBACTOC with MV below and rejects the Elaeusa attri- bution, without suggesting any other mint possibility. Our piece is evidently the same type : the OC termination of the inscription is certain and the M V at least partially legible. 1 To Miss D. H. Cox I am indebted for permission to illustrate a coin of Cibyra from the Tarsus collection which she published. M. Jean Babelon and Drs. Eduard Holzmair and Karl Pink have provided reproductions and information regarding pieces in the Paris and Vienna Cabinets. I am most grateful for their assistance. 79</page><page sequence="2">8o A.N. S. MUSEUM NOTES Miss D. H. Cox in publishing a Tarsus coin collection in the Adana Museum (Num. Notes &amp; Monogr., No. 92) lists a coin of Cibyra, No. 84, which provides a clue to the origin of our piece. A comparison of the two specimens (Nos. 1 and A on Plate XIII) brings out clearly the close resemblance, par- ticularly striking in the rendering of the head of Augustus. Although the capricorn faces in opposite directions on the two coins, it is surrounded on both reverses with the ŒBACTOC form of the legend. The Adana piece, however, has KiBYPAT instead of M below. Miss Cox connects her Cibyra coin with two other bronzes of the same general type: one recorded by Imhoof- Blumer ( Monn . gr., p. 397, No. 88) with C€B KIBY- PATflN and the capricorn right, the other by Babelon ( Invent . Wadd ., No. 5819) with KIBYPATON and no direction specified for the capricorn. The first piece is 18 mm. in diameter; the second, like the Adana specimen and ours, is 17 mm. Our No. i seems to belong with these other Cibyra coins of Augustus. The group offers an interesting variety of inscrip- tions, but no one of them supplies definite proof as to which Cibyra issued the money since the CEB and CEBACTOC are to be associated with Augustus rather than with the town. Imhoof-Blumer and Babelon ascribe their coins to the Phry- gian Cibyra, while Miss Cox suggests that the Adana piece, as well another bronze in the same collection, may have been struck by the Cilician Cibyra - an attribution which is strengthened by the provenance of the collection and the large proportion of Cilician coins in it. On our specimen the MV is a puzzling variation of the legend. The K may be intended for the mint or the district and the M for MTyrpótroXis, but there is no epigraphical evidence known to me which would substantiate this title for either Cibyra.2 If the letters 2 Of the two, Cibyra in Phrygia would seem to have the better claim to the designation at the time of Augustus.

This little group of Elaeusa-Sebaste coins is of special interest in that it adds two new imperial issues to the known mint series of that Cilician town. Heretofore, it was assumed that the monetary output of Elaeusa ceased after the union with Cilicia in 74 A. D. and was resumed only in the time of Commodus to continue through the reign of Valerian.4 Our Nos. 2 and 4 prove states in the Cibyratica district. Little is known of the Cilician Cibyra during the same period; in Byzantine times it was of sufficient importance to give its name to the Cibyrrhaeote theme (Const. Porphyr., De Themata I, 38, 3). 8 For the significance of the letters in the field, see Miss Cox's interpretation (loc. cit., p- 23)- 4 Of earlier issues sometimes attributed to Elaeusa, Imhoof-Blumer ( Revue sutsse , 1898, pp. 28, 32 ff.) rejects the coin of Augustus (our No. 1 above) and questions the reading</page><page sequence="4">82 A.N. S. MUSEUM NOTES that the period of activity for the Elaeusa mint must beexten- ded to include Faustina II and Gallienus. The former may even have had some personal association with Elaeusa. She is known to have accompanied her husband on a tour through Asia Minor and to have died suddenly at the village of Halala, later renamed Faustinopolis, which is presumed to have been close to the Cilician gates and hence not too far from Elaeusa. The Faustina issue, acquired by the Society in 1948, must certainly be assigned to Elaeusa- Sebaste. The TTAPAAIOV points unmistakably to the Cilician island, the only one of five mint towns named Sebaste or Sebasteia which could legiti- mately claim to be a Sebaste-by-the- Sea. While theC€BACTH MHTPO of the legend is merely a continuation of the form customary on the later autonomous issues, the addition of the descriptive TTAPAAIOV is unique for the Elaeusa mint and, to the best of my knowledge, finds its only parallel in the coinage of another Cilician town, Antiocheia ad Cragum, whose earliest imperial pieces belong to the period of Antoninus Pius and Faustina II. The reverse type is suitable for Elaeusa, being in all probability an extremely primitive rendering of the same mummy-Artemis which appears on our Gallienus specimen, from the Newell Collection, and also on Elaeusa issues of Julia Domna and Crispina (No. B on Plate XIII, from the Paris Cabinet).6 This early mummy-shaped figure, placed on a spherical base, has arms crossed over the breast and a head of one ascribed to Trajan by Sestini {Lett. num. com., VIII, p. 96; Pl. II, 13). On the other hand he suggests that certain silver pieces of Nerva and Trajan, usually assigned to Caesarea in Cappadocia, may have been minted at Elaeusa. Wroth (B. M. C., Ga - latia, etc., p. xxxvi) argues on convincing grounds against this transfer. 5 Both the Crispina and Domna coins are published by Imhoof-Blumer - the first in Nomisma , 1913, PI. II, 24 and the second in Kleinasiatiscbe Münzen , II, Pl. XVII, 4. In each instance the author connects the type with Aphrodite Urania or Astarte. Now that we have on money of Gallienus a representation which is undoubtedly Artemis, the statue on the three earlier issues may plausibly be identified as the same goddess. Despite certain variations in dress and posture, the figure retains its distinctive mummi- form aspect throughout the series.</page><page sequence="5">GREEK COINS AT THE A.N.S. 85 which is little more than a pellet on a stalk with a vertical stroke at the top possibly intended to represent the polos. A similarly sketchy treatment of the head of the mummy- Artemis occurs on the money of Anemurium, but there the body is swathed in horizontal bandings which Hill (B. M. C., Lycaonia, etc., p.xli) suggests may be an attempt to indicate the bee form of Artemis. On our coin, however, there are traces of a dotted robe such as the goddess wears on the Gallienus specimen and on the coinage of Ephesus. From the three illustrated Elaeusa pieces, it is possible to see the deve- lopment of the mummy-Artemis type over a 75 year period. The engraver of the Faustina coin either had no clear con- ception of the device or was so cramped by the size of his flan as to be unable to do it justice. The Crispina piece, issued only a few years later, shows a decidedly more realistic treat- ment of the type, particularly with regard to the head. By the time of Gallienus the figure is definitely a cultus statue of Artemis in the Ephesian tradition but with variations such as one finds on the issues of Anemurium. Our No. 3, a bronze of Valerian from the Newell Collection,, is undoubtedly the type listed without illustration by Mionnet {Suffi., VII, p. 296, No. 568) after Sestini {Lett. num. cont.,. VIII, p. 98). The excellent preservation of our piece allows a correction in the earlier descriptions. The object in the right hand of Dionysos is not a bunch of grapes but a kantharos. held downward. Although the lower surface of the coin is somewhat worn, traces of an animal's head and tail suggest the traditional panther at the god's feet rather than a cista- mystica with emerging snake as reported by Mionnet. Bostra 5. Head of Antoninus Pius r., laureate. Border of dots. Rev . BO CT Ram standing to r. Border of dots. JE ' II mm. 1.80 grms. (From Flinders Petrie Coll.)</page><page sequence="6">84 A.N. S. MUSEUM NOTES Purchased by the Society in 1947, this coin is similar to three pieces in the Newell Collection.® The type is apparently unpublished. In size our coins are the smallest known to have been issued at Bostra, being most nearly comparable to the quasi-auto- nomous specimens with Tyche bust and camel (B. M. C., Arabia, etc., p. 16, Nos. 1-2). To all appearance the obverse is anepigraphic although the crudely executed portrait of the emperor fills the available space so fully as to make certainty impossible. The inadequacy of the flan for the device is particularly noticeable in the reverses. Only in the case of the illustrated coin is the complete body of the ram shown, while the border of dots, visible in part on several of the Newell specimens, is here almost entirely off flan. The abbreviated form of the inscription is also found on a larger denomination of Antoninus Pius, but the treatment on our coins is uncon- ventional: the first three letters reading downward from the lower right field, followed by a T which is reversed and placed upright in the exergue. The ram is undoubtedly to be associated with Zeus Ammon, who is frequently represented on the coins of Bostra. His bust appears as a reverse type from the time of Commodus on, while the standing figure of the god with a ram at his feet is used on money of Trajan Decius and probably also on issues of Elagabalus and Etruscilla.7 There has been considerable speculation as to the signi- 6 All three Newell bronzes were originally in the Rouvier Collection. They vary as follows: a. ' ii mm. 2.05 grms.; b. ļ 10 mm. 1.44 grms.; c. ļ 11 mm. 1.34 grms. 7 The clearest representation of Ammon and the ram is to be found on a coin of Trajan Decius, illustrated as Fig. 36 by C. R. Morey (Appendix to Div. II. Sect. A. Part 4 of Publications of the Princeton University Archaeological Expedition to Syria in 1904- 1905 and 1909). Two Elagabalus issues and one of Etruscilla show a standing figure with an animal at his feet. Morey describes one type (No. 24) as Ammon ( ř) and the other two (Nos. 25, 51) as Bacchus (Dusares); however, Hill (B. M. C., p. xxvii) believes that it is Zeus Ammon with a ram who is depicted on both the second and third pieces.</page><page sequence="7">GREEK COINS AT THE A.N.S. 85 ficance of the Ammon types at Bostra. Dussaud, writing in the Revue numismatique (1904, pp. 171 ff .), advances the theory that Zeus Ammon was identified with the Nabataean deity Dusares. It would then follow that the representations of the former on the coinage are to be taken as evidence not of a separate cult but rather of one aspect under which the local divinity was worshipped. In the introduction to the British Museum Catalogue, Hill follows Morey in rejecting the Am- mon-Dusares identification and attributing the Ammon cult to the influence of the Legio III Cyrenaica, which is mentioned in inscriptions from the time of Marcus Aurelius and later as having its headquarters at Bostra. Our coins do not solve the problem. They indicate that the cult of Ammon or Ammon-Dusares was already established at Bostra in the time of Antoninus Pius, but this does not rule out the proposed military origin. Although epigraphical evi- dence connecting the Legio III Cyrenaica with the Arabian capital dates from the reign of Marcus Aurelius, there is reason to believe that at an earlier period the legion was in Arabia and probably in Bostra itself.8 However, if the cults were sepa- rate in the beginning, it seems clear that they soon became closely linked in the popular mind. Throughout the Bostra coinage there is a striking parallelism in the representations of Zeus Ammon and the youthful Dusares. The earliest im- perial issues use the ram of Ammon and also the camel, which in all likelihood is to be associated with Dusares. With Com- modus the types become anthropomorphic as busts of the two deities appear on the coin reverses, while still later under Caracalla or Elagabalus, the picture is complete: Dusares on 6 See Kubitschek (Pauly-Wissowa, R . s. v. Legio , pp. 1 509-1 510) for the departure of the Legio III Cyrenaica from Alexandria between 120-127 A. D. and its possible establishment at Bostra during or at the end of Hadrian's Jewish campaign.</page><page sequence="8">86 A.N. S. MUSEUM NOTES his camel9 and Ammon with the ram at his feet. Furthermore, as Newell points out {Num. Chron 1923, p. 160), there is even a curious identity in the costume of the two gods. At times the busts are conventionally draped, again both are clad in the cuirass of the Roman soldier. Ptolemy of Mauretania 6. REX PTOLEMAEVS Bust of Ptolemy r., diademed and draped. Border of dots.

JR. / Broken. No. 9 is a fairly recent acquisition of the Society; the other Ptolemy pieces are from the Newell Collection. The second and fourth types seem to be unpublished, while the caduceus and cornucopiae issues bear dates hitherto unrecorded for those varieties. The winged caduceus, adopted as a coin device by Ptolemy at the very beginning of his reign, is used infrequently, either alone or in combination with other symbols. As the sole reverse type, it was struck in silver for the year i (Charrier, Monnaies de la Numidie, etc., No. 311) and in bronze for the year XVII 9 The identification of the camel-rider is that of Morey (loc. cit ., p. 13, Nos. 21-22), supported by Kubitschek {Num. Zeit.¡ 1916, p. 191). Hill (B. M. C., p. xxviii, n. 4) suggests the possibility of another Nabataean god.</page><page sequence="9">GREEK COINS AT THE A.N.S. 87 (Charrier, No. 322). Our No. 6 adds a silver issue for the year VI.10 No. 7 is a type apparently unknown in silver. Müller ( Numis- matique de l'ancienne Afrique, III) and Charrier list bronze coins with RA XV, RA XVI and RA XVII in a wreath, which is described by the former as oak and by the latter as laurel. Unfortunately the examples are not illustrated in either publi- cation, but one of the coins cited, in the Vienna Cabinet, has an unadorned oak wreath in contrast to our crown which seems to be of laurel. The rendering of the laurel band with its numerous berry clusters and three disks is unusual, while the omission of any device within the circle focusses further attention on the wreath itself. Crowns with a central jewel or medallion attach- ment are known from Hellenistic and Roman times and representations of them occur on the coinage of Augustus {cf. B. M. C., Coins of the Roman Empire, I, Pis. Iff.).11 Con- sidering the close ties between Rome and Mauretania at this period, there is a strong likelihood that the die engravers of Juba II and Ptolemy were influenced by the Roman coins 10 Another example of the caduceus type from the Aliotte de la Fuýe Collection (Ciani Sale, 1925, No. 1830) may represent still a third silver striking. The arrangement, with RA in the upper field to the left of the caduceus, differs from that on the coins of years I and VI, but from the photograph it is impossible to determine what numerals, if any, were originally inscribed to the right of the type. n One cannot be absolutely certain that the disks of the coin wreaths are intended to represent gems. On certain issues of the Bosporus kings (Syll. Cop., Bosporus , PI. 2) the object at the top of the circle is very like the round shield which appears on other reverses of the same series. Nevertheless for the Roman coinage, it would seem more reasonable to suppose that we have representations of the crowns given for services to the state, which Pliny (N. H., XXII. 4. 3) describes as gemmatae et aureae. An earlier reference to such a jewelled wreath is to be found in a Delian inscription of the second century B. C. (Homolle, B. C. H ., 1882, p. 32, lines 29-30) with its record of a gold crown with a carnelian in the center, a dedicatory offering of Queen Stratonice. For other examples of Hellenistic and Roman wreaths with gem or coin-like attach- ments, see Stephani's listing of objects from graves in South Russia ( Compte-rendu de la Comm. imp . arch . de St.-Pétersb ., 1875, PP* 16 ff.).</page><page sequence="10">88 A.N. S. MUSEUM NOTES when they occasionally embellished the plain laurel circlet with a jewel at the top (Charrier, Nos. 192, 360). The triple- gemmed wreath on our coin may be merely an additional elaboration or it may derive from the corona which Ptolemy received from Tiberius following the subjugation of Tac- farinas c. 24 A. D. (Tacitus, Ann., IV, 26). Ptolemy's pride in the insignia bestowed by Rome is revealed by the repeated use of the grouped sella curulis, sceptre and wreath as the reverse type for his silver issues and even for a rare gold piece. True, the wreath when shown in conjunction with the other objects has no indication of jewels, but that may have been due to the difficulty of reproducing such details in a small scale representation. Our coin shows evidence of restriking on the reverse. The original type may have been a capricorn issue of Ptolemy him- self; the lavishness with which the berry clusters are strewn on both sides of the frame of the wreath makes it hard to trace the underlying device. On the money of both Juba II and Ptolemy the cornucopiae and sceptre in saltire is a common reverse type. No. 8 is of particular interest in that it was struck in the year XI, a date which strangely enough is not otherwise represented on the published issues of Ptolemy. It seems clear, however, that on our piece the stroke below the fillet of the cornucopiae is a 1 to be connected with the preceding RAX. Except for the struggle against Tacfarinas, the reign of Ptolemy appears to have been singularly uneventful. Nothing in the records of the period explains this unique break in the coinage. Either there was a crisis of which we have no knowledge or the copious output of the years previous prompted a curtailment of mint opera- tions c. 31 A. D. Our No. 9 is distinguished from other issues of Ptolemy by the use of the single spear of wheat without any supplementary</page><page sequence="11">GREEK COINS AT THE A.N.S. 89 device. Ordinarily the regal silver carries two or three spears,, but in the case of one coin cited by Charrier (No. 401), which was minted in the same year as ours, there is a single spear shown with crossed thyrsi.
