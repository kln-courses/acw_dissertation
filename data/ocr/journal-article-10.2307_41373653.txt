DA VE Y Co-ordinaîor ; Science and Engineering Research Council Robotics Programme , am/ GEC Senior Research Fellow in Robotics , Sr. Cross College , Oxford ' delivered to the Society on Monday 21st March 1983 ' with the Lord Gregson in the Chair THECHAlRMAN:AsIsaid when we began this series of lectures, the Society has been very fortunate in securing people of the highest standard and the highest reputation in the business to present this subject. That is certainly true to-night with Peter Davey. After start- ing with GEC Applied Electronics Laboratories at Stanmore, and going on to work as an engineer at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley, California, he returned to Europe in 1964 to help set up a new in- stitute for high energy physics at the University of Heidelberg in Germany, and has now gone back to Oxford where he does two jobs at the same time. He is the Co-ordinator for the Science and Engineering Research Council's Industrial Robotics Initiative, which is a UK-wide programme in universities, poly- technics and industry, and he is also leading a research team, working on an improved sensor-guided arc- welding robot in conjunction with an industrial support unit. So we have in Peter Davey a many who is going to show us the future of robotics. The following lecture , which was illustrated, was then delivered. INTRODUCTION TWO facturing robot EARLIER applications process Cantor and in relation future lectures prospects to have the treated manu- for robot applications in relation to the manu- facturing process and future prospects for robots in a changing world. In this lecture robotics research is presented from a more theoretical point of view, whilst relating it to present limita- tions and future practical possibilities for complete robotic systems. Robotics research to-day is about nothing less than the extension of the programming of deci- sions within computers, toward the programming of actions in the real world. It is a research field in the crucible. A structure is beginning to emerge which was not visible even a few years ago, but to establish a firm theoretical basis for different parts of this structure is going to take twenty years of most exciting research. The work will involve a fusion of many hitherto distinct academic dis- ciplines: for example, the skills of electronics and computing engineers must merge with those expert in manufacturing processes. Not only in universities and polytechnics but also in industry, there will be parallel fusion occurring. Here the traditionally distinct rôles of the product designer, the prototype machinist and the production engineer must merge. All this work will make possible within a few years the widespread use of 'second generation' robotic systems. Physically, these may resemble assembly stations on a transfer line or unmanned vehicles - mobile robots - as much as the usual anthropomorphic manipulator. Such machines are invaluable in the context of flexible manu- facture in the factory because they can make use of sensors to cope accurately with minor devia- tions in their surroundings - especially in the parts and processes they are handling. There is some parallel in the transition from eighteenth- century warfare based on highly regimented, 'inflexible' units facing each other in closed squares, to present day guerilla warfare where a high degree of autonomy is given to the local commander and even to the fighting man himself. This transition has only been made possible by training a high degree of intelligence in each soldier - rather than just dumb obedience - and then providing sophisticated intelligence gathering and communication systems, just as we are now seeing in sensor systems and com- munication networks on the factory floor. 671</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS PROCEEDINGS Although second generation robots are some- times termed 'intelligent', that word would be best reserved for a future generation, able to plan their actions themselves. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the robots we are evolving now exhibit a certain amount of 'com- mon sense'. But as with craftsmen, so with robots; common sense, or any higher skill, simply is not required if the production engineer can make all aspects of the process sufficiently perfect; that is if the battle can be fought under completely orderly conditions. Perfection in the manufac- turing environment is costly, however, and so an important part of many areas of robot research is to help firm up the relative costing of these two different approaches: a more determinate pro- duction process versus use of robots having more common sense. LIMITATIONS AND POSSIBILITIES OF CURRENT TECHNOLOGY Let us consider what happens to-day even with the best robot devices currently available, when we try to integrate them into a complex system consisting of a computer, one or more manipu- lators (or mobile robots) and a number of sensors. What we find can be classified as limitations in perception, in decision and in action. Consider limitations in perception. A 'common sense' robot will include within its memory at least some model (computer representation) of itself, its surroundings and the parts known to be within its immediate workspace. But objects entering this workspace - either arriving on a conveyor system, or being approached by a mobile robot - are not perfectly known a priori. Even if the programmer has defined a small range of possible objects, the robot must use its sensory equipment to establish where and what they are, and in what attitude. But there are many prob- lems in using actual sensors. Acuity is limited; there are difficulties with ruggedness and place- ment, sensors that give good lateral information give poor range information, and vice versa; and above all the great quantity of data produced by devices like cameras and ultrasound scanners viewing a three-dimensional scene can seldom be processed quickly and cheaply enough by to-day's techniques to yield useful control information for the robot. Not just routine 'image processing', but much higher level pattern recognition or 'image understanding' functions are required - and these have been found notoriously difficult 672 to implement on computers during the last two decades. Of course, research on techniques for image analysis is crucial to a wide range of appli- cations, from remote sensing of earth resources to diagnosis of medical images, but industrial automation places specially tight constraints on speed and cost. Limitations in decision-making are found in the supervisory computer. They happen purely because of the great complexity of the situations being handled. Programming a computer to detect, understand and manage three-dimensional objects in the real world is a completely different kind of task from programming it to do compli- cated numerical manipulation. The shortcomings of the program centre around the need for better representation of 3D objects, better ways of reasoning about relationships between these objects and ways of dealing with the combina- tion of deviations of many random variables. Although the program of the computer can be relied upon to work perfectly in the sense of reproducing the logic that the industrial pro- grammer intended, the software aids are simply not yet of a standard to make his task feasible in all but the simplest situations. Limitations on action are legion. First, we come across all the problems to be expected with relatively complicated mechanical devices. Although the mean time between failures for robots is around 700 hours - good in comparison with that of many other machine tools - all such machines suffer from wear and imprecision in their joints, requiring periodic calibration to take care of changes in electronics and mechanics. In particular, if one robot is exchanged for another, unless careful calibration and measurement has been applied to each one, the same program may result in differences in position of many milli- metres within a working volume of one or two cubic metres. The manipulator is even more un- predictable in one important way: its structure in- evitably deflects in complicated ways when moving heavy loads with high acceleration. The forces due to inertia will cause striking errors in flight between the programmed and the actual path, which may lead to collisions which could not have been foreseen from static considerations. All this means that the programmer can no longer be con- fident that the position of the tool or workpiece at- tached to the end of the robot arm will comply with his program; static errors will be consider- able and dynamic errors may be quite horrific.</page><page sequence="3">OCTOBER 1983 ROBOTICS III It may be worth giving some examples of what we can and cannot do when constructing robot systems around present-day components. First, robots to-day are not the least like the universal robots that were confidently expected some years ago. Only in the software do we see an increase in universality: for example, provision of modules for communication, or conversion from Cartesian to joint co-ordinate systems. Taking into account all the kinds of limitations described above, we can design an effective robot for a task like paint spraying or one that is effective for spot welding, but mechanical design alone will preclude efficient use of the same robot for both these different tasks. This is a pity: to attain complete flexibility in our attack on industrial production, we would ideally wish to have a single type of universal robot so that changes to the program alone will be sufficient to make it undertake different tasks. What is happening at the moment is a trend away from universality, which is resulting in a limited number of generic types of robot for the most commonly met tasks, such as surface finish- ing, spot welding, continuous processes like arc welding or gluing, and finally, assembly. Assembly is a task which it is particularly important to get done efficiently by future robots. Some 30 per cent of the whole manufacturing workforce of developed countries is estimated to be engaged in assembly. At present it is possible to use robots to put together assemblies as com- plicated as a tape recorder, and this has been done in Japan on a trial basis, but the result is unbelievably slow and the grippers and fixtures associated with the robot turn out to be rather particular to the components being assembled. The result is that the cost of changing from one assembly to another may be very high indeed, far higher than the mere cost of reprogramming. Future robots will be expected to work not only on the shop floor but also in environments with less orderliness, such as in mines, in radiation areas, or undersea. At the moment we can build remote manipulator machinery which in effect extends the human operator's sensory and motor organs so that the operator can at least be removed from hazardous areas. Used in the classic way, they are slow, ponderous and very tiring for the human operator; they are only beginning to be equipped with enough computer power to let them undertake some part of their work autono- mously but this will became an important strand in future robotics research. FIGURE l. The manufacturing view of robotics. The complete manufacturing system is viewed as a ' black box ' converting resources into the wanted product Some tasks for which we should like to build robotic systems involve combining a high degree of dexterity with high speed, for example robots for the clothing industry. At present a programm- able robot simply cannot compete in terms of speed with dedicated textile machinery, yet there would be advantages here too if production could be made more flexible and adaptable. The research model for many of these very fast applications is ball playing. Classic work by Professor Fujii and his associates at the University of Tokyo resulted in a manipulator fast and agile enough to go through the motions of throwing a ball most convincingly, it could even be demonstrated throwing the ball into a waste-paper basket - seemingly a prodigious feat of programming until Fujii genially disclosed that what he actually did was to move the waste basket to the point where the ball generally fell! Computers can be programmed to play board games up to and including chess at a reasonable Club level, but so far there is no hope at all of our programming a robot to play ping-pong. This simply epitomizes the difficulty we have in try- ing to extend computer techniques into the real physical world. THE STRUCTURE OF CURRENT ROBOTICS RESEARCH A structure is now becoming visible in the sort of research work needed to allow us to make funda- mental improvements in applications like the ones just mentioned. I will briefly describe the current work of selected research groups in relation to 673</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS PROCEEDINGS FIGURE 2. The programming view of robotics. This illustrates the main software modules required for an ' intelligent 3 robotic system this structure, which may be viewed from several different angles. The first of these, summed up in Figure 1, can be called the manufacturing view of robotics, and consists of determining what can be expected when we put different components - computers, actuators, sensors - into robotic systems to carry out specific manufacturing tasks. Much of this work might in the purest sense be disqualified from being called 'research' in that it does not extend our total knowledge by answer- ing fundamental questions. Instead its object is generally to provide the detailed information which is required as a crucial component in 674 designing and managing novel production systems. For example, work by Pitts at Southampton concentrates on the arrow 'Authorization', in the sense of what is to be manufactured by the system. He attempts to decompose thé product into 'features', defining these in such a way that both the designer and the manufacturing engineer can examine together all implications of design changes. Each feature has a recognizable func- tional value and a definable cost implication relative to the robots or other machines used to produce it. An illustration is in the production of air conditioning units from sheet metal.</page><page sequence="5">OCTOBER 1983 ROBOTICS III FIGURE 3. The manipulator view of robotics. This includes mechanical and control engineering applied to a wide variety of fixed and mobile manipulators , tools and grippers FIGURE 4. The sensor view of robotics. This includes study of transducers and associated real-time software for analysing the raw data Figures 2, 3 &amp; 4 show three further views of the structure of robotics research, in which the emphasis is more an analysis of particular elements in a robotic system and how to improve them. The first and most important view is shown in Figure 2. This shows a typical set of software modules which we believe will be neces- sary in order to give sufficient decision-making capability to robot systems. In this view we see the manipulator, or several manipulators, inter- acting with a process in the bottom part of the picture. Software below the lower dotted line runs online, that is, it is being executed all the time that the process is in operation; it is con- cerned with controlling the manipulator in accor- dance with the presence and movement of objects as detected by sensors. This software is specific to the application; it runs in a local computer generally embedded in the robot controller, under the supervision of a real time operating system. The operating system is analogous to the operating system found on a mini computer and is independent of particular applications. Above the dotted line are the modules required for programming such systems off-line, that is, for teaching the robot sufficient information to define trajectories, actions, and how to take deci- sions conditional on the data it derives from the sensors. It is not surprising to find that work on three- dimensional body modelling forms an import- ant part of this research. De Pennington's group at Leeds, working in collaboration with a group of firms, has extended the constructive-solid- geometry (CSG) modeller NON AME for use in modelling robots and their environment. In par- ticular, his research is attacking the general pro- blem of determining whether, and where, two mechanical parts occupy the same space at the same time. The problem here is to find algorithms which ensure detection of clashes, yet can be computed in a reasonably short time. Leeds chose to determine the swept volumes by using the union of swept spheres: Figure 5 shows the power of this method in finding a clash between two moving robot arms co-operating in a model assembly task. Another crucial module in Figure 2 is devoted to simulation and visualization of the program as it is being produced to allow the engineer to envisage, and interact with, the program he is generating. Bonney's work at Nottingham Uni- versity, linked to the Production Engineering Research Association, has been used quite widely by several firms to produce 'movies' to help the production engineer (and even more important, his manager!) to convince himself through simu- lation that a particular robot will work together with moving conveyors, etc., to achieve the required cycle time in production. Figure 6 shows four robots in simulated spot- welding of a vehicle cab. 675</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS PROCEEDINGS FIGURE 5. Leeds NON AME system: the solid lines near the top of the picture define a * clash 3 between two co-operating robot arms, automatically detected by the program The two central blocks in the top of the picture 'process planner' and 'object programming system', represent automatic procedures for breaking down plans expressed by the engineer in a most general way, for example, 'assemble carburettor type 6' into the intricate series of individual trajectories and commands needed to move each component in turn into its right posi- tion and mate it with the others. These modules make use of a body modeller, but in addition need to be able to make deductions about relationships FIGURE 6. Nottingham GRASP system: a simulation of four robots spot-welding a vehicle cab 676 between the bodies thus modelled, that is, to carry out geometric reasoning. The key ideas embodied in the RAPT system for geometric reasoning, proposed in 1978 by Popplestone at Edinburgh, are novel mathematical means of representing relationships such as touching, turning, sliding, etc., between individually modelled 3D objects. In future research at Edin- burgh it is hoped to unite this work with the CSG modelling facilities developed at Leeds and mentioned above. In Figure 3, we see robotics research from the manipulator viewpoint^ that is the searchlight is turned on to the bottom right hand part of Figure 2. In this view it is the manipulator which dominates along with the means of improving it, cheapening it and controlling it optimally - ways to reduce the limitations on action men- tioned above. This work of course include mobile robots such as those being developed by Larcombe at Warwick. This comprises protection, naviga- tion and guidance systems based on computer integration of tactile, ultrasonic and optical sensors. Figure 7 shows a small industrial truck fitted experimentally with such systems.</page><page sequence="7">OCTOBER 1983 ROBOTICS III FIGURE 7. Warwick : a small industrial truck or ' mobile roboť fitted with sensor systems for self-navigating, self-guidance and protection FIGURE 8. GEC Marconi Ltd: an experimental all-parallel manipulator for use in assembly To show that robotic research is by no means restricted to the university community, a similar free-ranging truck has been developed at GEC Electrical Projects Ltd, Rugby, able to navigate itself by reference to an optical marker beacon. In addition, Figure 8 shows a highly innovative 6-degree-of-freedom robot intended for fast assembly operations. Conceived by Streeter at GEC Marconi Research Laboratories, Great Baddow, and called GADFLY, it uses an all- parallel linkage to give much higher speed and stiffness than the various types of serial linkage used in conventional anthropomorphic robots. Other examples of work in this area are attempts to improve the control of extremely flexible arms, for example, those of Roth and his asso- ciates at Stanford. Since all heavily loaded robots moving at really high speed will deflect considerably, the Stanford approach is to study the design and control of an arm that is deliber- ately made flexible - almost like a fishing rod- Every fisherman knows that with sufficient co- ordinated skill of eye and hand&gt; even an extra- ordinarily flexible rod can put a fly with great precision in the desired place. The current 677</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS PROCEEDINGS FIGURE 9. Stanford: the Salisbury hand having two fingers and opposing thumb , each with 3 degrees of freedom research arm at Stanford is deliberately built to be extremely flexible in one lateral axis yet (unlike a fishing rod) rigid in the other. Results have been encouraging in attempts to drive it from the motor at one end so as to move the other with a minimum of overshoot. Particularly fine work also in the manipulator area is that of Salisbury, now at MIT. A student of Professor Roth, he has considered the follow- ing question. Given the desired working volume for a robot gripper, and given the types of object it is required to grip and move in that volume, can an optimal configuration of links in the arm and in the hand be derived? The best example of his work so far is the hand with two fingers and opposing thumb each having 3 degrees of free- dom, shown in Figure 9. Salisbury arrived at this design by first establishing a rational basis for analysing the geometry of fingers and grasps; ac- ceptable designs being those which would com- pletely restrain the grasped object. A group of 600 potential hand arrangements was next mathematically reduced to a small subset of acceptable designs. The 9 link design shown can produce 3 point contact on grasped objects which, with appropriate friction forces introduced by a pad at each contact point, is sufficient to hold 678 stably any 3D object. (To manipulate objects in the hand - for example, to twiddle a baton - requires of course an extra contact point.) Figure 4 shows the final view of the structure of robotics research. This is the sensor view and it focuses on the bottom left-hand part of Figure 2. It is concerned not just with the design of the sensors themselves, but even more importantly of cheap, fast acting image processing and image understanding procedures which can transform the raw data from the sensors themselves into simple signals to be used to feed back and con- trol the manipulator or vehicle. This work ranges from theoretical studies of better algorithms for simplifying the vast mass of data from a camera, through to the design of sensors which are severely constrained by the physical process that they have to monitor. An example of the former, theoretical, type of research is that of Davies at Royal Holloway College, Egham. Figure 10 shows results of a fast, accurate method for identifying the edge of an object - here a biscuit - partially obscured by others. The extraordinary efficiency with which our own eye and brain carry out tasks like this makes it hard to grasp how difficult a research problem it is to design efficient computer programs to do</page><page sequence="9">OCTOBER 1983 ROBOTICS III FIGURE 10. Royal Holloway College : results of a fast , accurate algorithm for identifying a partially obscured round object the same thing. An example of work in the sensor area dominated by difficulties introduced by the process being controlled is that of my own group at Oxford: the study of sensor systems suitable for controlling arc welding robots so as to make reliable joints in thin sheet metal even when the positions of the edges to be joined is not accurately known beforehand. Figure 11 shows welding controlled by a compact prototype sensor con- taining a laser and semiconductor camera chip, packaged in a small cylinder right around a welding torch arid able to survive within a few centimetres of the arc itself. Another major field in this area of research is the attempt to build 'smart sensors', that is to devise image processing algorithms, together with special purpose computers which can be made cheap enough to be integrated with the sen- sors themselves and spread liberally through a flexible manufacturing system. Work by Kittler's group at SERC's Rutherford Laboratory work- ing with Computer Recognition Systems Ltd. is attacking this problem in order to develop smart sensors able to carry out image-processing opera- tions like those shown in Figures 12a and 12b - high speed automatic inspection of sparking plugs. OUTSTANDING RESEARCH GOALS Each of the above areas contains a few funda- mental research issues. In the 'manufacturing view', a crucial question is research on the management of robotic and flexible manufacturing systems in which the buffer storage between individual processes is FIGURE 11. Oxford: a MIG welding robot controlled by an experimental laser/camera sensor reduced to a minimum. Also in this area there is important work on the full understanding of the forces and torques involved in the mating of mechanical parts. This work was pioneered at the CS Draper Lab at MIT and led in 1978 to an important discovery, that the insertion of many symmetrical parts into corresponding holes can be achieved by means of a purely passive remote centre-of-compliance device, the so called RCC. Research of this kind must be linked tightly to basic studies of how best to design products for assembly by robots. In the 'programming view', the most important future work lies in development of new concepts to help computers carry out geometric reasoning about relationships between objects in thç physical world, and particularly in the ability to program robots in the face of combinations of many variables whose values are independently derived from sensors. Complexity arising from the combinations of uncertainty in all possible variables is so high that it seems the extensive use of symbolic logic - not just extensions of conventional computer-aided design - may be essential to ensure programs which are complete and exact under these conditions. 679</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS PROCEEDINGS (a) (b) FIGURE 12. Computer Recognition Systems Lté high-speed inspection of sparking plugs: (a) image as seen by camera ; (b) results of edge-finding algorithm In the 'manipulator view', two important long range goals are to further develop (1) optimal design of linkages for particular work spaces, and (2) algorithms for optimal dynamic control, taking into account inertia and deflection in every link of a multiple jointed manipulator. Finally, in the 'sensor view', probably the most difficult research is towards developing fast systems for image understanding which are model-driven, that is they are able to make use of a priori information derived from a geometric modeller to predict the likely appearance of the 2D images caused by inclusion of particular 3D objects in a scene, both individually and when overlapping others. Work on building true stereo vision systems fast enough for industrial use will be another major challenge. BRITAIN'S PLACE IN ROBOTICS RESEARCH There is no doubt that the major US laboratories, particularly Stanford, MIT and Carnegie Mellon University, are the world leaders, and have been 680 for many years, in fundamental research in many of the fields I have discussed. It must be said, however, that the very advanced fundamental research in the US is so far ahead of industrial applications, that many production engineers there believe that the most important thing is simply to make good use of all techniques that already exist. In Japan the incredibly successful use of robots in real manufacturing situations has so far been achieved from a base of relatively little good academic research. Their strength so far has been in using to-day's (or even yesterday's) tech- niques in an accurate, timely way to secure the best possible return in production, economy and quality. The Japanese recognize, Jiowever, that if they are to stay ahead, they may be forced to raise the level of their own longer ränge research; in particular research into programming and Artificial Intelligence techniques. It is note- worthy that the report of a recent Japanese interest group on off-line programming systems within the CAM-I organization has put forward a pro- gramme for research looking remarkably like Figure 2.</page><page sequence="11">OCTOBER 1983 ROBOTICS III In Germany, robot research has mainly been concentrated on excellent systems studies of the kind shown in Figure 1 . The arrangements for transferring such technology from academy to industry are, however, better institutionalized in Germany than in any other country: they are centred upon the Fraunhofer Institutes. French and Italian work has been of a very fundamental kind, dealing with important long-range ques- tions, but so far has not been particularly well linked into solution of actual problems in the production environment. The UK also has always had excellent funda- mental research in areas crucial to robotics such as dynamic control, geometric modelling, geo- metric reasoning, simulation, and advanced pro- gramming technique. Work in these areas is certainly world class, equal to the best in the USA. The main problem, in robotics as in many other areas of engineering research, has been the relative weakness of research on rather shorter timescales, say three to five years, which will link this advanced work to development of actual industrial applications. The co-ordinated national research programme in Industrial Robotics launched by the Science and Engineering Research Council is based largely on execution of research in joint University/Industry teams. This is just one of several trends which should result in a more nearly ideal spread of research effort across the whole spectrum from longer range research through to short-range industrial development. At the moment, I think we can claim that Britain is overall in the first league of robotics research, but somewhere near the bottom of it. THE WAY AHEAD In his 1923 play, Russoms Universal Robots, Karel Capek makes Helena ask Dr. Call, 'Oh, Doctor, what's going to become of people?'. He replies 'God knows, Madame Helena, it looks to us scientists like the end!'. When will 'robots with common sense' become widely used? Is 'the end' really in sight, for robotics research, let alone for the human race? I believe that in order to maintain international competitiveness, robots with common sense, able to cope economically with errors and short- comings in the world around them, will be widely used as one important tool in advanced flexible manufacture within four or five years. By that time, many developed countries will have learned how to use this new tool in order to automate reliably a range of factory operations, including assembly of moderately complex electrical and mechanical products. But this is only a small beginning in the exploitation of robotics research. After the emergence of 'common sense' robots, later products will include 'intelligent' robots able to form their own detailed plans, from quite loosely defined instructions, working in more hostile environments than the factory: these will imply the extension of large, complex computing systems into the physical world. The research needed to do this will be one of the most exciting and most demanding areas for young engineers to work in over the next ten to fifteen years. I hope that this time will be used by Western countries as the breathing space in which to reflect on the even more demanding problems of how to base our society on less work and more leisure. Countries which do not nur- ture this research, and ensure the flow of robotic products into their industries, may so quickly become uncompetitive in world markets that the ensuing steep rise in unemployment forces traumatic social change, and allows no such breathing space whatever. DISCUSSION THE CHAIRMAN: One message that comes over fairly clearly is the importance of the software. A lot more hardware exists than software to drive it. I wonder what will happen when a third-generation robot meets the fifth generation of computers, which by the Japanese timescale is due to happen in three and a half years from now. MR. T. B. HOBROUGH (Automatic Vision Cor- poration, Vancouver, Canada): Rather early on in your lecture you discussed the shortcomings of robots and in particular the shortcomings of manipulators. It struck me at the time that most of the shortcomings that you mentioned were actually sensory shortcomings rather than manipulative shortcomings. Then later on you mentioned that you had greater hope for structured light approaches to visual perception rather than a straight-on approach to 3-D. Why do you say that? THE LECTURER: Those questions are so lovely that they might have been planted! Perhaps I did not go quite far enough back. The sort of shortcoming 681</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS PROCEEDINGS that leads to all the others is that robots can operate perfectly well within cycle times of two seconds, five seconds, six seconds, but if you start trying to make a robot system (and there is no reason why you should not) work with cycle times of 0.2 of a second to 0.6 of a second, you are completely snookered. There is no fine tinkering that is going to allow you to do that. There are serious shortcomings within the mechanical design of robots themselves that are going to force you to use unusual materials, very lightweight structures, that are going to deflect horrendously, and you are then going to have to learn to control those properly. If you mean then that the way to control them properly may well be to use sensors to help you do it, of course I am with you, but I think the arms themselves are going to have to change greatly. I do not have a picture with me to explain to the audience what structured light is all about, but the idea in its simplest form is that if you want to look at a 3-D object and understand its shape, let us say the corner of the desk here, one way to do it is to set yourself up with a single camera and shine sheets of light from the side, at some finite angle to the optic axis of the camera, and then look at the resulting 2-D image. You can imagine the intersection of the bright sheet of light with the 3-D surface gives you a set of kinky lines. Those lines are a lot easier to interpret in the camera than the rather subtle collection of grey levels which is the image of that same object under ordinary illumina- tion conditions. In industrial automation, unlike, say, in remote sensing of satellite data, or even automative navigation of cars or buses down a street, we are quite often in the position to impose the sort of illumination we want on the things we are looking at. And that seems to me to open the door to wide use of this structured light technique. MR. MERVYN OLIVER PRAGNELL: What sort of inferences would be, or perhaps are, allowed from perceptual reports? I mean, more specifically, would those statements which are logically implied by a set of perceptual reports be inferable? THE LECTURER: Your question is of some depth and is of a philosophical nature. I am unable to answer it. I stand revealed as a rather practical bloke! MR. PRAGNELL: It is mathematical rather than philosophical. Could I try to help you in a way? There is a book to be published by MIT Press in July 1983, by a distinguished logician called Jon Barwise entitled Situation Semantics, and I think you might find that the answer is in that publication. THE LECTURER: Thank you very much. the chairman: It is a rapidly developing field. DR. BERNARD garland (School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Kingston Poly- 682 technic): Coming back to structured light, could the speaker say whether it is as expensive on data process- ing time as a normal pattern recognition scheme iden- tifying different grey levels? the LECTURER: It is very much lighter on data processing time, because in a structured light image in principle all the information is contained in binary form. If you take my example of the sheet of light and a 3-D object, the only features of the image you are in- terested in are the collection of very thin, bright lines, and all the rest can be taken as dark. In principle you are dealing with a simple binary image. That is, as I am sure you will appreciate, enormously much lighter in computation time than trying to treat a picture com- posed of a hundred different grey levels, which is a very subtle business indeed. DR. GARLAND: Is structured light a practical proposition? the lecturer: Yes. The first industrially useful demonstration of it was the General Motors Consight, and that must go back to 1977. Ever since then there has been lots of very practical work using it. Our own at Oxford is using it in an exceptionally horrendous environment, that is about an inch away from a two kilowatt arc. MR. KENNETH MARSHALL: Looking into the future: are we in any danger of getting into a situation where the robot mechanization just cannot cope with an unexpected situation? It might happen underground, or it might happen with a big fire situation, it might happen in an atomic plant, and in a situation like that has the psychological side got to progress so that people have sufficient confidence to put their lives in the hands of robots? Some unfavourable incident might set back the whole progress of innovation. the lecturer: Teaching robots to deal with catastrophes is most important. That sort of thinking derives from teaching robots to deal with fairly simple accidents. We have a name for it now; we call it error- recovery in robot systems. How can a robot work station get going again in the event that a part has simply been dropped from its gripper, and is therefore knocking around the workspace somewhere? You would like to pick up the part if possible; if not, at least to clear it out of the way. Now that is a very nice field in itself and it sits within the programming view of robotics. I think, however, in all these systems, if you talk about catas- trophes of a kind that are serious to people, then we are a very long way indeed from handing the job over to robots, whether it is maintenance in á radioactive area or anything else. The correct way to work robots into that kind of task is to think of them as freeing the human operator to take the more important, the really difficult,</page><page sequence="13">OCTOBER 1983 ROBOTICS III decisions. I do not know the situation at Three Mile Island, but it might be that part of the problem was that those operators were so inundated with data from a myriad sensors that they could not see the wood for the trees. Probably we would be better occupied study- ing the psychology of people under stress and giving them the best possible robotic tools to allow them to work under stressful conditions where catastrophes might occur, rather than attempting to transplant some of those theories into robotic software. MR. L. W. B. AUGARDE: Would you say that a lot of robotic research has been limited by thinking of them as devices which would replicate human behaviour and just reproduce human performance? The word itself comes from the word 'worker', and have we dwelt rather too much on that? Could we have released intel- lectual energy a little more if we had taken a wider view? THELECTURER: Certainly we could have released intellectual energy. There have been major explosions of intellectual energy in various directions over several decades, generally heading off into the blue sky, and we could release it as you say by not constraining it at all to the limitations of human performance. How- ever, I am not so sure that we could have made better robotic manufacturing systems so far by thinking along those more radical lines. The reason is very simple; generally we are trying to use robots as just one adjunct of a line that already is using conventional tools, and is using people at other points. So there is a good reason why robots have tended to work in the same sort of working volume, that is about one metre cube, that people work in. If you look into the future of course that is going to be different. The most telling way of putting that I think is the point that Dr. R. B. Sims often makes; very often if you are thinking of building a product say the size of this projector, you start off by building a factory and workshops about as high as this ceiling (although not quite as elegant!) and then you set out your robots and machine tools at about four foot six from the ground. This is because people are involved. Now as soon as you can make your robotic systems so good that the people largely disappear from the picture, then of course the factory to produce that projector is scaled to that size. You can imagine the whole produc- tion happening in a kind of dark lightless tunnel two feet by two feet, and the manager in industry can then save enormously on the building costs, the cost of heating, lighting and ventilating and all the rest of it. So in summary I think we could not have made pro- gress faster towards the practical robot systems in use now by freeing ourselves from the human scale con- siderations, but in the future we should be very careful not to rule out scaling down or scaling up. There are good examples of both. There are little robots produced now for fine assemblies like watches with a working volume of about ten centimetres cubed and with precision (if you believe the Japanese) down to about four microns. At the other end of the scale you have Lamberton Robotics up in Scotland producing robots for handling forgings weighing I think twenty tons, where the robot system is about a quarter of the size of this room. So I think we are beginning to see the different scales appearing, and they will probably appear more as time goes on. MR. D. s. RICHARDS: Are there any practical ways of getting an absolute position in a working volume? THE LECTURER: That is a question dear to my heart. I nearly launched a competition through the Science and Engineering Research Council for the best idea for independent measurement of the position of a robot's end effector within its working volume using external sensors. Everybody jumps in straight away and says 4 Yes, no problem. Imagine triangulation with laser beams or automated theodolite methods'. Of course they all fall down on one incredibly simple thing, which is the dense packing of equipment which obstructs a typical robot workplace. I wish I had a picture to show you. You would see that it becomes extremely difficult because you can never rely on getting line of sight to one or more transducers. It will be a great day when eventually we can forget about relying on the values of a series of encoders at every joint of a serial mechanism in order to assess where the end effector, where the hand actually is. That day will come. MR. RICHARDS: Inertial guidance systems? the LECTURER: Yes, indeed. Show me an inertial guidance system costing around £1,000 instead of £40,000 or so. I think the cheapest inertial guidance system is of that order. We would use them like a shot. It is a lovely bit of metrology for somebody. At the moment, however, it is difficult to do accurate perfor- mance measurements of a robot even under test stand conditions. You can put it on a surface table two metres by three metres, and you can make beautiful static measurements of its accuracy in space and the angles of the wrist in space, but if you start trying to make those measurements when it is in flight at three metres a second from A to B, much of the classical instrumenta- tion breaks down. There, however we can assume line of sight contact, and that means several practical solu- tions are in sight. THE CHAIRMAN: I suppose the ultimate answer has got to be bring laser gyros down to miniature sizes. We are not very far off. I should imagine it will not be too long before you have implant systems. MR. M. C. McCARTHY(Departmentoflndustry): I wonder if the speaker would comment on the econo- mics of the subject. 683</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS PROCEEDINGS THE LECTURER: Research on economic justifica- tion of using robots in many different processes is an extremely important part of robotics research. It fits into the first picture that I drew, what I call the manu- facturing view of robotics. That is, people view it as a black box, and all they are interested in is the capital cost and the running cost and the value added to the product as it passes through. I think there is a fair amount of good work going on in Britain, ranging from the more academic work in universities through to excellent work in the research associations and govern- ment laboratories, which I feel are pretty well placed to do that sort of thing; for instance, PERA and the Na- tional Engineering Laboratory. I used the economic argument to focus our own work at Oxford right at the beginning. Although to try to put an optical guidance system on the end of a welding torch was clearly going to be a most delightful piece of research in instrumen- tation and computing, the question was very seriously raised, 'C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre' - or was it? It was indeed la guerre! It would have cost £260,000 to equip the press shop to such an accuracy that it could produce pressings that could be welded by a dumb first-generation robot, whereas even at the wildest estimate, the system that we are producing at Oxford, if it proves feasible, will have an added cost of about £15,000 per robot. I think a fair amount of atten- tion in research laboratories is being paid to econo- mics. I would not want to see the subject expanded to the detriment of all speculative technological research. MR. JOHN LOMAX, CEng, M I Mech E (Thames Poly- technic): Mr. Chairman, a year ago I compared a sur- vey on the needs of robot users, the improvements they wanted, with a list of SERC funded research. Robot users want increased speed, easier programm- ing. The SERC funded sensors and locomotion. There are obviously several reasons for this, and I wonder if the speaker would like to comment? the LECTURER: I value that survey. Do you mean the one done at Imperial College, by King and Lau?* MR. LOMAX: Yes. the LECTURER: I studied that carefully, and it gave me a lot of food for thought. What I decided in the end was that indeed we were backing the sort of research that would lead to the attributes that the users wanted. It is just that if you ask a user what he wants, that is not the same as correctly defining the piece of research needed to get it. For example, users did want speed in robots, and therefore it was obviously impor- tant to have several groups working on robot dyna- mics, which we already funded. Equally though, as * King and Lau, 'Robotics in the UK', Industrial Robot, March 1981, p. 32. 684 one of my other questioners suggested, if you want to make robots really fast then sensors are crucial, because if robots get very flexible indeed, you must have eventually a set of sensors in the end effector which is able to help you control this very whippy movement. Literally we are talking about fishing-rod style robots, and I am sure that we are going to come to that within five years, where the deflections are huge as the arm flies in, say, a quarter of a second from point A to point B. Yet you cannot expect the average user to connect research on sensors with the higher speed he seeks. Locomotion scored very low on the list, but I am almost sure that the users to whom that question was put were thinking of robots walking around the place, and many of us are sceptical about those. Again, if you change the question a little and ask should we do research on mobility in robots, meaning unmanned automated warehouse equipment and unmanned deli- very trucks that are able to go around a factory and in particular work in rather less structured areas like loading bays, then I know the users say yes. They are willing to spend money on free-ranging industrial trucks in a year or two, and we are only just in time in backing research on that. Speed and locomotion are two particular points which I remember in the survey: ease of programming we are funding heavily. Г feel completely easy that indeed we are doing the right thing in those cases. I hope that does not sound too complacent. MR. PETER FOYER (Ingersoll Engineers): You have talked about useful and ingenious software which we all hope will be available in five years time or less. The significant problem at the moment is producing high quality, reliable software at a realistic cost. the LECTURER: I agree completely. That is a cru- cial need. We are beginning to get outside the bounds of robotics research, because of course robotics is only one of innumerable important fields that are totally dependent on very large, very complicated software systems. I do not need to enumerate others. I hope that for robotics, as for many other applications, we can draw on a lot of research that is going on elsewhere. I think that the research that will have the most impact on this is generally classified these days as 'software engineering'. Software engineering is, for example, one of the four lead topics in the Alvey Committee's proposals. Now the SERC at least has determined to put its share of money into that area, some sixty million pounds over a period of a few years. I think the results obtained in areas like software engineering will indeed allow us to bank producing on the sort of complex, in- genious, elegant software that I have been discussing, at a realistic cost. dr. I D. NUSSEY: I should like to say how splendid it was to hear so broad a subject covered and in so</page><page sequence="15">OCTOBER 1983 ROBOTICS III short a time, and to feel that something was happening in the three to five year timescale that industry could build on. My first question is, as raw computing power becomes ever cheaper (I think it is falling at a rate of 25 per cent compound per annum into the indefinite future) is the question of solving the difficult vision and sen- soring problems going to be overcome essentially by brute force, as opposed to complex artificial intelli- gence? My second question - you showed a very good schematic of the process, the input and the output; one area in which you did not talk of any research was the one with the dotted line marked management. I wonder whether there is any comment on the medium-term issues of handling the resource that we are talking about within a rather larger industrial frame? the lecturer: The dramatic drop in cost of computing power affects all sorts of things. It will enable vision problems to be tackled in real time and at the cost of a few hundred pounds, that are vastly expen- sive to tackle now. Dr. Nussey said, as though it was an alternative, either brute force solutions or AI. I think that the truth is that you must use those new, cheap, very powerful computers in both ways and at the same time. It is hopeless to start thinking of AI techniques to help understand the meaning of an image before you have done a lot of very good and very computer- intensive image processing. The balance between brute force, or image-processing, and artificial intelligence, or image understanding, in solving vision problems may stay roughly the same. More and more complicated problems will become possible through combining the two. Of course different types of computing are needed for the two. For brute force - we are thinking of largely parallel operations done in array or pipelined proces- sors, whereas for the AI later on, we are thinking of machines designed for artificial intelligence, LISP machines or whatever. Both will be used, and both will have dramatic results. I would say that neither of those possibilities invalidate what I said earlier about struc- tured light. 'Cheat where you can' will remain a good motto, and one that every engineer ought to read first thing in the morning. As for management of flexible manufacturing sys- tems, I am no expert in this subject although I am beginning to learn a little. The technology of flexible manufacture may be in some cases beginning to out- strip what is manageable, and therefore there is room for a lot of very good research and a number of excellent industrial products in computer aids to flexible manage- ment which will go well beyond the computer aids that we now have for both production planning and management in general. the CHAIRMAN: It must be obvious to everybody that the combination of computer and microelectronics is going to affect the lives of everyone right across the whole spectrum, whatever their activity and wherever the activity takes place. Tonight's lecture by Peter Davey gives us some view of the enormous tasks we still face in bringing this new science to the point where it really does begin to do real work in a real approach to solving many of the problems. We should thank him for a very competent review of the research field in this subject. 685</page></plain_text>
