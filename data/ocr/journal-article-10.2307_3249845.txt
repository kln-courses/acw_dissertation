<plain_text><page sequence="1">Y. KRISHAN THE ORIGINS OF GANESA G anesa is worshipped in all parts of India, being the most popular of all the gods of the Hindu pantheon. He is non-sectarian in character inasmuch as followers of all sects and denominations, Gaivites, Vaisnavites, Buddhists and Jainas, pay homage to him. Brahmi and the other gods also pay homage to him at the commencement of any of their enterprises or works. There are more shrines in India dedicated to him than to any other deity. As one of the Paurinic paica devatds he is equated with the other great gods of Hinduism, Siva, Visnu, Sakti and Sirya. He enjoys priority of worship (agrapzjd). His name is invoked at the beginning of all secular and religious undertakings like the construction of a house or the beginning of a journey; performance of all sathskdras or domestic rites like the garbhdddna (conception), jatdkarma (tonsure), upanayana (sacred thread), marriage; in the opening sentence of a book or letter, or at the commencement of all religious rites, by the irauta (Vedic), smdrta (Jdstric and paurdic), or tdntric. The words uttered are: Gave.a ya Vighneivaraya namah (obeisance to Ganesa, the Lord of obstacles). He is considered as siddhiddtd (bestower of success), buddhiditd (bestower of wisdom) and vriddhiditd (bestower of wealth and success). He is figured as a being with the head of an elephant and the body of a human being, riding or surmounted on a rat. He has numerous epithets: Gajinana (elephant-faced), Lambodara (pot-bellied), Ekdanta (one-tusked, with the other broken), Ganidhipa (Lord ofganzas or hosts), Vinayaka (great leader or lord), Vighneivara or Vighnardja (Lord of obstacles). Paurinic Legends: The SkandapurdznaI ascribes the creation of Gane'a to Pdrvati out of the impurities of her body. The Matsyapurdnza2 repeats the same legend, adding that its face was like that of an ele- phant and that it came to life after immersion in the waters of the Ganges. Pdrvati adopted him as her son. According to the Lingapurcada3 150,4,6 Ganeba was specially created by Giva to checkmate the asuras who cause injury to the devas and for the destruction of the daityas. The Vardhapurdkza 234 says that it was a very handsome boy, who sprang from the laugh of Siva, and aroused the desire of Pgrvati. Siva, becoming jealous, cursed him, making him elephant- headed and potbellied, and chief of the Vinajyakas.

It was by a mixing of the sweat of Umi (Pirvati) and Sankara (Siva) that he acquired a trunk. Giva called him a Vindyaka as he was born to Pirvati without a husband, ndyaka, (Vdmana xxviii, 71-72), and predicted that he would cause iooo impediments to the gods. According to the legends current in Nepal,6 however, Gaineda was not created by Siva and Parvati but became manifest of his own will, svayambhbi; he is called Sfirya-Vindyaka. The Purdnas also explain the genesis of the elephant head. According to the Sivapurcdna7 136. 18 Pirvati wanted an attendant of her own, as the ganas of Rudra and the Pramathas only carry out the orders of Siva. So she created Ga.neea out of the scrubbings from her body, without the intervention of Siva. Gatnea kept guard outside her apartment. Once he objected to Siva's entering while she was bathing. This angered Siva, and a fight ensued between his gapas and Gainesa, in which the former were defeated and fled. By a strategem Siva cut off Gaine'a's head; in turn this aroused the anger of Parvati, and she created iooo goddesses, jaktis, to fight the killers of Gaxnega. This led to a great battle, which wrought destruction in the ranks of the gods. They were forced to sue for peace, which eventually was restored on the condition that Gana- pati be brought back to life, and be treated as chief presiding officer among the gods. On Siva's command his host of deities brought the head of the first living being that they met, which happened to be an elephant, and fixed it on the trunk of Ganapati. That head had only one tusk; hence Garnapati is called Ekadanta, single-tusked. Revived, he was crowned by the gods, and appointed leader of the gapas. According to the Brahmavaivarta purdnas Krsna in the form of a boy appeared in Pdrvati's apartment. The gods were invited to see the baby, Ganega, after its birth. The gaze of Sani (Saturn) reduced the head of Ganega to ashes; the head restored was that of an elephant. According to the Suprabbeddgamas Siva and Pdrvati once assumed the bodies of elephants to enjoy themselves, and it was from that union that the elephant-headed Gagapati was born. Thus we can see that the Pauri~nic accounts about the origin of Gaineea are inconsistent and conflicting. According to the GaneJapurdnaIo there have been four different forms of Viniyaka in the four ages of the Hindus. In the Krtayuga he is called Mahotakata Viniyaka, being born to Kagyapa and Aditi. He has no elephant head, and has a lion as his vehicle. In the Tretiyuga he is called May-ireivara, being born to Pirvati. He is not endowed with an elephant head, and has a peacock as his vehicle. In the Dviparayuga he is called Gaj?nana, is born to Siva and Pdrvati, possesses an elephant head and has a rat as his vehicle. In the Kaliyuga he is called DhTimaketu Vin yaka; his features are not described, and his vehicle is a horse. Thus it is in s The Vdmanapirana, ed. A. S.

This legend appears to be the source of the Japanese deity Shoden or Kangiten, "the joy-giving god", who was conceived when Siva and Pdrvati had changed themselves into elephants.

We learn also the anomalous fact that he is worshipped by Siva and Pdrvati before their marriage ceremony is performed. This unusual circumstance is reflected in art: thus the scenes in the Rdme'vara temple at Ellora" and at Kanauj 12 showing the marriage of Siva and Prvati depict both Ganega and Skanda as attendants. Again, the purina version in which the gayas fight Pirvati's son cannot truly account for his title Ganeda since it makes him their enemy instead of their lord. The variant which makes his sire Krs.a incarnate as a boy clearly reflects the sectarian con- flict between Saivism and Visnuism. It is evident that the Purdntas made strenuous efforts to justify Ga.napati's admission into the Hindu pantheon, by one fanciful story or another. It may be noted, finally, that according to a verse of doubtful authenticity attributed to Manu, Siva is the god of Brahmins, Visnu the god of Ksatriyas, Brahmi the god of Vaisyas, and Gananayaka the god of Siidras; i. e. of the lowest class in caste society.13 Gavefa in Art: Ganega is said to appear in sculpture some centuries earlier than in literature. It has been argued that a silver drachm of the Indo-Greek King Hermaeus dating about 5 o B.C. represents him as a throned male deity with an elephant's head."4 A terracotta plaque of the first century B.C. or A.D., found in the excavations at Rairh in Jaipur,'s is thought to show a Vaindyaki, a female deity having the head of an elephant. Likewise on two clay tablets unearthed in the digs at Sambhar bearing a figure claimed as elephant-headed is called Ganeda.16 However all these identifications are highly speculative. On the coin of Hermaeus, (now in the British Museum), tusks and ears are missing, and the trunk cannot be distinguished from the elephant's head as a whole. Again it is most exceptional that a Ganeda should be shown in three-quarters view seated on a throne usually occupied by Zeus in Indo-Greek coins. As a general rule such round silver coins bear the likeness of a ruler, whereas gods or animals are depicted on square copper coins.'7 The reverse of gold or silver pieces generally bears the figure of a Greek deity; exceptional variants are the figures of a bull, an owl, a horseman.is The terracotta from Jaipur is greatly damaged; the original excavation report gives no description of the plaque, and from the photograph no conclusive identification is permissible.19 In regard to the clay tablets discovered at Sambhar, the excavator D. R. Sahni himself enter- tained doubts whether the figure shown could be called Ganega.zo I Gopinatha Rao, op.cit., vol.II, ii, p. 347, pl.CV. 12 C.

The supposed elephant head lacks trunk and tusks. Apparently the Amardvati sculptors were intent on portraying mythical creatures of all kinds with wings, horns, etc., and thus endowed a gava with some characteristics of an elephant's head but not the most important. Another untenable suggestion made by Coomaraswamy is that the earliest iconographic representation of Gan.ega is an elephant-faced gapa on the Kantaka Cetinga stxpa of the second or third century A.D. in Sri Lanka. A number of gatas are represented there:23 some play musical instruments, one sports with a cobra, another stands on his head. Many are animal- headed, such as those of the horse, bear, or monkey. The one with the elephant head is merely one among these, not their lord. The Siva temple at Bhumara (fifth century A.D.) also presents many gapas with animal or bird heads, such as the lion, bear, monkey, bull, or parrot, and two others with a lion head and a demon head on their bellies24. Gaineea himself is seen in a large medallion as well as in the round, but there is no suggestion that he is lord of the group ofgavas.zs It is natural to conclude that in both these cases nothing more than artistic fancy was involved. Probably the earliest intended representation of Gaine'a is to be found on a bas relief of the Kushan period from Mathura, which depicts five elephant-headed yak4as or ganas.26 This is followed by a stone in high relief from the Fatehgarh district, U.P. ;27 a Gande~a from Mathura (fig. i), ascribed to the late third century;28 and a small Guptan terracotta from monastery II at Sarnath.29 There is also an early representation in stucco at the base of the brick structure (fourth-fifth century) of the Maniyar Math mound excavated at Rajgir.3o From the fifth century on Gane'a images appear in different parts of India: in the Udayagiri Caves near Sanchi (fourth-fifth);31 on a terracotta from Bhitargaon (early Gupta);32 from Nachna (Madhya Pradesh, fifth),33 Elephanta, Tanegara and Aurangabad (Western India); at Samalaji in Gujarat (fourth-fifth);34 and at the Siva temple at Bhumara (sixth), these being in elephant's trunk or Gatiapati." He admitted, however, that karabha may also mean a young camel, and added: "Unfortu- nately the face of the figure is damaged and there is nothing to show that it has the trunk of an elephant, gajamukha. There are vestiges of a cauri on the right shoulder which would be inappropriate in a representation of Ganega." 21 A.K.Coomaraswamy in Boston Museum Bull., 1928, no. 154, P. 30. 22 Sivaramamurti, Amdrivati Sculptures in the Madras Museum, Madras 1956, p. 158, pl.IV. 23 J.M.

From the south are: Pedavegi near Ellore in Andhra Pradesh (fourth-fifth), where the Silafikiyanas ruled at Vengi;3s and the Peddamudiyam plaque from Cuddapah, also Andhra Pradesh, of the early Pallava period (sixth-ninth A.D.).36 At this time Gaiiega had become one of the principal gods of the Hindu pantheon. Outside India the earliest iconographic representations are two stone statues from Afghani- stan (figs. 2, 3) one from Sakai Dhar near Kabul (fourth century) and the other from Gardez with an inscription in Brihmi (fifth century).37 A terracotta from Akra in present Pakistan is also datable to about the fifth century.38 Ganeia was also popular in other Asian countries, Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Java and Bali, Cambodia and Champa, Tibet, Chinese Turkestan, China and Japan. This material must await treatment elsewhere. The earliest Ganega sculptures are two-armed; none has any vehicle. Among the early images cited above, the Mathuran figure in third century Kushan style (fig. i) holds a bowl of cakes with one hand and with the other perhaps a tusk; the cake-bowl is visible also in the early Guptan Gane'a of the Udayagiri cave near Sanchi.3a The early Guptan Bhitargaon plaque shows four arms, two holding identifiable attributes: in one left hand the bowl of cakes, while the right hand makes the tarjani mudrd.4o The sixth century statue from Bhumara4' (fig. 4) also has four arms, holding an axe, a broken tusk, a sceptre, and embracing a kakti. Gopinatha Rao cites texts and sculptures of Gane'a having four, six, eight, ten, or sixteen arms.42 We suggest that the two-armed figures belong to an early iconographic stage in which he was conceived as Vighne'a, lord of evils or obstacles. On his admission to the hierarchy of Paurinic gods, he was endowed with four. As a tdntric divinity his arms were further multiplied and he was associated with a iakti. In the "classical" form he is endowed with a pot belly; four arms, later still more, holding a hatchet (paraiu), sweetmeats (ladldus or modaka), a broken tusk or stylus for writing, and a noose (pdia) or goad (ankula), or in the varada or abbaya mudrds. A snake is tied around his body as a sacred thread and he rides or surmounts a rat. The last feature becomes common only in late sculptures and literature (fig. 5). A rat vdhana occurs on the Mukte'vara temple at Bhubane'vara, from the tenth or eleventh century.43 In the useful compilations of Chola practise published by Balasubramanyam, the volume on the early period (tenth century) contains only one example out of 23 plates, from Aditurai.44 In the Middle Chola volume (985-1070) there are three occurrences out of 2z.4s The more general 35as Ibid., p.61I. 36 Ibid., p. 62. 37 G.

The Silparatna describes a five-faced Gandefa who rides a lion. The 3ukranitisdra, iv, 4, 169 permits any animal to be his vehicle. A basic text, the Ganyeapurdna (I oo100-15 oo) places a Gar.apati in each of the four cosmic periods, as we have seen, but furnishes only the god preceding the present yuga with a rat; the others receive a lion, a peacock, and a horse. The rat is explained by a trivial anecdote.47 From the uses of the terms gapapati and gapas in the Rigveda (ii, 23, I and x, 112, 9), the Yajurveda (fukla mddhyandin sambitd, I6-5, 22zz. 3 and 23. 19) and the Taittirtya sathbitd iv, 1. 2. 2 - Vdj. 2. 15)48 many scholars have concluded that the references are to the familiar elephant-headed Ganeda. This is clearly erroneous for the following reasons: The Aitareya Brdhmaya (i, zi) and the Kausitaki Brdhmaya (viii, 5) make it clear that in the first Rigvedic hymn cited above (ii, 23, I) the term ganapati is addressed to Brahma.naspati or Brhaspati.49 The Vedic bhbsyakdras or commentators of the mediaeval period in no case find a reference to Ganeda in the hymns cited above.so Instead they interpret gayapati in a wide variety of ways: as lord of the hosts of gods;s" as lord of all creatures;sz specifically as Indra;s3 as Rudra, lord of beasts, especially horses;4 sas the horse, lord of hosts; ss as lord of the gathering of women.s56 These commentaries establish conclusively that the term gayapati in the Vedas was not identified with the elephant-headed and pot-bellied Ganeda, and that the word gayas did not mean the mischief-making hosts of Siva's attendants. It is noteworthy that the Gavteapurdna, iv, 33, long after Ganeda's identification as a Vedic god, makes the direct admission that the 46 Early Chola Architecture and Sculpture (866-1014 A.D.), London 1974, pls.23a, 28, 46, 64, 81a. 47 See above and fn. io. The story is told that a Gandharva, Kaufica, was transformed into a rat by Vimadeva's curse. As a rat he ate up the grain, damaged the books, clothes etc. of the sage Pardiara; so Gajinana threw his noose around it and made it his vdhana. 48 See in general R.C.Hazra, "Gaina-pati worship and the Upapur~nas dealing with it," Journal of the GanganathJha Research Inst., vol.V, pt.4, 1948, pp.267-68, fns. 17, 18, 20, 21. 49 A.

Sarma of the Vishveshwaran and Vishva Bandhu Institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies, Hoshiarpur. Their individual writers are: Venkatamrdhava and Uvata, both IIth cent.; Sdyania and Bhattabhdskara, both 14th cent.; and Mahidhara, i6th cent. It is true that the Mai- trdyatii Samthitd section of the Yajurveda contains a mantra addressed to a deity called Karita-hastimukha danti, an obvious reference to an elephant-headed god. But this like other hymns addressed to Rudra, Gauri, Skanda, Brahmd, Vigriu etc. is a later addition, since this nomenclature is definitely post-Vedic (e.g. Kegava-Ndrayan.a used for ViSn.u). The Satkhitd sections of the Taittirfta and Vdjasaneyi do not contain these mantras. The different list contained in the Taittirfta Aranyaka has been preserved in two recensions that diverge markedly in the deities they name. Neither the Sakthita nor the Aratn- yaka lists are dependable. Thus the appellation Vakratunda (an elephant with a twisted trunk) occurring in the T. Aran.- yaka, x, i.5, is an addition, as is the laudatory verse for Vindyaka in the Baudhdyana Smrti, ii, 5.9.3. 5' Thus Venkatamadhava and Syagna commenting on Rig. ii, 23.1 and Yajur Taittirfya, xxiii, 14.3. 52 Thus Bhattabhdskara on the mantras referred to above. 53 Thus STyagia on Rig, x, I I2.9. 54 Ibid. on Yajur Taittirfya, iv, 1.2.2 and Vdjasaneyi, ii, 15. 55 Thus Mahidhara on Yajur M2dhyandin, xxiii, 19. 56 Thus Uvata on the mantras. Sdyania and Mahidhara interpret the word gapapatebhyas in Taittirvya, iv, 54.1 (Vj. i6. 25) as devinucara. To Sdyania devlnucara means "follower of gods" and to Mahidhara a special being (bhbta viflea). 290</page><page sequence="7">rsi, or sages, Brahma, the Vedas, the Upanisads, and the six Sistras do not know the true nature of Gane'a. A dominant feature of Vedic mythology is the fact that little attention is paid to animal fetishes, the gods being conceived of as mighty men dwelling in heaven. Though certain animals may have been given a totemistic importance in the choice of names, such as the tortoise, the fish, the goat, the calf, or the owl, this is not true of the elephant, gaja or bastini. The term "Ganega" as now understood, appears rather late in literature.s7 Its true precursor seems to have been one of its present synonyms, Viniyaka. The latter, in the plural, signified evil spirits. In the Mahibhdratas8 (Vafigavdsi ed. iii, 65, 23; xii, 284, 13; xiii, J150, 25) they are spoken of as unfriendly, malignant beings like bhiztas, rdksasas, and pisadcas. In the Mdnavagrhya s#itras9 of the seventh to fifth century B.C. a group of four Viniyakas is named. Persons pos- sessed by them are forced into frustration; they are an impediment to princes in seeking a king- dom, in trading and farming, in marrying or bearing children. Texts of the Guptan period, the Yajhavalkya Smrti and the Visnudbarmottara, continue to name a group of four, but reveal concepts closer to the final Gainea.60 Vindyakas cause obstacles, but may also bring success in actions and in the performance of rituals (yajha). The being may be described as elephant-headed or elephant-faced, or as lord of ganas by appointment by Brahm~ and Indra. Their power may still be predominantly evil. Thus the seventh century author Binabhatta in his Kddambari61 speaks of an unlucky idol of Mahivin~yaka as a sum of evils: the great worm, the great disease, evil portents, dangerous poison, dangerous beasts, the tempest, evil planets, an evil snake-like nature, loveless, lacking in any goodness, etc. The same author62 describes a group of female recluses as reciting hymns in praise of the major gods of the time under variant names, Siva, Pirvati, their son Kirttikeya, Visnu, the Jina Aryivalo- kite'vara, the Arhat, Brahmadeva, but not Gane'a or Viniyaka. Another lingering sign of ill repute is the fact that they receive offerings of wine, fish, and flesh, all generally taboo in the Hinduism of that time. In brief, neither Ganega nor Viniyaka occurs in the Vedas. In post-epic literature, Gane'a is first a Viniyaka, lord of evils, and then a vighnahartd, remover of evils. In the Mdnayagrhya Sftra and the Yajiavalkya Smrti he is not called elephant-headed, but he is so described in the Visnu- dharmottara. Neither Mdnava nor Visnudharmottara calls him leader of the ganas but Yadja 271 makes him the leader of gapas, appointed by Brahma and Indra. He fuses in himself not only the different Vindyakas but also other evil forces represented by the mat.rganas, mother goddesses, and the grahas, planets, as we shall see below. s7 The legend that Gane'a acted as scribe for Vydsa in writing down the Mahibhdrata appears in the north Indian recension of the epic, but is missing in the south Indian granthi; in the former it appears to be an interpolation.

Winternitz, "Gane'a in the Mahdbhdrata," Jour. of the Royal As.Soc., 1898, pp. 380-382. 58 See Hazra, op.cit., pp.266-267, fns. 8, 13, 15,16. 59 Ramakrishna Harshaji Sastri ed., Manavagrhya Sitra, Gaekwad Oriental Series vol.XXXV, Baroda 1926.

Through this process of growth the loosely imagined Ganeda became ultimately one of the five dominant Hindu gods, the paFtca devatds, ranked as the equal of Siva, Visnu, Devi, and Siirya. At the same time his retention of the epithet Gainapati made it possible for his devotees to claim for him a respectably Vedic antiquity. The devotional literature addressed to him in the mediaeval period borrows wholesale from the phraseology of the past, and appears under the great tradi- tional titles. There is a Ganyeopanisad, a Ganelagita, and a Ga.yeapurdna. Ganeda has come to be called lord of the heavenly hosts, wisest of the wise, lord of treasure of treasuries, most adorable of adorables, supreme among those who pray, king of kings.64 Through his epithets he is equated with Indra and Agni. It is said he is named when the Vedas speak of Brahmanaspati. In the Ganelapurdnia, i, 69. i7ff., different verses of the Purusa-sikta of the Rig Veda are prescribed for invoking Ganeda. The ninth to thirteenth century eulogy Ganeedagitd in both content and phraseology is almost wholly drawn from the Bhagavadgitd, with Gane'a replacing Krs.na. He too is identified with the supreme being, and is endowed with the highest compassion, karugn, the quality of a bodhisattva.65 In consequence of this identification with the Vedic gods Ganesa was endowed with their familiar attributes, in visualization and art. Through the goad, the thunderbolt, and the lotus he rivals Indra; through the tiger-skin garment, the crescent moon emblem, and the snake as sacred thread he rivals Rudra/Siva; through the noose he rivals Varuna; and through the axe he rivals Brahmanaspati. As "buddhiditd" he is endowed with the intelligence of Brahmanaspati, and as "siddhiddtd" with the bountiful nature of Indra. As a proper god he is to be fed by sweets, no longer by wine, fish, and flesh. Among the early writings that name deities in groups, Ganesa is absent from the Vedas, P.nini, Kautilya's Arthaaidstra, the Rdmayana and Mahibhdrata, and the Pdli Buddhist literature. He is not invoked in the Grhya and Dbarmasitras at the beginning of auspicious rites. 63 A.A.Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, New Delhi repr. 1971, P.75. In the Vedas Rudra is represented as the god of death. Cf. also R.N. Dandeker, Some Aspects of the History of Hinduism, Poona 1967, p. 51 . It may be noted that Rudra, unlike the beneficent Vedic gods, does not engage in conflict vs. the asuras. Manu the law-giver (iii, 164), excludes from those invited to the irdddha ceremonies inter alia those who perform ganayagas, sacrifices to ganas, which the commentators take to mean performances addressed to Viniyaka or Ganeea. Cf. Buihler (transl.), The Laws of Manu, S.B.E. vol.XXV, Delhi reprint 1967, fn to verse 164. Also Dandekar, op.cit., p. 74. 64 E. g. Rig. ii, 23,1: "We call thee lord of the heavenly hosts, the wise among the wise, the most famous... the best of those who pray O Brahmanaspati..." The Yaj. (sukla 23. 19): "We call thee the lord of the heavenly hosts, the most adorable, the lord of the treasure of treasuries..." Compare the Ganelapurdna 46,14-15: "He [Ganega] is the wise among the wise, supreme among those who pray, Brah- manaspati. He is king of kings, lord of the treasure of treasuries, the most adorable among those adored." The Gayneapfirvatapini upanisad, 5: "You are the lord of the heavenly hosts, the supreme being, the wise among the wise, embodiment of the highest intelligence, the king of kings, the incomparable light..." In ibid., 2: "You are the lord of heavenly hosts, the most adorable among those adored." Thus Ganeea is given Vedic epithets: Kavinim kavi, Jyeqthardja, Brahman, Brahmainaspati (from the Rig); Priyapatim and Nidhipatim (from the Yajur). In the Gatesapurdna, 1,46-78 he is called rig-yajub - sima sambhitf, the embodiment of the Three Vedas. In ibid., 1,46-1100oo he is described as Yajfiapati, lord of Vedic sacrifices; in 11,41-43 it is claimed that he incarnated himself in order to establish Vedic rites and customs. 65 Based on Kiyoshi Yoroi's Ganesagiti, The Hague 1918, Introd. 292</page><page sequence="9">Fig. I Seated Gane'a image, early Gupta period.

In Brihmi inscriptions up to ca. 300 A.D. neither Gandea nor Vinayaka figures.67 In the Buddhist Lalitavistara, vii, (second A.D.)68 the idols of Siva, Skanda, Ndriyana, Kubera, Candra, Sfirya, Vaigravan.a, Sakra, Brahmd, and the Lokapilas are shown to the baby Siddhirtha. In the Divydvaddna (first B.C.-second A.D.)69 the gods named for worship to get a son are: Siva, Varun.a, Kuvera, Sakra, Brahmd (drdmadevatd, vanadevatd, s.rngatakadevatd, balipratigrahikam devatam); Divya i,i and 30.440. The Dharmasathgraha vii, viii, ix, and xTo enumerate eighteen Lokapilas including Brahmi, Siirya, Indra, Krs.a, etc. but neither Gaine'a nor Viniyaka. In the stuti of Ya'omati Kalpadrumdvadanamdla (sixth century and later: f. 87, b, 2 foll.Pars. ms.)71 the Buddha is compared with mythological and religious beings outside Buddhism: with Brahmd, Visfiu, Siva, Agni, Yama, the ndgas, Viyu, Kubera, Mdra, Pafica'ikhd (king of the Gandharvas), Garuda, the sun, moon, clouds, etc. but not with Ganega. In the Acdrifga sfitra, ii, i 2(3)72 of the Jaina canon, there is no reference to Ganega, though the worship of Indra, Rudra, Skanda, theyaksas, the ndgas, and trees is mentioned. Several texts of the Guptan and early post-Guptan periods,"3 such as those of Kiliddsa, the Pafcatantra, or the Amarakosa name the war god Skanda, Kirttikeya, or Guha as the only son of Pdrvati. Guptan coins portray Laksmi, Visnu, Durgd, and KumSra or KSrttikeya, but not Gane'a;74 nor is he mentioned in Guptan inscriptions. Two copper coins of Huviska bear the legend "Ganesa" in old Brdhmi and show an archer holding a bow with string inwards. The figure has been identified with Siva.75 At any rate these Kushan coins demonstrate that the name Ganeda was not assigned at that period to an elephant-headed deity. In Indian iconography theriomorphic beings like the kinnaras, ndgas, vidyddharas have been habitually represented with a human head above an animal body. Gane'a, on the other hand, shows the reverse. It is true that certain forms of Visnu, the man-lion Narasitihha, the horse- headed Hayagriva, the boar-headed Variha, are depicted with animal heads. But each of these is a special manifestation, an avatira, of the godhead of Visnu, having a limited duration for the specific purpose of destroying evil. They symbolize events in the legends of Visnu that prove his supremacy; they are not cult objects in themselves, and cannot have provided models for the cult of Vindyaka. The latter's iconography, instead, must have been determined by his character as a non-vedic deity. As such he could not be represented like the true Vedic gods, in anthropomorphic fashion; and so he was given an animal head, the head of the lord of animals. In this role he shows himself as the later, paurinic heir of the Vedic Rudra defined as Padupati. 66 D.C.

He is called a pilaca, and thus a follower of Rudra. To worship him is considered worship of a crook, dhfrtaydga. In texts of the Kushan period he is described as the leader of evil spirits that afflict children, or is associated with the ambivalent Mother Goddesses. In the epic period, on the other hand, he has become the leader of the devas, and fights the champion Mahisa. No representation of Skanda in art is known prior to the first century A.D. There is apparently a close connection between the roles of Ga.nea and Skanda as one-time gods of evil, who in the end were taken into the Hindu pantheon at a high level. Gavela and the Mother Goddesses: In relatively late religious literature and art, Ganega/Vindyaka is found associated with seven or eight divine mothers. In one text, the Yadjavalkya, 290,77 Vindyaka is called the son of Ambiki, to whom his worshippers should offer obeisance. The Gobhilasmrti78 directs that all rites should begin with an act of worship of Ganeda and the mdatris. In iconography, the seven Mother Goddesses are usually though not invariably shown in a row with Virabhadra (Siva) at one end and Ganega at the other. The Mayamata79 and the Rupamandana stipulate that this arrangement should be followed.8o Temple decorations from Aihole, Ellora, (fig. 6), Bhubaneivara, Khajuraho, etc.s8 provide extensive evidence in support of this practise as do treatises on sculpture. The cult of the Mothers was not Aryan or Vedic in origin. They personified scourges like smallpox, typhoid, cholera, hysteria, or deadly serpents, and might be propitiated by offerings of goats, pigs, hens, or buffaloes. On admission into the Brahmanical pantheon these malevolent beings were identified as faktis of the major Vedic gods: Brahman.i of Brahmi; Mahe'vari or Yogeivari of Siva; Vais.navi of Visnu; Kaumdri of Skanda or Kumira; Varihi of the boar incarnation of Visnu; Indrini of Indra; Cdmungd or Narasimrhi of Yama. They were conceived in the images of their male con- sorts, and therefore were given the same ornaments, weapons, and vdhanas. Perhaps that is why in their earliest appearances, in the Kushan and Gupta periods, they lack the frightful features seen in late sculptures, and may even seem charming. However they are entirely different in nature from their companion gods. The account of their origin given in the Vardha- 76 Based on V. S.

They personify (in the order of their names given above): pride; desire; illusion; attachment; greed; envy; fault-finding; and tale-bearing. Viniyaka is both an embodiment of these evil forces and their lord, Vighneivara. Ganeja and the Navagrahas: The Ganpea cult is also associated with the cult of the Navagrahas, nine "planets" (the sun and moon, the five recognized planets, and the two mythical eclipse demons, Rihu and Ketu), which grew up under foreign influence around the fifth century A.D. Though grahas are both malefic and beneficent, the term generally means an evil power. Viramitrodaya, x, 72, a commentary on the Yaj]avalkya Smrti8s always associates the worship of Vindyaka with that of the "planets." Again, according to the Garudapurdna84 in concluding the worship of Viniyaka, among others, the tutelary deities of the "planets" should be worshipped. The sculptural evidence for the association of Gane'a with the nine is sparse and late (fig. 7). The combination is found on a late Guptan fragment from Sarnath depicting the great decease of the Buddha; on an eleventh century architectural fragment from Nalanda; and on a slab from Kankandighi in West Bengal.85 Ganeia in Buddhism: The Buddhist sddhands describes6 and the Buddhist idols portray Ganesa in both his destruc- tive and beneficent aspects. He may be shown lying prostrate under a benign goddess, or being trampled underfoot. Sddhand no. 204 of the Sddhanamdld describes the esoteric guardian god Aparijita as trampling on him (fig. 8). On the other hand he is praised in Sddhand no. 30787 as an embodiment of siddhi, success, and a remover of obstacles, vighnahartd, This latter role won him an honorable place at the entrance to Buddhist temples. In Lamaism88 he is represented as an acolyte of the Buddha serving as a god of wealth (holding a cintdmani and riding a rat that may vomit jewels). He may also figure as a demon being trampled on by the god Mahdkila. Gavela in Jainism: Gan.eba appears rather late in Jaina literature and art, being particularly favored by the Svetimbara sect; in Digambara literature there is no reference to making his image. He appears as the yaksa supporter of the z3rd Tirthailkara, Pirivandtha, being given the name Pirivayaksa89 or Dharmendra, and being distinguished by a ndga hood and a tortoise mount. Gane~a images have also been found in the Jaina caves at Udayagiri and Khandagiri in 82 Vardhapurdnau text, Bombay 1923, xxvii, 32-37. 83 See note 77 above. 84 M.N.Dutt, trans., Garudgapurdza, Calcutta 19o8, p. 291. 85 Banerjea, Hindu Iconography, pp. 444-45. 86 B.

The earliest reference to him in Jaina literature is to be found in Hemacandra's Abbi- ddna-cintdmanzi (twelfth century).9o Vardhamina Sairi in his Acdradinkara gives a detailed descrip- tion of Ganeda. The origin of Ganeda appears to be non-Indian, inasmuch as the Indian pantheon is essenti- ally anthropomorphic in character, and animals as a rule, are the vdbanas or mounts of Indian deities. We suggest that the concept of an elephant-headed god was an importation from Egypt via the Hellenistic kings of the Middle East and the Indo-Greeks of northwestern India. According to ancient Egyptian zoolatry, the divine can manifest itself in animals and birds.() In Egypt the earliest divinities were frequently represented in animal forms: Khanum, god of fecundity, as a ram; Anubis, god of the dead, as a jackal; Thoth, god of learning, as an ibis or baboon; Sobek, god of waterways, as a crocodile; Bastet, goddess of joy and love, as a cat; Apis as the sacred bull. With the growth of the concept of divinities in human form, these beings came to be conceived in therioanthropomorphic guise, with animal or bird heads and human bodies. So Ra, the sun, might be animal or bird or reptile-headed; Seth had the head of a donkey; Thoth that of an ibis or baboon; Sobek that of a crocodile; Sekhmet, the war goddess, that of a lioness; Thoueris, the goddess protecting women in child-birth, that of a female hippopotamus. It seems that the motif of an animal head was borrowed by the Hellenistic Greeks from Egypt, to emphasize that the king was a manifestation of divine power. The Seleucid monarchs, whose political and cultural power at its height extended from the Phoenician coast to the Hindu Kush, entrusted an important symbolic role to the whole elephant or the elephant head. To profit by this example, the Bactrian general Demetrios, whose army won ca. i 8o B.C. a more lasting foothold in the Northwest than had Alexander's, had himself portrayed in profile on his coins with a kind of "elephant scalp" at reduced scale above his helm (fig. 9).9, On some of Demetrios' coins which call him "Supreme Being" (datable 190-171 B.C.), the figure of an elephant appears on the obverse with a caduceus on the reverse. In Indo-Greek coinage the obverse is usually reserved for a representation of the king who issued the coin, or the king whose memory it commemorates.93 Thus the elephant on the obverse can be identified symbolically with the "Supreme Being" Demetrios. The caduceus was the Greek symbol of power that, inter alia, produced wealth and prosperity, the special features of Ganeda in Indian religious beliefs. On coins of Antimachos (circa 171-160o B.C.), the elephant stands on the obverse while on the reverse is a standing winged Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, holding a wreath and palm or a winged thunderbolt, the weapon of Zeus and Pallas Athene.94 The reverse of coins of Antialcidas (circa '45-'35 B.C.) shows Zeus enthroned holding a miniature winged Nike at the 90 M.P.

A less formal design shows a walking profile Zeus with his sceptre, backed by a profile elephant holding the little Nike.9s On a coin of Eucratides (circa 171- 13 5 B.C.) the reverse presents the city goddess of Kapiga seated left, holding a palm, balanced by a mountain and the forepart of an elephant. The in- scription reads Kaviilye nagara devatd, the god of the city of Kapigi or Kapi'a.96 Centuries later when the city was visited by the Chinese pilgrim Hsiian-tsang he found its tutelary deity a mountain called "Pi-lo-sa-lo" (Pilusira), manifest in the shape of an elephant.97 For the Greeks this guardian had been Zeus. Thus on some Indo-Greek coins an elephant might replace a throned Zeus or be paired with him. The most explicit combinations were evolved by the introduction as an intermediate symbol of a miniature figure of a winged Victory, the Greek Nike. As we have seen in one active version these figures move to the left as if in procession. In more formal terms the throned Zeus holding a Nike on the right was balanced by the elephant emerging on the left, holding a wreath. Here perhaps are the elements, still set in Hellenistic terms, of a kind of cult triad that much later would bring together Siva, Gane'a, and Kirttikeya: the leading god humanised, the power of Nature personified as an elephant, and the personification of victory in war. A plausible further step would be one in which the two local gods were merged in one figure with both kinds of divine attributes. As has been noted earlier, this is one interpretation of the silver coin of the last Indo-Greek king, Hermaeus, now in the British Museum. The perspective throne, the human body seen in three-quarters view, and the rayed halo are solidly based in Hellenistic tradition. The one possible feature belonging to an elephant may be a trunk, descending from the face across the upper torso. More powerful authority seems to lie behind the objection that a trunk is just what this attribute does not indicate. The coin obviously presents a stimulating problem for further research elsewhere.98 The introduction of Gane'a into the Indian pantheon appears to have met a need felt at that relatively late period. Human beings have always felt menaced by the hostile forces of Nature, and have sought protection against them by worshipping deities. In India the Siddhanta astro- logy which became dominant under Babylonian and Greek influence around the third century A.D. added a new dimension to the evil with which men had to contend: the planetary forces that were believed to shape an individual's destiny. As protection against inauspicious move- ments of the Navagrahas, the nine heavenly bodies, the most effective counter-measures were held to be the performance of special rituals, the graha pu-jd or graha homa. But these ceremonies required the employment of Brahmin priests and Vedic rites, and so were beyond the means of any but the powerful and affluent. Beyond or beneath these traditional measures, the worship of other protective gods and goddesses was formalized to meet the needs of the lower castes. The cult of Viniyaka or Gafieia was perhaps the most successful of these substitutes called on to meet the threats of both terrestrial and planetary forces of evil. Small wonder that Gafiea has been a god of the people, of the multitude. His protection extends to all. 95 Ibid., vol.II, The Apogee of the Indo-Greeks, Types 269-273. 96 Ibid., vol.I, Type 194. 97 S. Beal, Chinese Accounts of India, Calcutta, 1957 (ed.) Vol.I, p.
