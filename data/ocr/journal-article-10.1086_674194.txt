         <p>Everything tends to make us believe that there exists a certain point of the mind at which life and death, the real and the imagined, past and future, the communicable and the incommunicable, high and low, cease to be perceived as contradictions. Now search as one may one will never find any other motivating force in the activities of the surrealist than the hope of finding and fixing this point.</p>
         <attrib>— André Breton, 1929<sup>1</sup>

      <p>How can we know that we do not know? By the simple fact that we remain speechless in front of things that stimulate our desire for knowledge. But then, how does one write about things that make one speechless? How does one interact with events or artworks that withdraw from cognitive impulses? Perhaps one way would be by working with and against that withdrawal, trying to see, like Breton once did in his manifesto of 1929, where art and life, historical references and personal narratives intertwine and begin to challenge each other.</p>
      <p>I believe that Lili Dujourie’s work addresses that unknowable part in us that Lacanian theory calls the <italic>objet petit a</italic> — a gap at the centre of the symbolic order that either makes us implode in a narcissistic quest for ourselves or pushes us to seek the object of desire in the Other.<sup>2</sup> Her oeuvre can be read as a tide between absorption and dispersion, Minimalism and the Baroque, figuration and abstraction. It is as if her work were the very incarnation of the alchemic formula par excellence, the <italic>coincidentia oppositorum</italic> theorised by Nicholas of Cusa that aimed to overcome apparently contradicting ideas — being and nothingness, the universal and the particular, origin and end, faith and disbelief — through a dialectical image that would compress all the aspects of the universe while at the same time keeping its mysteries intact.<sup>3</sup> Dujourie’s dialectic vein is to be found in such formal impurity: hers is a relentless quest for aesthetic metamorphoses that attempts to bridge the Western, Neoplatonic gap between intelligible and unintelligible forces by playing with two contrary impulses — exposure and withdrawal.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Le Transfert</italic> (1960–61), Jacques Lacan uses the Greek word <italic>agalma</italic> (‘ornament’) to refer to a precious object hidden in a worthless box that undergoes constant transformation without ever revealing the true nature of its content.<sup>4</sup> For Lacan, <italic>agalma</italic> (the mysterious object triggering love) is related to the <italic>objet petit a</italic> (the object-cause of desire) but they are not one and the same. Although Lacan initially uses love and desire as interchangeable terms, he later establishes a clear distinction between them: <italic>agalma</italic> relates to the analysand’s perception of the Other as an ideal being who holds the precious jewels of happiness, whereas the <italic>objet petit a</italic> is but a partial, replaceable commodity, and never designated by a real object.<sup>5</sup> If we were to think of Dujourie’s work in Lacanian terms, what would be its <italic>agalma</italic> and its <italic>objet petit a</italic>? Could one say that the <italic>agalma</italic> in her work is her love for grandiose themes and lavish materials, and that the <italic>objet petit a</italic> is what drives her questioning of the causes of those desires?</p>
      <p>The economy of desire was already central to Dujourie’s early work <italic>Amerikaans imperialisme</italic> (<italic>American Imperialism</italic>, 1972), which undresses the very mechanisms of US Minimal art. A monumental installation, itself minimal, <italic>Amerikaans imperialisme</italic> consists of a large steel plate that leans against a colour-painted wall (red in its most recent re-creation) — with the exception of a bare section just behind the metal sheet, which can only be perceived when approaching the installation from an angle. The title of the piece throws us right into the heart of darkness of US political history, foregrounding the cultural imperialism associated with US movements such as Abstract Expressionism and Minimal art, which have arguably remained dominant in the international art context since the post-War era. How does one work with the desires caused by such cultural supremacy? One way is to produce forms that both act out and trap those desires.</p>
      <p>The generic forms and industrial materials that characterise the best-known works of Frank Stella, Robert Morris or Carl Andre are, in <italic>Amerikaans imperialisme</italic>, transgressed by a desire to engage with art-historical rewritings. Both a painting and a sculpture, <italic>Amerikaans imperialisme</italic> is not far from Donald Judd’s ‘specific object’ — the term he coined in the mid-1960s to refer to three-dimensional objects hovering between sculpture and painting, neither one nor the other.<sup>6</sup> But <italic>Amerikaans imperialisme</italic> operates at a remove from Michael Fried’s fear of the theatrical, and also his materialistic ‘what you see is what you see’ reading of Minimal art.<sup>7</sup> Dujourie’s installation works instead as a performative speech act in its attempt to change the reality that it describes. The brutal and self-contained forms of <italic>Amerikaans imperialisme</italic> are challenged by the irony of its title — a gesture that embraces the prevailing hierarchy within Western contemporary art of titles over artworks and concepts over forms, but that does so in order to undermine the sacred self-importance of US Minimal art. For what is more blasphemous than exposing the geo-political conditions of an artistic era in the title of the artwork while mimicking its forms?</p>
      <p>Yet Dujourie remains faithful to Minimal art’s demand to ‘show, not tell’. <italic>Amerikaans imperialisme</italic>’s simultaneous affirmation and negation of the US canon could be read through the Hegelian trope of the master and slave: on the one hand, it incarnates Western European art’s desire to challenge the supremacy of US art; on the other, it remains dependent on the US example, and could even be said to contribute to its further expansion. However, I believe Dujourie resolved, and exited, this conflict by finding her own way through the history of art in a subsequent series of works that commit to other, more resolutely personal visions of what art is or should be.</p>
      <p>Marcel Duchamp once claimed that ‘art is a game among all men of all eras’.<sup>8</sup> Much feminist art practice has tried to escape this game by refusing to establish a dialogue with the Western male artists who almost exclusively comprise the canon. Dujourie is not afraid of engaging in playful struggles. In her series of videos <italic>Hommage à… I–V</italic> (1972), made around the same time as <italic>Amerikaans imperialisme</italic>, we see her naked, lying on or near a bed in various classical nude positions, paying tribute to art-historical subjects — the artist and his model, and also the unseen viewer. A naked female body exposed to our voyeuristic gaze is easily read as willing prey. But if we look closer at the kaleidoscopic inventory of body postures, we discover a play of contradictory desires. Dujourie’s refusal to rely on any one pose, meaning or reading transforms her ‘body into a battleground’ and also her mind.<sup>9</sup> Who deserves her admiration most? Velázquez? Fragonard? Courbet? The ellipsis in the title allows for the elevation of anyone into a cult figure. But why not see <italic>Hommage à… I–V</italic> as a tribute to Dujourie herself? What can be more radical than affirming oneself as the ultimate authority?<fig id="fg2" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>Dujourie’s work has undergone many transformations over the years: from abstract sculpture to self-depicting videos, from monumental installations to minuscule meditations, from heavy to fragile materiality. After having experimented with collage and nude studies for a period, she made the stunning leap into her velvet works, which she carried out throughout the 1980s. In <italic>Opus 8</italic> (1984), for example, two intertwined velvet drapes — one a lurid light green, the other a sombre dark green — literally break out of a two-metre-wide golden picture frame. Occupying the half-left side of the otherwise empty frame, the intricate folds of the drapes bring to mind the opulent and meticulously depicted robes of Baroque painting, as if the dresses adorning two writhing figures at the centre of the composition had come to life; but they could equally be seen as mimicking the movement of paint splashing beyond the frame.</p>
      <p>In <italic>La Traviata</italic> (1984), a black velvet drape that covers the inside of a monumental four-metre-wide red frame leaves just the left upper corner exposed, revealing a uniform layer of pink paint underneath. The tip of the drape that has loosen itself from the frame caresses the floor, as if staging a mortuary farewell — or is it a foot descending from a scene? Giuseppe Verdi’s opera <italic>La Traviata</italic> (1853) is not only a love story but also a narrative about love for transient things — a favourite subject of the Baroque. Dujourie’s interpretation of this trope can be read through Gilles Deleuze’s understanding of the Baroque as the most abstract art of all in its creation of mental landscapes with the texture of matter. ‘To “have”’, argues Deleuze in <italic>The Fold: Leibniz and the Baroque</italic> (1988), ‘is to fold that which is outside inside.’<sup>10</sup> In Dujourie’s <italic>La Traviata</italic>, the Baroque is stripped down to its essence: a curtain without an action, as if incarnating Deleuze’s claim that, in the Baroque, there is nothing to see behind the curtain, nor beneath it. The secret is that there is no secret.<fig id="fg3" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>These references reappear in <italic>In mijn nacht nadert niemand</italic> (<italic>In my night no one approaches</italic>, 1985), a more self-contained composition, in which an olive-green velvet drape dangles forth, partially revealing the golden brocade on its reverse. Hanging from a mirror that doubles its contour, the folded drape stages a tension between inside and outside. The fold reveals the distortion inherent in the act of perception, but also a point of inflection between matter and soul, façade and hidden body, exposure and withdrawal. Its doubling suggests a world of human subjectivity lost in frames within frames and mirrors within mirrors. The subject is absent but the shape of the drape is highly anthropomorphic. Who is watching whom here, and where are the theatrics? The title quotes a poem by Flemish writer Hugues C. Pernath on the landscape of solitude, in which the solitary subject is longing for the appearance of an other.<sup>11</sup> Similarly, Dujourie’s work hints at the search for something, or someone, that is elsewhere; here, however, both subjects are absent, and the only thing that remains is the distance between their disappearances.<fig id="fg4" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>In <italic>Jeux de dames</italic> (<italic>Draughts</italic>, 1987), this dialectics of absence and presence is taken even further. On a large marble draughtsboard, a black folding screen stands, on which a twisting ultramarine-blue velvet drape rests. The composition might be said to resemble a vanishing rider trying to mount a horse that has transformed into an obstacle. Movement is frozen in the manner of Umberto Boccioni’s <italic>Forme uniche della continuità nello spazio</italic> (<italic>Unique Forms of Continuity in Space</italic>, 1913), but in Dujourie’s work neither form nor content are fixable. In contrast with the strict rules of chess, in draughts the pieces can move in all directions, and <italic>Jeux de dames</italic> embodies something of that state of infinite potentiality. Whereas in Boccioni’s futurist sculpture the movement is unidirectional, in Dujourie’s installation it is unresolved; the game could go either way.<fig id="fg5" position="float" fig-type="figure">

      <p>The absence of action counter-intuitively turns Dujourie’s phantasmagorical velvet series into highly active pieces that do exactly what Fried accused Minimal art of doing — perform. But in these works there is no self-sufficient form that imposes itself on the viewer. Dujourie’s transposition of the industrial, cold and masculine forms of Minimal art into ornamental, opulent and sensual fabrics evokes a more introspective search into European cultural history and its claims on religious and political supremacy. Think, for instance, of the use of eroticism and sensuality in Baroque art. Such subversion of references, materials and forms can be seen as part of a larger postmodern deconstruction of pure form but it is also a personal bridging of austerity and vanity, of formal experimentation and psychoanalytic journeys into the unknown.</p>
      <p>The luxurious fabrics vanish eventually in Dujourie’s work, leading to more sombre contemplation of the vanity of things. This aesthetic shift is again accompanied by a transition in materials — from the lavishness of velvet to the austerity of plaster and the rigidity of metal. The Latin phrase <italic>omnia vanitas</italic> (‘All is vanity’), often painted in seventeenth-century Dutch still lifes, points to the fruitlessness of humankind’s efforts in this world. In Dujourie’s series <italic>Kabinetten</italic> (<italic>Cabinets</italic>, 1992–93), a similar preoccupation with the transitory aspect of human satisfaction can be found. In this sober and delicate installation, plaster-cast cloths are tucked inside small, black metal boxes standing on tall, thin legs; they look something like a tomb, a drawer or a magician’s toolbox, suggesting both entrapment and liberation, the end of things and pure potentiality.</p>
      <p>Anthropomorphic objects alluding to an absent human body continue to populate the artist’s subsequent works. <italic>Mille et une nuits</italic> (<italic>Thousand and One Nights</italic>, 1993), for example, involves again plaster-cast cloths, which this time are in the scale of the human body and set against iron blackboards on tripods, as if they were hanging bath towels. Their ghostlike shapes connote the disappeared body — was it embalmed or just dried out? Such dialectics between lust and death resonate in <italic>Grijze velden</italic> (<italic>Grey Fields</italic>, 1997), in which an iron bed bears the sticks of a bier. It looks like a coffin ready to be carried on a litter, but coffin, litter and bed are one and the same, as if life and death had merged in one speculative form that can hold contradictory elements.</p>
      <p>The sensuality of the fabric pieces only returns, if transfigured, in Dujourie’s latest series, <italic>Ballade</italic> (2011), which embodies many of the artist’s yearnings and obsessions. First installed at the Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey, in Burgos, Spain as part of her exhibition ‘Nature’s Lore’ (2011), it is composed of a number of vividly coloured paper and papier mâché sculptures resembling flowers and herbs, inspired by the medicinal plants typically cultivated in the <italic>hortus sanitatis</italic> (‘physic garden’) of medieval monasteries such as Silos.<sup>12</sup> These ancient remedies are translated here into mesmerising forms and colours whose anatomy suggests the female sexual organ, or, more generally, the immanent desire in all things. The way the sculptures are displayed — one after the other, along two long tables — recalls Judy Chicago’s installation <italic>The Dinner Party</italic> (1974–79). Dujourie’s flowers are, however, not to be symbolically devoured; rather, they are intended for contemplation. If Chicago pinned down female celebrities as if they were butterflies, Dujourie asks us to exit the table of art history, having struggled with some of its protagonists, to enter an imaginary garden in which human and organic life forms live side by side.</p>
      <p>The true journey into the unknown can only begin with an attempt to exit ourselves and connect with the world around us. Maybe that’s what <italic>Amerikaans imperialisme</italic> is all about: the discovery of the gap at the centre of the symbolic order of Western art, and the wish to occupy it, fill it, hide in it, escape it, and then, to return to it, again and again, like a subject torn between <italic>agalma</italic> and <italic>objet petit a</italic>. The intellectual and sensual hide-and-seek with conscious and unconscious desires that Dujourie’s work stages places us between the impulse towards an ideal love and the fetishistic object that replaces its lack — in search of the causes of our desires.</p>
