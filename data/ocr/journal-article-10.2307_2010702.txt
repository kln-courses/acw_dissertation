Pp. xxi + 722. The title of this important new work by Professor Ormond-' Con- cepts of Philosophy,'-is not indicative of its contents. For it is essen- tially a work on the philosophy of religion. Or rather it is a work on religious philosophy, not treating in detail of religious phenomena, but giving those philosophical concepts that justify the religious con- struction of experience. It is remarkably free from blemishes of the polemical spirit. It is characterized by the same sweetness and light that we note in the Rev. Dr. Sewall's 'Reason in Belief.' It is, of course, as any philosophy of religion must be, controversial of all merely empirical interpretations of experience. It invalidates the scientific interpretation, not by mere negation, but by showing how the mechanical theory itself is only completed in a teleological view of the universe. " A final theory is one that transcends mechanism and finds the original spring of things in intelligence and purpose. Mechanism itself is reached only by abstrac- tion from intelligent and purposive activity" (p. 184). The concepts of philosophy that he reaches are necessarily those of absolute idealism. But he guards against taking them as being abstractly intellectual. With Hegel, he insists upon their purposive character, and goes further in reintegrating the emotional element of concrete experience. He thus succeeds in conserving all that the pragmatists contend for, without giving up the fundamental rational construction of experience. It is impossible to give an abstract of this large product of ripe philosophical culture. But we may indicate some of its chief points. His central principle, to which all his critical procedure leads, is that of Personality-' a transcendent and eternal consciousness, whose thought and purpose would be adequate for the movement as a whole' (p. 394, cf. et pp. 335, 517 and 718). He works up to this by a critical exposition of the abstract view of the scientific construction of experience, showing that it abstracts from the fundamental relation of every form of experi- ence to consciousness. Consciousness, in its highest form of self-con- sciousness-that to which every real thing is-is the fundamental reality. One finds himself criticizing the author (p. 409) for his rather loose use of the term consciousness. A more thorough working out of the concept at the start would save some confusion. Natural science abstracts from consciousness and gives us an abstract external world in a mechanical system. Purposive intelligent conscious- ness then asserts itself against this abstraction when paraded as the whole truth of experience. Its acquisitions are reread and reinterpreted by philosophy in the light of the concrete situation. Naturalism makes nature indifferent to consciousness, treating it at best as a helpless spec- tator. Philosophy corrects this abstraction and grounds naturalism and mechanism in consciousness as the final and efficient term in reality (p. 393). Kant's supposed Copernican revolution was really (as later</page><page sequence="2">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 47 idealistic philosophy shows) ' a change from what we may call a hylo- centric to a psychocentric conception of the world of reality ' (p. 70). His chapter on the 'Dialectic' is not quite what one would expect. It lacks the clean-cut intellectual exposition that is ordinarily supposed to be the characteristic of the dialectic. With him it is diluted or mixed with more practical elements. It takes the form of an evaluation of 'the plain man's' knowledge by science and metaphysics, but it reaches its aim in showing how it is that only the metaphysically real-the eternal self-consciousness-is the ultimate category of explanation. In the light of this principle he reviews physical science, biology, social activities, the community, and the social and ethical syntheses. The chapters in which he treats of these various constructions are full of clear conceptions and interesting details. The dialectic persistently shows the inadequacy of all these constructions. But it is chiefly the ethical synthesis that is made the bridge to the religious construction. Here we reach the demand for 'an eternal consciousness, now in the garb of a supreme and all-comprehending ethical purpose, in which the ethical purposes of finite individuals shall be included and conserved, and which at the same time shall supply the universal under which the world forces as a whole may be unified and subordinated to conscious direction' (p. 395). He accepts the alternative of taking such an eternal consciousness as the final term of reality and as primate in a world of reality, and then proposes to accept the rigorous logic of the situation-that of construing all forms of physical and psychical existence as grounded in it. That is, he accepts the theistic interpretation of experience as a whole. In a chapter on 'Emotion and Rationality,' he reintegrates emotion in his first principle of personality. The completely rational must satisfy our whole conscious nature. " If it satisfies the intellect but leaves the emo- tional world in chaos, it does not embody a completely rational situation." Then follows this statement: " A completely rational conception of reality is one in which the combined requirements of thought and feeling are ideally met by a principle of unity that has its spring and type in the oneness of conscious individuality, uniting with a principle of individua- tion that it includes while it grounds and limits the variations of per- sonality " (p. 409). Both phenomenalism and pantheism are conse- quently ruled out as not being completely rational, and we are boldly and firmly carried into an anthropomorphic interpretation of experience as a whole. Where analogy with self fails there knowledge ceases. The purely transcendent is the utterly unknowable. These are Professor Ormond's repeated dicta. But no phase of experience fails to give us both trans- cendence and self-likeness. The ultimate reality is like and super-like self. These are the two strands that Professor Ormond seeks to weave into the pattern of the cosmos. There are many questions we should like to ask him before giving a verdict as to his success. But let that go, and let us briefly summarize, where we do not criticize. He devotes a chapter to a consideration of the psychological roots of religion and another one to the question of the origin and development</page><page sequence="3">48 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY of religion. These two chapters are largely critical of current anthro- pological theories of the religion of primitive man. But they also give a constructive view of religious elements and processes and progress. The two main elements that he analyzes out of the process are those of the transcendency and the likeness-to-self of the object of religion. Knowl- edge of God is a progressive personalization of the transcendent, by what he terms an 'infinitation of human analogies' (p. 468). This is a process which more truly represents the advance than does Spencer's view of deanthropomorphization, which only characterizes a decadent movement. Analogy with self is the only means of knowing God. Crude anthro- pomorphism can only be replaced by a more and more elevated one. When it is entirely gone, then knowledge of God is gone too. But even in its crudest form anthropomorphization implies an infinita- tion of analogies of self. In the use of these " analogies of our self-hood experience, we are forever approximating, but ever falling short of, a complete and adequate realization of the Divine. . . . Self-hood supplies the germ of an experience which, if its forms could be completely devel- oped and all its possibilities translated into reality, would have trans- cended the limits of finitude and relativity and become absolute " (p. 572). Here we find him stating a relative agnosticism as he does in other places. The 'sense of transcendence' is never wholly intelligizable by the per- sonalizing process. "The result is a movement of approximation in which we are progressively conceiving the value of X, which stands for the Divine nature, but never reaching a definition that can be taken as final" (p. 489). Here we are utterly unable to understand Professor Ormond's position. Here he is apparently treating of mere conceptions or picture-thoughts about God as 'the great eject' (p. 119). But he has previously identified God or the Absolute with self-conscious personality. That was his ulti- mate definition of the Absolute. On that ground of rational definition he is at one with the so-styled gnosticism of Hegel and other absolute ideal- ists. It is a great lapse of the argument to take the question into the region of picture-conceptions and thus unavoidably fall into agnosticism. " The analogy of self-hood is the principle of intelligibility in general " (p. 609). What need, then, to lapse from his doctrine of self-hood as self- consciousness to that of an empirically conscious self? Then take the following quotation at his highest point of view: " We do not regard God as a being like ourselves up to a certain point and so far forth intelligible, while beyond that point His nature becomes transcendent and wholly inaccessible. . . . If God be intelligible at all He is intelligible in His whole nature. . . . God is a being like ourselves in a true sense,-our other self. He is this in His whole being and not in a mere part of it" (p. 610). There is no congruity between this definition of the Absolute and his assertion that 'we never reach a definition that can be taken as final.' Surely all that he can mean is that we can never reach a final picture-conception of God. A philosophy of religion should definitely evaluate picture-conceptions in terms of thought and then have done with agnosticism.</page><page sequence="4">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 49 Otherwise we find Professor Ormond's using of the two strands of self- analogy and transcendence of great force and enlightenment in his interesting discussions of the theistic question. Depersonalizing deity in occidental pantheism reaches the same goal attained in oriental thought by the depersonalizing of self (p. 475). In either form the depersonalizing process is a decadent movement. That is the hopeful, gnostic strain that dominates the whole work. In the light of this, the human individual gets his just place. " The self is not simply 'a piece of the Absolute,' as Royce says (unguardedly, I think), nor is the self simply a specialized purpose of the Absolute" (p. 525). But, 'in man, God is instituting finite replications of Himself, natures which find their ideals of life and good realized in God and which are bearers, therefore, of a divine destiny.' " It is an abuse of analogy, to characterize these finite selves as bits of the Absolute" (p. 665). He further criticizes Royce's grounding of the finite individual in the Abso- lute as failing to secure its worthful reality (p. 669). The one must not be so conceived, that it swallows up the many. It is to be noted that in treating of the destiny of man, after canvass- ing the different grounds for immortality, he comes to say: "All the proofs of immortality, from Plato down to John Fiske, have rested on the presumption of the teleological character of man's life . . . The Platonic proofs have supplied the model of all proof in this field" (p. 675). It is to be noted, too, that he carries the teleological principle into his chapter on 'Nature,' and thus makes way for his conception of man as a part of-the culmination of-the nature process. "Why should a purposeless system evolve as apparently its most characteristic product a purposeful being " (p. 651). " Let us once become thoroughly grounded in the doctrine of the divine origin of nature, and we shall not have any trouble with the natural extraction of man.. . Through nature he comes from God " (p. 622). The volume is too large and too important for anything like a fair appreciation, except in the form of an extended review. We trust that we have said enough to voice our judgment that it gives a thoroughly notable and helpful addition to our standard works on the philosophy of religion. It is to be hoped that the next edition of the work will give us a good index. Let me close with a quotation from the last page of this most delight- ful and stimulating volume: " There seems to be, in the last analysis, just two alternative views of consciousness that can be regarded as at all rational. The one is that which conceives it as mere awareness, and con- sequently, when logical, reduces it to a mere spectator in the world. The other is the view advocated here; namely, that consciousness is an agent- in fact the agent of agents,-revealing in its activity the truth and significance of the inner nature of things " (p. 718).
