The continued conflicts between Pompey and Caesar, and Cicero's own failed attempts at successful social trian- gulation in the dispute, had left the orator at an unarguable dry speli in his oratorical and literary career and ail but deprived of the foren- sic popularity and social status he once enjoyed. Cicero had not de- livered an oration since the masterful, if somewhat anxiously re- worked for publication, pro Milone in 52; he followed this with de Re Publica in 51, but indeed seems to hâve published nothing of sub- stance between this and Brutus in 4ο5. The man who once consid- ered himself the very voice and body of the Republic has found him- self a Virtual exile6 from the Forum that had so long been his home and at a loss, or so he suggests, as to how to reinstate himself in the «oratorical civitas» of the urbs. Brutus, then, constitutes both a break- ing of the longest silence experienced by the orator since the first years of his career, and the prologue of his reentry into the intellec- tual, and as I shall contend textual, life of thè city. The détails of this reentry are made explicit early in Brutus where, in a pointed discussion of the économies of literary exchange, Atti- cus is made to describe in novel and definitively textual terms the 3. Caesar crossed the Rubicon and marched on Rome in January 49 BCE; the ensuing turmoil lasted some two décades. Although it would be anachronistic to establish a date for thè definitive «death of the Republic», upon the conclusion of the civil war it seems clear that the Republic had given way in part to an incipient monarchy and the eventual rise of a new impérial structure. On the difficulty of establishing any single moment of «collapse», see fiirther especially E.S. Gruen, The Last Generation of the Ro- man Repüblic, California 1974, pp. 1-5. 4. It has often been supposed that Brut. 3.10, (quid uos, inquam, Brute et Attice? Numquid tandem noui? Nihil sane, inquit Brutus, quod quidem aut tu audire uelis aut ego pro certo dicere audeam), refers to the outcome at Thapsus on 6 April (so see Douglas, op. cit., pp. ix-x), and so it has been argued that the dialogue (or this part of it, at any rate) was written be- fore the news of Thapsus had reached Rome. However, it is entirely possible that the orator, himself aware of the outcome of the African campaign, wished to set the dialo- gue either in the days before the news of Caesar's victory had reached Rome or, and as Gowing, art. cit., pp. 62-64 convincingly argues, indeed after the news of Thapsus had reached our interlocutors, in which case 3.10 might refer to Caesar's plans in the wake of his victory. 5. It is likely that some work was completed on de Legibus (started in 52) in this year, and it has been suggested that the work begun on this text was picked up again in 46 at around the same time as the composition of Brutus (Gowing, art. cit., p. 40 and P. Mac- Kendrick, The Philosophical Books of Cicero, New York 1989, p. 77, among others, cite Ep. Fam. 9.2.5 in support of this chronology) and seems to hâve been worked on from that point untQ, perhaps, the author's death in 43. 6. So W.M. Bloomer, Latinity and Literary Society at Rome, Pennsylvania 1997, p. 54, no- tes of Cicero's technical treatises of thè late 50s and 40s, «These Latin dialogues with Roman characters, however anachronistic, are [...] the publication of a professed, not legal, exile».</page><page sequence="3">Textual Eloquence in Cicero7 s Brutus 117 «debt» of which the présent dialogue is imagined fitting repay- ment: Itaque quoniam hic [inquit Atticus] quod mihi deberetur se exacturum pro- fessus est, quod huic debes, ego a te peto. Quidnam id? inquarti. Ut scribas, inquit, aliquid; iam pridem enim conticuerunt tuae litterae. nam ut illos de re publica libros edidisti, nihil a te sane postea accepimus... (Brut. 5.19) «And thus, [said Atticus] since this fellow has claimed that he will exact what you owe me, I corne to get payment for what you owe him». «What- ever do you mean?» I said. «That you write something». Said Atticus, «For it has been too long now that your pages hâve held silent. Γ ve received es- sentially nothing from you since you published those books On the Repub- lic...» The blatantly economie tones of an elite discussion of textual re- ciprocity are indeed surprising - nowhere in any of the orator' s ear- lier technical treatises does such language or imagery appear - but hâve been little discussed by critics and commentators in the past7. And yet even before we get to Atticus' remarkable suggestion that the orator's text (in lieu of his voice) might fonction as a kind of so- cial currency, the dialogue establishes itself on a subtle thème of public silence and its cure in private literary memory and recollec- tion. The treatise begins with a narrative that recalls the détails of Autumn 50, shortly after the orator has received the news of the death of Q. Hortensius Hortalus8 but presumably before thè defini- tive start of civil war. In the death of Hortensius, as soon becomes dear, Cicero has lost not just a friend and esteemed colleague but ail of his hopes for the future of Republican speech and thè politicai freedoms of which this speech is the expression. Indeed, and as we told at the end of the dialogue, the orator sees in the death of Hort- ensius an allegory for his own particular fate: Hortensi uox exstincta fato su' est, nostra publico, «Hortensius' voice was silenced by his own death, mine by thè that of thè state» (Brut. 96.328). From the Hellenistic period on, it had been a standard feature of 7. Douglas' op. cit. pp. 10-13 response is représentative, «In this difficult passage, in which it is hard to determine how far the metaphors should be pressed [...] Qicero] promises to repay his debt to Atticus, and in §19 his debt to Brutus, by some published works» (p. 10). 8. Q. Hortensius Hortalus, cos. 69, died in mid June, 50 BCE; Cicero learned of this death on ca. 10 August, upon his return to Rhodes: Brut. 1.1; cf. Fam. 3.12, 2.15; Att. 6.6. Hortalus, born in 114, was eight years older than Cicero (Brut. 64.230) and held undispu- ted oratorical prééminence until thè rise of thè latter; politicai rivais only early in Cice- ro's career (cf. in Verrem [70] and pro Lege Manilia [66]), the two were on the same side in trials from 63 onward.</page><page sequence="4">118 Sarah Culpepper Stroup thè dedicateci text that it begin with a référence to the death or loss of a loved one and use this death as the affective impulse for the «life» offered by the subséquent composition and prestation9. But as has been noted by several scholars,10 the funereal imagery of Bru- tus is limited neither to the introduction of the dialogue nor to the orator's discussion of Hortensius. Rather, after a brief but moving eulogy for his colleague (1.1-5), thè orator expands thè scope of his lament to include both the Republic and, as an implied corollary, the whole of Roman oratory (2.6-9). His only solace, as the final Unes of the introduction tell us, is engaging in the recollection11 of Rome's great oratorical lineage (2.9). It is with this sentiment that the intro- duction - and the orator's solitude - cornes to an end, and the imag- ined sermo is brought to the stage with the arrivai of Atticus and Bru- tus at Cicero's Palatine12 residence. Cicero's two interlocutors hap- pen upon the orator strolling in his private garden13 quietly lament- ing the worsening fate of the Republic. The very sight of his beloved comrades eases Cicero's troubled heart, and after a brief référence to the ills of thè state, Atticus asks of Cicero whether they might en- joy de re publica silentium (3.11) and hear something from Cicero him- self (aliquid audiremus [...] ex te) rather than be the bearers of news that might only add to the orator's worries. After a jovial chat over the circulation and exchange of litterae in which the three participate 9. It is a characteristic of Hellenistic epistolary dedication to claim that the death of a friend or colleague has inspired the présent text: thus Archimedes dedicates his Quadra- tura Parabolae to Dositheus, but cites the récent death of Conon as the impetus for his writing. Similarly, both Cicero and Catullus frequently cite the death of a friend or col- league as the impetus for a dedicated work; Catullus préfaces his «translation» of Calli- machus' Coma Berenikes (66) with an entire poem - dedicated to this same Hortensius - outlining the connections between his brother's death, grief, memory, and friendship. In addition to Cicero's use of the death of Hortensius in this dialogue, he cites the deaths of Crassus and Antonius as at least partially responsible for his décision to write de Oratore, and uses news of Scaevola's death as an entry point into thè recollected sermo of Laelius. On thè late Republican use of death as a trope in the production of the dedi- cated text, see S.C. Stroup, A Society of Patrons. Cicero, Catullus, and thè Body ofthe Text, forthcoming. 10. Recognized by modem critics first by R. Haenii, Die literarische Kntik in Ciceros Bru- tus, Samen 1905, p. 52 («Ciceros ,Brutus' ist in gewissem Sinne die grosse politische Grabrede au die eloquentia Romana»); cf. too Douglas, op. cit., p. xi; Fantham, op. cit., pp. 45-46; Narducci, op. cit., p. 98, «giustamenta si è parlato del Brutus come di una Gra- brede, di un epitafio dell'eloquenza romana; il tono funereo è presente fino dal proe- mio, una lunga felicitazioni per la tempestiva morte che ha impedtio a Ortensio...». 11. quorum memoria et recordatio in maxumù nostris grauissimisque curis iucunda sane fuit, cum in eam nuper ex sermone quodam incidessemus. 12. This is clearly the dramatic location of the dialogue, as indicated by the phrase, cum [...] essem otiosus domi, «when I was [...] taking my leisure at home» (3.10), cf. Douglas, op. cit., p. 7 and Gowing, art. cit.; pace Fantham, op. cit., p. 45, who places the dialogue at Tusculum, the site of the orators' earlier conversation: quod mihi nuper in Tusculano inchoauùti de oratoribus (5.20). 13. nam cum inambularem xysto et essem otiosus domi, M. ad me Brutus, ut consueuerat, cum T.

(3.10).</page><page sequence="5">Textual Eloquence in Cicero* s Brutus 119 with dear enthusiasm (3.11-5.21)14, Cicero agrées to Atticus' request to discuss Rome's oratorical past (5.20, quod mihi nuper in Tusculano inchoauisti de oratonbus: quando esse coepissent, qui etiam et qualesfiiL·- sent, «[Γά like to return to] that which you recently began telling me about the orators: their origins, and who they were, and what they were like»). And the rest, as they say, is history. Or is it? For even as Brutus is a dialogue ostensibly intent on a pré- sentation of Rome's oratorical past15, I would argue that it is simi- larly a text deeply concerned with the future rôle of thè orator in a Republic that had corne increasingly under the power of an auto- crat. As noted above it has long been recognized that Brutus (a text aptly identified by Gowing as a literary «anomaly»)16 plays an impor- tant rôle in the orator's attempt to write himself back into the intel- lectual life of Rome. So too, critics hâve more recently noted that the oratorical biographies of which Brutus is composed may mark a kind of turning point from primarily oral to primarily written rhetorical practice; a newfound or at any rate reinvigorated interest in the literary history of Rome17. But as much as the literary inter- ests of the dialogue hâve been recognized, I would argue that even the excellent récent studies of Brutus hâve tended to view Cicero's 14. Cf. Gowing, art. cit., p. 48, who notes right of sections 3.13-4.16, «His reading of it, Cicero responds, brought him salus (13), and once again following the principle of po- etic reciprocity - citing in this instance Hesiod - Cicero insists on repaying Atticus in kind». The orator's citation of Hesiod at Brut. 4.15-5.16, (quamquam illud Hesiodium lauda- tur a doctis, quod eadem mensura reddere iubet qua acceperis aut etiam aimulatiore, si possis) refers to Erga 349-350 (ευ μεν μετρεΐσϋαι παρά γείτονος, ευ δ' άποδοΰναι / αύτώι τώι μέτρωι, και λώιον, αϊ κε δύνηαι «Take well from your neighbor, and return well, too, / by the very same measure, and even better, if you can...»). This is a favorite passage of the ora- tor's in discussions of his own literary and social reciprocity, and as referred to similarly at de OJf 1.48 (45 BCE), Ep. Att. 13.12.3 (45 BCE), and Ep. Fam. 9.8.1 (45 BCE). 15. As Marco Zangari has suggested to me, Brutus refashions the whole history of the Republic according to a definitively oratorical world-view. It reclaims the growth and prééminence of the urbs as one imminently dépendent upon the successes of its orators, and reckons time not according to consular year so much as oratorical milestone. See further E. Rawson, Cicero the Historian and Cicero the Antiquariati, «Journ. Rom. Stud.» 62, 1972 on this dialogue in the context of the orator's historical endeavors. 16. For the literary motives of Brutus, see further esp. Kytzler, art. cit.; Narducci, op. cit., pp. 157-160; Stroup, op. cit. 17. Narducci, op. cit., discusses the rôle of Brutus in this process in chapter Five (Dal Discorso Pronunciato al Discorso Scritto. L'eloquenza come Prodotto Letterario, pp. 157-173); see too Kytzler, art. cit. Elsewhere, the literary leanings of the dialogue recognized, but the textual aspirations of its author rarely noted: thus C. Rathofer, Cicero 's , Brutus' ah li- terarisches Paradigma eines Auctorias-Verhältnis, Frankfurt 1986, pp. 158-160, limits his dis- cussion of such to «literarische Kritik» in Brutus, whereas Fantham, op. cit., p. 46, re- marks upon the dialogue's utility as a source-pièce for our own investigations into the early history of the Republic: «The Brutus is as near as surviving Roman texts will bring us to literary history». See also Fantham's more developed discussion of the literary in- tentions of Brutus and Orator in G. Kennedy (ed.), The Cambridge History of Literary Criti- cism, vol. 1, Cambridge 1989, pp. 235-241.</page><page sequence="6">120 Sarah Culpepper Stroup literary interests as second to his oratorical or historiographical ones18. That the orator's composition of numerous and varied dialogues attests to his wide-ranging literary interests is at this point beyond question. But one of the main thèmes of this article will be that his literary interests extended forcibly into his own work, and into his own aspirations for textual production and explicitly literary renown. Indeed, Cicero's choice to write Brutus at a time of extreme personal and politicai destabilization should incite us to look be- yond the stated thèmes of the dialogue and to plumb more deeply thè social and textual implications of this rieh treatise. There are of course manifold potential starting points for a productive 'textual' exploration into Brutus. The focus of this study is limited to one of the most prévalent, and yet least discussed thèmes of the dialogue: the orator's peculiar and progressively complex personification of Republican éloquence in terms of a gendered physical being - a young woman, to be precise - who can move throughout, and be manipulated within, the orator's textual world. 2. Cicero and the Problem of Personification The cultic, artistic, and literary personification of cognitive abstrac- tions - the process by which variously 'non-human* attributes ac- quire recognizably human characteristics, or Persönlichkdt, to use Stössl's term19 - occupies a prominent position in the social and in- tellectual life of antiquity. However, both the désignation of any particular personification as such, and indeed within the realm of personification the production of a meaningful distinction between 'cultic déification', 'anthropomorphic characterization' and 'literal- 18. For an early investigation into the literary concerns of Brutus, see Haenni, op. cit.; somewhat later see Kytzler, op. cit. and Rathofer, op. cit., and most recently Narducci, op. cit. and Gowing, art. cit. Fantham, 1997 op. cit., pp. 45-46, refers to Brutus as alterna- tively (and rightly) a «cultural history» and a «literary history»; A. La Penna, Ritratti dalle Lettere di Cicerone, in Interpretare Cicerone, E. Narducci (ed.), Firenze 2002, 1-23 (here, p. 3), confesses a prédilection for Brutus «non solo per la galleria di ritratti, ma ancora più per la capacità di calare la storia dell'oratoria romana nella storia politica e culturale di Roma». T.N. Habinek, The Politics of Latin Literature. Wnting, Identity, and Empire in An- cient Rome, Princeton 1998, p. 96, notes that Brutus demonstrates «interest in literary as well as politicai history». 19. Stössl (Pauly-Wissowa, XIX, 1042-1058) describes the phenomenon neatly, «Von Per- sonificationen kann gesprochen werden, wenn einem Unpersönlichen, also Seelenlo- sen die Merkmale der Persönlichkeit verliehen, ihm Eigenschaften, Gedanken, Ge- fühle, Bestrebungen, Handlugen zugeschriben werden, die sonst nur beseelter Persön- lichkeit - menschlicher oder göttlicher - zukommen».</page><page sequence="7">Textual Eloquence in Cicero7 s Brutus 121 ized lexical effect'20 are consistently fraught issues. On the déifica- tion end of the spectrum is what I would term the 'strong personifi- cation' of abstract civic desiderando, (e.g., Tyche/ Fortuna, Hygeia, Con- cordia, and Fax), who corne outfitted with physical attributes, topo- graphical associations, and family trees; and who tend to be more a matter of cultic practice and, in turn, artistic représentation than they do of poetic device21. In opposition to thèse figures, we might posit as 'weak personification' both (1) the literalizing lexicality of passing phenomena or human concerns (Phobos and Aidos in Homer; Fortuna, Salusy and Spes in Plautus and Fama in Virgil) and (2) the self-contained mythopoietic pedigrees that are emotionally effec- tive at a world-order level but rarely exert narratological force out- side of the passages in which they occur (so Atê is the daughter of Zeus at Ü. 19.91; the progeny of Nux are given at Hes. Theog. 211- 232)22. For whereas both of thèse maneuvers may function as a pow- erful literary device within a particular passage or work, in each case the personified figure is rarely characterized with more than a sim- ple epithet and in any case tends to function at the rhetorical side- lines - rather than thematic center - of a text. But if the vividly per- sonified Tyche of Rhamnous stands at one pole, and the scarcely per- sonified Fortuna in Terence (Phorm. 203) stands at the other, then the majority of what are casually referred to as Greek and Roman 'per- sonifications' are situated somewhere on the highly literary contin- uum between strong cultic abstract and weak grammatical invoca- tion. It is in this category of 'middling personification', the detailed and literalizing endowment of an abstract concept with the variously human characteristics (e.g., heredity and appearance, thought and 20. I adopt this helpful term from Quilligan's discussion of female allegory in Pizan's Cité des Dames: «personifications of abstractions such as Philosophy and Nature take the feminine form primarily because allegory always works narratively by literalizing lexi- cal effects.» (M. Quilligan, The Allegory of Female Authonty: Christine de Pizan's «Cité des Dames», Ithaca 1991, pp. 24-25; cited in HJ. Paxson, Personification's Gender, «Rhetorica» 16 (2) 1998, pp. 149-179; see hère esp. pp. 160-161). For a helpful summary of modem théories of personification and gender, see Paxson, art. cit., pp. 158-162; although Pax- son is incorrect in his early statement that «in Hellenic, Roman, and much medieval art and allegorical literature, personified abstractions [...] were exclusively female» (149; ita- lics in original) - there are of course a fair number of masculine personifications in anti- quity (e.g., Phobos, Thanatos, Ploutos and Demos in Greek authors; Amor and Furor in La- tin) - he nevertheless provides an interesting discussion of the (predominately) femi- nine gendering of personification. Paxson, The Poetics of Personification, Cambridge 1994, pp. 8-34, provides a helpful survey of the définitions of personification from antiquity to thè medieval period. 21. On the déification of abstract ideas in Rome, H.L. Axtell, The Déification of Abstract Ideas in Roman Literature and Inscriptions, Chicago 1907 remains an important resource. 22. So too Atê is named daughter of Eris at Hes. Theog. 230 and the mother of Peitho at Aiskh. Ag. 385-386. Pindar gives Hybris as the mother of Koros at O. 13.10, and Euripides lists Alastor, Phonos, Thanatos and Phthonos as possible fathers of Helen at Tro. 768-769.</page><page sequence="8">122 Sarah Culpepper Stroup sensation, intention and action) that we find thè boundaries of thè abstract and the materialized most vibrantly tested. Thus, for exam- ple, in Prodicus' fable of Herakles* choice between the feminized Eudaimonia/Kakia and Aretê (Xen. Mem. II.1.21-34), in Aristophanes' bickering Logox, (Ar. Neph.), and in Callimachus' comically mournful Plokamos (Pf. fr. 110; cf. Cat. 66) we hâve personifications that réside not in the in pale grammatical margins of a text so much as at the vi- brant, discursive core. And so when I refer to Eloquentia as 'personi- fied' in Brutus, what I mean is that thè abstract concept of éloquence is transformed in the text into an increasingly human, identifiably fe- male character. As such, she is subject to many of the freedoms, at- tentions, and restrictions of a 'real woman/ but possesses thèse at- tributes always with the understanding that she acts as the human embodiment of the Republican voice. Thus she is capable of speech (though quite significantly she does not speak in the text), silence, movement, stasis, learning, unlearning, romantic overture, and - most importantly - protection from thèse overtures at the hands of her ideaHzed Tathers/ At no place in this dialogue would I suggest that Cicero endows his Eloquentia with divine status, or offers her up as an object of cultic worship in anything more than thè most ab- stract or poetic of terms (though a later fragment of his Hortensius might indeed point to such)23. But neither can the orator's careful and highly literary construction of Eloquentia be dismissed as weak grammatical abstraction or mere rhetorical effect. As I argue in the follo wing pages, the personification of Eloquentia in Brutus is nothing so much as an intensely literary maneuver. As such, it is not only a vivid embodiment of thè oratori own hopes and plans for the dis- tinctly textual future of the Republican voice, but indeed a blueprint for literary expression and textual exchange that would présage much of what becomes the accepted norm for the production of both prose and verse in the Augustan and Imperiai periods. But if the lion's share of ancient literary personifications fall into the category of this 'middling' type, even in the case of such mid- dling personifications there is the strong tendency to resisi, if not re- ject, a standardization or consistency of form and degree of charac- terization. So in the earliest poetic examples of personification - such figures as Dike, Hypnos, Thanatos and Até24 - the personifica- 23. Hort., fr. 19 «...]ca Eloquentia tuen, quarti tu in caelum, Hortensi, credo, ut ipse cum ea si- mul ascenderes, sustsulisses». The context is of course unclear, but as Hortensius likely dates to 45 - the year after the publication of Brutus and yet in the period of the orator's greatest literary production - I find it not unlikely that Cicero is here pursuing the thème of Eloquentia as a kind of literary 'Muse' intimately connected to the interests of Republican oratores. 24. For Dike, ci. Hes. Erga 219-224; 256-262; for Hypnos, Soph. Phil. 827 ff.; for Thanatos,</page><page sequence="9">Textual Eloquence in Cicero's Brutus 123 tions vary from passage to passage and author to author25 in the de- gree to which they are endowed with anthropomorphic physical, in- tellectual, or emotional characteristics. Even in the case of later au- thors a single word will often vacillate - rapidly and within the same text - between vivid personification and unmarked abstract, and I would suggest that it is the very lexical and stylistic flexibility en- dowed by this 'middling personification' that seems to have been its greatest source of appeal for authors interested in exploring the po- etic and rhetorical potentialities of this landscape of abstraction. In his own use of personification we find Cicero no more or less consistent than, and at least as enthusiastic as, his Greek and Roman predecessors. The orator's acquaintance with the dialect and liter- ary tradition of personification, in its many forms, is evident throughout the corpus. He knew of Prodicus' seductive moral apo- logue; his référence to it in de Officiti is a primary source for Roman knowledge of the fable26 and although his citation of it eschews mention of the sophist's hypersexualization of the young Herakles' 'moral choices' it is clear that he had acquaintance with the text of Xenophon. As is perhaps unsurprising, Cicero theorizes more than any other prose author on the enthronement of civic good as a means of influencing public behavior27. He argues in the technical treatises for the personification of uirtutes (though never uitia, cf. de Leg. II.19, 28) as a means of encouraging proper behavior among the boni28, and represents the voice and character of absent (or de- ceased) individuals and abstracts - through the process of conforma- ci Eur. Alk.; for Atê, cf. Λ. 9.505-507, 1991-96; 126-133; Hes. Erga 216, 231, 352, 413; Aiskh. Ag. 355- 25. So Greene, (OCD 1949; s.v. Personifications) «A single figure, such as Ate, varies from passage to passage and from poet to poet, being now a physical or psychological phenomenon, now a moral force, now a füll -fledged divinity with family connections [...] even a given poet within a single work often vacillâtes between the genuine perso- nification of a vividly characterized abstraction and a 'grammatical apotheosis' to the despair of modem editors who would like to be consistent in the matter of capital letters». 26. Nam quod Herculem Prodicus dicit, ut est apud Xenophontem, cum pnmum pubesceret, quod tempus a natura ad deligendum, quant quisque uiam uiuendi sit ingressurus, datum est, exisse in solitudinem atque ibi sedentem diu secum multumque dubitasse, cum duas cerneret uias, unam Voluptatis, altérant Virtutis, utram ingredi melius esset... (de Off 1.118). Cicero's utter silence hère on Prodicus' highly eroticized personifications of Eudaimonia I Kakia and Aretê is indeed surprising, though one wonders whether the orator may hâve consid- ered that kind of détail excessively lascivious (!) for a book on moral duties dedicated [in 44] to his son. Cicero mentions Prodicus elsewhere at Brutus 8.30 and DND 1.118 in a discussion of the «cultic personification» of moral goods. 27. In addition to DND I.118 (cited above), see 2.61. Cicero explicates the specihcally moral benefits of personification at de Leg. 2.19 and 28. 28. It is undear, of course, where else in the Republican and early Impérial corpus we might expect to see such theorizing. It would be unlikely for this kind of discussion to appear in the historians, and indeed it does not; Quintilian theorizes on prosopopoeia at 12.10.61 and (more fully) 9.2.29 and 11.1.39 but it is clear that what he has in mind is the</page><page sequence="10">124 Sarah Culpepper Stroup tio - in many of his public orations and with notorious success. To the modern critic the philosophical 'personification' of, e.g., Fides and the forensic 'voicing' of a deceased ancestor (so Appius Clodius Caecus in Cael 33-34) may seem like inherently - and perhaps even significantly - divergent rhetorical maneuvers. But a discussion of conformatici19 by the auctor of the ad Herennium would suggest pre- cisely the opposite: Conformatio est cum aliqua quae non adest persona confingitur quasi ad- sit, aut cum res muta aut informis fit eloquens, et forma ei et oratio adtribuitur ad dignitatem adcommodata aut actio quaedam [...] haec con- formatio licet in plures res, in mutas atque inanimas transferatur. Proficit plurimum in amplificationibus partibus et commiseratione. (Her. 4.53.66) Conformatio entails the fashioning of an absent individuai as if présent, or when a suent or unformed thing is mode eloquent, and both form and speech are attributed to it, or a certain type of movement suited to its character [...] This conformatio may be applied to a varie ty of things, both silent and inanimate; it is especially effective in the techniques of «amplification and «commiseratio». In the passage above, we hâve the inclusion of two apparently dis- tinct rhetorical maneuvers (thè Greek eihopoeia in thè fìrst case, and prosopopoeia in the second) within one and the same conceptual and linguistic category. The first technique of conformatio, one we might cali 'animate personification' (the 'voicing' of an absent but theoret- ically animate persona), is rarely induded in modem surveys of ei- ther «personification» or rhetorical figure but was indeed used by the orator frequently and with great success30. The second tech- nique, one we might specify as 'inanimate personification' (the 'voicing' of, or attribution of Persönlichkeit to, that which is naturally représentation of absent individuals rather than the attribution of Persönlichkeit to ab- stract concepts. 29. Cicero himself uses the term throughout the philosophica and the rhetorica in both its most basic sensé - as an indication of physical of 'semi-physical· fashioning, shape, and form (DND 1. 18.47; Tusc. 1.22.50; de Or. 1.25.114) - as well as its more metaphoric - as an indication of expression, mental notion, verbal arrangement and even, in Brutus, something like 'figure in speech' (de Or. 1.5.18, 3.52.201; DND 1.38. 105; Top. 5.27; Brut. 37.140). 30. Surely one of the more famed examples of such is at Cael. 14.33-34, in the orator's dramatization of Appius Claudius Caecus' imagined horror at the events wrought by his descendent; an imagined speech by Milo functions similarly at Mil. 93-98 (on which see further J.M. May, Trials of Character. The Eloquence ofCiceronian Ethos, North Carolina 1988, pp. 137-140). Quintilian discusses this technique at Inst. Orat. 12.10.61 (and else- where), where he identifies it as a component of the «grand style» of oratory; at 9.2.31, he distinguishes between prosopopoeia (in the case of the deceased) and ethopoeia (in the case of the living).</page><page sequence="11">Textual Eloquence in Cicero' s Brutus 125 mute, unformed, or inanimate) is similarly a common enough élé- ment in Ciceronian oratory: if it appears with somewhat less fre- quency than the first, it arguably cames with it even greater rhetori- cal power. Thus Sicily is made to speak at Caec. 11-27, Res Publica at Plane. 12-13, and Patria [et al] at Cat. I.18, 27; Patria is made to «hâte and fear» at Cat. I.17. But as distinct as thèse two techniques may seem to the modem critic, the auctor's explanation of the term, in concord with Cicero's own free use of both 'types* of conformatio, would suggest that both the voicing of the absent animate and the voicing of thè mute inanimate were considered identical (or at least comparable) rhetorical processes. In either case, the orator is at- tributing speech or emotive quality to aliqua persona not actually présent. Whether or not that persona was, or had ever been, an ac- tual person (as opposed to an abstract concept) seems of little or no import to the oration or - as I shall argue - text at hand. The technique of conformatio as described above ('animate-' or 'inanimate personification') might at first seem to be applied only rarely in the technical treaties. Certainly it is my argument that the personification of Eloquentia in Brutus represents the orator's most complex, and certainly peculiar, conformatio within the whole of the corpus. But it is far from the only one. For according to the auctor's description of conformatio - a description utterly in accord with Ci- cero's own practice - I contend that ail of the orator's dialogues might be understood to function as extended, and highly literary, conformationes: représentations of the voice and character of absent personae for a spécifie rhetorical (and in the case of the dialogues, lit- erary) purpose31. As the auctor makes dear above, conformatio was thought to be especially effective for the purposes of amplificatio (the stirring of indignation) and commiseratio (the stirring of pity), each of which may adduce the authority of the past or the fears for the future as a means of strengthening the argument at hand32. This is, of course, exactly what Cicero does in his choice and présentation of 'characters' in his many dialogues. He imputes to the august au- thorities of the past (Crassus and Antonius in de Oratore; LaeHus, Sci- pio and Cato in Cato) or the «learned men» of the présent (Atticus, Varrò, and Cicero in Academica; Atticus, Brutus and Cicero in Bru- tus) the intellectual attitudes of thè late Republic as well as, in many 31. This is an argument I develop further in a fortheoming study on late Republican textual practice. 32. Of amplificatio the auctor writes, amplificatio est res quae per locum communem instiga- tionis auditorum causa sumitur...pnmus locus sumitur ab auetontate, cum commemorarne quantae curae ea res fiierit dis immortalïbus aut maioribus nostris, regibus, civitatibus, nationi- bus, hominibus sapientissimù, senatui (Her. 2.30.47-48). Of commiseratio, he writes, misen- cordia commovebitur auditoribus si variam fortunarum commutationem dicemus; si ostendemus in quibus commodis fuenmus quibusque incommodis simus, conparatione; si quae nóbis futura sint nisi causam obtinuerimus enumerabimus et ostendimus... (Her. 2.30.50).</page><page sequence="12">126 Sarah Culpepper Stroup cases, his own biting anxieties over the perceived dégradation of so- cial and professional freedoms. And if the dialogues are themselves understood as literary exercises in thè forensic practice of conforma- no then, I contend, what we have in thè case of Eloquentia is not so much an uncanny intrusion of poetic or rhetorical figure into dry historiographical treatise as it is, in effect, the perfectly naturai - and indeed, delightfully clever - Containment of one 'type' of conforma- tio within another. She is a personification entered into a dialogue of personifications; a rhetorical fiction right at home in Cicero's fictive rhetorical world. The orator's récognition of the stylistic and rhetorical power of thè personified abstract, as well as his obvious comfort with thè idea of this 'personification play\ is made apparent in his marvelously ekphrastic personification of Pleasure and the Virtues in the second book ofde Finibus: pudebit te, inquam, illius tabulae quarti Cleanthes sane commode uerbis depingere solebat, iubebat eos qui audiebant secum ipsos cogitare pictam in tabula Voluptatem pulcherrimo uestitu et ornatu regali in solio seden- tem; praesto esse Virtutes ut ancillulas, quae nihil aliud agerent, nullum suum officium ducerent nisi ut Voluptati ministrarent, et eam tantum ad aurem admonerent (si modo id pictura intellegi posset) ut caueret ne quid faceret imprudens quod offenderet animos hominum, aut quidquam e quo oriretur aliquis dolor. «nos quidem Virtutes sic natae sumus ut tibi seruire- mus; aliud negoti nihil habemus». (de Fin. II.21.69) «You will blush», I said, «at the image Cleanthes used to draw so skillfully in his lectures. He would advise his listeners to imagine for themselves a painting of Pleasure in the most elegant raiment and sitting on a mar- velously decorated throne. Beside her should stand the Virtues as her handmaidens; they should have nothing to do, no business of their own, other than to minister to Pleasure, and merely murmur in her ear (if only a painting could be imagined to murmur) that she should avoid ili - advis- edly doing anything that might offend the sensibilities of the public, or any- thing from which any pain might arise: 'We are the Virtues, and born thus to serve you - we have no other taskY De Finibus, published the year after Brutus and coneeived as a dia- logue between L. Torquatus, C. Triarius and Cicero himself, pur- ports to provide a newly Roman examination of Greek philosophi- cal thèmes.

But it is important to note that the criticism hère is aimed at the substance of Cleanthes' teachings, and indeed Epicurean ethics as a whole, radier than his use of personification per se. It should go without saying that Cicero was no more required to engage in such an extensive description of Cleanthes' pedagogical style (as noted above, he recounts Prodicus' fable of Herakles with no référence to the original 'inanimate personification') than he was to cast the whole of this inquiry into dialogue form. And indeed, nowhere else in this dialogue are the abstracts uoluptas or uirtus imbued with such strong Persönlichkeit. His choice to do so hère, then, points to the or- ator's récognition of thè 'inanimate personification' as a semantic marker of authorial interest and appropriation. In its capacity as such, we might imagine the personification to function along the ideological Unes of the Latin diminutive, itself a polysémie appro- priative category of which Cicero is remarkably fond. For just as the semantic structure of diminutive is such that it cames both an éval- uation (be it ameliorative or pejorative) and a référence to the eval- uator (the author's suggested 'decoding' of the descriptive display of his words), the personification is able to transfer a discussion of abstract ethical concepts into the realm of authorial subjectivity and, more to the point, affective possession or rejection. Thus the représentation of Cleanthes' original 'inanimate personifications' is no vapid mimesis of Greek prototype; to the contrary, the orator's pointed réitération of Cleanthes' lecture serves precisely to under- mine the authority of the original. It is a deft it is a deft projection of the orator's own harsh critique of the philosopher's ethical precepts onto his description of the teaching of thèse precepts itself. In his unexpectedly vivid description of Voluptas and the Virtutes as figures of corrupted female luxury, Cicero stirs within his 'audience' a care- fülly constructed reaction against Cleanthes' philosophical stance. As an appropriative marker of authorial critique, then, thè 'inani- mate personification' (to which I will from this point on refer to simply as personification) carried with it a vast literary potential for a strengthening of argumentation. It is the récognition of this poten- tial, I contend, that moved Cicero - one year earlier and in a very différent sort of dialogue - to forge in his discussion of thè abstract Eloquentia a source of literary power and persuasion. The thème of éloquence runs throughout the dialogue and is referred to in terms ranging from unmarked abstraction (which instances will not, for the most part, be brought into the discussion) to strong, and as we shall see progressively evolving, personification. 33. De Orat. 1.236 sed quia saepe utitur orator subsidio iuris in causis, iddrco istam iuris scien- tiam eloquentiae, tanquam anallulam pedisequamque, adiunxisti. I am grateful to a careful anonymous reader for suggesting this very useful comparison.</page><page sequence="14">128 Sarah Culpepper Stroup The following pages focus on three major points of transition in the dialogue - from the introduction to the Greek biographies, from the Greek biographies to those of Rome and from Rome's past to Brutus' future - in which Cicero develops the «character» of Eloquen- tia (henceforth capitalized when in référence to the personified figure) by means of progressively detailed and complex personifica- tions. First, I read the dialogues* initial référence to Eloquentia «in the présent» (6.22) as an introduction to the orator's own unnatural positioning in the interstices between traditional Republican «speech» and the «silence» that has been imposed upon it under the rise of Caesarian autocracy. Next, I turn to Cicero's description of the Eloquentia «of the past» (13.51) and examine the orator's use of traditionally Atticist criticisms in his unmistakably gendered de- scription of her early years and near destruction as a resuit of way- ward Eastern travels. Finally, I analyze one of the last sections34 of Brutus - and surely the most compelling and important personifica- tion in the text - in which Eloquentia «of the future« (96.330) is re- ferred to in terms of an orphaned intellectual daughter - a figure who must be rescued from the forum and brought back within the confines of the home, that she might be circulated exclusively at the hands of her oratorical guardians. By the end of Brutus, as I hope to show, Cicero has transformed thè abstract concept of Republican Eloquentia from a poorly defined catchword for rhetorical ability into a vibrantly personified promise of social and literary résurrec- tion for the producers of written Eloquentia35 - in the form of rhetor- ical, historiographical, and philosophical treatises - themselves. 34. Ail manuscripts break off at section 97.333 (following oportunorum) and before the dialogue's formai conclusion. It is unlikely, however, that we are missing more than one or two sections of the text - the équivalent of perhaps one half of a Teubner page; so Fabius Blondus writes at the end of B, non erat amplius in exemplan, a quo abscisse sunt charte due. quamquam ut mihi uidetur nedum charte sed pauca admodum uerba defiaunt. 35. In the group of Cicero's dedicatees, we can include with certainty Atticus, Brutus, Varrò, Cornius Nepos and Quintus Cicero. It is likely, I think, that Caesar (who dedica- ted to Cicero his own de Analogia and who received, by way of Balbus and Oppius, a copy of his pro Ligano; cf. Ep. Att. 13.19) and Catullus (cf. c. 49) may hâve similarly parti- cipated in some limited literary exchange with the orator. On this suggestion, see espe- cially W. Kroll (ed. and comm.), C. Valerius Catullus, rpr. Stuttgart 1989, p. 88, who sug- gests that a copy of the orator's In Vatinam may hâve prompted the poem; both Thom- son (éd. and comm.), Catullus, Toronto 1997, p. 323 (cf. Thomson, Catullus and Cicero: Poetry and the Criticism ofPoetry, «Class. World» 60, 1967, pp. 225-230) and E. Laughton, Disertissime Romuli Nepotum, «Class. Philol.» 65 (1), 1970, pp. 1-7, suggest somewhat more convincingly that one of Cicero's own poems may hâve been offered; contra this see Ta- tum 1988, who views the poem as an «urbane taunt» (184) that need not respond to a spécifie «gift» from the orator. E.A. Fredricksmeyer, Catullus 49, Cicero, and Caesar, «Class. Philol.» 68 (4), 1973, pp. 268-278, offers an excellent survey of the more influen- tial studies on this tantalizing poem. It is likely that thè scope of the orator's literary cir- de included a much larger group of participants than those who can presently be identi- fied with some certainty. The introductory sections of Bruti« imply that Q. Hortensius</page><page sequence="15">Textual Eloquence in Cicero' s Brutus 129 3. Eloquentia Obmutuit: When Speech Stopped Speàking The first personification of Eloquentia in Brutus - indeed, the first réf- érence to Eloquentia in the text as a whole - occurs in the early sec- tions of the dialogue. Shortly after the three interlocutors hâve met, and following quickly upon a lament over Brutus* own truncated or- atorical career, Cicero introduces the thème of éloquence as he summarizes the whole of thè Republican decline in the haunting collocation of speech and silence: ...nam mihi, Brute, in te intuenti crebro in mentem uenit uereri, ecquod- nam curriculum aliquando sit habitura tua et natura admirabilis et exquisita doctrina et singularis industria, cum enim in maximis causis uer- satus esses et cum tibi aetas nostra iam cederet fascisque summitteret, subito in ciuitate cum alia ceciderunt turn etiam ea ipsa, de qua disputare ordimur, Eloquentia obmutuit. (Brut. 6.22) For when I gaze upon you, Brutus, I am often made to worry whether your wondrous naturai abüity, your flawless learning, your remarkable dévo- tion will ever have their day at the races. For whilst you were busying yourself in cases of the utmost importance, and my own advanced age was giving way and laying down the scepter, suddenly everything went to hell in our state and even Eloquentia - the very topic of our discussion - feil silent. Of course, we need not posit even a 'weak personification' of Elo- quentia in order to make this phrase compréhensible. It is a fairly un- remarkable literalized lexical effect, and if the semantic collocation créâtes a nicely unsettling frisson - «Speech stopped speaking» - it does not in and of itself qualify as a convincing conformatio. Indeed, far from 'voicing' Eloquentia in this passage, Cicero is positing a lack of voice36, a mouth opened as if to speak, but robbed suddenly of its freedom to do so. But it will be good to remember that this is a dia- logue itself precipitated by the death of the orator Hortensius, a very real Voice of the Republic'; and so if we read Eloquentia obmu- tuit to signify not an actual silencing (and indeed, it cannot) but a metaphorical death of Eloquentia' s public voice (qua the 'virtue' that is Republican speech37), it is interesting to note what the author Hortalus would also have been considered a member of this group, although the text that bore his name (Hortensius , published in 45), possibly imagined to be a fictitious dia- logue between Cicero and the deceased orator, would likely have been dedicated to Brutus or Atticus. 36. Ovid créâtes a similar - if inverted - effect in his silent personifìcations of Tacita and Muta at Fast. 2.571 and 583. 37. Eloquentia identified as a uirtus in thè first book of de Oratore: [Mnesarchus dicebat]</page><page sequence="16">130 Sarah Culpepper Stroup does next. For far from abandoning Eloquentia to her silence, Cicero develops the thème of wordlessness through the language and im- agery of the formal fonerai: hic ego: laudare igitur eloquentiam et quanta uis sit eius expromere quan- tamque eis, qui sint eam consecuti, dignitatem afferat, neque propositum nobis est hoc loco neque necessarium. (Brut. 6.25) And I said, «But to praise Eloquentia, to display the magnitude of her strength, to teli of the great dignity she bestows upon those who follow her - neither is this my intention nor is this the place for it». And indeed after these words the orator leaves off from discussing Eloquentia herself for several chapters. What follows instead, as we know, is an exhaustive présentation of Greek, and especially Ro- man, oratorical nobility: a Virtual fonerai parade, we might say, of Eloquentia7 s family tree3 . Surely modern critics have been right to note that the fonereal tones of the early chapters of Brutus (beginning, of course, with the introductory description of the death of Hortensius) are so perva- sive as to suggest that the entire dialogue might be read as a kind of literary rehearsal of the hudatiofiinebris39. But what are the implica- tions of this stylized pompai What might the orator have in mind in his entextualization of oratorical death? Is this, indeed, his intention at ali? Although we have no detailed descriptions of the fonerai pro- cedure written by a Roman author, Polybius' (6.53-53) account of the fonerai practices of the Republican elite are exceedingly helpfol in developing an outUne of the ritual as a whole. We can say with some certainty that both the présentation of the ancestral imagines, and the oration that accompanied this présentation and outlined the past accomplishments of the family line, were expected and impor- [...] oratorem autem nisi qui sapiens esset, esse neminem; atque ipsam Eloquentiam, quod ex bene àicendi scientia constaret, unam quamdam esse uirtutem, et qui unam uirtutem haberet, omnes habere...

Kierdorf, Laudatio Funebris: Interpretationen und Un- tersuchungen zur Entwicklung der römischen Leichenrede, Hain 1980.</page><page sequence="17">Textual Eloquence in Cicero' s Brutus 131 tant features of the ritual. As Flower has argued, thèse performative éléments of the fanerai, as well as the written laudatio that would hâve been circulated following the event40, offered the descendents a way to connect the deceased's accomplishments with the family's past, the survivors' présent, and the descendents' future. If Eloquentia's sudden silence is thus understood as a 'death of Re- publican speech'41, we can read Cicero's biographies as a kind of lit- erary présentation of Rome's oratorical imagines (itself constituting a kind of conformano of the deceased's ancestors42) in conscious mimicry of the public fanerai. In his stylization of Rome's oratorical masters as the «ancestors» of Republican Eloquentia, Cicero boldly transforms the abstracted silence of the Republican voice into a per- sonal family tragedy. \f Eloquentia' s life in the Forum has corne to an end, then, Brutus is both a laudatio for its passing and an important literary record of the 'family' memory. But I think that this cannot be thè end of thè story. In his récent article on memory and silence in Brutus, Gowing makes the attractive suggestion that Cicero's ide- alized concealment oiEloquentia (96.330, on which see section IV be- low) contains a référence to the domestic Containment of the imag- ines. But just as the lauàatio praises the ancestors of the deceased and the accomplishments of the family's past, I contend, it must neces- sarily (and at the same time) stake a daim for the family's future. Thus I suggest instead that the fdeath' of Eloquentia in thèse early sections is intended only as a public one (with apologies to William Goldman, she is only «mostly dead»43) and cames with it tantalizing hints that there may yet be a way to resuscitate the oratorical pedi- gree. Eloquentia has fallen silent in public - but might there arise an alternate venue for her voice? 4. Peregrinata Tota Asia Est: Corruption in Greece, Rédemption in Rome The second major personification follows shertly upon the first and, as if gaining life force from the descriptions of Eloquentia's Greek an- 40. Cf. Flower, op. cit., p. 129 on the publication of the laudatio. 41. Although Fantham 1997, op. cit., does not discuss Eloquentia per se (much less in terms of a personification), her Statement that Brutus was «written in part as a eulogy of the lost art of free speech» (p. 56) is dosely in line with my présent argument. 42. Flower, op. cit., pp. 128-129 notes connection between the forensic and funereal conformatio. 43. The référence hère is to the character Miracle Max, in Goldman's novel The Pnncess Bride, Harcourt Brace &amp; Company, 1973. Upon inspection of the apparently deceased Wesley, Max informs Inigo that there is a substantial différence between «dead, mostly dead, and ail dead».</page><page sequence="18">132 Sarah Culpepper Stroup cestors, is ail the more vivid. It is yet early in Cicero's oratorical bi- ographies. He has twice reviewed the development of refined speech in Greece (7.26-13.50), and the transition from East to West is marked by an abrupt shift in tone and a remarkable account of the Eastern adventures of a young Eloquentia: nam ut semel e Piraeo eloquentia euecta est, omnis peragrauit insulas atque ita peregrinata tota Asia est, ut se externis oblineret moribus om- nemque illam salubritatem Atticae dictionis et quasi sanitatem perderet ac loqui paene dedisceret. (Brut. 13.51) For as soon as Eloquentia set out from Piraeus, she wandered about ail the islands and so traveled thè whole of Asia that she ended up smearing her- self with foreign practices and destroyed the vigor - and health, if you will - of her Attic diction and almost forgot how to speak. The description is a striking one. For in thèse Unes we hâve neither a dry summary of the évolution of Greek rhetorical theory, nor a sim- ple grammatical invocation of Eloquentia qua public speech, but rather a vivid travelogue of a young girl· s departure from Athens and near destruction of herself - and her réputation - through the unchecked abuse of Eastern luxuries. The image of Eloquentia «set- ting out» on her oratorical journey is not the first in Cicero; indeed a similar abstraction occurs in the early sections of the orator's youth- ful de Inventione44. But whereas there the language was relatively un- colored and only incidentally 'gendered/ hère we hâve instead the detailed innuendo of a distinctly female danger. In Greece, Eloquen- tia was allowed to travel abroad without a maie guardian; as a resuit she feil victim - at the hands of Demosthenes and Demetrius of Phalerum - to the naïve over - application of the unnecessary 'cos- metics' of foreign rhetorical practice (se externis oblineret moribus)45. The orator's suggestion that Eloquentia «almost forgot how to speak» as a resuit of her childish abuse of eastern luxury anticipâtes his transition to the more salubrious nature of mature Roman ora- tory: the ills Eloquentia encountered in Greece, it is implied, will be cured upon her arrivai and cultivation in Rome. Taken as a whole, 44· Ac primo quiâem sic et nata et progressa longius Eloquentia uidetur et item postea maximis in rebus pacis et belli cum summis hominum utilitatibus esse uersata (Inv. 1.3). 45. The verb oblinere, hère understood as «daub» or «smear» is used frequently in the case cosmetics (though also paint and mud) and as such often cames with it an extend- ed implication or moral or ethical corruption or dégradation. Cf. Cic. Verr. 3.31; Mart. 6.93-9Î Ov. Ep. 11.2 (of a libellus); Tac. Ann. 2.17; Sen. Ep. 123.7; Hor. Ep. 2.1.204, 1. 19.30; Suet. Gram. 10 (of «sullied» literature). A reader remarks that a similar sentiment regarding thè 'naturai grooming' of oratio is to be found at Orator 78. On the possible Greek sources for such imagery (in de Orat.), see E. Fantham, Comparative Studies in Re- publkan Latin Imagery, Toronto 1972, esp. ch. 6.</page><page sequence="19">Textual Eloquence in Cicero7 s Brutus 133 this description provides both a vivid turning point for the progres- sion of the dialogue, and a subtle parallelism of Eloquentia's «life» with the orator' s own présent literary endeavor. Eloquentia has left Athens; she (and Cicero) can only arrive in Rome. But if we also understand personification of this sort to fonction as a strongly appropriative maneuver, as I argue we should, then Ci- cero's description of Eloquentia in thèse Unes can be understood to fonction at two forther levels. First, and as we saw was the case in his rehearsal of Cleanthes' Voluptas, the personification of Eloquentia at this point of transition enables the orator to insert into an other- wise straightforward account an acute (if modestly doaked) autho- rial critique: hère, that Asianist rhetoric is a distinctly, even neces- sarily, 'immature* prédilection. It is a forgivable impulse in the young (and so we think of Cicero's own youth), but must be guarded against in the speech of the mature. Second, by referring to Eloquentia in personified and distinctly gendered terms - this must be the point of thè highly allusive se [...] oblineret - the orator is able to 'claim her as his own'; to underline both his personal interest in her subséquent reception at Rome, and (in anticipation of the end of the dialogue) her continuing, and increasingly textual, interaction with the orators with whom she cornes into contact. The critique of literary production and reception via the représen- tation of a sexually suspect personification is far from unique to Ci- cero or the Republic. In his second Isihmiant Pindar personifies the poems of Terpsichore with his cynical claim that they are sold with «silver - glinting faces» now the Muse has learned to sing in ex- change for payment46. In his treatise On the Ancient Orators, Dionys- ios of Halicarnassos - usefol for comparison with Cicero if certainly not an influence upon him - personifies Asian rhetoric as a «vapid whore» (εταίρα τις αφρών) who has expelled the Attic Muse from her rightfal domain and is bent on destroying her own liveli- hood47. 46.

Certainly, the gen- dered personification of texts or textual concepts had become in- creasingly common in thè literary and visual production of the late Hellenistic period, during which time the physical text and literary paraphernalia moved to thè forefront of thè lexicon of social and politicai status49. For the late Republican audience, I contend, such personification on Cicero's part would have been considered, if not a commonplace, at least a recognizable stylistic topos and one that is indeed later developed in thè Hterature of thè Augustan and Impe- riai periods50. In his image of a wandering Eloquentia who is subject to the damaging moral influences of foreign practice, Cicero both thing so much as the houses of the profligate and wicked. For just as in such houses there résides a wife, freeborn and prudent but with no authority over her own affairs, while an vapid whore, set on the destruction of her livelihood, thinks herseif fit to con- trol the entire estate, terrifying the [wife] and treating her like filth; thus in every polis and in thè exceedingly civilized ones no less than elsewhere (and this was the straw that broke the camel's back), the ancient and autochthonous Attic Muse lost both her rank and her possessions, while the upstart, arrived only yesterday or the day before from the god-forsaken depths of Asia - a Mysian or Phrygian or Carian beast - thought her- seif fit to rule over Greek poleis, ousting her Opponent from public affairs». 48. Cicero makes explicit the importance of the written record in thè case of, e.g., Pen- des and Thucydides (both at 7.27), Themistocles (7.28), Alcibiades, Critias and Thera- menes (7.29), Lysias and Demosthenes (both 9.35); at both 10.41 and 13.50 Homer is ad- duced as «évidence» of honos Eloquentiae in the early period. The Roman biographies are introduced with a direct référence to the importance of the written record (13.52-14.53.) and indeed textual évidence is emphasized in many of the biographies. 49. As noted above, Callimachus' Plokamos Berenikes (Pf. fr. 110) is surely nothing if not a detailed, and humorously extended, conformatio; the poem itself seems to have been subsequently personified at Epigram 51 (52 Sehn.), in which the author refers to a Bere- nika, «lately fashioned and yet moist with perfume» who has been added as a «fourth Grâce». On visual personification of the text, cf. the relief of the Apotheosis of Homer by Archelaos of Priene (e. 125 BCE, now in thè British Museum; BM 2191) which shows the poet seated and flanked on either side by young female figures of the Iliad and Odyssey. 50.

Ut Adultam Virginem: The Textual Embodiment of Eloquence The thème of Eloquentia's reception and development at Rome runs intermittently throughout the remaining biographical portions of the dialogue. We learn that although she had been raised in Athens51, it is the Forum for which Eloquentia had been born: itaque [Calui] oratio nimia religione attenuata doctis et attente audientibus erat inlustris, &lt;a&gt; multitudine autem et a foro, cui nata Eloquentia est, deuorabatur. (Brut. 82.283) Thus [Calvus'] language was attenuated due to his excessive scrupulous- ness; experts and those who listened carefuUy noted its quality, whereas the crowd and the forum- -for which Eloquentia was born - simply ate it up. As Cicero would hâve it, then, Eloquentia's arrivai in Rome consti- tutes thè ultimate fiilfillment of her birthright. The rising threat of a Caesarian autocracy, and the concomitant weakening of oratorical freedom, hâve meant - for Cicero - that thè city that was to be the house of Eloquentia's maturity has instead become the tomb of her silence. But if the erstwhile Muse of the Forum has turned into thè ulti- mate victim of Republican decline, Cicero's final personification of Eloquentia is ail the more exceptional for its literary force and social implications. For after Cicero has treated his guests to the whole of oratory's family tree, and as he moves toward the concluding sec- tions of the dialogue, he abruptly réhabilitâtes Eloquentia from a sex- ually suspect wandering Muse into an orphaned (and strangely re - virginal) daughter - figure who must be returned to the home and protected from the ham - handed advances of naïve lovers: nos autem, Brute, quoniam post Hortensi clarissimi oratoris mortem or- bae Eloquentiae quasi tutores relieti sumus, domi teneamus eam saeptam liberali custodia, et hos ignotos atque impudentes procos repudiemus tuea- male through their grammatical gender, their authors, and their voices [...] desire for them can orJy be mediated through the female» (p. 50). 51. Of Eloquentia's birth and youth in Athens, Cicero writes, uidesne igitur uel in ea ipsa urbe, in qua et nata et alta sit Eloquentia, quant ea sero prodierit in lucenti (10.39)</page><page sequence="22">136 Sarah Culpepper Stroup murque ut adultam uirginem caste et ab amatorum impetus quantum pos- sumus prohibeamus. (Brut. 96.330) But Brutus, since the death of Hortensius - that best of orators - bas left us as the guardiane (if you will) of an orphaned Eloquentia, let us keep her within the home, shielded by our noble protection: let us send away these shameless and good - for - nothing suitors, let us keep our füll - grown vir- gin chaste, and let us repel from her - as much as we can - the advances of her lovers. The personification hère is a powerful one, more detailed, explicit, and socially charged than any other in thè Ciceronian corpus52. And yet even when this scene has been noted in criticai inquiries into Brutus - and in the vast majority of cases, it is not - it has received only glancing interest; dismissed, in Douglas* words, as merely an «elaborate simile»53. But in light of my argument for an extended and evolving personification of Eloquentia throughout this text, and especially at points of marked transition or emphasis, the text de- mands that we give this passage a second look. Certainly the image of a young woman who can retain her chastity only under the pro- tection of an older man brings with it at least implicitly erotic under- tones54. But unlike Herakles' highly eroticized 'dioice' between Eu- daimonia/Kakia and Arete, Cicero and his interlocutors - indeed, the whole reading audience of Brutus - are imagined in terms that are paternalistic rather than romantic. The literary allies of Brutus are forged hère as the mature and domestic protectors (tutores) of their young Muse, rather than her eager, if ham - handed, lovers55. But 52. Pace Douglas, op. cit., p. 232 ad 96.330, who considère this image to be effectively the «same» as those at Ep. Fam. 3.11.3 and Or. 64, the latter of which refers to the mollis oratio philosophorum as a casta, uerecunda, uirgo incorrupta quodam modo (itaque sermo po- tius quam oratio dicitur). There are of course similarities: thè former passage personifies the duitas as an orphaned child, and the latter philosophical speech as an untouched uirgo. However, in neither case does Cicero advise or imagine personal - much less gendered - interaction with these personifications as an allegory for extra-textual poli- ticai or literary activity nor does he pursue these personifications with any formai pur- pose through the remainder of these works. 53. Douglas, op. cit., p. 232 ad 96.330. 54. As J.P. Hallett, Fathers and Daughters in Roman Society: Women and the Elite Family, Princeton 1984, p. 138, has noted, there is often sexual tension in the triad of a young woman, her father, and her suitor. A reader has made the interesting suggestion that in the somewhat eroticizing description of Eloquentia as a young ward to be protected by her tutores, we may have a référence to the orator's (unfortunate) marriage to his ward Publilia toward the end of 46. 55. I am grateful to an anonymous reader for the suggestion that in this image of pro- tection from intnisive suitors, we might have an invocation of the young Eloquentia as a sort of Penelope-figure who is to await the return of her «lawful spouse» - Cicero him- self, perhaps, or the orators of Brutus' génération who are to take up the challenge of preserving Republican éloquence.</page><page sequence="23">Textual Eloquence in Cicero' s Brutus 137 what exactly does Cicero intend in this highly gendered image of a newly domesticated Eloquentiaï What can it mean to keep this entic- ing figure locked within the home, shielded by the noble tutelage of her oratorical protectors? What, finally, are we to make of this startling suggestion that the place for public speech must now be- come thè private home? To get at thèse answers, we must recon- sider the social and literary program of Brutus within the context of Cicero's personal and politicai fortunes in 46. As noted at thè start of this study, Brutus (one of the first of what would become a sizable corpus of technical dialogues) has been widely recognized as an early attempi of the orator to reinsert his voice into the intellectual consciousness of the Republic. If Eloquentia has fallen silent at the beginning of the dialogue, it is Cicero who now claims to speak on her behalf. In his personification of Eloquentia, then, the orator has provided her with a voice and a venue: he has done for her precisely what she has done for orators in the past. This final personification, I contend, encodes a careful - if bril- liantly simple - blueprint for the orator's literary and politicai strat- egy. For in Cicero's image of a young girl rescued from the Forum and brought within the home we hâve a striking allegory for his own planned shift of activity and influence from the long - estab- lished corona of the Forum to the relatively untested theatrum of elite textual circulation56 - that very audience, in other words, for which Brutus is intended. Cicero would not hâve turned his back on public oratory with any relish, nor indeed do I think that he would hâve imagined, even in 46, that his absence from the Republican Fo- rum would be irreversible57. But just as the orator likened his own silence to that of Hortensius (Hortensi uox exstincta fato su' estf nostra publica 96.328), he would similarly hâve understood his own fate as inexorably intertwined with that of his Muse. If Eloquentia was «born for the Forum», the orator considered himself as no less enti- tled to this birthright; and so in his imagined rehabilitation of her powers of speech, he must surely hâve in mind his own concomi- tant rédemption. But should the literary implications of a «domesticated Eloquentia» 56. On the crowd of the Forum as a corona, see, e.g., Brut. 51.192; in a letter to Atticus dated to 45, Cicero writes of thè 'audience' of one of Atticus' private readings orator's pro Ligario: theatrum quidem sane bellum habuisti (Ep. Au. 13.20). B.A. Krostenko, Cicero, Catullus, and the Language of Social Performance, Chicago 2001, p. 56 notes of the literary implications of this phrase, «The 'fit readers but few' before whom Atticus gave a rea- ding of Cicero's pro Ligano were a bellum theatrum. They were 'a nice bunch' or 'a good group', as literary men like Cicero and Atticus would agrée». 57- Although Cicero returns to thè Forum in 44, the circumstances of the Caesarianae (46-45) were hardly those of the Republican forum; the Antonianae (or «Phillippics») si- milarly reflect an anxious awareness that the orator has found himself playing a dange- rous politicai game - the rules of which hâve suddenly, and ominously, changea.</page><page sequence="24">138 Sarah Culpepper Stroup remain undear, Brutus itself embodies the answer. Cicero fre- quently refers to rhetorical writing - the newly penned dialogue no less than the reworked oratio - as a distinctly domesticust as opposed to forensis, \abor (so see Brut. 24.92). In his final image of Eloquentia made 'domestic', the orator is suggestively interweaving the sphères of cultural and literary practice and relying upon his reading audience to recognize the implications. In Cicero's Rome (as in vir- tually all geographical and temporal intersections in the span of das- sical antiquity), a young woman's worth - her economie potential - resided preeminently in her use, by her father, as an objeet of mar- riage exchange. An unmarried daughter is kept within the home and away from unacceptable suitors, then, not that she might be eter- nally 'hoarded' by her pater familias (indeed, such hoarding would constitute a destruction of value) but precisely so that she can even- tually be 'married off in a match that will itself cernent the bonds between themselves and their houses. As Cicero has suggested throughout Brutus, Eloquentia is most evident only when she has been «embodied» in the literary évidence. Now that she has been domesticated, I argue, she has been made definitively, even primar- ily, textual: she will 'réside in the home' ofthose who write; she will be traded 'in marriage' by means of precisely those texts that are written for, and circulated throughout, thè elite literary Community - the bellum theatrum - of thè late Republic. She will, finally, provide the means of attaining a lasting literary voiee to those who have found themselves prematurely süenced by the Republic: equidem etsi doleo me in uitam paulo serius tamquam in uiam ingressum, priusquam confectum iter sit, in hanc rei publicae noctem ineidisse, tarnen ea consolatione sustentor quam tu mihi, Brute, adhibuisti tuis suauissimis litteris, quibus me forti animo esse oportere censebas, quod ea gessissem, quae de me etiam me tacente ipsa loquerentur uiuerentque mortuo... (Brut. 96.330) And although I have cause to grieve, since I set out on the path of my life so late that night has fallen upon this Republic before my journey has come to a dose, I am nevertheless sustained by the consolation y ou offered me in that most pleasing treatise,58 Brutus, in which you advised me to be stout of heart, since I have accomplished such things as will both speak of me when I am silent, and will live on, after I have died... In the beginning of Brutus, Cicero portrayed an Eloquentia who had begun to threaten both her parent' s réputation and society's ac- cepted norms of behavior. In the final sections of the dialogue, the 58.

Thus, by styling Eloquentia a uirgo and the members of his intended literary cirde noble patres familias, Cicero has forged a scheme of isonomic exchange in which textual embodiments of élo- quence are to be traded back and forth in the manner of young women betrothed (despondere?9) in the self - interested agreements of their fathers. And if texts are exchanged in terms of elite marriage agreements, the progeny of thèse exchanges - the infinitely self - replicating «intellectual offspring»60 of the union - will be subse- quently promised, and exchanged, literary works. The orator has created, in other words, a remarkably domestic solution for an in- herently politicai problem. 6. Conclusions Brutus continues to be a text valuable to scholars for the wealth of information it provides on the oratorical, literary and - to a certain extent - politicai history of Republican Rome. But as I hâve argued in this study, its aims can be read as no more strongly historical than they are painstakingly literary. Brutus is, in thè end, a brilliant apolo- già for its own writing. But so too is it an apologià for the orator' s fu- 59. Cicero uses despondere to describe the process of textual exchange on at least two occasions. At Ep. Att. 13.12, he discusses the «promising« of de Finibus in precisely such terms, in his search for a suitable text to dedicate to Varrò: nunc ittam περί τελών σύντα- ξιν sane mihi probatam Bruto, ut tibi placuit, despondimus, idque tu eum non nolle mihi scripsisti. At Ep. Att. 1.10.4, he writes, bibliothecam tuam caue cuiquam despondeas, quamuis acrem amatorem inueneris. Although the verb despondere can mean «pledge» or «dedicate», it also commonly means betroth, a meaning Cicero intends, induding here, at least six of the twelve times he uses the verb: cf. pro Chi. 179; de Or. 1.61.239; Ep. Fam. 8.7.2; Ep. Att. 1.3.3; Ep. Frat. 2.6.1. 60. The notion of literary texts as the intellectual offspring of their «authorial parents« is hardly unique to Cicero, nowhere else is it treated with anything approaching the same détail or literary intent. The thème does not appear in extant Republican litera- ture prior to Brutus; this may well be a matter of lacunose sources, but I would not be surprised if he found the inspiration for Eloquentia as his 'intellectual child' in the Greek authors with which he was certainly familiär. The text-as-offspring appears several ti- mes, if only by way of very weak personification, in Piato (cf. Phdr. 257b, 274e, 275a, 276e-277a, 278ab; Rep. 330c, 534d, 599b-6oob; Symp. 177a, 209a-e; Tht. 164e) and twice in Aristophanes (Neph. 137; Batrakh. 1059); on intellectual offspring in Phaedrus, see further J. Derrida, Dissémination, Chicago 1981, pp. 76-84; on writing as a form of reproduction, see D. Steiner, The Tyrant's Wnt: Myths and Images ofWrìting in Andent Greece, Princeton 1994, pp. 110-116 (I am indebted to Ruby Blondell for ail of thèse références).

As such, it provides us with an almost disturbingly lucid snap- shot of the conflicts that arise between politicai System and rhetori- cal practice and one man's distinctly textual response to his own im- minent fate. Brutus begins with the image of an oratorical world that is out of the orator's control. But by the end of the dialogue, Cicero has translated a dangerously destabilized Republican oratory into the terms of private, authoritative, and definitively controïlable social exchange. And with this translation cornes the suggestion that his forced withdrawal from the Forum might be ameliorated in terms of a strategie 'literarization' of his craft. By refiguring the voice of the Republic in thè body of the orphaned daughter, then, he has cre- ated a novel way of containing his language, status, and character within a medium that can transcend thè bounds of space and time. For just as the orator has transformed Eloquence into his textual child, so too he has transformed himself into a new and powerful type of literary patriarch - and the whole of the Republic, at least for a time, into a librorum munieipium.
