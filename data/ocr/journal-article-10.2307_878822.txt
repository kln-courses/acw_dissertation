<plain_text><page sequence="1">New York An exhibition of some I7o nineteenth- century French drawings, shown under the title 'The Non-Dissenters', marked the tenth anniversary of the Shepherd Gallery, New York, last winter. We might take such an event as simply one among many signs of conservatism in the world of art during the present recession, if what we actually saw didn't have to do so much more with continuity than with retrench- ment. Thus the overall conviction shown plentifully in this remarkably varied array of approaches to drawing, may actually correspond, to some extent, with a phenomenon evident in even the most advanced recent art, namely, that the act of drawing retains a vital perti- nence. The most eccentric or revisionist qualifications of drawing only confirm further what we already find within the pluralism of the nineteenth century: that drawing makes sense for practically all types of serious artistic enquiry. Admittedly, the 'non-dissenter' concept has a certain anti-modernist edge. Martin Reymert, of the Shepherd Gallery, coined it in I96i1 - as the fully illustrated and very thorough catalogue informs us - 'to find a name under which could be grouped all French artists who were then more or less forgotten and/or held in bad repute by prevailing theories of "mod- ernism".' But if the story of modernism can easily be told without mentioning Bonheur or Bouguereau, Couture or G6r6me, not to mention D6taille, Flan- drin, Michel or Vernet, it nevertheless cannot be told without reference to Ingres and G6ricault and Delacroix and Millet and Degas and, even, Puvis de Chavannes. All these artists, and many more, were represented. Yet the whole enterprise would have been far less worthwhile if it had amounted to a mere vindication of academicism. On the contrary, what was interesting was to discover 'modern' or enduring value in what may have been circumstantially academic. Thus, for instance, Jean-Jacques Henner's powerful little black chalk Prostrate Male Nude; Study for 'Bara' (c. x1882) (Fig.x 2) takes up a pose closely associated with poeticized heroic death in earlier Romantic Classi- cism, but with as much originality as (modern) traditionalism. Henner dis- covers an occasion to deal with a radically gravitational, prone posture with shallow, oblique axes, and he gets energetically involved with the heavy, expressive blacking-in of the surrounding 'non- mnotif' in a way that not only mutes descriptive space but, more urgently, becomes the anxiously expressive embodi- ment of a meditation on death. To con- sider a few more of the drawings indi- vidually may suggest the same dialectic of tradition and modernity in various other ways. G6ricault was represented by a spirited ink-and-wash Man Clutching his Horse in Water (Fig. 113), of about 1815-i6. The almost passionate closeness between this bearded, turbaned North African (?) and the horse dragging him through the water, must be one of the most intense of G6ri- cault's many treatments of equine vital- ism. Even the oxidation of the ink in Gericault's impulsive lines flatters the impetuosity of the theme. Both man and horse, although preoccupied in a forceful charge against the strong current of some stream or river, fit together into a com- pactly triangular, even pedimental, ar- rangement. Indeed, the raking horse's head, even if it were not in such intimate connection with the rippling water, would be enough to remind us of the East pediment marbles of the Parthenon. Yet what we see is hardly in a class with plaster-cast school drawings after classical sculpture; it is, instead, a completely vivid sample of Romantic emotion. Ingres's pencil Portrait of Jean-Pierre Granger (I818) was a disappointment, but an interesting one. Granger, it seems, had that kind of thoroughgoing bad looks that it might take the full ingenuity of some Roman Imperial sculptor to sublimate. M. Granger was half nose. That organ does boast a distinguished enough angle in the middle - a fact of which Granger seems to have been all too aware - but there is enough extent above and below the angle for two noses. That Granger's 307</page><page sequence="2">OEM, 112. Prostrate male Nude, study for 'Bara', by Jean-Jacques Henner. Sigred. c. 1882. Black chalk, 19-3 by 32-5 cm. (Exh.

Still, how interesting all this be- comes for the question of the beauty of nature and the beauty of art, for if Granger's presumptuous bourgeois self- confidence has its own, built-in carica- tural element, the generous descriptive sympathy of Ingres does not. A later Ingres drawing, a pencil Study of Arms for 'Stratonice' (1840) is a working sketch rather than a presentation piece of any kind, but on those very grounds it appeals - as visual thought. Several parallel variants of the same extended arm here overlap in a kind of interlocked or dove- tailed way that has as much interest as the well-turned edges of the arms, hands and fingers on their own. Millet was represented by two very different, yet complementary, drawings. The Republic: Allegory (c.1848) is a rhetori- cal, but stirringly rhetorical, pastel, in perhaps something like the way the more bombastic element in nineteenth-century opera is so closely intertwined with themes of political liberalism. As with such music, the astonishment, when it comes, derives not from monstrification, but from its very opposite: the awakening into life and ordinariness of ideals that might have seemed unapproachably superhuman or impractically abstract. The irony, and the human value, of this sort of 'Realism' is that what today would have amounted to pointless or cynical 'demythologization' is ennobling in a new way. By comparison Millet's Goose Girl (c.I1850), in black chalk with pencil, is less grand but almost as nobly ordinary. The figure sits as plainly in the landscape as J. E. Millais's Blind Girl. Her pose, while traceable back to Ditrer's Melancholia I, has, however, the character of being discovered in the real world rather than having been forced mythologically onto it, just as the plain- ness of the goose theme may suggest in a more general way that what could have been dressed up according to some Leda- like formula is satisfying enough in ordinary human terms. (A recent attempt to discredit 'spiritual' values in Millet has not convinced this writer.) 'The Non-Dissenters' helped to point up similarities just where differences might seem to prevail. Thus Gavarni's Le Rubis, a tour de force of distilled vulgarity, and his only a little less than half as slick Pulcinello and Columbina, would by themselves have belied Gavarni's significance in light of Millet. Yet Gavarni's wonderful Three- Quarters View of a Standing Man in Overalls (Fig. I 6), where ink wash sensitively solidifies the delicacy of water-colour, narrowed the gap between him and Millet considerably. Similarly, if Theodore Rousseau's Landscape with a Stream, in chalk, was nice but not news, Troyon's astonishingly sensitive Haystacks by a Road- side (Fig. I 4), also in chalk, was one of the most gratifying examples of supposedly 'conservative' art. Of three drawings by Delacroix, I found the single landscape, Boats (1854), which may be a view out a window at Dieppe, a little bald and slack, although for any other artist this would be a perfectly presentable water-colour. Of the two sheets of figural studies the pencil Sheet of Studies; Male Torsos, Arm, Two Head and Torso Studies (1855) has a kind of solid power; that it suggests wrestling also relates it, perhaps unexpectedly, to Courbet and Eakins, especially in terms of a rationalized, or normalized, involve- ment with straining, Michelangesque musculature. But Delacroix was probably not as much at home with a pencil in his hand as with any sort of brush, and the other sketch, Male Torso Studies (Fig. I 15), entirely in wash, shows the difference between the excellent and the marvellous. These torsos are also chunky and Michel- angesque, but they even evoke Cezanne in their faceted, vibrating patches of strokes that dissolve solid, sculpturesque form in the model and reconstitute it on the page. As in Delacroix's water-colours, a wash test right on the sheet itself lends an athletic urgency to the drawing, as though there were hardly time to get the impulse down - in the midst of simul- taneous analysis and reconstitution - let alone fuss about mixing some tint. This excitement charges these otherwise highly posed figure fragments in a way that is thus the converse of Gericault's man and horse that happen to form a pedimental composition. Degas's Portrait Study of Giovanna (?) Bellelli, of about I862-64, must be the most splendid drawing I can remember seeing. At least I thought so until I saw the recent Morgan Library exhibition of Fitzwilliam Museum drawings here in New York, and, even then, it still held up with most of the Fitzwilliam's best. Con- sider the affinity between the contours of the woman's ear as an open and irregular system of curved forms, and the twin tiny solid spheres of an earring dangling from it. The touch throughout is at once soft and firm, most obviously in the figure's pulled-back but supple hair-do but also wherever Degas evokes modelling by working against the outside of a form instead of, so to speak, marching in place with shading. The unity of this very homogeneous design depends on very un- worked passages being in such close touch with unworked passages. And the sketch, executed with a very obvious visual intelligence - as in the curved, bracket- like vertical edge of forehead and hair, taken together, in analogy with the hori- zontal 'bracket' shape of eyebrows and nose - is a little sonata of curves. It is noteworthy that such a fine drawing belongs to the supposedly 'conservative' part of Degas's production. Perhaps that is why its perfection and control (which can be compared with classicistic draw- ings by Picasso that raise a similar issue) seem to bring the intellectually lucid aspect of academic tradition into agree- ment with later, more abstract develop- ments. Happily, the drawing has passed into a public-access collection, that of the University of Notre Dame (South Bend, Indiana). 'The Non-Dissenters' had an- other Degas drawing, a fine Left Profile of a Standing Horse in black chalk, but, by comparison with the Bellelli portrait, this more 'sophisticated' work was too easy to like without having to learn something. Other works also have surprising modernist consequences. Take Thdodule- Augustin Ribot's brooding ink and wash Chair, which one could easily muster into historical service on behalf of Van Gogh's symbolic 'portraits' of his own chair and of Cezanne's. It happens in this case that Van Gogh did know of Ribot, and it is conceivable that this very work, or one like it, could have made its influence felt. But Ribot's drawing is in its own right far from being a purely documentary item. Already, on its own terms, it is a moody, introspective and affective study of a chair as an inanimate, even geometric, object with essentially anthropomorphic, if not phenomenal, properties. Even the curl of the small sheet of paper, earnestly soaked with washes, has a certain unexpectedly articulate relation to the rustic simplicity of this humble rush-seated chair, and of Ribot to it. This may not evidence 'dissent', but it hardly amounts to com- pliance. JOSEPH MASHECK</page><page sequence="4">//g ...... ..... 116. Three-quarters view of a standing man in overalls, by Gavarni.
