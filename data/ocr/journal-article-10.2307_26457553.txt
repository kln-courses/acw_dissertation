The Mochica modeled and painted a candid record of their culture in their ceremonial pottery. This art, which has given us some of the finest sculpture of the pre-Columbian Americas, vividly portrays an early preliterate society. In it we may glimpse many of the outward facets of daily life and perceive much of the thoughts and emotions common to these ancient people. The coast of Peru is a vast desert, broken occasionally by rivers flowing from the Andes to the sea which transform narrow stretches of this plain into fertile, habitable land. The Mochica were not the first to draw their livelihood from this harsh environment. Untold centuries before, primitive bands hunted and fished along the shores of the Pacific. Archaeology has traced their subsequent slow but remarkable evolution toward civilization, first as simple farmers, then as sophisticated townsfolk and expert craftsmen. The Mochica built and advanced their culture upon this heritage. By the beginning of our era, small, north coastal settlements had expanded into city-states, and Mochica warrior-priests governed a well-ordered society. Not only in the north but throughout Peru this epoch is aptly termed the Florescent or Classic Age, for the highest level of artistic quality and technical skill was reached. This great tradition was never surpassed in pre-Columbian times, for society turned aggressively instead to seek power and wealth. About a.D. 800, the Mochica State fell before the onslaught of imperial armies from the Andean highlands, whose conquest set the pattern in later centuries for the brilliant, militant, and final reign of the Inca princes. Tragically, the splendor of the Inca civilization was dimmed almost at once after the arrival of the Europeans. Even before, traces of the many pre-Incan peoples had disappeared, obliterated by war and conquest, the passage of time, and the covering desert. Only in recent decades have archaeological discoveries led to the reconstruction of the panorama of Central Andean prehistory, making it possible to identify and define the nature of the various societies within it. In this manner the Mochica have been most vividly brought to life. Their art, unearthed in cemeteries and temple ruins, reveals their culture in almost every detail. Its forms and iconography mirror the philosophical concepts and myths which structured this society from within and the social patterns and political powers which gave direction and cohesiveness from without. 7</page><page sequence="3">The Mochica, who cultivated the Santa, Moche, and Chicama valleys, domi nated the north coast politically and culturally during the Florescent Age. The physical and intellectual growth, in fact, the very existence of the Mochica State depended upon extending and maintaining the fertility of the land. To construct and sustain the immense complex of irrigation and agricultural works, the cooperation of every individual was required. Strict secular and religious controls were devised to secure the organization and unity necessary for the continuance of these life-giving projects. Ruins of imposing ceremonial and administrative architecture mark this north coastal landscape and are eloquent testimony of the domination the ancient government exerted on its citizens. Imposition of political control as well as great population expansion were the primary motivations for incessant wars of conquest, and nobles and commoners alike, with great fanfare, went to battle. Thus, each member of Mochica society — although rigidly stratified along class and occupational lines — was directly important in the function of state affairs. The reflections of this way of life are contained in Mochica art. Immediately, we perceive that its aesthetic is always consistent. Many thousands of ceramics, mainly funerary offerings, have been excavated, but among them there are none in different or cruder styles or which show popular or unsophisticated motifs to indicate that the art of the lower classes remained apart from that of the aristocracy. Although the best of their art objects were produced for the ruling warrior-priests, many examples in precisely the same style as those rendered for the upper classes have been found in commoners' burials. Much of Mochica iconography extolls the virtues and values of their rulers, but another equally important side of this art was concerned with the contemporary scene. The artist was well aware that the whole of society constituted his audience, and he portrayed and commented upon every aspect of his culture. Both the rulers and their subjects, as well as the world about them, appear on vessels as precisely painted or sensitively modeled figures. The two elabo rately costumed persons drawn on the vessel [1] were rendered with a quick, technically fine line which imparts the feeling of movement, tension, and even violence. Sculptured ceramics, exemplified in the admirable portrait head [2], are monumentally serene and expressively alive, showing that the artist made full use of his keen powers of observation. These clay vessels were made in molds and usually fashioned with a "stirrup spout," two distinguishing features of Peruvian north coastal pottery. Several basic vessel shapes underlie the supple, infinitely varied range of sculptures and painted and relief decoration. Only a limited number of earth colors — browns, reds, cream — were used to highlight detail or to draw the silhouetted motif, but plastic form was empha sized instead. Despite the rigid adherence to these particular stylistic conventions, the artist had great freedom in his choice of subject matter and motif. Mochica art is often symbolic, yet highly realistic, although it is never narrative in a stylistic sense. It does not tell us a story, but in a more profound manner records and comments upon the many aspects of life itself. The artist was able to express an idea, an action or event, an individual's character or situation, even the nature of an inanimate object, such as the towering gabled house [3], by seizing 8</page><page sequence="4">2 Portrait head vessel.

In this way he re-created the world around him not only realistically but more meaningfully in the terms in which he and his society saw it. This descriptive and insightful quality of Mochica art gives us the mecha nism with which to fathom the nature of these ancient people, and through this comprehension our aesthetic perceptions and appreciation are modified and their intensity increased. The analysis of the prevalent themes and motifs and the extent of the artists' preoccupation with them, reveals with amazing clarity the culture's traditions. We see religious beliefs and ceremonials, myths, magical and curing practices, all the elaborations and details of daily existence which disappear forever with the disintegration of a preliterate culture. In Mochica art ample expression of the social pattern can be seen. It reveals the nature of the community's participation in ritual, the role of the common folk in government, their regard for and esteem of each other, the obedience and reverence accorded to the ruling class, and the kind of justice and punishment accorded to those who deviated from established ethics — in fact, all those atti tudes which are often elusive even to an actual observer of an alien culture. What in particular of ancient Peruvian life can be derived from this art, and what are the significant motifs from which we may draw the reconstruction of Mochica cultural traditions? Their concept of the universe — the world of the real and the supernatural — and man's attempt to control his destiny within it is stated with remarkable clarity. Religion and the State were one and the same. The Supreme Ruler, standing at the top of the hierarchy of nobles, was the incarnation of the Supreme God. He appeared as an old, wrinkled man, a warrior, or a young adult, but always with the fanged features of the timeless jaguar feline [4]. His activities encompassed every aspect of life — priest, farmer, doctor — and his duties were, above all, to insure the supremacy of the State through victory in war, and to fight for good against evil. The Mochica universe was filled with aggressive demons which took the shape of crabs, horrifying insects, and fantastic sea creatures. The violent battle between these spirits and the Supreme Deity is a prominent iconographical theme. The Mochica were keenly aware of nature, and in its realm both the animate and inanimate were apparently conceived of in dynamic and individual terms. This was expressed in their art in the deification, demonizing, or even personification of all things, and we often see vegetables, mountains, even jars of alcoholic drinks endowed with human attributes. Surrounded by barren desert, the Mochica considered water and its con comitant productivity of prime interest. Although the Supreme God assured agricultural fertility, many aquatic beings such as the frog and the serpent headed rainbow, seen in relief [4], held a prominent place in the religious symbolism of this art. So, too, human fertility as well as death were of ever lasting concern, and often together were incorporated into an erotic cult, which was depicted with stark realism in ceramics. But death was only the beginning of another life — that of the remains of the deceased, and skeletonized creatures march to soundless flutes in many macabre portrayals. Although directed by warrior-priests, participation in never-ending religious 10</page><page sequence="6">3 Jar modeled as a house on a high terrace. Mochica, Peru, A.D. 200-700.

Temple ceremonials appear to have been the symbolic re-enactment of mythological combats and events by masked and costumed persons. We can see triumphal and funerary processions of flag bearers and flute players, or lines of dancers performing to the music of panpipes and drums. The artist joyfully recorded this colorful pageantry in great detail. The Mochica intervened in their fate through such elaborate rituals, but, when faced with more immediate problems, they combined ceremony with more practical measures. While sham en and medicine men presided during sickness or at crucial points in the life cycle of an individual, doctors were employed to amputate limbs or to massage and suck out the disease, and competent herbalists administered a wide variety of efBcacious drugs. Not only did the Mochica artist convey his concepts of supernatural life, but in his precise definition of the mode of daily existence, attitudes toward his fellow man, reflections on community values and the ideal human being, we can detect a philosophy of life. The warrior noble [5], endowed with cunning, strength, and proud dignity, was the embodiment of the ideal individual, and his activities and virtues were extolled prominently in art. As the leader of the armies and supervisor of ceremonies, he paraded his status with elaborate costume and other insignia of rank. As the greatest insult, vanquished enemy warriors were stripped of this finery and in degradation were led by ropes to the conquering leader. Nobles were accorded the honor of being carried in a litter, and sat on high, shaded platforms to receive the common folk who reverently approached and kneeled below. Court messengers were symbolically portrayed as swift birds [6] or insects. Attendants similarly appear on vessels as lizards or animals, and served their masters at banquets or extravagant hunting expeditions, which were the typical diversions of the aristocracy. The common folk were more often depicted in this art at their tasks: farming, begging, or [7] riding to market on the back of a llama. The women [8] are seen caring for their children, weaving and cooking, but, as we can 13 7 Figure riding on the back of a llama. Mochica, Peru, A.D. 200-700.

To us, much of the power of this art lies in its philosophical and psycho logical implications: life was viewed as a constant battle of man against man, man against nature and the supernatural forces of evil. The artist regarded his peers with a sophisticated and, at times, hostile objectivity, delighting in their difficulties, commenting on their faults and, sometimes, cynically observing their pleasures. On the other hand, the blind man [9] undeniably evidences the wide range of emotion contained within this art — understanding, dignity, and humility — and reveals a more poetic and highly empathetic side of the Mochica character. Here, then, in art, is a lucid picture of both the spiritual and physical world of an ancient people. We may ask by what system of moral principles were the two reconciled, and by what manner of coercion were the dictates of authority enforced. The maintenance of the State required the full cooperation of its members, and emphasis was placed on the strict control and regimentation of the com munity. Rigid class stratification and conformity of the individual to his role were values of overwhelming importance. Those who deviated from accepted patterns were dealt with harshly. Punishment was severe, inflicting a permanent stigma upon the delinquent, who was made to serve as an example of justice to the people. The lips were cut off in reprisal for the first transgression, and for subsequent offenses the body was progressively mutilated. The nose, feet, or hands were amputated, and the criminal was made to wander about with rattles or bells to proclaim his wrongdoing. Their capital punishment goes far beyond our imagination — stoning, skinning alive, and exposure to the sun and birds of prey, and this justice was carried out in public with great display and festivity. The Mochica artist was absorbed in depicting these un fortunates and, in unrelenting realism, gave a poignant comment on their tragic plight. We see in the art of the Mochica a series of motifs which were significant enough to be remembered and carried on through their history. These motifs were rendered in a powerful, unified style, reflecting an intensely realistic outlook which left no place for sentimentality or romanticism. The icono graphy of Mochica art expresses little wish-fulfillment and slight imaginative play. While all motifs are, in a sense, symbolic, this symbolism is direct, and fantasy is restricted to simple anthropomorphism or strange juxtaposition of natural elements. We can only wonder why this was so. Perhaps the dream world which many aboriginal societies create either to deny terrifying reality or to bring its mysteries within their realm of comprehension was not necessary for the Mochica. Possibly they were able to minimize fears of privation and disaster, not through fantasy but through awareness of their own achievement, confidence, and forceful control of the human and natural environment. Nevertheless, although he was little interested in the realm of fantasy, the Mochica artist was a magician in his own right. With his imagery he had power over memory and overcame the passage of time, eternalizing the visual aspect of his world. 15</page></plain_text>
