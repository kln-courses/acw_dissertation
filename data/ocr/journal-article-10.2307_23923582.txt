<plain_text><page sequence="1">William M. Voelkle and Roger S. Wieck, The Bernard H. Breslauer Collec tion of Manuscript Illuminations, assisted by Maria Francesca P. Saffiotti. New York: The Pierpont Morgan Library, 1992. Pp. 256; 64 color illus., 143 black-and-white. $49.95. The catalogue of Bernard H. Breslauer's collection of 104 manuscript illuminations—leaves and cuttings from original manuscripts—was published for the exhibition of his holdings at The Pierpont Morgan Library from December 9, 1992, to April 4, 1993. His collection spans the eleventh to the seventeenth centuries, focusing on the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, and it includes early twentieth-century illuminations in two fourteenth century Italian antiphonary leaves by the Spanish Forger. The catalogue starts with Breslauer's account of his acquiring single manuscript leaves and cuttings for their beauty and historical importance. Fif teen years ago he moved from London to New York, where his collection became accessible to manuscript scholars in the area. His generosity has borne fruit, resulting in an excellent catalogue written by two curators of The Pierpont Morgan Library, William M. Voelkle and Roger S. Wieck, with the assistance of Maria Francesca P. Saffiotti. The two authors give an historical survey of the Breslauer leaves in the introduction. The catalogue entries divide the material according to the country of origin and chronology, as follows: French (nos. 1-15), English (nos. 16-18), Nether landish (nos. 19-28), Spanish (nos. 29-30), Central European (nos. 31-54), and 270 Book Reviews</page><page sequence="2">Italian (nos. 55-104). The last two form just over two-thirds of the collection. Each manuscript leaf or cutting is reproduced in black-and-white, accompanying the catalogue entry; of the 104 examples, 64 are also reproduced in color plates between the introduction and the catalogue. The catalogue entries are organized by 1) subject title as the heading; 2) codicological information as to the type of illustration—initial letter or miniature, the manuscript text, attribution, localiza tion, date, size, and number of columns and lines; 3) essay giving the artistic, iconographical, and liturgical or textual background of the work and compara tive material; 4) text of the incipits giving their liturgical, biblical, or secular as sociations; 5) parent manuscript; 6) sister leaves; 7) provenance; and 8) bibliography. Then follow five useful indices pertaining to 1) artists and scribes, 2) iconography (Old Testament, New Testament, saints, classical or historical subjects, portraits, coats of arms, and secular scenes), 3) types of manuscript texts, 4) provenance (owners, dealers, and auction houses, accompanied by place names), and 5) manuscripts cited. The quality of many leaves is truly spectacular. A number of leaves once belonged to famous religious and secular manuscripts. For instance, a Spanish miniature (no. 29) comes from the Beatus Commentary on the Apocalypse from San Andrés de Arroyo in Castile (ca. 1230; Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, MS nouv. acq. lat. 2290). The scene of the Lamb defeating the Ten Kings (Apoc. 17:14-18) in vivid colors contains a strange anthropomorphic figure of the cruciform-haloed Lamb as a warrior. And a calendar leaf of September, formerly in the Hours of Bona Sforza illuminated by Giovanni Pietro Birago, in the British Library, London, represents the epitome of Milanese Italian Renaissance illumination in the late fifteenth century. More will be discussed below. The texts of the Breslauer leaves and their subjects are predominantly religious. This review comments on the highlights or the unusual aspects of the four principal texts of liturgical or devotional nature. Nine leaves of Italian, French, and Central German origins once belonged to missals. Usually because of their large size and liturgical and artistic im portance, pages of miniatures often became tempting targets for the unscrupu lous to remove. Such acts have robbed us of liturgical evidence of their use and destination. Yet astute scrutiny of the style, liturgical association of subjects, and physical features of leaves can successfully lead to the discovery of parent manuscripts or sister leaves. For instance, James Marrow's research on Breslauer leaf no. 44 connects it to the 1485 missal illuminated by Conrad Wagner for Johannes von Giltlingen, abbot of the Monastery of SS. Ulrich and Afra, Augsburg. Occasionally an iconographie clue throws light on the Studies in Iconography 15 — 1993 271</page><page sequence="3">localization of a leaf, as in the case of the late thirteenth-century Crucifixion miniature (no. 4), formerly attributed to England on stylistic grounds. The picture includes SS. Justus and Pastor, with their names on the scrolls they hold. Venerated in southwest France and northern Spain, the martyred brothers of Alcala are patron saints of the cathedral in Narbonne in Aude. They are rarely represented in medieval art. Voelkle and Wieck therefore suggest the origin of the leaf from a missal commissioned for the Narbonne cathedral. This leaf, however, could have formed part of a picture cycle preceding a psalter, a tradition well established in France and England. A leaf, no. 48, dispels our notion that missals are commissioned by bishops, abbots, or priests. A dedicatory inscription in German beneath the full-page miniature "The Coronation of the Virgin by Two Persons of the Trinity," records the date 1504 and the commission of Abbess Barbara Vetter von Schwennigen for the Cistercian convent at Oberschönenfeld in Bavaria. In the scene she appears as a pious donor, accompanied by scrolls inscribed with formulaic Latin prayers and by heraldic shields of the Cistercian convent and of her parents. If only more of the detached leaves would contain such a wealth of information! Nevertheless, Voelkle and Wieck were rightly cautious in assigning this leaf to a missal, for the place of the recto miniature (blank verso) within a mass book is uncertain and its subject is unusual. More numerous are leaves from liturgical chant books of institutional usage, the antiphonary for the divine office (24 examples) and the gradual for the mass (18 examples). These notated service books often of huge size, for lecterns were meant to be sung at a distance. Some leaves bear pictorial evidence of ecclesiastic and particularly mendicant patronage, linking them to major choirbooks such as those of Jacobellus of Salerno for Dominican use (no. 57). Antiphonaries and graduais were in great demand in Italy and Central Europe. They were produced often in major workshops of illuminators, including those identified by their signatures (e.g., nos. 57, 73), and those recognizable by their styles (e.g., of Niccolö da Bologna in Bologna, no. 70; of Lorenzo Monaco in Florence, no. 74; of Christoforo Cortese in Venice, no. 76; and of Joannes Simeley de Pisek in Prague, ca. 1500, no. 47). The work of the last shows the impact of German prints on the iconography of illuminators, providing stock repertory of compositions for images, such as the Last Supper depicted for the feast of Corpus Christi. Not all choirbooks were in Latin. One leaf (no. 66, ca. 1340), attributed to the Master of Dominican Effigies in Florence, comes from a Laudario in Italian, which is a vernacular choral book used by confraternities in Italy. 272 Book Reviews</page><page sequence="4">Psalters tended to be used as private devotional books by the laity in the thirteenth century. Five of the seven Breslauer leaves (nos. 19-20, 32-34) formerly belonged to psalters of Flemish and German origins. A spectacular German leaf (no. 34) comes from the Arenberg Psalter of the Hildesheim diocese (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, MS nouv. acq. lat. 3102), said to be commissioned by Duke Otto of Braunschweig (ca. 1238-39) for the marriage of his daughter Helen to Landgraf Hermann II of Thuringia, son of the sainted Elizabeth of Thuringia (Hungary). Certainly the rare hagiographie picture cycle of martyrdoms or tortures in the calendar (the Breslauer recto shows the martyrdom of Thomas) harks back to the earlier psalter of St. Elizabeth in Cividale, Museo Archeologico Nazionale, MS CXXXVII. On the verso, the double-register miniature with prophets in partial medallions foretelling the events of the life of Christ is clearly connected to the Elizabeth psalter. Iconographie similarities between the two deluxe books must surely be ex plained by their dynastic links. Of course, other psalters were produced for the religious, for example, the enormous leaf with the "B" initial of Psalm 1 (no. 89) from a Florentine psalter (ca. 1500), used as a service book for a Benedictine house. The next group of fourteen leaves comes from books of hours later favored as devotional prayerbooks by the laity. Those from French and Netherlandish hours form the majority, as was true of the late Middle Ages. The French Jean Bourdichon (nos. 8-11) and the Flemish Simon Bening (nos. 22-27) are familiar names. Yet a German leaf with a historiated initial at matins of the hours of the Virgin (no. 31, ca. 1200) reminds us that the early development of the books of hours took place in Central Europe, as well as in England and France. At this stage, Hours of the Virgin were often appended to psalters. The death of the Virgin is a rare subject for matins of the Virgin (also pictured in a French book of hours in Nuremberg, Stadtbibliothek, MS Solger 4.4; late 13th c.). Books of hours were, however, not popular in Central Europe until the late fifteenth century. A puzzling example is an English miniature of Saturninus of Toulouse (no. 17), which had belonged to an unusually long suffrage cycle of thirty-two illustrations in the Quaritch Hours (late 14th c.), broken up after the 1931 catalogue. Most English books of hours list suffrages after lauds of the Virgin, but none of the thirteenth or fourteenth century cite the first bishop of Toulouse. Though his feast (11.29) is included in some English calendars, he is listed in the litany of one book—the Vernon Psalter-Hours (San Marino, Huntington Library, MS EL.9.H17; after ca. 1316). Why this French saint is portrayed in the Quaritch Hours remains a mystery. (He figures also in the Studies in Iconography 15 — 1993 273</page><page sequence="5">collect initial of his feast in the sanctorale of the contemporary Carmelite Missal, also cut up, in the British Library, MS Add. 29704.) The suffrage miniatures bear heraldic shields (unidentified in the 1931 catalogue) and letters in some borders, which may denote a motto or a variation of Knyvett, a name that could be associated with the East Anglian family in Norfolk. In sum, the two curators have done remarkable detective work in tracking down parent manuscripts and sister leaves for the detached leaves. Their scholarship is careful and authoritative. Their catalogue is an impressive instruction book on how to analyze leaves and cuttings removed from their contexts, and it constitutes a valuable resource for students, scholars, and collectors of manuscripts.
