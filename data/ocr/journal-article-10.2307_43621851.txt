T rade - the reciprocal transfer or exchange of commodi- ties, persons, or information - is a form of communica- tion and, along with the transmission of culture, is the only archeological evidence we have for communication among early peoples. Such solid proof for trade is very rare and there is no way to know how representative is the remaining evidence of the extent, content, purpose or manner of early trade as a whole. Twenty years ago it was difficult to point to any evidence of trade in the Eastern Mediterranean much before the beginning of the Bronze Age, ca. 3000 BC. Recently a great deal of new evidence for trade has come to light thanks largely to new techniques for identifying the sources of raw materials and the publication of many new excavations. In this article, I wish to review the evidence for trade in prehistoric - specifically Stone Age - Greece and to summarize what we have learned from it about early communication.1 The Stone Age of Greece can be divided into three separate stages, or phases: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic was represented by mobile hunter-gatherers and spans a period from ca. 200,000 to 18,000 BC in the last Ice Age. During the first two millennia of the Holocene, Mesolithic hunting- gathering bands continued the Old Stone Age way of life. Beginning about 6000 BC, small agricultural villages with food production based upon sheep, goats, wheat, barley and pulses were established throughout Greece. These Neolithic villages grew in number, size and complexity until ca. 3000 BC. At that time there was a shift in settlement pattern which was associated with an increase in the size of settlements. These were often fortified, had monumental architecture, and made use of metallurgy.2 To many, the Paleolithic and Mesolithic hunter- gatherer bands and Neolithic farming villages may seem to represent isolated self-sufficient communities whose energies were largely directed towards subsistence level food procurement to ensure survival with a minimum of effort. Today, however, it is evident that sophisticated networks of trade for different kinds of materials already existed in the Upper Paleolithic. Obsidian is a black volcanic glass and has been found at archeological sites of very early date on the mainland.3 It occurs at three localities in the Aegean, and it was the pioneering work of Colin Renfrew and his associates in the 1960s, that firmly established the island of (fig. 1) Melos as the principal source for the mainland obsidian.4 Since the time of their initial discoveries the geographical extent, magnitude and chronology of the distribution of obsidian has been considerably expanded. Melian obsi- dian has been documented up to 500 kilometers from Melos spanning a period of roughly 9,000 years (see map). The earliest occurrence of this material on the mainland may be more than 10,000 years ago in Upper Paleolithic levels at Franchthi Cave on the Peloponneso. Thereafter obsidian became increasingly abundant com- Fig. 1 : Distribution of obsidian, 10,000 to 3000 BC.

There can be no doubt that the distribution of Melian obsidian among the mainland sites involved active trade since Melos was separated from the mainland by open sea in the last Ice Age. The deposits of obsidian were discovered, and the material transported to the mainland at that time by boat, on an irregular basis, by small parties of individuals who carried away cores of obsidian.5 These were given preliminary working on the spot but were flaked into finished tools on the mainland. There is no question of specialized traders living at and directly exploiting the quarries on a commercial basis in the Stone Age. Nevertheless, the amount of obsidian trans- ported to the mainland was considerable.6 The quanti- ties involved have not yet been estimated, but may easily have been in the hundreds of kilograms.7 However informally obsidian was collected from Melos, it would have been gathered by people from more southern, coastal sites like Franchthi Cave. From there it would have found its wav from hand to hand along Fig. 3: Volcanic rock used to make millstones. established trade networks to more northerly and inland inhabitants. Since on land there were neither draft animals nor carts in the Stone Age, transport was by hand and by foot and for large quantities was nonexistent.8 Small boats, perhaps nothing more than reed canoes, would have sufficed for the sea trip. The distinctive physical characteristics of obsidian have made it easy to recognize, but it was only one of many materials to be traded in prehistory. My own work has shown that another distinctive volcanic rock, a porphyritic andesite or rhyodacite, found on the island of Aegina was being transferred to the mainland already 9,500 years ago to sites such as Franchthi Cave - where it was found in both Mesolithic and Neolithic levels - Athens and Kitsos Cave. What is more, this material, which was used to make millstones (fig. 3), has been exploited in Aegina continuously from the Upper Mesoli- thic to the present day - millstones were manufactured •there as recently as 1976. This may be one of the oldest continuous industries to survive into modern times anywhere in the world. The distribution of andesite has thus far been documented no more than 100 kilometers from its source in the Mesolithic and Neolithic, but as study progresses I expect it to be found farther afield and inland than is presently known. As with obsidian, mainland users probably went directly to Aegina to procure small quantities of andesite which were worked into finished millstones at the home village. Millstones, or lumps of andesite may, however, have been traded to neighboring peoples.9 Long, thin flaked stone blades in prehistoric Greece were not always of obsidian. High quality chert blades - flint and chalcedony - were imported throughout the Neolithic period to Franchthi Cave, Kitsos Cave and other sites (fig. 4), and were apparently imported in their finished form, since no cores or debris of the same material have been found at these sites. Most such blades have a lustrous sheen which developed from the use of the blade as a reaping knife or sickle for grasses like wheat and barley. The source(s) for the chert have not yet been identified, but similar blades are to be found at Neolithic sites throughout Greece. Thus it is probable that here we have evidence of another long distance trading network, and it is tempting to imagine that chert may have had a northern source and traveled in the opposite direction from obsidian; indeed, it may have been one item that was exchanged for obsidian.10 Jewelry made from the spondylus shell (Spondylus gaederopus) was certainly traded great distances inland from the Aegean in the Late Neolithic, reaching as far as central Europe. Spondylus bracelets and other objects are found at virtually every site in Greece throughout the Neolithic, though these are all located near the coast. It seems likely that spondylus artifacts would have been an item of trade among inland Greek settlements at an early date. 11 Shell jewelry other than spondylus may also have had a wide circulation. Ornaments of cut, ground and polished shell, such as Dentalium or Cerastoderma have been found at Final Paleolithic Franchthi Cave and are increasingly common in later periods. At Franchthi Cave evidence was found to indicate that bead manufacture from cockle- shells was a specialized activity in the sixth millennium BC.12 418 Ekistics 302, Sept. / Oct. 1983</page><page sequence="3">While it may be premature to refer to this as craft specialization, it would have taken little extra effort to produce beads at Franchthi in sufficient quantities for trade. Shell beads are certainly quite common on Greek Neolithic sites and as yet little effort has been made to identify their source(s). Other durable materials were traded in Neolithic times, but present evidence is insufficient to reconstruct their distribution. One may include here emery from Naxos, marble in the form of vessels or figurines, stone axes (celts), and pottery. Marble vessels, such as an Early Neolithic bowl from Franchthi Cave, or figurines like the remarkably similar examples found near Sparta and in Aegina, derived from sources that have not yet been identified.13 Likewise the distinctive green stones used for axes (or celts), such as serpentinite or peridotite, derived from as yet unknown sources, are found at every Neolithic site. Clark has shown that an extensive trade in stone axes was being carried on in Europe over distances as great as 900 miles from a very early date and it is unlikely that Greece will prove to be an exception. Stone axes were valued as wealth and would have been traded over long distances; in Greece at least one Early Neolithic "hoard" of celts has been found attesting to their value in the ancient economy.14 There is no doubt that pottery was traded in later Neolithic Greece. No study, however, has yet appeared that attempts to trace pottery either by means of style or composition of its clay to particular centers of manufac- ture as has been done successfully with Bronze Age pottery.15 The possiblity of establishing trade in pottery raises exciting prospects. Vitelli has suggested that the similarity of Middle Neolithic painted pottery among sites in the Argolid may be attributed to the practice of exogamy rather than to the presence of specialized itinerant potters. The small size of prehistoric communi- ties in Greece would have made the sharing of mates necessary, and, if women were the potters in Neolithic Greece, it is argued, their transfer would have served to transmit particular stylistic elements among widely sepa- rated communities.16 Indeed this practice may be viewed as a variety of "trade" in itself all but invisible in the archeological record. Jacobsen has also suggested transhumant animal herders as being responsible for the dissemination of pottery styles in the Middle Neolithic.17 In this connection, one may perhaps mention the discovery by Talalay of anthropomorphic figurines of the Early and Middle Neolithic that were purposely cut or split into two halves. She suggests they may represent some sort of contract or form of identification between groups or parties.18 It is tempting to speculate on their use in hypothetical exchanges of mates or commodities be- tween communities linked by pastoralist transhumants. Other commodities that were traded may have left no physical trace. Salt was certainly a valuable trade item between coastal and inland sites, probably from the Paleolithic. However, there is absolutely no evidence for this. That countless other goods, like wood, honey, gum or coloring matter were exchanged can only be surmised. Domesticated plants - wheat and barley - and animals, - sheep and goats - and their products, i.e. textiles produced from their wool and hair, may have been Fig. 4: Sketches of high quality chert blades found at various mainland sites. traded, and this may account for their wide distribution from the centers of original domestication. Renfrew, among others, has drawn attention to the increase in the late Neolithic of the number of artifacts - spindle whorls, spools and loom weights - which he interprets as evidence of craft specialization in textile production.19 However, textiles could have been traded in small quantities, as would baskets and skin bags, even in the absence of specialized production. Nothing, of course, may be said of the nonmaterial aspects of prehistoric trade. No trace will ever be found of the folktales, information, security, magic, medicine or just plain gossip that was often the oil to lubricate the more material aspects of everyday trade. Yet such transfers of nonmaterial information may have been as important as any of the commodities that were ex- changed. The record of prehistoric trade as summarized here is not impressive in itself. There is no suggestion of large scale exchanges of commodities produced by specialists, nor of specialized traders, media of exchange or the other trappings characteristic of large scale trade in later antiquity. Rather it is a record of small scale transfers of raw materials and simple manufactured items affected by hand-to-hand bartering. No tankers or freighters were involved, only the slow creep of artifacts from village to village, harbor to harbor and valley to valley. The small scale and primitive beginning should not lead us, however, to underestimate the importance of trade as a form of early communication. On the contrary, trade and communication in prehistoric Greece were the same thing. At present, the actual modes of carrying out prehistoric trade have only begun to be studied in any detail. What is important in this context is the fact that trade, however primitive, brings individuals into face to face contact and circulates artifacts. In an important study, Adams reminds Ekistics 302, Sept. / Oct. 1983 419</page><page sequence="4">us that the word "trade" originally signifies "a path or beaten track" and thus implies movement of people, things and ideas.20 Renfrew draws attention to the fundamental similarity of trade as a process of exchange, and the transmission of a signal in information theory. As Renfrew puts it: "A cup made of gold, to a person who has not previously seen gold, imparts information about the world. From the standpoint of the receiver it is a message." In other words, to quote Renfrew again: "The trade situation is an exhange situation, and an exchange situation is an information flow situation.' 21 We have seen that to study early trade is to study early communication, and as such, trade will remain at the center of archeological inquiry. In the future, evidence of trade will be forthcoming from ever earlier periods of time in Greece, and archeologists will expand their study to include questions of the social context of trade along with its economic aspects.
