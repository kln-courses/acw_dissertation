Mies van der Rohel In recent years the work of Lilly Reich (1885-1947) has finally begun to receive the attention it deserves: from fashion to furniture, exhibition installations to architecture, her designs have been the object of several studies as well as a major retrospective at the Museum of Modem Art. Inevitably, she paid the price of her close collaboration with and dedica- tion to Mies van der Rohe. There is no question of Mies's deep and lasting impact on her But the exact extent of her influence on Mies may never be known. During their intermittent work and occasional life together, her projects were often overshadowed by his. When Lilly Reich first met Mies in the mid-1920s, he was already sep- arated from his wife and three daughters. Their first joint undertaking was a large hall for the exhibition Die Wohnung, organized by the Werk- bund at Stuttgart, in 1927.2 Close collaboration led to a more intimate * I wish to thank Andreas Huyssen for his careful reading of my manuscript and excellent suggestions.

Today, most scholars would agree that Reich played a major role in the design of some of Mies's most well-known interiors such as the Barce- lona pavilion and the Tugendhat house. Vivid colors and curvilinear forms appeared in his projects only after Mies began to work with Reich.5 Her own architectural work cannot really stand comparison with his, even though one must factor in the limited opportunities open to women in this field. Be that as it may, her forte lay elsewhere. Looking back at her out- put, which was cut short by World War II, it seems clear that her greatest contribution was at the same time her most controversial - display. This paper focuses on Lilly Reich's installations and their ideology, particularly the exhibits that she produced for the 1937 World's Fair in Paris. Her lapidary elegance and originality in this area remain a mile- stone in the history of design. Window Dressing Issues of display connected to mass consumption had begun to attract attention ever since the advent of international expositions in the 1850s. At the time, two competing trends dominated the scene. Naturalism prevailed to a great extent when it came to exhibiting manufactured objects such as clothes, shoes, and jewelry. In this case, context, and hence narration of some sort, was the rule. But avant-garde movements, such as abstraction and surrealism, were also increasingly popular in the 1930s. During this period, the surrealists were introducing allegory into exhibition displays in the name of the unconscious. Their compositions pivoted around the human figure, or at least its simulacrum, the mannequin, as could be seen in Salva- dor Dali's notorious windows for Bergdorf Goodman in New York (1939). 3.

Since the 1920s there had been a revolution in the strategies of display. The Art Deco exposition held in Paris in 1925 had a strong effect on the world of commercial exhibitions and installations, but it tended to valorize the unique and the unrepeatable. Even more important was the creation, also in Paris, of the Union des Artistes Modernes in 1929.6 The organization campaigned tirelessly on behalf of a modernist aes- thetic, new forms of display, and the use of modern materials conso- nant with mass production. Bringing together artists, architects, and designers, the Union underscored rather than disguised the relation of the merchandise and the installations with industry, as opposed to the luxury goods exhibited at the Art Deco show that attempted to endow machine-made goods with the allure of handicraft. Influence of new ini- tiatives such as these can be seen in the windows designed for the great Parisian department stores throughout the late 1920s and 1930s: there is no thematic environment, no mimesis, no allegory. Just an abstract composition of fabrics tastefully draped over invisible frames. Having worked for some of Berlin's most fashionable department stores such as Wertheim and Gerson, Reich was familiar with these ideas. In 1911 she designed clothing installations for Wertheim, where her teacher Else Oppler-Legban was head of the women's fashion department.7 During the war, she also collaborated with Hermann Freudenberg, head of Gerson, Berlin's leading clothing store for women, in her aggressive show on German fashion.8 A member of the German Werkbund since 1912, she had closely followed its activities in this area. Working in collaboration with retailers, the Werkbund had initiated a campaign to inculcate modem tenets of window display in order to improve consumer taste. Their 1913 yearbook carried a series of arti- cles and photographs dedicated to the subject, including a display by Lilly Reich.9 Shop-windows played an important role in the Werk- bund's critique of the commodity and its representation within the retail 6.

Drawing on Werner Sombart's earlier work, Friedrich Naumann, Karl Ernst Osthaus, Joseph August Lux, and Paul Westheim, among others, had all written on the deepening rift which they located no longer between producer and product, but between production and consumption. They advocated more straightfor- ward ways of exhibiting mass-produced objects that minimized alien- ation by refusing to narrativize goods. 10 "The Werkbund shop-window," writes Frederic Schwartz, "was non-narrative: attempts to show the commodity in a scene, real-life or fantasy, were shunned. There were no elaborate props for the goods, and the goods themselves were not props 10.

The merchandise had to speak for itself without recourse to a thematic environment that endowed it, by association, with symbolic properties it did not intrinsically possess.12 But the roots of new theories of display were not to be found only in currents of political economy close to the Werkbund, which in any case had little impact outside of Germany. Modem art and architecture also left an indelible trace in many areas of visual urban culture, especially in the exhibition spaces of museums, expositions, and, of course, depart- ment stores. This cross-pollination itself is worthy of note. Numerous art- ists and architects in Germany and France had contributed to new ways of envisioning display, many of them women who were beginning to enter the profession in ever greater numbers: Charlotte Perriand, H6l1ne Henry, Sonia Delaunay, Eileen Gray in France, as well as Reich's Ger- man colleagues Anna Muthesius, Else Oppler-Legband, Else Wenz- Vietor, Ruth Hildegard Geyer-Raack, and Lilly Prill-Schloemann.13 By showing Reich's familiarity with these ideas, I am merely estab- lishing a context, not claiming filiation; for the sleek sophistication of her ethereal designs is a far cry from the commercial avant-gardes of consumer culture and the tasteful arrangements of fellow designers from the Werkbund or the Union des Artistes Modernes. However much she may have been influenced by new trends in contemporary installations, her own tactics revolutionized the art of display with their implied cri- tique of the usual techniques of representation. Reich sided resolutely with the advocates of abstraction. Rejecting the associationist and alle- gorical rhetoric of the surrealists, she shunned all figurative references to the unconscious, the uncontrollable, and of course, the body. Only rarely did she use raw matter and thus foreground nature, as in the exhi- bition Die Wohnung unserer Zeit [The Dwelling in Our Time], held in Berlin in 1931. But this deliberate "regression" to origins was unusual 11. Frederic Schwartz, The Werkbund: Design Theory and Mass Culture Before the First World War (London: Yale UP, 1996) 104. 12. This was an old theme in retailing. In his monumental novel on the department store published in 1883, Emile Zola said that Octave Mouret, owner of the fictitious Para- dise of the Ladies, "scoffed at some of his colleagues who believed that the goods should speak for themselves."

It is interesting to compare the double-barreled names of Germany's women art- ists to those of their French and Irish counterparts: hyphenated identities - at least profes- sionally - spell out a story of exclusion, or inclusion at a price.</page><page sequence="6">166 Cruel Metonymies for her, and had as much to do with specific clients and commissions as with personal choice. nA:I 7-77-? -.HIM~ii:::::' -iiii Figure 2.

In many of her installations, underwritten by major German firms such as the Hackerbraiu beer display for the International Exposition of 1929 in Barcelona, Lilly Reich stressed the connection with industry and serial production. Nevertheless, by exhibiting mass-produced objects, neatly stacked side by side by the hundreds in elegant, tay- lorized contexts, Reich in fact dissolved the individual unit in an abstract and global image. Repetition and seriality devaluate the repre- sentation of the single object, and constitute a threat to figuration itself. Whenever possible, she carefully avoided stressing any relation to industry, as one can see in some of her glass exhibits for Berlin's Deut- sches Volk - deutsche Arbeit [German People - German Work] show of 1934.

Actual boundaries blur into illusion in a purely retinal game of demate- rialized forms. Matter is sublimated into sheer visuality. This telling elision of any reference to the origins of goods positions Reich against many of the Werkbund's most distinguished theoreticians in their romantic critique of capitalism. Werner Sombart had already noted that the new strategies of window display staged the products in such a way as to alienate them from their industrial source. While stores previously arranged goods so as to call attention to their provenance, the new commercial institutions cut the umbilical cord with manufactur- ing in their representation of the merchandise. As Sombart noted, "there develops an arrangement of commodities according to their determined end, according to their function in consumption." Consequently, "a cer- tain indifference with respect to origin" ensues.14 14. Sombart, "Die Entwicklungstendenzen im modernen Kleinhandel" 149, 150.

The point is driven home even more clearly in Reich's work for the German textile exhibit in Barcelona, where the installation design came straight out of the modem museum environment. There is no illusion of referentiality here - that is, manufactured objects carefully arrayed by the window dresser in a context implying industrial production. If any- thing, we get the opposite: the illusion of mediated unreferentiality. Reich ostensibly cut off all moorings with history, labor, capitalism, choosing to privilege the object over context and production process. Fabrics are aestheticized and presented in isolation from any environ- ment that might recall use-value. All traces of labor and the social rela- tions of production are elided.15 Unlike many artists who were trying to bring art down from the ivory tower, Reich seeks exactly the reverse: to raise installation to the realm 15.

Free-standing glass walls, almost like abstract paintings, replace the usual props or pedestals that hold up the merchandise.16 As in Mies's nearby Barcelona pavilion, the panels are set orthogonally to each other, so that the planes and axes defining them intersect at right angles, galvanizing space. Reich clearly detaches the object (textiles) from time (history) and place (geography). Allusions to the everyday are carefully eliminated, and the merchandise acquires the lure of cul- tic, mythic icons in the secularized rituals of consumption. She thus aimed not at obliterating the divide between high and low, but at elevat- ing goods to the status of museum objects. Her installations work to demonetize the commercial transactions implied in the very function of display, by putting the aura back into mass-produced goods, or at least into their exhibition. While it would be an exaggeration to claim that 16. Deborah Dietsch has called attention to the impact of Lilly Reich's use of free- standing panels on the work of Mies van der Rohe.

The connection with works of art is further stressed by her adoption of the frame and of the triptych format, so that one reads the textiles against the framed glass as figure on ground. From Jacques Derrida to Louis Marin, numerous scholars have called attention to the semiotic impor- tance of the frame. Structurally, it separates the display from the visual and perceptual encroachment of the surroundings, and thus helps focus the viewer's attention. But it also has a semantic function, that of constituting what it delimits as a valuable object. "The frame," wrote Louis Marin, "is not only a requirement of the use-value of the picture but also a sign (a marker) of its possible exchange-value, a sign which is overdetermined in certain historical moments and in certain cultural places and which transforms the enclosed picture into a sign of wealth and culture."17 In this respect, it is important to note her use of synthetic and machine-made materials, such as chrome, glass, and steel in exposition displays.18 Though her interior design shows great sensitivity to texture, one almost senses a fear of raw matter and sheer density here. In con- trast to Walter Benjamin, who claimed that glass left no aura,19 Reich tried to heighten the ethereal, insubstantial appeal of her installations by availing herself of polished and vitreous materials: she privileged gleam- ing, sharp-edged textures smoothed and sharpened into crystalline planes that disavowed any gestural trace, any allusion to nature or to the human hand. A cerebral approach such as this aimed at evacuating the subjec- tive, the emotional, and the sensuous, not at eliminating the aura. Baudrillard had already noted the special properties of glass, which was both a medium and a goal. Glass isolates, he wrote: "It cuts all 17.

Germany relied more and more on synthetic textiles, as the 1937 exposition later made clear: "Here may be seen, side by side with the familiar stuffs which have proved their worth through the centuries, the new artificial materials.... It does not require the special intuition of the woman to realize that, with these new materials which Germany has discovered, it is not a question of 'substitutes,' but of a genuine enrichment of the products of the textile industry, offering hitherto undreamed of possibilities to the modiste."

Down deep, it is not even a receptacle but an isolator. Furthermore, glass also allows for the symbolism of a second state and a degree zero of the material. A symbolism of congelation and hence of abstrac- tion."20 The disengaged objects on display, insulated by glass, are meant to trigger off a purely retinal response on the part of a disen- gaged and presumably unpolitical viewer. It is clear that Reich differed radically not just from the surrealists but from the other proponents of abstraction as well. For example, she achieved the opposite of what her contemporary Frederick Kiesler wanted to do with his own provocative installations. In attempting to erode the frontiers between the world of high art and the street, Kiesler tried to bring art down from its pedestal, eliminating or de-emphasizing picture frames, and changing the conventional manner of hanging paint- ings. Whether or not he achieved his goal is open to question, but the contrast between them can be seen clearly in his 1942 installations for Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century gallery.21 Conversely, the window displays Kiesler produced for Saks Fifth Avenue in 1929 reveal the impact of museum installations. But the spotlight falls on the object. There is no mise-en-scene calling attention to itself. Lilly Reich was also opposed to more commodified forms of exhibit- ing objects, as in the case of department stores. All allusions extraneous to the merchandise were rejected, in keeping with Werkbund practice, of whom an anonymous critic had written: "the display booths are bare: only the products on display should speak, should vouch for them- selves."22 Not only did she eliminate overt referentiality, but her ele- gant minimalism in fact muted or concealed political issues which were part of the dominant ideologies responsible for these venues. All her seemingly self-referential installations imply the fiction of a politically 20. Jean Baudrillard, Le Systeme des objets (Paris: Gallimard, 1968) 57. Transla- tion mine. 21.

It is important to analyze the conditions surrounding the creation of these works in order to understand Reich's politics of representation. Con- text, chronology, and the reaction of the viewers all need to be interpel- lated if we are to take a stand against essentialist conceptions of art which crop up, as Paul De Man once said about literature, "whenever the study of works of art is pursued at the expense of their reception by the public."24 A work of art is never sealed off in itself once and for all, nor can its "meaning" be made to coincide with the author's claims of intentionality. In the case of Lilly Reich, not only does abstraction not absolve her from political responsibility, but her installations for Paris took on a different connotation, independently of her will, by virtue of both the political and the historic context in which they were embedded. The inescapable connection between the exhibits and the political agendas of each nation brings to mind an observation made by Anne O'Hare McCormick at the time: a World's Fair, she wrote in 1937, is "a display of one thing to prove another. .... the Paris Fair is interest- ing as the first exposition of this new flaunting of political parties and symbols."25 And indeed, all the different pavilions and their exhibits were affected to varying degrees by the international events of 1937. This is particularly true of Lilly Reich's displays which were housed not in the German pavilion, built by Albert Speer, but in the interna- tional one where each nation's wares were shown side by side. Just how this particular fair conveyed political information - both 23. Lilly Reich, "Modefragen," originally in Die Form (1922).

Like all such documents, the site plan was a blueprint for official policy: "it is the State that defines the principal axes [of the exposition] and can intervene in the administration of the different</page><page sequence="14">174 Cruel Metonymies lots until the very opening."26 In this case, the politics of the orga- nizers were cynically clear: the aggressive confrontation between Albert Speer's German pavilion and the Russian one by Boris Iofan had been deliberately mapped out to dramatize the show on plan and in elevation. In his memoirs, Speer recounts how he "accidentally" came upon the sketch for the Soviet pavilion: "While looking over the site in Paris, I by chance stumbled into a room containing the secret sketch of the Soviet pavilion. A sculptured pair of figures thirty-three feet tall, on a high platform, were striding triumphantly toward the German pavilion."2 He thus deliberately planned his tower-like building so that it seemed to arrest the dramatic offensive of the Soviet pavilion. A more tragic confrontation, which could not have been foreseen by the French authorities, involved the location of the Spanish pavilion by Josep Lluis Sert and Luis Lacasa, which was situated literally under the shadow of the swaggering German building.28 For Spain the irony could not have been more cruel. On 26 April 1937, one month before the Paris exposition was inaugurated, the little Basque town of Gemika - Guemica - had been bombed by the Nazis. With the specter of the Russian revolution still before their eyes, the nations that would soon declare war on Germany as the Allied Forces refused to acknowledge the catastrophe. And even though the conservative presses of most European nations refused to carry the story, Guernica made front-page news in every country; in France, no educated person could ignore it, all the more so since so many intellectuals rallied to the Spanish cause.29 It was in response both to the tragedy and also to the official silence with which the news was received that Picasso painted his sear- ing and unforgettable Guernica, conceived specifically for the building 26.

Significantly, the same metonymic relationship between Spain and Germany occurs - again accidentally - inside another building of the world's fair, the International Pavilion, where Lilly Reich's work 30. Another tragic adjacency confronted the Spanish pavilion towards the rear of the lot, where the pavilion of the Papal States was located. The Vatican, at the time the only nation to have officially recognized the sovereignty of Franco's Spain, allowed it to be represented in its own building with an altar. The altarpiece showed Saint Teresa d'Avila bringing succor to Franco's troops, and was executed by Jose Maria Sert, uncle of Josep Lluis Sert, one of the architects of the pavilion of the Spanish Republic.

Again, Reich chose neither the pavilion where her vitrines would be located, nor their exact positioning within the building. But in that specific his- toric context, contiguity - deliberate or not - had a clear political undertow, at least for all those who followed the Civil War in Spain, and Germany's brutal role in the conflict. These particular installations are not among the best works of Lilly Reich, but they are crucial instances of her activities at a key moment in history. Contrasting fabrics are gracefully draped over metal frames arranged against sheets of plate glass that serve to bracket her displays and isolate them from their surroundings. Here Reich recuperates ideas and designs that she had produced together with Mies van der Rohe for the Reichsausstellung der deutschen Textil- und Bekleidungswirtschaft [Imperial Exhibition of the German Textile and Garment Industry] that took place in Berlin earlier that year.32 Shortly before the opening, on 24 March 1937, their ideas were curtly and unceremoniously coopted by the architect Ernst Sagebiel when Hermann Goring (then in charge of Hit- ler's four-year economic plan) took control of the exhibition.33 Whether due to political or aesthetic pressure, or even time constraints, the Paris design is somewhat more conventional than anything she had ever done. The curved glass wall, for example, was a fragment of the more original and elegant solution that she and Mies had earlier planned for Berlin. The Sounds of Silence Even though Reich cannot be held responsible for the involuntary rela- tion of her textile displays to the neighboring Spanish ones in the Inter- national Pavilion, her very participation in the Paris fair at that moment says something about her attitude toward politics. Spain - the only for- eign country where Reich had worked previous to 1937 - was hardly incidental to her career. It was for the international exposition held in 31. Though the fair was inaugurated by President Leon Blum on May 24, the Inter- national Pavilion was not ready until much later. This explains why some of Reich's draw- ings are dated July 31.

We have, of course, no way of knowing what Lilly Reich thought about the bombing of Guernica. But if the savage attack on an innocent civilian target caused her any problems of conscience, it did not stop her from participating in official initiatives representing the Third Reich. Indeed, it did not bother any of the French administrators of the 1937 fair either, since they awarded a gold medal to both Albert Speer and Boris Iofan for the German and Soviet pavilions respectively.34 But this was not the only instance where Reich looked the other way, at least publicly. One year after the Paris show, window dressers of a different kind were at work in Germany. On the night of 9 November 1938 [Kristallnacht], in a perverse parody of the display strategies that had so preoccupied the Werkbund, the Nazis systematically smashed plate-glass windows of Jewish-owned properties all over Germany. In Berlin alone, 29 department stores were vandalized or destroyed,35 including Wertheim, for which Reich had worked, and for whose owner she had designed an apartment in 1931. The association of department stores and Jews was well established in Germany. As Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf "If the fate of Rome should strike Berlin, future genera- tions would some day admire the department stores of a few Jews as the mightiest works of our era and the hotels of a few corporations as the characteristic expression of the culture of our times."36 Years ago, Richard Grundberger noted that the euphemism "Crystal Night," suggestive of the plate glass shattered in the course of the pogrom, "was in its way, symbolic, as stressing material damage to the exclusion of physical and spiritual barbarity."3 Glass is not moored to any particular meaning, and has both the power to reveal and the power to silence.38 It can stand for opacity as well as transparency, particu- larly when it cleaves a wedge between human pain and the realm of matter, constituting itself as sheer, objective, neutral datum.

Most, of course, elected the soft and yielding path of least resistance, and would later claim after 1945 that they had opted for "inner exile."40 When Mies himself finally left Ger- many, largely at Reich's insistence, she paid him a visit in 1939, but chose to return to Berlin.41 According to Franz Schulze, Reich appar- ently wanted Mies to invite her to stay, and left moving letters com- plaining sadly about their separation.42 On 9 September 1939, for example, she wrote to her friend Maud Grote: I am on my way back from America where I was with Mies a few weeks and was then upset by the news of the war. It was not at all easy for me. I realized ahead of time that returning from there would be very, very difficult for me.... But I don't want to talk about it. You will understand somehow.43 Nowhere, however, does she record the slightest repugnance of return- ing to Germany because of what was happening to a large number of its 38.

No matter what her country did, she never refused to work for it, nor did she ever emigrate - even when she had the possibility, however slim, of doing so. To be fair, one must remember that Mies had job offers in the United States, a fact that made it easier for him to leave. Professional women undoubtedly had far fewer work opportunities than men, and they may have thus been excluded from "a more heroic, or politically acceptable stance."44 That this does not seem to have been Lilly Reich's case is borne out by the fact that a few years earlier, on 10 June 1933, when the Werkbund was subjected to the process of Gleichschaltung and the presidency was entrusted to Nazis, she had been one of the members of the executive committee who negotiated the change of leadership.45 Reich, the first woman to be elected to the board of directors of the German Werkbund,46 never protested when, for instance, the infamous "Aryan clause" excluding Jews from membership was adopted that same year.47 In fact, the Werkbund became one of the very first cul- tural organizations in Germany that officially excluded non-Aryans.48 Whether Reich complied with nazification out of political expediency or blind faith in authority (in this case the Fiihrerprinzip), the economic and professional dividends of Realpolitik were noticeable. Toward the end of the war, Lilly Reich worked for Ernst Neufert, whom Albert Speer had entrusted with the task of devising new stan- dards for housing.49 At the time, Speer was not only Hitler's favorite architect, but had been appointed minister of armaments as well, fol- lowing the death of Fritz Todt in a mysterious airplane crash in 1942.50 44.

And in her case, strength of character was never an issue. She had, as Franz Schulze has pointed out, a "commanding personality."53 Former colleagues and collabora- tors furthermore described her as someone who was outspoken, "pushy," and had an "unpleasantly assertive" personality.54 Hinnerk Scheper, who also taught at the Bauhaus, complained to his wife that Reich was "a cold, business-like woman, . . . completely indifferent to how other people get by."55 Friends, on the other hand, recalled her sense of discipline, constant self-denial,56 and courage in the face of death (she died after a long illness in 1947). According to Elaine Hoch- man, "few would dispute her ability to face up to things as they were, without sentiment or ideological bias."57 The Politics of the Unpolitical The idea that it was possible to face up to things "without ideological bias" was widespread among German professionals and intellectuals. Since the late nineteenth century, educated Germans had always taken refuge from politics in the rarified sphere of Bildung and Kultur, those twin pillars of German Idealism. They retreated, like Zarathustra, to the 51. Recent research has shed new light on Speer's personal involvement with Nazi policy concerning the Jews.

The pervasive myth of the unpoliti- cal German was expressed most famously, of course, in Thomas Mann's 1918 Betrachtungen eines Unpolitischen [Reflections of a Non- political Man], where he reaffirms his allegiance to the authoritarian state, the Obrigkeitsstaat, and to the persona of the disengaged intellec- tual.58 It was written in response to his elder brother Heinrich Mann's essay in praise of Emile Zola and the intellectuel engage,59 which Tho- mas took as a thinly-veiled attack on himself.60 This quietist, noli me tangere attitude was particularly prevalent in times of political turmoil. When Mies undertook to reopen the Berlin Bauhaus after 200 members of the Gestapo closed the school on 11 April 1933 on the grounds that it was an unpolitical institution, he fell back on the old conception of the intellectual as detached observer. Three months later, on July 21, when Mies finally received permission from the Gestapo to reopen the school, he called Reich, then in charge of interior design and the weaving workshop: "We can open the school again. Order champagne," said Mies. "What for?" answered Reich, always the realist. "We don't have the money." Nonetheless, the champagne appeared at the faculty meeting, where Mies explained in triumph, "Now, I went there for three months every second day just to get this letter. I was anxious to get this letter. I wanted to have the permission to go ahead. And now I make a propo- sition and I hope you will agree with me. I will write them a letter 58.

It is the exact picture that Thomas Mann himself was later to draw of the struggle, with Naphta and Settembrini fighting it out in The Magic Mountain, paradigmatic victims, perhaps, of one of the most disturbing perversions of an age in which all profundities tend to be sinister, and shallow all the friendlier thoughts about man."

Three years earlier, at the Werkbund meeting held in Vienna in June 1930, Mies had articulated this position unambiguously: The new era is a fact; it exists, irrespective of our 'yes' or 'no'. Yet it is neither better nor worse than any other era. It is pure datum in itself without value content .... Let us accept changed economic and social conditions as a fact .... All these take their blind and fateful course. 62 Lilly Reich's silence with regard to the fate of former students, col- leagues, and associates must also be seen in this light. Her allegedly unpolitical stance breaks down in face of the facts. Over the years, she had become indispensable to Mies who usually consulted her before making decisions. If Reich must be credited with a greater share in his work than has hitherto been acknowledged, she must also bear some of the responsibility for the events surrounding the last year of the Bau- haus (1932-33), when she was one of the professors who had a strong say in school policy.63 In a monumental study on anti-Semitism carried out in this country just after World War II, Adorno attempted to identify the psychological roots of this unwavering belief in authority that served to legitimize rac- ism.64 But this was no ahistorical descent into the unpolitical under- world of the psyche: it was the historicity of discrimination - its sociological dimension - that interested him. Bringing psychoanalysis to bear on a huge survey, Adorno concluded that the authoritarian indi- vidual was one who had suffered a fair amount of paternal repression 61.

As a result, the individual is over-adjusted to soci- ety, and takes pleasure in obedience and subordination.66 Conversely, outsiders, Jews in the case of this particular study, become socially sanctioned outlets for anger, symbolic substitutes for the hated father.67 No doubt much has changed in our understanding of the psychology of fascism since then. But Reich's endless and unconditional service- ableness to her country - the Fatherland, after all - seems to stem from a similar mechanism of repression. Self-denial and disci line the very words used to describe Reich by some of her peers6 - are typical traits of the psychological profile outlined by Adorno. How- ever, in her case, stereopathy,69 that is, rigidity and lack of cathexis, are not just character traits but stylistic ones as well. Her reliance on order, geometry, seriality, and cold, steel-like materials and surfaces, are no doubt preferences she shared with all the designers of the International Style - Erich Mendelsohn, for example. But they also resonate like the formal analogues to deep-seated psychological tendencies. One has only to consider her design for the Deutsche Linoleum exhibit in Stuttgart (1927), to see how Germany looms large in her imaginary.70 Impressive as it is, this setting speaks not of quietism but of militancy and nationalism transmuted into aesthetics. One often for- gets just how nationalistic some of the "international" style practitio- ners could be. From Lilly Reich's projects for the German fashion industry to her output for the Werkbund (which was nothing if not nationalist), autarchy seems to have been the perennial postulate for her work. On the other hand, it is undeniable that her interior designs could reveal an exquisite feeling for sensuous form and surface. Mies's 65.

Tugendhat house in Brno (1930) and the Wolf house in Guben (1927) owed much to Reich's sensitivity to color and texture.71 So too did projects aimed specifically at women, such as the Cafi Samt und Seide [Velvet and Silk Cafi] which Reich and Mies executed for the exhibition Die Mode der Dame [Women's Fashion] held in Berlin in 1927. Black, orange, and red velvet folds, hanging elegantly from metal frames, were contrasted to swaths of black and lemon-yellow silk. This unrestrained response to color and fabric betrayed the hand of Reich rather than that of Mies. Many of her exposition works, however, address the spectator in ways which, though non-discursive, can only be read as political. Metaphor versus Metonymy Her politics can be seen in her installations for the 1937 World's Fair. 71. Cf. Grete Tugendhat's comments in Fritz Neumeyer, The Artless Word 372 n65.

Although Reich refused categorically to make use of scale, iconogra- phy, and anthropomorphism - as did Speer - in order to embody extra-architectural values, the referent is the same in both cases: Hit- ler's Germany. Precisely because her design refrains from promoting images of Nazi power as does Speer's, it seems more acceptable to us politically. Indeed, the transparent rationalism of all the installations that she designed for the Third Reich in a way represent Germany in masquerade. One might say that Lilly Reich's stylistic sublimations dis- guised what Speer chose to emphasize. Display, as Jacques Lacan showed in his famous lecture on Edgar Allen Poe's Purloined Letter, can be the best method of concealment.72 "It is through modes of dis- play," wrote Peter Wollen in a fine essay on the subject, "that regimes of all sorts reveal the truths they mean to conceal." 73Display is never 72.

Abstraction, unlike allegory, has always been excused, as if it were incompatible with political representation. The adversarial relation between the historicizing installations in Speer's pavilion and the modern- ist ones of Reich is purely stylistic. Since she turns her back on both the dark, regressive side of Nazi romanticism, its love of nature and the ver- nacular, as well as its overscaled classicism. Speer's tower, with its asser- tive, if not phallic, overemphasis, makes an easy target as allegory.74 So do the historicist settings inside, with their occlusion of all references to modernity, and their insistence on a seamless, unbroken tradition from the Greeks to the born-again Aryan Greeks of Nazi Germany. But though Reich attempts to desemanticize her settings, wrenching her products from the easy and illusory continuum offered by histori- cism, referentiality cannot be done away with by formal means alone - by askesis. Context here overrides the contents of the individual instal- lations and inflects all works situated within its compass by associa- tion. Whether their designs communicate through metaphor, as Speer's, or metonymy, as those of Reich, both speak to us of politics, and were situated within the same syntagmatic chain. Reich, like so many Ger- man modernists of her generation, was prone to a peculiar kind of polit- ical aphasia: an unwillingness or inability to speak outright, combined with an equally pronounced inability to remain silent.75 Abstraction, in other words, is not a form of political autism, but a muted mode of articulation. Her work of the 1930s reveals the flip side of the petrified, lithic lexikon of Speer's pavilion - the reverse sublime of Nazi mod- ernism: terror disguised as the everyday, and transcendence at its most abject, as rationalist instrumentality. One should not give undue attention to what was after all only a minor incident in the lengthy trajectory winding through the exposition. It is doubtful whether the thousands of visitors who streamed past the international pavilion and its innocuous and unadventurous textile exhibits, ever gave a second thought to politics - unless they were 74.

But the purpose of this paper is to shed light on an important aspect of modernism in its endless negotiations with ideology, and to show how modem architecture too could generate and promote, rather than simply reflect, Nazi policy and practice. We know surprisingly little about Lilly Reich's personal ideas. Her death in 1947, a troubled period in German history, her status as a woman, and her own self-effacement vis-A-vis Mies, have all con- spired to leave much of her everyday life blank. But we know just enough to bring up the issue of collaboration. Reich was no political innocent. She was a woman of remarkable intelligence, proven strength of character, and a certain degree of institutional power, both in the Werkbund and, more briefly, at the Bauhaus. Whether or not she was a party member - and this has never been established - her ideologi- cal collusion with fascism is undeniable. Only positivists still believe that one is dealing with fascism only when written proof of appurte- nance to the Nazi party actually turns up. It is not a question of submitting all German artists and architects active in the 1930s and early forties to an art-historical equivalent of the Judgment of Nuremberg. But it is imperative to hold them to political accountability. If Mies and Gropius have been held responsible for their actions and political opportunism, Reich cannot be exempted from the rule.77 It is essential to give her a place in the history of architecture to which she is entitled by virtue of her talent, and from which, like many women, she was excluded for so long. But this cannot be done at the 76.

Instead, some of the most influential writers who have worked on Reich still subscribe to the historical models that leave political ques- tions untouched, and accord hero-status to the monographic subject of their research. Sonja Giinther, for example, a well-known specialist on Reich, claimed that during the war Reich was "compulsorily assigned to serve in the 'Organization Todt', even though she had no connections with National Socialism."78 The Todt organization was responsible for building the West Wall and the U-boat shelters along the Atlantic, in addition to roads in occupied territories.79 And with regard to the instal- lations of the 1937 World's Fair in which Nazi Germany figured so prominently on French soil, Giinther had only the following to say: "This was a fine challenge for Lilly Reich, and one that she mastered with bra- vura, and in which she gave rise to a harmonic composition."80 Like- wise, in her otherwise wonderful book on the work of the Bauhaus women, Sigrid Wortmann Weltge wrote that while Mies rose steadily to fame in the United States, Reich remained in "war-torn Germany, denounced by the government, barely able to survive, but faithfully tending to the legal matters of his [Mies's] business."81 No document proving the Nazi government's denunciation of Reich has ever been published. Furthermore, when Mies chose Reich to head the Bauhaus weaving workshop in 1931 - she was a talented designer, but had no prior experience in weaving - the students boycotted Reich's classes and sided with her assistant Otti Berger, who in addition to being a superb practitioner in the craft, was an exceptionally gifted teacher.82 Weltge cites "philosophical and personal conflicts" between Reich and Berger.83 In view of the fact that Otti Berger later died at Auschwitz in 1944, one has to probe a little deeper into those "philosophical" con- flicts. At stake here is the issue of writing a history of art, and more specifically of women's art, in a way that resists blindly following tradi- tional paradigms and blanketing out what should be exposed to light. No one, of course, can reduce Reich, or Mies for that matter, to the 78. Giinther, "Lilly Reich, 1885-1947" 22. Emphasis mine. 79. Speer, Inside the Third Reich 194. 80.

One is awed by the sophistication of her work, by her courage and stamina in face of relent- less opposition to women, and by her pioneering role in the Werkbund in the area of design and display. These are remarkable achievements by any standards. But the political aspect of her career raises serious questions that cannot be brushed away. Ultimately, her elegant and reti- cent installations are the complex and ambivalent signifiers of modern- ism at its most promising and at its most troubling. Whatever the price of dissidence from established biographic and artistic models, one must work relentlessly to demystify the past, mindful of Walter Benjamin's great injunction to those who presume to write on history: "Only that historian will have the gift of fanning the spark of hope in the past who is firmly convinced that even the dead will not be safe from the enemy if he wins. And this enemy has not ceased to be victorious."84 84. Walter Benjamin, "Theses on the Philosophy of History," Illuminations, trans. Harry Zohn, ed. and intro.
