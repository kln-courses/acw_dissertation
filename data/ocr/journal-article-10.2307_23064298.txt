<plain_text><page sequence="1">9 Milton and the Pastoral Mode: The Epitaphium Damonis J. K. NEWMAN The fates of Boethius and Thomas More alike have familiarized us with the picture of the scholar and humanist on the gibbet at the behest of some implacable despot.1 John Milton (1608-74), who acclaimed the execution of Charles I in 1649, reversed these roles. Brilliantly gifted though he was, he is not therefore easily thought of as a humanist, certainly not as anything in the Erasmian mold, since he was too violent a partisan. Even claims that Milton was a "Renaissance" writer ring a little hollow. In the mid seventeenth century, over a hundred years after the deaths of Leonardo (1519) and Raphael (1520)? Nevertheless, this article argues that the poet, even if an epigone, is not to be understood apart from the Classical tradition, and to that extent he is a humanist and even—perhaps—"Renaissance" author.2 But the Classical tradition must not be interpreted in some woolly way. It offers a very precise yardstick against which deviations may be measured. Here, our concern is with the poet's epic ambition. Et quantum mihi restat ad Culiceml Lucan is supposed to have said (cf. Statius, Silvae 2. 7. 73), meaning perhaps that he had already attained brilliant success, while Virgil was still engaged on what were thought to be his opera minora—and perhaps more modestly that what he had done so far scarcely measured up to Virgil's juvenilia. If Virgil established a pattern for the development of the European literary epic that was to become paradigmatic, it is clearly important to know what it was. Virgil did not come to epic by an easy route. The Life by Donatus informs us (§19) that originally he toyed with a theme from Roman history. But he found it impossible to repeat what Ennius had done before him. He turned away—oddly, to a modern taste—to the pastoral. Mox cum res Romanas incohasset, ojfensus materia ad Bucolica transiit. He dropped these early epic plans, we also learn in one version of these remarks, because he was offensus nominum asperitate. It seems a curious reason, although since it is the reverse of what Quintilian (12. 10. 33) says about the dulcedo of 1 lo fei giubetlo a me delle mie case, says Dante's Piero delle Vigne, Inferno 13. 151. 2 English insularity should never be forgotten. Henry VII's Chapel in Westminster Abbey, completed in a version of Gothic in the year of Leonardo's death, is an amazing example.</page><page sequence="2">380 Illinois Classical Studies, XV. 2 Greek names, perhaps it is some indication that the exquisitely sensitive Roman felt again the incommensurability of the historical and the mythical already established by Aristotle in Chapter 9 of the Poetics. Odd though this may be to modern taste, there is already here a replication of the precepts of Callimachus, who at the beginning of the Aetia (Book 1, fr. 1. 3-5 Pf.) had rejected the bombastic epic of war and history, and put forward instead the example of Hesiod, but of a Hesiod who was a shepherd (Aet. 1, fir. 2.1-4): iioi|ij£vi p/fjXa ve^lovti jiap' Txviov õ^eoq üijtov 'Hai68j&lt;p Mouaecov eöjioli; öx' Tivxiaaev H.]ev oi XöiEoq yevEo[ ]ejci Kxepvriq i)8a[ To the shepherd tending his flocks by the hoofmark of the swift horse, Hesiod, when the swarm of the Muses met him ... to him the origin of Chaos ... of heel . . . water. 1. Cf. (ir^Xa ve(j.ovti, Quintus Smyrnaeus, Posthom. 12. 310. Even though scholars find that Quintus was a shepherd at Smyrna (!), all the conventional passage means is that, by this time, even the pseudo-Homeric manner has to take on the color of the Hesiodic/Callimachean if it is to enjoy literary respectability. 2. eo|J.õq here appears to compare the Muses implicitly with bees: cf.

Callimachus recommends therefore to the epic aspirant, not the versification of history to the glory of kings and great heroes which would become too common as the Hellenistic period advanced, but an epic under the patronage of Hesiod which would celebrate the origin of the world. The stories of David and Amos show that there is already something religious about a shepherd who receives a revelation, as there is about the title Alxia; witness the many aetia dotting the Pentateuch. But "Hesiod" was also a stalking-horse, covertly enabling Callimachus to introduce a novel version of the Homeric. The first "Callimachean" epic we have, the Argonautica of Apollonius Rhodius, looks therefore like a conventional heroic tale, but its conventionalism is only apparent. It follows Callimachus' own example in the Hecale of exploring the flip side of the heroic ideal, and it even shows some debt to the philosophical tradition.3 And what could Callimachus' other epic, the Galatea (frr. 378-79 Pf.), have made of the attack of the Gauls on Delphi in 279-78?—a heroic theme, but hardly handled conventionally, if we judge by its list of exotic fish. But 3 Newman, The Classical Epic Tradition (Madison 1986) 78.</page><page sequence="3">J. K. Newman 381 there was always room in this manner for the more obviously Hesiodic, even for a Theogony. This explains Callimachus' strong defence of Aratus (.Epigr. 27), the Callimachean allegiance of Lucretius' De Rerum Natura, the plaintive admissions of Georgics 2.475-84, and Book 6 of the Aeneid. For Virgil then to adopt Callimachus' view of epic was no simple change of literary plan. The programmatic sixth Eclogue allows us to eavesdrop on the young poet's problems. In the poem, three points are relevant: (a) It opens with a recusatio. This must be quoted:. cum canerem reges et proelia, Cynthius aurem vellit et admonuit: 'pastorem, Tityre, pinguis pascere oportet ovis, deductum dicere carmen.' 5 nunc ego (namque super tibi erunt qui dicere laudes, Vare, tuas cupiant et tristia condere bella) agrestem tenui meditabor harundine Musam. When I wanted to sing of kings and their battles, Apollo plucked my ear, and added this advice: "A shepherd, Tityrus, should feed fat sheep, but thin spun should be his song." For now I—since you will have a superfluity, Varus, wishing to celebrate your doughty deeds and fearful wars—I will rehearse my country music on the slender reed. 3.

(b) It outlines a theory of epic (31 ff.) so deeply dependent on metamorphosis that we seem to be hearing a sketch of Ovid's later poem rather than of anything Virgil himself actually carried out. This impression is deceptive. The Aeneid is also Virgil's Metamorphoses, a flickering, umbrageous screen (fugit indignata sub umbras) on which nothing is ever one thing long. (c) It concludes with allusions to Hesiod and Orpheus (65,70-71).</page><page sequence="4">382 Illinois Classical Studies, XV. 2 What we must not do therefore is think of the Virgil that we know as abandoning Alexandrianism for heroic poetry, since he had already abandoned such poetry (res Romanae) for the Alexandrianism of the Eclogues, and was unlikely to retrace his steps (how could he?). Virgil moved towards the Aeneid while profoundly modifying, but still in some sense remaining faithful to, these original ideas. The Georgics exorcised some of his preoccupation with the Hesiodic, and even, if we think of the concluding episode, Orphic, although the theme of heroic anthropomorphism in that poem is not yet sufficiently explored. In the Aeneid itself, metamorphosis, transposed into the tragic key, triggers a whole complex polyphony of literary allusion. Book 6 allows Anchises to develop a cosmology (724 ff.). But, although the pastoral plays some role in the epic, for example in Books 7 and 8, its thematic is never dominant. Aeneas in Libya is what Aeschylus calls a kockcx; 7iovfif|v (pastor agens telis 4.71), but he is never a love-lorn swain of Theocritean or Bionian vintage. He has too strong a sense of his own destiny for that.4 * * * As a student of the Classical tradition, the Milton of Paradise Lost naturally exemplifies the Virgilian pattern, but his is a case of what may be called arrested development. This explains the unease which has been felt with his great epic ever since its publication in 1667. The elements which, in Virgil, are presented in clear and orderly succession, in Milton, are inchoate and commingled. We expect: 1. The abandonment of the pastoral, or at the very least its assumption into and transformation within a larger epic mold. It is this progression which enables the Hesiodic/Callimachean poet to relate the story of the origin of the world from Chaos, or to launch into cosmogony of some kind (Lucretius). This is why the supreme poet of this apocalyptic tradition is Dante, but a Dante who had defended his poetic program in an eclogue5 and who had been guided precisely by—Virgil. 2. The elevation of the satiric (comic, iambic) into the vatic. This was a sequence followed in lyric by Horace, and explains the satiric elements persisting, but not undigested, in the Odes. The Augustan poets' allegiance to the vatic ideal has been explored by me elsewhere. It is evident, for example, how much this side of their achievement appealed (again) to Dante. 4 An interesting study might be made of the elevation (and ultimately therefore disappearance) of the pastoral convention in the Aeneid into that of the Homeric/Stoic noi(ir)v Xcuov. 5 La corrispondenza poetica di Dante e Giovanni del Virgilio etc., edd. G. Albini and G. B. Pighi (Bologna 1965) 40-44.</page><page sequence="5">J. K. Newman 383 3. The musical and tragic evocation of an inconstant world in which the hero, driven by destiny, pursues his stormy course towards a shadowy victory. The last word of the Aeneid, as of the penultimate line of the Eclogues, is umbras/umbrae. This epic tradition (the only genuine tradition of such poetry to survive from antiquity other than as a mere fossil) is inherently incapable of carrying a univocal message. This explains the tensions we feel in Lucretius. But in Milton we find the impossible attempt to make the Hesiodic/ Callimachean epic do duty as the purveyor of unchanging truths (to "justifie the wayes of God to men"). Since the means are incommensurate with the end, certain awkward consequences follow from the attempt to square the circle:6 1. The pastoral persists into epic, so much so that its model of ill-starred swain and inconstant nymph twists awry the Pauline theology of the Fall. 2. The satiric is pursued for its own sake (e.g. 3. 494, "the backside of the World;" cf. 10. 867 ff., on women, and below on the Barberini bees). 3. The inconstant world, which this style cannot allow itself to reflect as a mirror of the way things are, is treated at a comic level, in spite of assurances we receive (PL. 9. 5-6) that tragedy is intended.7 Here, Milton's debt to Ovid's Metamorphoses and to Nonnus' Dionysiaca must be given full value. Finer tuning picks up from the poet many inconsistent voices, as if at one moment he understood fully the polyphonic instruments he has at his disposal, and then again believed they could be played to deliver an unambiguous message. Milton is often and rightly praised for his music. But it was Thomas Mann who defined music as "systematic ambiguity" (die Zweideutigkeit als System). To understand all this, one has to begin with Milton's beginnings. Just like Virgil, he was early drawn to the pastoral and, predictably, his Lycidas (1637) contains a recusatio. But this is a refusal which sets, not the epic against lowlier poetic ambition, as in Virgil's allusion to reges et proelia, but pastoral against amorous dalliance: Alas! What boots it with uncessant care To tend the homely slighted Shepherds trade, 65 And strictly meditate the thankles Muse, Were it not better don as others use, To sport with Amaryllis in the shade, Or with&lt;e&gt; the tangles of Neceras hair? Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise 70 6 The metaphor is drawn from Paradiso 33.133-35. 7 Scholars sometimes note Milton's comedy, e.g. in Book 9, without troubling about the flagrant contradiction this implies with the "tragic" of 9. 6. This will not do for the reader who cares about theology, as Milton did.</page><page sequence="6">384 Illinois Classical Studies, XV. 2 (That last infirmity of Noble mind) To scom delights, and live laborious dayes; But the fair Guerdon when we hope to find.

Eel. 2.14: Noruiefuit satius tristes Amaryllidis iras etc. Corydon is disappointed by Alexis, and wonders if he would not have done better to stay with Amaryllis. The English poet has reversed the image, while retaining the Virgilian structure. 71. Tacitus, Hist. 4. 6: quando etiam sapientibus cupido gloriae novissima exuitur. This allusion to Helvidius Priscus seems rather to anticipate the anti-royalist sentiments of the mature politician. 77. Virgil, Eel. 6. 3-4: Cynthius aurem / vellit et admonuit. 78. Virgil had courted some sort of poetic fame (Geo. 3. 8—9), but closer to Milton is perhaps a programmatic elegy of the Roman Callimachus (Prop. 3. 3. 17-20): But, if Propertius is encouraged by Apollo to abandon epic for love elegy which will be a partner in the erotic game, the Christian poet is encouraged to pursue pastoral, rather than a life of dalliance, in hope of fame in heaven. What we expect if we follow the Virgilian analogue is that he would be enoouraged to see pastoral and the Hesiodic as a stage on the road to epic. Already the Miltonic reluctance to abandon the pastoral mode, considered as somehow superior, less corrupt, is plain. Its alternative is outside literature altogether. A fresh impulse towards the epic came when Milton visited Italy (1637-39), for which he had prepared carefully by learning Italian. This was no doubt part of the reason for his close friendship with Carolo Diodati, son of an Italian Protestant family who had migrated to London. Because of this excellent preparation, and the desire of Urban VIII to re-establish old ties non hie ulla tibi speranda est fama, Properti: mollia sunt parvis prata terenda rotis; ut tuus in scamno iactetur saepe libellus, quem legat exspectans sola puella virum.</page><page sequence="7">J. K. Newman 385 with England now that Charles I had succeeded to the throne,8 the poet was warmly welcomed. Disturbed by the trial of Galileo, scholars are not always kind to seicento Italy, although Milton himself never doubted its central importance for him. The greatness of French classicism, as it would mature later in the century, is undeniable, but, in spite of the dazzle exercised by the Sun-King, it would be as foolish to conclude that the extraordinary creative power of the Italians had waned when Milton was among them as it would be to conclude that post-Augustan Rome had no aesthetic. Sometimes the imagination soars above and beyond the written page. Milton was the contemporary of Gianlorenzo Bemini, who, in succession to Maderna, completed work on the Palazzo Barberini in 1633, and who, when later invited by Louis XIV to work on the Louvre, is reported to have answered: "Non mi parlare delle cose piccole" ("Do not trouble me with little things"). By comparison with St. Peter's, it was una cosa piccola.9 He was the contemporary of Borromini, of Guarini. In painting, the varied holdings of the Palazzo—though not all of them of course could have been seen by the poet—give some notion of the widespread use in the art of the day of chiaroscuro, and, in Caravaggio's (|1609) Narcissus, of a mirror effect pleasing to the Mannerist. In music, the rich polyphony of Palestrina (t 1594) was rivalled by new theories of operatic, dramatic monody, thought to be the revival of the Greek theatre. Monteverdi's Orfeo was produced in 1606, his L'Adone in 1639, the very year Milton visited Venice. The Barberini in fact were considerable patrons of music, and Domenico Mazzocchi's La Catena d'Adone, drawn from Marino, was produced under their auspices in 1626. Roman opera also drew upon the epics of Ariosto and Tasso. If a parallel for Milton's poetry were to be sought in contemporary art, it would be with these works and their essential staginess that he should be compared, as already his Comus and the eulogy of the London theatre in his elegia prima (27-28) suggest: Excipit hinc fessum sinuosi pompa theatri, Et vocat ad plausus garrula scena suos. Next I wend my weary way towards the pageantry of the rounded theatre, and the voices from the stage call my attention to the applause they stimulate, (tr. N. G. McCrea, adapted) 8 Especially evident in the poem of Lelio Guidiccioni, Ara Maxima Vaticana (Rome 1633) 22: Sed non ulla frequens magis, aut reverentior, Vrbi... quam . .. Anglia . . . etc. 9 Bernini was also a literary artist. In 1644, while in Rome, the English diarist John Evelyn wrote: "Bernini... gave a public opera, wherein he painted the scenes, cut the statues, invented the engines, composed the music, writ the comedy, and built the theatre"; cf. R. Wittkower, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Sculptor of the Roman Baroque (London 1955) 1.</page><page sequence="8">386 Illinois Classical Studies, XV. 2 The whole passage to v. 46 deserves study. It is here, and not in the Italian occasional poetry of the day, that we should seek poetic congeners even for his epic. "Renaissance," if provisionally acceptable as a catch-all term, is ultimately quite inadequate for this complexity, as it is, for example, for the poetry of Giambattista Marino (t 1625), whose old patron Milton met and impressed. Milton was entertained in Rome by Cardinal Francesco Barberini, the Papal nipote, whose epitaph is still seen on the right by the visitor to the sagrestia in St. Peter's,10 and the poet relates in a letter to the librarian Lucas Holsten11 that, when it was announced that he had arrived at the door of the Palazzo to attend an evening reception, the Cardinal himself went out to escort his guest to join the party, a signal honor conferred by a Prince of the Church on a Protestant foreigner barely thirty years old. Milton paid repeated tribute to an Italian singer, "Leonora," whom he heard, and one may imagine what the effect of her arias and other musica da camera amid the candlelight of some splendid, frescoed salone, perhaps that on whose ceiling we still contemplate Pietro da Cortona's glorification of the Barberini family (1633-39), surrounded by the richly garbed audience of ladies, churchmen, diplomats, poets, scholars and soldiers, might have been on the impressionable and musically gifted poet. A teatro was attached to the Barberini Palace, where productions were noted for their spectacular effects. Bernini himself designed the sets for Rossi's Erminia sul Giordano, produced there in 1633.12 Landi's pious Sant' Alessio, with libretto by Cardinal Giulio Rospigliosi, later Clement IX, was put on in 1632. The year 1634 witnessed the same author's Vita di Santa Teodora. Milton himself attended Rospigliosi's comedy Chi soffre, speri in the Barberini theatre in 1639.13 Was it here that Samson Agonistes began to take shape in his mind? Is it a libretto for a score that was never written? Elsewhere in Italy too he had enjoyed singular courtesy. The Florentine Antonio Francini wrote, for example: 10 Set up in 1682, it praises the Cardinal, inter alia, for his beneficentia in omnes / etiam remotissimorum [sic] nalionum homines. Its mistake in gender has therefore endured in this public place for over three centuries. 11 D. Masson, The Life of John Milton (London 1875) 634; cf.

The energetic efforts devoted by Urban Vm to improving the accessibility of the Vatican Library are still appreciated by the scholars who use the Baiberini Catalogue. 12 The title-page of the 1637 edition of this work is reproduced in Heritage of Music I, edd.

Oxford-New Yoik 1990) 82, where a number of relevant remarks about the Barbeiini contribution to the development of Roman opera may be studied. 13 Von Pastor (above, note 11) 953.</page><page sequence="9">J.

In proud Babel, so far as you are concerned, Jove confounded tongues to no purpose—Babel that, because of its different languages, fell to the plain as a trophy to its own defeat. Not only England, but Spain, France, Italy, Greece and Rome hear their most worthy utterance. Here, we read inter alia a tribute to Milton's knowledge of Spanish. Naples was a Hapsburg (Aragonese) domain. Has the poet's possible debt to Spanish literature ever been investigated? The epic ambition, or at least potential, must have been clearly visible to contemporaries. The Roman Ioannes Salsillus (Selvaggi) wrote: Graecia Maeonidem, iactet sibi Roma Maronem, Anglia Miltonum iactat utrique parem. Let Greece boast of Homer, and Rome of Virgil. England boasts of Milton, a match for both. What had Milton done in 1639, what was he showing to fellow poets and to the world of letters in general that could possibly justify this kind of praise? Is something lost or suppressed—something in Italian? Count I. B. Mansus, the former patron of Tasso and Marino, echoes the famous remark of Pope Gregory the Great: Ut mens, forma, decor, facies, mos, si pietas sic, Non Anglus, verum hercle Angelus ipse fores. If only your religious beliefs matched your intellect, your beauty, your grace, your appearance, your demeanor! You would be not an Angle but an Angel. Milton's interest in Italian epic is clear. He translated Dante on the Donation of Constantine. At some point he came to admire Ariosto enough to quote from him at the start of Paradise Lost (1. 16, "Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rime" = "cosa non detta in prosa mai ne in rima," O.F. 1. 10), and he stayed with Manso in Naples. A Latin poem (1639) is evidence both of the admiration he felt for the old man, and of the epic pull: O mihi si mea sors talem concedat amicum Phoebaeos decorasse viros qui tam bene norit, Si quando indigenas revocabo in carmina reges, 80 Arturumque etiam sub terris bella moventem; Aut dicam invictae sociali fcedere mensae, Magnanimos Heroas &amp; (o modo spiritus adsit) Frangam Saxonicas Britonum sub Marte phalanges.</page><page sequence="10">388 Illinois Classical Studies, XV. 2 Oh, if only my fate would grant me such a friend, who knows so well how to honor inspired poets, if ever I shall come to sing of my country's kings and Arthur who stirs war even beneath the earth; or to tell of the knightly fellowship of the unconquered Table and, if inspiration lasts, show the Saxon armies yielding to British arms. 83. modo vita supersit, Geo. 3. 10. See Epitaph. Dam. 168, quoted below. The relevant point is that this is the language of a recusatio used also by Tasso: forse un di fia, Ger. Lib. 1.4. 7. In this poem, his epic thoughts are still centred on history, on reges et proelia. Perhaps he was thinking of Tasso's two epics on the Crusades. But Tasso was also the author of the pastoral Aminta, and Manso was also the former patron of Giambattista Marino (1569-1625), once the most famous poet in Europe. Marino's Adone, dedicated to Louis XIII of France and his queen Maria de' Medici,14 tells the story of the adventures of Adonis and Venus. Adonis is a countryman, a huntsman, a denizen of the Arabian forests (1. 45-46), reminiscent, when we first meet him, of the Aeneas of the first book of Virgil's epic. But Marino adds to the Aeneid a long rhapsody about his hero's physical beauty, a rhetorical topos with a lengthy history.15 It is in these elaborate personal descriptions that we find so much anticipated of this quite un-Virgilian aspect of Milton. Adonis, who was worshipped with the offering of tcfjrcoi ("gardens," "flowerpots;" cf. P.L. 9. 440), is part of the Alexandrian pastoral (Theocritus 15, Bion, the Eiq veicpov "AScoviv), and this aspect of the story explains why it had already attracted the youthful Shakespeare. Did it attract the youthful Milton, who certainly relates the tale in Paradise Lost (1. 446 53)? Is the possibility left out of account because the structural role of the pastoral in the lead-up to European epic (or, in the case of Shakespeare, epic drama) is ignored by critics unfamiliar with the Classical tradition—and with the crucial importance of Italian literature? The invocation of Book 10 of the Adone is noteworthy: Musa tu che del Ciel per torti calli infaticabilmente il corso roti, e mentre de' volubili cristalli qual veloce, e qual pigro, accordi i moti, con armonico piede in lieti balli 5 de l'Olimpo stellante il suol percoti, onde di quel concento il suon si forma ch'e del nostra cantar misura e norma: 14 It was placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum by Urban VIE in 1627 and 1628, but this does not seem to have had much effect on its influence. For Milton, it might have been an extra attraction. 15 Cf. Call. Hecale, fr. 274 Pf.</page><page sequence="11">J. K.

(PL. 7. 1-3) But, quite apart from all this, Marino's whole habit of resuming his Italian predecessors, and notably Boccaccio, his display of erudition, his Joycean (and Callimachean) awareness of language as a calculated instrument of fantasy and make-believe, his allegorization, his intrusion beneath the surface of the poem of his own personality coloring the narrative—these features put us in the presence of Milton, even if his leisurely, Ariosto-like pace does not. In general, it seems impossible to believe that this long conjurer's mantle wrapped by the Italian around the story of the seduction of a young and handsome hero in a garden of delights by the goddess of love had no influence on Milton's ultimate epic thought and conception. While staying with Manso in Naples, Milton planned to visit Sicily. The visit never took place. It is alleged that he was forced to abandon his plans by news of the imminent Civil War in England, and there were stories that, if he lingered in Rome on his way back, the English Jesuits were 16Musae, quae pedibus magnum pulsatis Olympum, Ennius, Ann. fr. 1 Sk.</page><page sequence="12">390 Illinois Classical Studies, XV. 2 plotting to assassinate him. But he did linger in Rome, quite safely, for another two months, and then went on to visit Florence, Bologna, Ferrara, Venice, eventually to return by way of Geneva.17 Perhaps then these excuses about the imminence of the Civil War are quite false, and there was a psychological reason hindering Milton from visiting Sicily. If he had confronted the reality, he might have been less able to treat it as a country of the mind which he did not need to visit because he was trapped there already. "Why, this is hell, nor am I out of it." On his return to London, never to leave England again, he found Diodati dead. The Epitaphium Damonis which he wrote to commemorate his friend still lingers with the pastoral and because of that still reveals a preoccupation with conventional epic heroics: Ipse ego Dardanias Rutupina per aequora puppes Dicam, &amp; Pandrasidos regnum vetus Inogeniae, Brenaumque Arviragumque duces, priscumque Belinum, Et tandem Armoricos Britonum sub lege colonos; 165 Turn gravidam Arturo fatali fraude Jögemen Mendaccs vultus, assumptaque Gorlöis anna, Merlini dolus.

If life but lasts, my pipe, long forgotten by me, will hang from yonder old pine tree, or changed to native music will celebrate a British strain.

One wonders what in fact contemporary Europe would have made of Trojan ships at Richborough (Rutupium), although in 1633, displaying an extraordinary knowledge of pre-Norman history (perhaps derived from Richard White's Historiarum Britanniae Libri XI, 1597-1607)), Guidiccioni had certainly congratulated English kings on their loyalty to Rome (Ara Maxima Vaticana, p. 21): Quot veniunt uno peregrino ab litore reges, Linquentes Thulen? Hoc arsit Osuvius aestu, Cnutus, Etelstanusque, Odoardus, Cedual, Ina, Richardusque, aliique. Simul patria arva Britanno, Arva Caledonio linquuntur . .. How many kings came from a single foreign shore, abandoning Thule? This passion inspired Osuvius, Canute, Ethelstan, Edward, Cedual, Ina, Richard and their company. Briton and Scot together leave their native lands . . . It is in reading some of these Latinized British and Norse names that one begins to understand offensus nominum asperitate in the young Virgil's misgivings about historical epic. But Milton's poem also shows something else. It begins as follows: Himerides nymphae (nam vos et Daphnin &amp; Hylan, Et plorata diu meministis fata Bionis) Dicite Sicelicum Thamesina per oppida carmen. Nymphs of Himera, for you recall the tale of Daphnis and Hylas, the long wept fate of Bion, sing a song of Sicily by the towns of Thames. 1. Sicelides Nymphae, paulo maiora canamus, Eel. 4. 1. 2. et meministis enim, divae, et memorare potestis, Aen. 7. 645 (repeated by the codex Romanus at 9. 529). This form of memini docs not occur, for example, in Ovid or Lucan, making the Virgilian allusion all the more obvious. 3. Ascraeumque cano Romana per oppida carmen, Geo. 2.76. The reges et proelia in the background of line 2 are quite outflanked by the reminiscences of the pastoral and of Hesiod. There is a jarring false quantity at the end of line 1 here. Milton knew as well as any man that Hylas has a short first syllable, if for no other</page><page sequence="14">392 Illinois Classical Studies, XV. 2 reason than because the word occurs three times in two consecutive lines of the Eclogues with the right quantity.18 An easy correction would have been to write nam vos et Daphnin Hylanque. This is not open to metrical objection. But in Milton's mind Hylas has become confused with uX/n, "wood," which does have an initial longum,19 and that is evidence of a preoccupation with the "wild wood" (Marino's "Arabiche foreste") that may be traced all the way from Comus (312) to Paradise Lost (9. 910). Because the poet cannot get his relationship to the pastoral ("sylvan") straight, it even corrupts his memory of classical prosody. In Milton's proem, Daphnin and Himerides are also telling. Daphnis occurs of course both in the Eclogues and in Theocritus, but his first introduction to Greek poetry seems to be owed to Stesichorus,20 born at Mataurus in Italy, and later active at Himera in Sicily. Himerides is not in fact found in any classical Latin author.21 The poet therefore, inventing an adjective to do so, evokes an ultimately Sicilian lyric predecessor, whom Quintilian (10. 1. 62) describes as maxima bella et clarissimos canentem duces et epici carminis onera lyra sustinentem. This predecessor sang the story of the shepherd Daphnis who was struck blind for infidelity (Aelian, Var. Hist. 10. 18): PouKoXmv 5e Kaxa x-qv IiKeXiav õ Ad&lt;pvu;, Ttp(ia0r| aiixov v\)(icpri jua Kai õ)|iiX.Tioe KaXcp övxi. . . ouvGtikck; 8e ejcouioe uriSEfuou aXX.r(t jtXriaidaai a\&gt;xõv Kai ejcriJce{X,rioev oxi Jteitptonevov eaxlv aüxõv axeptiGiivai xiiq õ*|/£üx; eav napani.

Sannazaro has it right: el vetus amissi cesserat ardor Hylae (Opera omnia latine scripta, ed. Aldina [1535] 50). Giovanni Boccaccio, who certainly lived as a young man in Naples, and who in poem VI ("Alcestus"), line 148 (p. 60 in Janet SmarT's translation [New York 1987]) of his Bucolicum Carmen writes at the beginning of the hexameter Ylas Spartanus, is confusing Hylas, Hercules' squire, and Hyllus, Hercules' son and the ancestor of the Dorians. But who can believe that in scanning Hylas' name Milton followed Boccaccio rather than Virgil? However, when in this same passage Boccaccio tells the story of the two cups allegedly given to Meliboeus by Hylas, he says a great deal relevant to the two cups which Milton says he got from Manso (Ep. Dam. 181 ff.). Scholars have looked for these in his baggage rather than in the poems of Theocritus and Virgil. More on this in Bush (above, note 17) 318-19, who however overlooks this passage of Boccaccio. But if this was already a Renaissance topos? Manso after all was Neapolitan too. 19 As is shown in medieval Latin poetry, for example, where it enjoys its Aristotelian sense of "matter": Walter of Chätillon, Alexandre is 4. 182, 10. 11. 20 D. L. Page, Poetae Melici Graeci (Oxford 1967) fr. 279. 21 It is not listed, for example, by D. C. Swanson, The Names in Roman Verse (Madison 1967).</page><page sequence="15">J. K. Newman 393 When Daphnis was a shepherd in Sicily a nymph fell in love with him and became his mistress since he was so handsome. She made a covenant that he was to have no dealings with any rival, and threatened him with the doom of losing his eyesight if he should transgress. They had a mutual agreement about this. But later the king's daughter fell in love with him and in a drunken fit he broke his word and had intercourse with her. This led to the invention of pastoral song, whose theme was his loss of sight. It was Stesichorus of Himera who was the author of this genre of lyric. But more than this. Stesichorus himself was also struck blind—for impiety, and for this tale Milton needed to look no further than Plato's Phaedrus (243a) or Horace's Epodes (17.42-44): infamis Helenae Castor offensus vice fraterque magni Castoris, victi prece, adempta vati reddidere lumina ... Castor, once offended by the fate of Helen besmirched, and mighty Castor's brother, yielded to entreaty and gave back to the poet the eyes he had lost. So, although at the official, conscious level in his Epitaphium Damonis Milton speaks of his prospective epic in conventional terms, his vatic psyche knew something much more relevant to what he actually would do. Like Stesichorus, he would write an epic that was profoundly lyricized. Like Stesichorus, and like Stesichorus' pastoral hero Daphnis, he would go blind. Like Apollonius Rhodius' Hylas (Arg. 1. 1207 ff.), he would get into deep waters in a hyle (wood). And is it too cheap to add that some sort of personal confusion about sex (Mary Powell) would have something to do with it? The pastoral eventually inspires much of the imagery associated with Milton's Eve. Milton is especially poignant when comparing Eve with Proserpina, raped by the infernal Pluto while busy with her flowers. In the famous passage, the introductory negative is fraught with psychologisches Moment (14. 268-72): Not that faire field Of Erma, where Proserpin gathring flours Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie Dis Was gatherd, which cost Ceres all that pain To seek her through the world ... Negative comparisons are old, but dare one suggest that part of the heart rending effect of the negative here reflects Milton's own failure to visit (to come to terms with) Sicily when he had the chance? An epic in which "pain" is a key word is not an epic of heroic action, but of profoundly subjective disquiet. We can see how a Sicily held at mythopoeic level supplies in this way all the ingredients for a paradise that would be lost, even the fiery volcano (though Naples has its volcano too) that, already in Greek poetry, was the</page><page sequence="16">394 Illinois Classical Studies, XV. 2 everlasting punishment of a rebel against the divine will. But there is one drawback. In the pastoral, the lovelorn shepherd betrayed by the inconstant nymph is essentially innocent. In Virgil's eighth Eclogue, for example, Damon (!) loses Nysa, with whom he fell in love as she was gathering apples: Saepibus in nostris parv am te roscida mala (dux ego v ester eram) vidi cum matre legentem. Alter ab undecimo turn me iam acceperat annus, iam fragilis poteram a terra contingere ramos: 40 ut vidi, ut perii, ut me malus abstulit error! In our orchard when you were little I saw you (I was your guide) gathering dewy apples with your mother. Already my twelfth year was upon me, already I could touch the brittle branches from the ground. I saw, and was lost, carried away by desperate amazement. The English poet reshapes his Adam along Aristotelian22 and pastoral lines. He is not a scoundrel, but a man who makes a big mistake (Virgil's malus error). But how then in theology can he be responsible for the condemnation of the human race? This question is never very clearly answered in the poem, particularly not when Adam reproves Eve in language borrowed from Euripides' chaste Hippolytus and his rejection of incestuous Phaedra's advances (10. 888 ff. = Hippol. 616 ff.: cf. Medea 573-75). Daphnis went blind because of infidelity, seduced by a king's daughter when he was drunk. To that extent he was a type of Adam, unfaithful to God's command, seduced into drunkenness by Eve. Stesichorus was blinded because he was unjustly critical of Helen's morals. Are women guilty or not, and if so what are they guilty of? In Milton's own relationships with women there was perhaps a failure to look things in the face which finds its outcome in these confusions. Paradise Lost seems to show, not that disobedience, but that Eve's sexual sin is the root of all our woe.23 But this sexual emphasis is far too narrow for "'IX'liin in Bereshith 3. 13. Yet the poet knew that this narrowness was contrary to his basic theology, that the root sin was man's disobedience, not woman's weakness. In any case, the opening lines of the Epitaphium Damonis are far more relevant to Milton's epic ambition, when their subtexts are correctly explicated, than any later bluster in the poem about the heroic epic of British history never actually written. But Milton was able to appreciate this future only in a confused way because he was dodging the issue about pastoral. His confusion persisted into Paradise Lost, which is the story of the invasion of a garden by a devil disguised as a serpent who seduces the 22Mr) Siä jio^Oripiav, õXXä 8i' änapriav fieyaXr)v Poetics 1453al5-16. 23 "But still I see the tenor of Mans woe / Holds on the same, from Woman to begin" {PL. 11. 632-33). This pun ("woman" = "woe man") is as old as the Chester mystery plays of 1500, according to the OED.</page><page sequence="17">J. K. Newman 395 woman and leaves the man to follow her action in a desperate act of love. But how can an act of love be the disobedience that ruins the human race? In his French introduction to the Adone, Marino's contemporary Chapelain defends the poem as an epic of peace, rather than war, a thesis likely to be of interest to Milton,24 even though the English poet takes rather a different view of the role in peace of the heroic. Chapelain also mentions Nonnus. The debt of Milton's seduction scene to Nonnus may now be re-emphasized. Two passages are particularly relevant: üapOeve Fkpaetpoveia, a-u 8' ot&gt; ya|a.ov eupeq äXv^ai, 155 äXXa SpaKOvteioiaiv evvuxpevOTii; -õuevavoiQ, Zei)? oxe TiouXueXiKTog ä(ieiPop.evoio jipoowTiou VVJitpiOQ ijlEpÕEVTl 8p&lt;XK(OV K\)K^OV)(J.EVO&lt;; 6A.KW ei? jx^XÕv opcpvaioio 8iecm%£ jtapöevewvoi;, oeitov 8auXa yiveia • rcapiaxa|iEvcov 8e Gvpexpw 160 EVVaOEV ioOfUItCOV 7CE&lt;pOpT||iEVO(; Öp-fi-tt 8paKÖVTCÜV, Kai ya^iai? yevõeaci 8E|iai; X,ix|xa£exo Kowprii; HEi^iXOi;- ai0Epicov 8e SpaKovxeicov ijievcuwv nEpaEfpovrji; yovoevxi xõtcco icofiaivexo yaoxrip, Zaypea yeivanevri, Kepõev Ppecpoi;, 0?

(6. 155-68) Ah maiden Persephoneia! You could not find how to escape your mating! No, a dragon was your mate, when Zeus changed his face and came, rolling in many a loving coil through the dark to the corner of the maiden's chamber, and shaking his hairy chaps: he lulled to sleep as he crept the eyes of those creatures of his own shape who guarded the door. He licked the girl's form gently with wooing lips. By this marriage with the heavenly dragon, the womb of Persephone swelled with living fruit, and she bore Zagreus the horned baby, who by himself climbed upon the heavenly throne of Zeus and brandished lightning in his little hand, and newly born, lifted and carrried thunderbolts in his tender fingers, (tr. W. H. D. Rouse) 158: "Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, " P. L. 9.517. Since in Milton's epic Eve is compared with Persephone, Persephone's seduction by Zeus in the form of a serpent may have particularly worked on Milton's imagination. The child of this union is Bacchus ("Zagreus"), son of Zeus, who, as Nonnus' story progresses, is done to death by the Titans and then rises again. But later in the poem, Bacchus discovers the intoxicating juice of the grape with the help of the serpent (12. 319-28): 24 "Peace hath her victories / No less renownd than warr": To the Lord Generall Cromwell, May 1652.</page><page sequence="18">Illinois Classical Studies, XV. 2 ä|j.&lt;pi õe jiiv oKoXifjai öpaKcov Stvwrcx; &lt;xKav0an; Xapbv evppaGdmYYO^ äneXyexo VEKxap oTtcop-qq 320 Kai P^oa-upaiq -yevveaai noxöv Bax^eiov ä(ieM;a&lt;; Poxpucx; oivcoGevcoi; eiciotd^cov 7to|j.a X.ai^ä jcoppvperi paöamYYi 8paK&lt;ov &lt;poivi^ev -üitfivriv.

A serpent twisted his curving backbone about the tree, and sucked a strong draught of nectar trickling from the fruit; when he milked the Bacchic potation with his ugly jaws, dripping the draught of the vine onto his throat, the creature reddened his beard with purple drops.

(Rouse, adapted) 327: "Back to the Thicket slunk / The guiltie Serpent," P. L. 9. 784-85. Dionysus then makes wine, and the satyrs get drunk on it. Here is the parallel with Eve's act in pagan mythology. The ancient motif of the serpent coiled around the tree, found in the classical world, for example, in a bronze fountain from the gymnasium at Herculaneum (Cardo V) showing a five-headed snake wound around a tree trunk, is still visible on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. In general, it may be urged that no proper understanding of Milton's epic is possible without a detailed study of the Dionysiaca (reprinted 1569, 1606). But can there be a Dionysiaca which justifies God's ways to man? At the start of Book 7, Milton had banished "the barbarous dissonance / Of Bacchus and his Revellers" (32-33), that is to say, the komos he had tried to assimilate in his early masque of that name. But, like all these suppressed ghosts, did das Verdrängte then return in unassimilated form to haunt him? Tristi fummo ne l' aere dolce . . . (Inferno 7. 121-22). The unassimilated satiric and comic ("carnival") to which reference has been made, caused by the inability consistently to move beyond the pastoral mode into epic, is shown by the fact that even the bees, with which in PL. 1.768 ff. the devils are compared, are a hit at the Barberini device,25 sculpted repeatedly on Bernini's canopy in St. Peter's, the model for Milton's Pandaemonium.26 In Milton, we seem really to be on the track of a negative satirist rather than a vates. Dante, who made no bones about calling his own 25 A book of poems dedicated to Urban VIII is entitled Apes Romanae, and is called by Masson "450 bees of the Barberini" (above, note 11) 630. 26 Paricer (above, note 17) 172.

Bees had been for Callimachus a positive symbol. Milton, who read Apollonius' Argonautica with his English pupils, might have written a different kind of epic. He knew Italian well enough to compose poetry in it, and it is those poems that show a more humane side to his genius, less censorious of women, of popish trumpery, less right about everything. If only he had settled down in Naples with Manso! But these might-have-beens, like the closer study of the Italian poems, are matter for another time.
