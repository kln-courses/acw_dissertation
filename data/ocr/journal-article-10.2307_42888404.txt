In order to specify how the boundaries between the voices, which we label as logos and mythos, are created, maintained and reproduced, this article studies the discursive formulation of the op-ed articles as instances of legitimation discourse at three levels: (i) pragmatic, various strategies of (de)legitimation of controversial actions; (ii) semantic, the way discourse processes the representation of events in the experiential world into ideological packages congruent with the audience demand; and (iii) sociocultural and political, the way each newspaper self-legitimates its orientation to the world and delegitimates alternative discourses. Taking rationality as a reference point in understanding the difference between the coding orientations, a detailed examination of discursive structures is also presented in order to test the newspapers' compliance with the critical standard of reasonableness. KKY words: coding orientations, (de)legitimation strategies, field, habitus, logos, mythos, rationality, voice Introduction The major concern of this article is to show how media discourse has become the site of hegemonic struggle in relation to social and cultural change in Turkey. The tension between modernity and political Islam, which leads members of the modern lifeworld into ontological insecurity, has erupted in the shifting discursive configuration of 'habituses' (Bourdieu, 1991), or how a socially positioned agent 'looks' in terms of bodily dispositions and 'voice' (Bernstein, 1990), or what</page><page sequence="2">818 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) discourses or genres are available for each agent. Both the articulation of agents with distinct voices and habituses are concerned with questions of the division of the social space into fields (in Bourdieu's terminology) and the subject positions and forms of consciousness produced and reproduced through that division. The contestation of the secular unitary public space and the domain of symbolic con- trol, founded by the emergence of the Republic of Turkey as a nation-state, which finds its ethos in a rational scientific worldview, the democratic order and the ascendance of the secular over the sacred, is the result of a counter-hegemonic project for the constitution of a new political agenda centred on the desire to restore a theocratic state with its attendant legal creed Sheria. Endeavours to rein- state Sheria configure as the dissolution of the public-private divide in favour of the absolute sovereignty of God and religious creeds in all domains of political and social life. This article examines the (de)legitimation strategies in confrontational dis- courses within the broader framework of critical discourse analysis, which treats discourse as social practice (Fairclough, 1989, 1992; Fairclough and Wodak, 1997; Van Dijk, 1993, 1998). More specifically, this article aims to show how dif- ferences in ideological orientations that also manifest themselves in sociocultural practices correlate with two different semantic styles in op-ed articles, which we prefer to label as logos and mythos orientations because of their epistemological orientations to scientific and religious knowledge respectively. We achieve our objective by relating Bourdieu's (1991) concepts of 'field' and 'habitus' to Bernstein's concept of Voice', as suggested by Chouliaraki and Fairclough (1999). Bourdieu's theory conceptualizes the social as doubly inscribed in places (fields) and bodies (habituses) so that there may be tension when habituses are not well synchronized with fields in circumstances of rapid social change. His theory can be translated into Bernstein's concept of 'voice', or 'habitual ways of saying', which can be seen as a 'linguistic habitus' (Chouliaraki and Fairclough, 1999: 1 1 7). We locate this shifting articulation of practices of production within the relative permanence of the social, e.g. the nexus of cultural and societal action orien- tations over-determined by rationality. In the analysis of rationality as the socio- cultural matrix of individual action orientations of the subjects positioned in the Turkish modernity project, Habermas' (1987) account of modernity as a process of rationalization, and particularly his concept of 'lifeworld', serve as a connection between abstract structures of consciousness and concrete events. 'The cultural and historical variability of lifeworld structures' (Habermas, 1987), which constitutes a necessary frame for social interaction helps account for the shifting articulation of symbolic/discursive practices. This analytical framework allows us to work within CDA and usefully account for the complex dialectical interaction between the social and the discursive in the context of rapid social change in Turkey. Problem Turkish modernization, or westernization, founded on the Utopian content of</page><page sequence="3">Yagciogju and Ay§en Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 819 Enlightenment informed by reason and secularism, has always been faulted for dissolving traditional ways of life without salvaging their communicative sub- stance. Although Islam as an order of discourse that enabled and constrained action in all spheres of life was abandoned when the Turkish Republic was founded in 1923, it continued to prevail as a normative system relegated to the private sphere. The recent comeback of political Islam, which has flared up in areas of cultural reproduction, of social integration and of socialization, refers to its reassertion as a political ideology that legitimizes political action and the rein- stitution of Islamic legal code, the Sheria (Tibi, 1983). Changing forms of social solidarity have led to the symptoms of social disintegration. As a result, Turkish society can no longer be conceived as 'a system that [satisfies] the conditions of maintenance of sociocultural lifeworlds' or 'as a systemically stabilized nexus of action of socially integrated groups' (Habermas, 1987). The increasing coloniza- tion of reason as the ever-present horizon of the lifeworld, effected by the institu- tionalization of the nation-state by 'dogma' and 'superstition', is perceived as an ontological threat, i.e. 'going back to the middle ages'. These disturbances in the reproduction processes find their expression in cor- responding crisis manifestations, such as loss of meaning, withdrawal of legiti- mation, confusion of orientations, anomie and the destabilization of collective identities; i.e. the disturbances when communicative action loses its capacity to serve as a suitable medium for the symbolic reproduction of the lifeworld (Habermas, 1987). What leads us as the members of the modern lifeworld into ontological insecu- rity is the tendency for the shifting articulation of agents and habituses, together with counter-hegemonic discourses, to constitute networks of which they become moments in ways that dislocate rational action orientations. Hence, the recent rearticulation of Islamist actors with traditional forms of attire and bodily dispositions - marked as the emblem of backwardness by the founding father Mustafa Kemal and the elite of the Republic - constitutes one facet of the con- frontation between the Republicans and the Sheriatists, whereas the articulation of these actors with 'voices' that cannot be called 'rational' by the implicit stan- dards of today constitutes the other. Indeed, for members of the rational lifeworld, the discourse of political Islam, more specifically the discourse of The Akit in this article, represents 'mere' or 'empty' words - an affect produced by an absence of 'internalization'. Using Harvey's concept of 'internalization' (1996), we maintain that the feeling arises from a divorce between the rational action orientations expected from the subjects of the Republic in all domains of life and the ways in which Islamist writers discursively construct their actions, which mediate an ori- entation toward mythos. For Harvey (1996; see also Chouliaraki and Fairclough, 1999), each moment of the social, which constitutes of other moments such as social relations, power, material practices, beliefs/values/desires and institu- tions/rituals, 'internalizes' the others without being reducible to them. This brings us to the twofold task of this article: (i) to specify the coding orientations of distinct 'voices', which correlate with differences in social membership and</page><page sequence="4">820 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) habituses; and (ii) given the interest in social change, to specify how the bound- aries between 'voices', which we label as logos and mythos, are created, main- tained and reproduced. Because the disturbances in the reproduction processes emanate from the legit- imation crisis of the Turkish republic we concentrate on the op-ed articles that thematize the validity claims about the (de)legitimation of the Republic which appeared at a moment of crisis. As what we wish to stress in this article is the point that 'struggles are enacted in the course of communicative interaction and that communicative interaction is the discursive facet of the constitution and reconstitution of the social, including the structuring of positions and relations between social fields' (Chouliaraki and Fairclough, 1999: 104), we shall concen- trate on the (de)legitimation strategies employed by the daily newspapers as the domain in which we can investigate rational action orientations and deviations from it. During the course of achieving our objective, following Habermas (1973), we as scholars observe two dimensions: our analysis is self-reflective and takes into consideration the historical life-context in which the linguistic and social interactions take place. As part of the system we analyse, shaped by the interests of the Turkish Republic, we adopt a self-reflective attitude in that we recognize that the need for rationality as the 'ever-present horizon' of our daily life is not ahistorical. These two constitutive premises locate our analysis within the CDA paradigm (see Menz, 1989 for 'critical science'). Database As our database we concentrate on 28 op-ed articles selected from two influential Turkish daily newspapers between 19 February and 12 March 1997. These newspapers represent diametrically opposed ideological coding orientations. The Cumhuriyet ( The Republic ) was established in 1924, one year after the foundation of the Turkish Republic and has supported the core values of the nation-state ever since. As far as its target readership is concerned, The Cumhuriyet is at the top of all educational categories, such as university-educated persons and the secular elite. The Akit (The Covenant ), however, is a relatively recent newspaper founded in 1993 that articulates a desire to recover the past, namely the Islamic way of life. It uses highly provocative language detrimental to the values of the Republic. The target readership is fundamentalists whose socioeconomic base is constituted by some capitalist industrialists, middle class and lower income small-scale busi- nessmen who are not usually university educated. These newspapers represent two distinct social voices, in which an agent's voice is conceived as a particular instantiation of conceptualizing the world in a specific way. Hence, we do not think that the discourses under examination can be understood simply as divergent accounts of the same 'reality'. We maintain that the difference lies in the epistemological orientation of two social groups. As The Cumhuriyet has been the defender of cultural rationalization emanating from the permeation of scientific knowledge and its emancipatory effect on traditional</page><page sequence="5">Yagciogju and Ay§en Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 821 habits of thought and social rationalization embodied in the eradication of the political authority of the divine will and the establishment of the republican form of government so that political power would reflect the will of the people, we believe that the coding orientations of the newspaper mediate an orientation toward the conception of logos. In terms of knowing the world, logos is defined by the Stoics as an active rational and spiritual principle that permeated all reality. Apart from its religious underpinnings, it came to refer to the rational, practical, pragmatic and scientific way to truth. It deals with the facts, looking to the future to discover what is new. The Akit , in contrast, has been the extreme voice of political Islam, which calls for political action and legitimizes bloodshed on the grounds that the Republic has illegitimately grasped political authority from Allah. As the op-ed articles under consideration constantly draw on the Koran as the source of authority and ignore contrary reasons to reply to validity claims thematized in the public sphere, we believe that it mediates orientations toward the conception of mythos. Mythos refers to the language of myth that anything divine, eternal and constant can be understood. It looks to the past to uncover meaning. Because we take rationality as a reference point in understanding the differ- ence between the coding orientations labelled as logos and mythos, we take op-ed articles as our objects of inquiry, which thematize contested validity claims and attempt to vindicate or criticize them through argumentative moves. The main objective of the op-ed article is to motivate readers to accept the validity claim in question through the soundness of reasons connected in a systematic way. Therefore, they provide a suitable medium for the analysis of rationality. Habermas, quotes from Neuendorff (1975) to explicate how the rationality of speaking and acting agents can be assessed: Anyone participating in argument shows his rationality or lack of it by the manner in which he handles and responds to the offering of reasons for or against claims. If he is 'open to argument' he will either acknowledge the force of those reasons or seek to reply to them, and either way he will deal with them in a 'rational' manner. If he is 'deaf to argument' by contrast, he may either ignore contrary reasons or reply to them with dogmatic assertions, and either way he fails to deal with the issues 'ration- ally'. Quoted in Habermas, 1987: 18 In the light of the above quotation, we can now specify more clearly what it is that irritates us as members of the discursive practices of the Republic about the discourse of The Akit. Its discourse is 'deaf to argument' and it replies to contrary reasons with 'dogmatic assertion'. What we need to investigate is the linguistic base that gives rise to these feelings. Theoretical background As our engagement in explanatory critique stems from a recognition of discourse</page><page sequence="6">822 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) as one moment in the social process, and of changes in discourse as being capable of opening new social possibilities, we need to apply a dialectical logic between social practices and the theories about them, concerned with discerning the potential for social change located in the public sphere. Bourdieu (1991) and Bernstein (1990) provide this link because they both theorize language as a social practice within the dialectic relation between structure and agency, foreground- ing symbolic structures and meaning in social reproduction and change. Whereas Bourdieu sees the structuring of complex contemporary societies in terms of social 'fields', Bernstein focuses on a particular field, education, concep- tualized as a broad field of 'pedagogy', which includes other fields (Chouliaraki and Fairclough, 1999). Bourdieu construes a field as a network of positions defined by a particular dis- tribution of capital. Capital, which endows the space with its own logic, is differ- entially distributed among the people who occupy the subject positions within the particular network, constraining the way they act. All forms of capital, which may be economic, social or cultural, can be converted to 'symbolic capital'. 'Linguistic capital' is the power conferred upon a particular linguistic form, style or dialect associated with the legitimacy and prestige of particular social positions. Thus, differences of capital between different positions are differences of power. However, the volume and capital composition with which a subject is endowed may change over time, resulting in the acquisition of power. Thus, fields are not static struc- tures that leave no space for change in subjects' positions, but are sites of strug- gle during which they can be restructured (Chouliaraki and Fairclough, 1999). Bourdieu's concept of habitus can be translated into Bernstein's concept of 'voice', or 'habitual ways of saying', which can be seen as a 'linguistic habitus' (Chouliaraki and Fairclough, 1999: 117). Like certain bodily dispositions and dress codes of agents positioned in the field in which they operate, and their pos- itions within those fields, 'voice' is manifested in dispositions to use language in particular ways. In other words, like in an order of discourse, agents are differen- tially endowed with a particular configuration of discourses and genres, depend- ing on their different social trajectories. Thus, like any socially positioned subject, the agent obeys the principles of power and control specific to the practice in which s/he participates. So does the discursive configuration of 'voice' (Chouliaraki and Fairclough, 1999). Bernstein defines code as a culturally determined positioning device which pos- itions subjects according to dominant and dominated forms of communication. Hence, ideology is constituted through and in such positioning. A code is a regu- latory principle that is tacitly acquired. It selects and integrates relevant mean- ings, forms of their realization and evoking contexts. The concept of code cannot be conceived separate from the concepts of legitimate and illegitimate communi- cation because it operates on a presupposition of hierarchy which is instrumen- tal in distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant meanings, appropriate and inappropriate or legitimate and illegitimate forms of realization, and finally legit- imate and illegitimate contexts.</page><page sequence="7">Yagcioghi and Ay§en Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 823 According to Bernstein (1990), code is a regulator of relationships between contexts, and through those relationships a regulator of relationships within contexts. The relations between contexts create the boundary markers whereby specific contexts are distinguished by their specialized meaning and realizations. A code regulates these relationships by two sets of rules: recognition rules and realization rules. Recognition rules are instrumental in distinguishing what cre- ates the speciality that constitutes a context, thus marking the relationships between contexts. Realization rules create the means whereby the creation and production of specialized relationships within that context is regulated. 'Orientations to meanings' refer to privileged and privileging referential relations. 'Privileged' refers to the priority of meanings within a context. 'Privileging' refers to the power conferred upon the speaker as a consequence of the selected meanings. Hence, Bernstein posits that relationships between con- texts arise out of classificatory principles regulating communication within the context (1990: 16). For Bernstein, specialized categories necessarily entail specialized Voices'. The voice of a social category is constructed by the degree of specialization of the dis- cursive rules regulating and legitimazing the form of communication. 'If cat- egories of either agents are specialised then each category necessarily has its own specific identity and its own specific boundaries' (Bernstein, 1990: 23). The insu- lation between categories creates a space in which a category can become specific. 'If a category wishes to increase its specificity, it has to appropriate the means to produce the necessary insulation that is the prior condition to its appropriating specificity' (Bernstein, 1990: 23). Thus, the degree of insulation is a crucial regu- lator of the relations between categories and the specificity of their 'voices'. For Bernstein, the locus of orientations to meanings is the social division of labour. We, however, utilize his theory to explicate relations of subordination between two distinct ideological orientations to conceptualizing the world. Analysis of the conjuncture In this section, we offer a specification of the configuration of practices within which the confrontational discourses in focus were located. By doing this, we hope to represent a particular path through the network of social practices which constitutes the current social structure in Turkey. We move from the more immediate conjecture within which the op-ed articles were located, to the more extended conjecture of the modernity project in tandem with the constitution of the Republic as a nation-state. To get a better sense of how the op-ed articles figure in the struggle between the adherents of modernity and those of Sheria we, following Chouliaraki and Fairclough (1999), identify three main moments of social practice, namely the social relations and processes (social relations, power, institutions), mental phenomena (beliefs, values, desires) and discourse.</page><page sequence="8">824 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) THE IMMEDIATE CONJUNCTURE The op-ed articles appeared in the wake of the National Security Council's meet- ing of 28 February 1997. The National Security Council is a constitutional insti- tution that consists of the President, representatives of the government and the military forces. Presided by the President, the Prime Minister and ministers involved in issues of national security exchange strategic information with the Chief of Staff and chief commanders of air, navy and land forces. The council convenes each month, after which a press announcement is released. The meeting of 28 February 1997 is considered historic because the Turkish military forces reversed the order of priority of threats directed against the Republic and announced that the escalating retrogressive endeavours of the fun- damentalist Islamic factions constituted the major threat. For the first time in the history of the Republic, an internal threat was considered to have priority over external threats. It was feared that, if the Islamic rebellion took place, the assault on the secular and democratic nation-state would be fierce, total and indiscrimi- nate. The announcement had unprecedented repercussions on political and social life in the country. The nation was divided into two camps through a system of paratactical equivalences: the ideal of the Republic and secularism representing the identity of the nation-state and Islamic cultural practices incarnating evil, the second being the negative reverse of the first. The existence of not one, but two, societies was acknowledged and a number of precautions advised to the members of the government to halt the imminent danger. Most significant among them, was the need to take immediate action to extend the duration of primary edu- cation (Kongar, 1998), which would be conducive to the formation of secular subjects and the enforcement of the 1925 dress code in universities and institu- tions, banishing any signification of religious identity from the public sphere. Thus, educational institutions were targeted as the domain in which the unity of 'one nation' was contested and therefore, the primary field to be protected from the elements that signified evil. The announcement was also historic because it implicated the members of the coalition government consisting of the Right Way Party and the Welfare Party in the retrogressive advances. Some circles argued that the announcement was in fact a coup d'état (Kongar, 1998: 283) operated within constitutional limits. Later the Welfare Party was closed down because of charges of secretly support- ing Islamic factions in challenging the orders of discourse of the secular and modern nation-state. Indeed the events that led up to the historic announcement of 28 February can be seen as moments in a counter-hegemonic and dissident discourse that erupted to challenge the hegemonic orders of discourse (see Harvey, 1996). First, inviting eminent religious persons to the Prime Minister's residence for a supper party to break their fasting was considered as a major transgression of the orders of dis- course which constrain what is permissible in the place signifying the absolute power of the people against that of the divine will. Second, the desire of Islamist</page><page sequence="9">Yagcioglu and Ayçen Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 825 women students to enter educational premises veiled, or the so-called headscarf dispute, was also regarded as an invasion of the public sphere by religious material and symbolic resources that have been relegated to the private sphere since the constitution of the Republic in 1923. Third, the invitation to the ambas- sador of Iran, by Mayor of Sincan, a member of the Welfare Party, to hold a rally 'Kudiis Gecesť (The Night of Jerusalem), in which Sheria was celebrated as the only possible order. The following day, tanks rolled in the streets of Sincan, which was interpreted as a 'warning' from the army. Thus, in so far as these diverse events are over-determined in their desire to restore the authority of the divine will over that of the people, they constitute a network of moments as internaliz- ing each other. All these counter-hegemonic practices indicate that the relative permanence of practices that constitute habitual ways of acting tied to the secularization of the public sphere since 1923 has become a site of shifting dynamics of power and therefore a field to be defended. The Secularist women's march to protest against these assaults on sets of conventions that divide, demarcate and structure the social world into different spheres of action according to the social project of modernity, can be considered in a relationship of over-determination with the announcement of 28 February, and thus with the military forces as wardens of the secular state. knowledge/power and the cultural and societal rationalization OF THE TURKISH NATION-STATE In order to understand how 'discourse internalises in some sense everything that occurs in other moments' (Harvey, 1996) of social life, we now move to the more extended conjuncture of the emergence of the Turkish nation-state and the role of rational thinking in the construction of the new subject. In this section, we show that there are compelling reasons for us to treat the historically contingent question of the Turkish modernity experience and the question of the causes and side effects of secularism from the perspectives of rational action, rational con- duct of life and rationalized worldviews. Habermas (1987) argues that in order to account for the cultural and societal rationalization of a society in the course of modernization, one must take into consideration the features of evolution that 'must be understood as advances in different types of "knowledge"' (p. 67). Indeed, the foundation of the Turkish Republic as an experience in modernization from above (Keyder, 1997; Kongar, 1998) constitutes an epistemological break, resulting in the progressive eradica- tion of traditional habits of thought in favour of rational thinking, which included transformation of the military, political and economic structures as well. What counts as knowledge in a society cannot be separated from the question of power. The Foucauldian term bio-power refers to the conception of power, which 'brought life and its mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculations and made knowledge/power an agent of transformation of life' (1981: 143). Given the power to define what constitutes knowledge, the interest of Kemal and the</page><page sequence="10">826 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) Secularist elite was directed at the creation of formal conditions of rationality in knowing, in reaching understanding through language and in acting, both in everyday contexts and the organization of discourse. Thus, the orientation toward meanings in the discourse of modernity privileged rationality. Kemal's speeches on certain occasions emphasized the importance of scientific knowledge as opposed to religious knowledge. The following excerpts provide valuable insights in to how all forms of life that pertain to the Enlightenment belief in scientific knowledge is legitimated, whereas all those pertaining to reli- gious knowledge is illegitimated. On 27 October 1922, he was addressing a group of teachers in Bursa immedi- ately following the War of Independence fought against British, Italian, French and Greek forces of occupation as follows: Ladies and gentlemen, do you know what lies at the heart of victory we won over the enemy who trampled with his filthy feet the most prosperous, the loveliest, the most beautiful parts of our country for over three and a half years? It is the adoption of the precepts and mandates of science and knowledge as guide in the conduct of military affairs. ... In the political and social life of the country and in the mental and intel- lectual life of our nation as well, our guide is going to be science and knowledge. (Our own emphasis, quoted in Sayih 1985: 77-8) Thus, Kemal was proposing a new configuration of knowledge conducive for the emergence of individual liberty and historical progress grounded in science by negating all forms of superstition, ignorance and repression encapsulated in the idea of religion. The hegemonic struggle between scientific knowledge and religious knowledge becomes most apparent in the definition of 'civilization'. The main objective of the Turkish modernity experience was to 'reach the level of contemporary civi- lization'. The term 'civilization' was defined essentially by reference to the West and its cultural model that has claims for universality. In the Turkish imagin- ation, the concept of civilization refers to that which is constantly in motion, moving forward, encompassing the idea of progress. Therefore, it refers not only to a given state of development, but also to an ideal to be attained, and it is the antithesis of barbarism (Göle, 1996). In 1925, Mustafa Kemal wrote of civiliza- tion as a natural force capable of destroying those who do not partake in its pro- cesses (quoted in Kasaba, 1997: 26): It is futile to try to resist the thunderous advance of civilisation, for it has no pity on those who are ignorant or rebellious. The sublime force of civilisation pierces moun- tains, crosses the skies, enlightens and explores everything from the smallest particle of dust to stars. . . . When faced with this, those nations who try to follow the super- stitions of the middle ages are condemned to be destroyed or at least to become enslaved and debased. Obviously, Kemal gives a transcendental twist to the question of 'civilization' and reflects on the fact that those who behave rationally (so that they are not destroyed or enslaved) must themselves presuppose an objective world in which 'civilization' resides and orient themselves to it as 'essentially constant' and 'incorrigible'.</page><page sequence="11">Yagcioglu and Ayçen Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 827 Thus this speech provides an example of what Mel vin Pollner calls, with reference to Alfred Schutz, 'mundane reasoning' (quoted in Habermas, 1984: 13). That a community orients itself to the world as essentially constant, as one which is known and knowable in common with others, provides that community with war- rantable grounds for asking questions of a particular sort of which the prototypical representative is: 'How come, he sees it and you do not?' On this model of reasoning, which Habermas (1984) discusses as a 'phenomeno- logical' instance of the cognitivist version of rationality defined exclusively with reference to employment of descriptive knowledge, the conditions of validity of symbolic expressions refer to a background knowledge intersubjectively shared by the communication community. Every disagreement presents a challenge to this lifeworld background. Thus, the recent reassertion of political Islam and the 'inability' of subjects positioned in their discursive practices to see the world as 'known and knowable in common' with the secularists create anomie and distur- bances. PEOPLE AS THE SOURCE OF POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND SECULARISM The embodiment of reason in the political realm meant the constitution of the republican form of government. It paved the way for the rationalization of politi- cal power through the medium of public discussion, whereby the general will and common interests could be reflected (see Habermas, 1987). It guaranteed that the legitimate exercise of political authority was a secular question rather than a reli- gious one and that the consent of the governed should play an important role in such considerations. Secularism, which was crucial for theorizing the modern nation-state, regu- lated social, political and legal domains as devoid of religious considerations. Like all other Kemalist principles, it was instrumental in the abolition of the absolutist Imperial State of the Ottomans as the primary locus of political right. According to Ate§ (1994: 142), the most significant feature of secularism is that it asserts the primacy of the individual as the ultimate bearer of political rights. Apart from guaranteeing civil liberties and an institutionally secured public sphere in the Turkish context, it played a central role in regulating the line of demarcation between religion and the civil life of the nation. Therefore, it is only natural that secularism became the antithesis of Sheria for the Islamist actors who oppose the anthropocentric, liberal and progressive culture of the Republic with the vision of a theocentric, authoritarian and static culture. THE DISSOLUTION OF GENDERED PUBLIC-PRIVATE DOMAIN RELATIONS The production of the public sphere as a field of mundane affairs played a central role in establishing new collective identities in the Republic. According to Göle (1996, 1999), Kemalist reforms aimed at the public visibility of women and the mixing of sexes brought about a radical change in the relations of the public-pri- vate domain. The emergence of women from the confinement of the mahrem</page><page sequence="12">828 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) spaces of the domestic meant the shifting of boundaries delineated by the Islamic code in terms of mahrem/namahrem. The demarcation between the mahrem (pri- vate) spaces and the namahrem (non-private) spaces, i.e. the interior and the exterior of the house, and the regulatory principles of behaviour dictated by these domains and the positioning of gendered subjects were profoundly affected as a consequence of the changes brought about by the social and cultural rationaliz- ation process. Women's corporeal visibility in the public domain embodied the dissolution of the gendered construct of Islamic social spaces. This entailed the illegitimacy of the Islamic morality precepts based on the modesty and invisibil- ity of women. The removal of the veil by women (1924 onwards), the establish- ment of compensatory coeducation for boys and girls (1924), the granting of political rights, such as eligibility for public offices and women's suffrage (1934), and finally the abolition of Sheria, the Islamic law and the subsequent adoption of the Swiss Civil Code (1926), were all measures taken to guarantee the public visi- bility of women in the modern Turkish nation-state (1996: 14). Göle observes that it is not mere coincidence that political Islam has chosen these symbolic realms in narrating its ideological struggle (1996: 35). As a result, the Islamic dichotomy between male/female spaces was shifted to that between the 'civi- lized'/'uncivilized' of the young nation-state. HABITUS OF THE CIVILIZED As much as anything else, the shift to modernity from the social practices of a society deeply embedded in Islamic culture inevitably gave rise to cultural inno- vations and a suppression of difference. The semiotic processes that best signified this withdrawal from the traditional belief systems constantly evoked the binary oppositions of 'civilized'/'uncivilized', 'progressivist'/'reactionary'. Attire, for example, for both women and men, represented the formal elements of change envisioned by the modernization project. Fez, in Kemal's own words, 'sat on the heads of the nation as an emblem of ignorance, negligence and fanaticism and hatred of progress and civilisation' (quoted in Kasaba, 1997: 25). Hence, the introduction of a western style dress code in 1925 configures as an instance of coercive technologies discussed by Mouzelis (1990). Conformity to the 'civilized way of life' was among the requirements for a distinct social status and privilege. The symbolic resources of surveillance to forge new orders of discourse also dele- gitimated the strict segregation of sexes in terms of occupational roles. Among the symbolic resources of surveillance were photographs of women unveiled, of women in athletic competitions, of female pilots and professionals and photo- graphs of men and women dancing together. More than anything else, the dichotomy between 'civilized' and 'uncivilized' was inscribed on the female body. Veiling, which marked the female body as mahrem, that is, as a forbidden sphere for the male gaze except the spouse, separ- ated women from 'civilized human beings'. As long as she remained behind the veil, she would never be able to 'qualify as an independent social being' (Asim 1989, quoted in Göle, 1996: 38). So, the abandonment of the veil was</page><page sequence="13">Yagcioglu and Ayçen Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 829 regarded as the emblem of their participation in the social life of civilized human beings. TURBAN AND ITS SOCIAL MEANINGS The continued attempts by Islamist women university students to enter campuses in their veils, or turbans , since 1983 reveals the tension between habituses and places, which is in turn grounded in the tension between modernism and politi- cal Islam. Göle (1996) points out that, paradoxically, women students who owe their visibility and social recognition to their access to secular education, empower themselves through their appropriation of a new 'symbolic capital' (Bourdieu) signified by the turban. As new political actors, women in their tur- bans speak for radical Islam, which articulates a desire for the transformation of society and of the world as an alternative lifestyle to that of the West. The appropriation of turban by Islamist women signifies the transgressive nature of the political Islam and its intervention in the public space that is organ- ized by social practices which naturalize the Kemalist ideology and the power dynamics that uphold it. Simultaneously, it evokes a series of binary oppositions grounded on the power dynamics of East and West, traditionalism and moder- nity, men and women (Göle, 1996, 1997). LEGITIMATE AND ILLEGITIMATE 'VOICES' Through our analysis of the macro social domain, we have tried to identify the specific grammar of the symbolic control exercised by the secular state, which legitimates the articulation of rationalization with embodied subjectivities, sup- pressing difference in the public domain. We now need to concentrate on the micro-level again, that is what 'voices', or particular configuration of discourses are available for the agents that are differentially endowed with the symbolic cap- ital of action orientations. If, according to Bernstein, for any socially positioned subject these configuration of Voices' obey the principles of power and control specific to the field in which s/he participates, then the privileged subject's coding orientation should obey the principles of rationalization seen as 'universal' mode of consciousness. Thus, one facet of the contestation over the control of the sym- bolic field configures as the politics of discourse of the Sheriatists centred upon the disruption of the universal code of rationalism. Given the interest in social change, our analysis in the following section will emphasize how the boundaries between the two coding orientations correlate with different subjectivities and how the flows of discourse are shifting as the manifestation of processes of social change in discourse. Our orientation is geared toward specifying relations within so that we can asses the degree of insulation between categories that we label as logos and mythos (Figure 1).</page><page sequence="14">830 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) Republic/Nation-state I Public-private domain relations Over-determination Conflict Conflict Legitimate: ^ Illegitimate: Rule of Law Rule of Sheria Distribution of Principles of Distribution of Principles of power: control: power: control: People Secularism Allah Koran Code: Logos Code: Mythos I t Ideology: Kemalist Ideology: Political islam t I Subject Subject ' $ Habitus: Modern Habitus: Traditional figure 1. Articulation of agents with distinct coding orientations and habituses (adapted from Bernstein, 1990) Discursive formulation of op-ed articles as instances of legitimation In our analysis of the sociocultural and political context in Turkey, we have tried to describe how loss of identification with the Secularist nation-state and 'the institutional practices which are partially constituted by shared concepts and beliefs' based on the Enlightenment ideal led to the 'erosion of institutional legit- imacy and the indeterminacy of institutional norms' (Connolly, 1987: 62), which culminated in the announcement of 28 February 1997. As in our case, the natural outcome of such a crisis is the proliferation of acts of (de)legitimation, which are largely discursive and therefore call for a detailed discursive analysis (Rojo and Van Dijk, 1997). In this article we concentrate on the discursive aspects of op-ed articles as instances of the ensuing (de)legitimation discourses in which the Kemalist actors/writers of The Cumhuriyet seek to re-legitimate the imperilled authority of the secular state and relevant institutional practices, re-establish consensus on the core values of Kemalist ideology, avoid disillusionment with the</page><page sequence="15">Yagcioglu and Ay§en Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 831 modernity project and its goals. The Sheriatist actors/writers of The AkiU in con- trast, seek to legitimate their withdrawal of allegiance to the system of laws, norms and the ethos of the Republic by representing the state as 'oppressive' and 'unjust'. In both instances, the overarching question is 'Who is the authority? The People or Allah'. Consequently, each newspaper performs a dual political func- tion, which is the general property of all media, to structure and process the events in the physical and social experiential world into ideologically unified packages and, in so doing, to maintain and if possible extend their community of readers (see Kress, 1983) by persuading them, through argument, that the moral order of society is at stake. Considering the regimentation of Secularists and Sheriatists in readiness for confrontation, to this dual function we would like to add a second (also see Gill and Whedbee, 1997: 157) to induce their audience in cooperative activity. Semantically, this process involves the legitimation of the cognitive-discursive representation of events as the true 'facts', thereby neutral- izing alternative 'versions' of events. This entails extensive descriptions of actions, expression of opinions of the speaker/writer and presentation of argu- ments about why the actions as described by him or her is/was not wrong. It is therefore crucial for the writer that his or her version of events be accepted (Rojo and Van Dijk, 1997). Hence, schematically organized by a complex argumenta- tive schema, with respect to pragmatics, legitimation discourse can be viewed as an exchange of verbal moves oriented towards self-defence in response to accu- sations and an attempt to convince that the version of events be accepted as 'true'. In this respect, there is not only an interactional, but also a rhetorical, dimension to the argumentative moves advanced by the writer (Rojo and Van Dijk, 1997). Indeed, these functions of the op-ed articles in our data as instances of legitimation discourse overlap with the definitions of rhetoric as a type of instrumental discourse calculated to influence an audience toward some end: (i) a means of persuading audiences, (ii) a method of reaching reliable judgements and decisions in a community, and (iii) a means of inducing cooperative activity. Identified with argumentative discourse, rhetoric is located on the political stage (Gill and Whedbee, 1997). Van Eemeren and Houtlosser (1999: 483) argue that the Aristotelian rhetori- cal norm of successful persuasion is not necessarily in contradiction with the maintenance of reasonableness as a critical standard of argumentation. Although legitimation is accomplished by persuasive or sometimes manipulative discourse, people engaged in argumentation may be regarded as committed to maintaining certain standards of reasonableness and expect others to comply with the same standard. Hence, we think that our analysis of the coding orien- tations of Secularists and Sheriatists, which takes 'rationality' as its point of ref- erence, overlaps with the pragma-dialectical approach to argumentation advocated by Van Eemeren et al. (1997). They define dialectic as 'a method of regimented opposition' deployed in communication 'that amounts to the prag- matic application of logic, a collaborative method of putting logic into use so as to move from conjecture and opinion to more secure belief' (p. 214).</page><page sequence="16">832 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) The op-ed articles in our data thematize controversial actions, accusations, doubts, critique or conflict over group relations, leadership and authority. Caught in the struggle between legitimation and delegitimation, these op-ed articles involve a complex discourse, which is accomplished by various speech acts such as assertions, questions, reproaches and counter accusations. Therefore, each op- ed article may be considered as a discursive macro-speech act of legitimation (see Rojo and Van Dijk, 1997), which requires the consideration of structures and functions of the discursive practice at pragmatic, interactional, semantic, schematic, stylistic and rhetorical levels. Each of these levels may be realized through a 'grammar of legitimation' developed by Van Leeuwen (1995a). The grammar is based on four major legitimation categories, each of which social practices are based on: • tradition, custom, law or persons with authority: authorization; • the utility of institutional actions and their validity in shared knowledge in people's minds: rationalization; • norms: moral evaluation; • narration: mytho-poesis. Structures and functions of (de)legitimation strategies in The Cumhuriyet and The Akit In this section, we concentrate analysing the legitimation structures and strat- egies of the op-ed articles of The Cumhuriyet and The Akit as a function of the sociocultural and political ethos of Secularists and Sheriatists, respectively. To do this, we study the process of discursive legitimation at the micro-level: the seman- tic strategies of (de)legitimation and the construction of the version of the events congruent with the ideology of the newspaper. SEMANTIC LEGITIMATION STRATEGIES We have found out that the op-ed article writers' semantic strategies display three of the four legitimation strategies of Van Leeuwen (1995a): (i) authorization, (ii) rationalization (historicity; oppression and threat), and (iii) moral evaluation: (backwardness and corruption; representing 'the other'). Authorization Reference to law, religion and people with authority is a general strategy of justifying one's actions, reactions or beliefs. In the discourse of The Cumhuriyet , the writers seek to legitimate secular institutional practices through strategies, which aim to show that the actions of the Sheriatists are not consis- tent with the secular order of society. That is they are inconsistent with the system of laws, norms, agreements or aims of the modernity project agreed upon by citizens who are able to think 'rationally'. The Grand National Assembly in which the will of people is issued in the form of legal codes is discursively con- structed as the prime source of authority. Claiming that the WP, the major part- ner in the coalition government, does not adhere to the moral order of the</page><page sequence="17">Yagcioglu and Ay§en Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 833 country, the writer of the op-ed article 'Where Does the WP Stand?' delegitimizes the actions of the WP deputy who was once the solicitor representing the defen- dants of the 'Sivas Fire', a case of arson in which 37 Secularist intellectuals were burned in a hotel fire allegedly caused by Sheriatists: (1) According to Law , there are certain things that an MP cannot do. A WP deputy has undertaken the responsibility of becoming the solicitor of those 'who burned 37 people in Sivas because of their beliefs'. He either does not know the law or does not care. That WP member of the Parliament is the head of the ministry which is respon- sible for the execution of laws. (Where Does the WP Stand?) Democracy is seen as the only legitimate order in which political Islam could be checked. In the article Awareness of Democracy', the author suggests the necess- ity of displaying democratic forms of protests to check political Islam, the common strategy is to prominently mark the names of presidents or spokesper- sons of non-governmental organizations or the leaders of unions representing institutionalized authority (Van Leeuwen, 1995a). Kress (1983) states that only 'legitimated' speakers appear in the media. As the elected members of democratic organizations, their status and identity mediate the implied validity of the content of their utterance: (2) KESK (Confederation of Public Employee Syndicates ), TDB (Association of Turkish Dentists), TEB (Association of Turkish Pharmacists), TMMOB (Association of Turkish Architects' &amp; Engineers' Chambers), TTB (Association of Turkish Medical Doctors) say in their common announcement 'we defend democracy, not coup-d'états, to check pol- itical Islam. The solution lies not in coup-d'états but in democracy'. . . . Ridvan Budak's - the general Secretary of DISK (The Confederation of Revolutionist Workers' Syndicate) proposal is interesting. He says 'On Saturday or on Sunday at a certain time go out either with your spouse, with your children, with your partner, parents or on your own and walk around . . .' Mehmet Atay's - The general secretary of ODP (Freedom-Democracy Party) of istanbul proposal: 'Stop working for a few minutes, stop walking while you're in the street. . . .' (Awareness of Democracy) Reference to Mustafa Kemal's speeches as a source of authority is also a common strategy. In order to criticize the policies of the Minister of Cultural Affairs, who seemed to signal Sheriatic sympathies, the writer of 'Who's Next?' justifies his 'fear' about the country's departure from the regime of truth based on the subli- mation of rational thinking and scientific knowledge, thereby implicitly accusing the Minister of being 'irrational' and 'uncultured'. (3) . . . And he is a decisive hero who is determined to transform the Ministry of Republican Culture into the Ministry of Sheriatist Culture. Atatürk was right when he said 'Knowledge constitutes the foundation of the Republic'. (Who's Next?)</page><page sequence="18">834 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) In The Akit , however, the authorizations are anchored in an overarching moral order. Actions are sanctioned only because Allah says so. . .' or 'Because Koran decrees '.In the article 'Fire Like Hell and Those Who Proceed to Hell', which takes its point of departure from a fire that reminds the writer of Hell, the writer establishes connections between totally irrelevant incidents and considers the fire as a 'warning' from God to the infidel, or more precisely to the Secularists who are destined for Hell because they ignore God's authority. By referring to Allah and the Koran and citing the words of Mohammed , the prophet, she delegitimizes the actions of the Secularists: (4) Of course Allah knows who is destined to Hell. Only Allah and his messenger decreed those deeds which take to Hell. ... I feel pity for those who seem to be humans; yet according to Koran , who fall below animals. ... I feel pity for the arrogant who look down upon their Muslim brother, offend him, and hurt him although they know Mohammed's words 'One who has even a bit of arrogance in his heart cannot go to Heaven'. (Fire Like Hell and Those Who Proceed to Hell) The strategy of appealing to the Islamic discursive practices of attire seems to reinforce the institutional bases of Islamic norms of behaviour. In the articles 'The So-Called Contemporaneity' and 'One Cannot Walk Against Sheria', which delegitimize the secularist Women's March against Sheria, the writers clearly state that the turban is 'the decree of Allah', and the Muslim woman wears it 'in accordance with her belief'. Those who do not adhere to this discursive practice are considered as having a 'crooked mentality' because violating the decree of Allah can only be explained by not being able to think 'right'. (5) This very person who finds the turban, which is the decree of Allah, anacronic and anti-secular, according to her crooked mentality. (The So-Called Contemporaneity) (6) Those who claim to defend 'women's rights' put a cross on the turban, which Muslim women wear in accordance with their belief. (One Cannot Walk Against Sheria) Historicity For both newspapers, temporality represents a distinctive and irre- ducible semantic domain of their making sense of the world and being in the world. The enterprise of meaning-making of present concerns occurs as an engaged appropriation of what is significant from the past in anticipation of the future (Yagcioglu, 1999). The conceptualization of the world as 'modern' and 'traditional' or 'Islamic' is represented in the newspapers' discursive formulation of the history. Synchronizing its birth with the foundation of the Republic, The Cumhuriyet constructs its conception of historicity on the inception of modern nation-state. The positive evaluation of the Republic is mediated through the col- location of '1923' with 'peace' and the negative evaluation of the past is medi-</page><page sequence="19">Yagcioglu and Ay§en Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 835 ated through the collocation of 'Sheriatist conception' with 'conquest' in the fol- lowing example (Yagcioglu, 1999). (7) Our world of peace was founded with the 1923 Enlightenment Revolution. Before the Republic , the world view of the Ottoman State was based on the Sheriatist concept of 'conquest'; 4 war' constituted the basic philosophy of the Imperial State. With the Republic , the motto became: 'Peace at home, peace in the world'. (While Crawling at the Door of Europe . . .) The Akit , however, grounds its conception of historicity on a period prior to the foundation of the Republic. Although the re-appropriation of the lunar calendar, which was banned by the Republican government, to represent the date on the first page is an open challenge to the Kemalist reforms, delegitimizing social actions is accomplished through references to the significant days of the Islam. In order to delegitimize the President's speech that attempted to justify the legality of the National Security Council and the 'warnings' issued about the infiltration of Sheriatic norms into the secular lifeworld, the author of 'Shave Befitting Such Knave' refers to the lunar calendar to point out that the speech was made on a day that has a special meaning in Islam, the implication being that the President does not refrain from offending the believers even on a sacred day: (8) Two days after this speech, in the Eve of Ramadan Bayram on Channel 7 there was a Solemn Occasion presented by Nuri Sesigiizel. (A Shave Befitting Such Knave) Backwardness and corruption One interesting aspect that we noted in our data is that the writers of The Cumhuriyet subscribe to orientalist mental models (see Said, 1978; Karim, 1997) that portray the Muslim as violent, backward, corrupt and barbaric. The actual formulation of the delegitimation strategies in terms of these preferred mental models contributes to its persuasive function in invalidat- ing the claims of the Sheriatists. Such a representation is functional with respect to justification of the Kemalist core values of progress, enlightenment and civi- lization. Example (9) provides a powerful instance that draws on these stereotyp- ical representations while example (7) above depicts the Ottoman Empire and the Sheriatists as 'war-mongers'. (9) We should see this: the WP and political Islam muster power by exploiting backward- ness. Look at the neighbourhoods, regions and provinces where the WP is powerful and got the vote, there, you can see the traces of backwardness. There is an inverse relationship between the WP and civilization. Anyway, the WP propaganda is based on the exploitation of this backwardness. Who would believe Erbakan's words 'those who work at NASA in the U.S., whenever they cannot solve the problems, they con- sult the Koran and solve their problems by reading verses?' A backward person would believe it. A person who is in his right mind would ask Islamic countries read Koran</page><page sequence="20">836 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) for centuries, why cannot they beat backwardness?' A backward person would listen to Erbakan with great admiration and could be happy thinking how powerful is his belief. (Their Problem is with Women) Standard move of delegitimating the coalition government is to emphasize the illicit dealings of the political parties that banded together. The semantic category 'corruption' becomes instrumental in discursively constructing the Illegitimacy' of the allegiance of the Sheriatist WP and the conservative True Path Party (TPP). In the article 'Corruption and Sheriatism', Tansu Çiller, the leader of the TTP, is accused of giving in to the blackmailing of the WP in order to cover up cor- ruption files about herself, although she had repeatedly announced during her campaign that coming together with the WP was out of the question. Thus, disagreement with respect to values is communicated through the cognitive- discursive representation of events as true (see Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969: 179). (10) Erbakan, the leader of the WP, has brought three corruption flies to the National Assembly, by using profitably Çiller's craftsmanship. These were the infamous files 'TEDA§, TOFA§, and Property-Ownership'. Erbakan said to Tansu Çiller: We are at the beginning of everything. There will be follow-ups. You can either form a coalition with me and enable the WP to get in power or I will send you to the 'Supreme Court'. What this means is that Erbakan has 'threatened', 'blackmailed' and by approaching the leader of the TPP, has taken Tansu under his seizure with a proposal known as 'indecent proposal' in the foreign press. As a result of this contract, members of the WP, hand in hand with those of the TPP, covered up the corruption files . (Corruption and Sheriatism) The taxonomy of 'gangs, Sheria and coup-ďétať in example (11) implicates Sheria with illegitimate dealings which is functional with respect to the justifica- tion of actions such as the demonstrations and protests organized by the Secularists to demand 'clean society' at the time as part of democratic process. One of its sociocognitive functions in the interaction is to induce cooperative activity in readers. (11) Actually I am angry at those who are satisfied with the discourse that Turkey should be freed from the vicious circle of gangs, Sheria and coup-d'état and yet not have taken any measures by utilizing their self-reliance, self-awareness, and their skill to get organized. (Struggle for Democracy and Law) In The Akit, however, as in example (12), the morally reprehensible allegation of corruption directed against the government is ignored or obscured by directing a counter-accusation at the Secularists for not objecting to the announcement of 28 February deemed as an instance of a coup-d'état. Their complaints about</page><page sequence="21">Yagcioglu and Ay§en Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 83 7 clean society is dismissed as an unwelcome and illegitimate behaviour because the Secularists themselves are equally corrupt. (12) Those who are for coup-d'état and who fuss about 'Clean Society' have more dirty laundry than clean laundry . . . and their illegitimate complaints about believers by extending the unruly behaviors of a few frauds to the society at large. (Setting the Agenda) Representing ' the other ' An effective strategy of deligitimazing the actions of the out-group is negative other-presentation (Van Dijk, 1998). Oktar (2001) dis- cusses how group polarization is represented in the discourse of these news- papers. What we would like to focus on here is the referential values of the expressions used to represent 'the other' and how these are related to the way both newspapers represent the illegitimacy of the social actors belonging to the out-group. Consistent with Kress (1983), in The Cumhuriyet , 'the other' is hardly named explicitly because of their instrumentality in inducing illegitimate coop- erative activity for the restoration of Sheria. The selection choices made at the level of definite descriptions instead of proper names can be explained by the awareness of the writers that they can rely on their readers to retrieve the refer- ence (see Clark and Clark, 1977; Sacks and Schegloff, 1977; Wilson, 1990). Even if the references were easily retrievable, we maintain that the pragmatic ground- ing in the particular selection of 'the WP man who . . .' to refer to two different persons in example (13) is to manipulate the readers' identification by directing away from the designated individuals towards their generic roles, i.e. their exis- tential involvement with the WP in their capacity as minister and mayor. Because establishing the WP as a 'threat' is relevant to the unfolding discourse rather than their personal deeds, the writer intends to direct the attention of the readers away from designated individuals towards the conceptual category 'threat'. (13) The WP man who has urged believers to take ' the oath for revenge' is a member of Parliament now. The WP man who presented a 4 Revenge Address' on the 10th of December against Atatürk and the Republic is the mayor of Kayseri today. Representations of 'the other' in The Akit greatly outnumber those in The Cumhuriyet. The type of referring phrases used by The Akit are over-generalized generic terms such as 'a group of Secularists who . . . ', and 'those who depart from humanity' used attributively , which fails as a referential act. The view of ref- erence based on the principle that speakers' intentions play a major role in dis- tinguishing how an expression is being employed in referring (Donnellan, 1966) offers a possible explanation for the pragmatic grounding of how indefinite descriptions get selected as referring expressions in the discourse of The Akit. The explicit aim in using attributive indefinite descriptions seems not to specify the existence or uniqueness of certain individuals but rather to specify 'whoever or whatever happens to be designated by the description' (Wilson, 1990: 85). This</page><page sequence="22">838 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) pragmatic choice is rhetorically implemented by the use of metaphors, clichés and stereotypes, which exaggerate the otherness of the Secularists by dehuman- izing them. Secularists are then treated and mistreated as wrongdoers, offenders and animals. Because animals do not belong to the realm of culture, or for that matter to religion, mistreatment of Secularists becomes justified: (14) From now on, there is a 'group of Secularists' who build their existence at the expense of non-existence of others , and who resist massively all demands for democracy and change by leaning on the institutions. (This Bloodshed Would Drown You All) (15) I feel pity for those who depart from humanity as to 'neigh' against Sheria and who imper- sonate as human but according to Koran who fall below animals. (Fire Like Hell and Those who Proceed to Hell) In The AkiU there is also a group (of people) referred to as the Invisible manipu- lative power' behind the Secularists. The identity of this group is not clear at all. In the epithets, invisible forces , the system , the obstructions emerging from ' within ' the system in examples (16) and (17), reference to an undefined, non-referential and anonymous group creates an intangible 'mythical group' (Edelman, 1977) which 'emotionalizes facts and eliminates common-sense and rational argument and makes independent thinking become superfluous' (Menz, 1989: 237). This is also congruent with the Islamist ideology of positioning a 'power' over and above the individual who is considered as not being able to act in his own will (see also Cem- Deger, 1999). (16) This nation reads the people who accuse and stigmatize in the newspapers, see them on TV. Yet, it has difficulty in figuring out the ones behind these accusations, since they remain invisible. Think about this for a moment: these invisible powers direct the media and many nongovernmental organizations who claim to be contemporaneous and even those people in the political parties. (The Almighty Allah) (17) The system , just like it did in the past to the socialist opposition, is constructing obstructions emerging from ' within ' [the system], while it is degenerating Islamist oppo- sition, it is opening up a room for manoeuvre for the mass who 'legitimize a secular way of life'. While doing this, it chooses the most suitable tool: the media. (This Bloodshed Would Drown You All) Oppression and threat The political Islamists' struggle of symbolic power over the public sphere is reflected in Islamist women's visibility in governmental offices and educational premises. The relegation of women's Islamic forms of attire to the private sphere with the foundation of the Republic has always been inter- preted by political Islamists as the grasp of women's 'freedom' to abide by the</page><page sequence="23">Yagcioglu and Ayçen Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 839 rules of Sheria. This is also observed in the discursive representation of the Muslim woman in The Akit : wearing a headscarf is represented as a sign of being a Muslim woman and Muslim women as 'oppressed' actors of Islam. In the op-ed article 'You Cannot Walk Against Sheria', which delegitimizes the Secularist women's march against Sheria, Muslim women are represented as oppressed because their adherence to the norms of Sheria in public sphere is obstructed. Secularist women who participated in the march are criticized for not being aware of such 'oppressed sisters' and for not (also) defending them. In this way, all women in the country are put in the 'same poť without making a distinction between their ideologies and Islamist women's visibility in public sphere is legit- imized. (18) It should not be forgotten that those women who are oppressed due to their 'headscarf', who are not allowed to work, not admitted to schools, and who are continuously degraded are also women. Those who claim to be defenders of 'women rights' put a cross on the 'headscarf' which Muslim women wear in accordance with their belief and besides, ignore those women whose freedom of receiving education is grasped. Their actions can be inter- preted not as a 'contradiction' but as a 'prejudice'. (You Cannot Walk Against Sheria!) The writers of The Cumhuriyet , however, delegitimize political Islamists' argu- ment about women's oppression by supporting the Kemalist ideology, which restricts Islamic practices of women to the private sphere. This is rationalized in the following op-ed article, in which the writer claims that the main aim of pol- itical Islamists in sending teachers into schools in headscarves is to disseminate Sheria and thus, represents such women not as oppressed, but as a 'threat' to the rationalized lifeworld: (19) Now, the 'freedom fighters' have another banner in their hands: - Freedom of turban! . . . That is to say, freedom to go under veil. Has any woman with turban in the streets been oppressed since the foundation of the Republic? No! Then, what is their purpose? To authorize the teachers with turban to work in schools and, also by their appear- ance, to create a Sheriatic influence on the students. (Where Does the WP Stand?) CONSTRUCTING THE VERSION OF THE EVENTS THAT IS CONGRUENT WITH THE IDEOLOGY OF THE NEWSPAPER In order to provide a discursive justification of their ideology, the writers of the op-ed articles aim to form a trustworthy formulation of the events. This also leads to the formation of preferred mental models (Van Dijk, 198 7) of the events on the part of the readers, which contributes to either the reinforcement of already existing mental models (of the in-groups) or to the construction of intended new</page><page sequence="24">840 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) models (in the out-group members). This persuasive function of op-ed articles is reflected in two distinct coding orientations that are congruent with the ethos of the newspapers. In order to reveal this, we analyse syntax and argumentative moves in the op-ed articles, which display two of the legitimation categories (Van Leeuwen, 1995a): rationalization (expressing reactions, definitions, question- answer pattern) and mytho-poesis. Expressing reactions Analysing the ways in which social actors 'react' towards what is happening around them brings out the social groups' orientations to the world (van Leewen, 1995b). Our analysis of the authors' reactions in terms of the types of verbs chosen reveals that they position the individual in social actions differently. In The CumhuriyeU the authors express their reactions by cognitive verbs with a human senser (Halliday, 1994) whose reference is given explicitly. That is to say, social actors are represented as 'thinking beings' acting on their own will. In addition, the objects of these verbs are mostly realized as clauses in which a proposition appears. The expedient choice of propositions containing an argument that triggers rational thinking on the part of the reader is congruent with the expectations of their readers. This enables the authors to fulfil their dialectical responsibility by exploiting appropriate presentational devices. (20) Our people think that the attempts for Sheria can be stopped not by coup d'état but by ameliorating the economic and political conditions of today in democratic ways. (Awareness of Democracy) (21) I think people who live in the Turkish society which has been experiencing Mustafa Kemal's Enlightenment are very happy to exercise their 'sovereignty rights' and that they do this very well (they even tend to abuse this at times) and will never delegate their rights to anyone. (The Importance of Democracy and Sheria) (22) Erbakan and all political Islamists think about carrying the decree of Koran to the state government. (Their Trouble is with Women) In The Akit , however, the overwhelming use of affective verbs in which human beings are represented as sensers represents social actors as subject to God's wishes. The objects are realized by a nominal group referring to Secularists and representing them - in attributive relative clauses - as oppressors or wrongdoers. (23) I feel pity for the ignorant who, in fact, proceed to Hell, but who think that they have done something good by marching against Sheria. (Fire Like Hell and Those Who Proceed to Hell) Cognitive verbs in the op-ed articles of this newspaper mostly serve to validate Allah's power. The cognitive verb used with human beings as senser is the verb</page><page sequence="25">Yagcioglu and Ayçen Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 841 'believe' in most cases, i.e. with human consciousness in a religious context: 'believing in Allah'. (24) In Turkey, you may believe in Islamic values or not. If you believe in them you will be our brother. If you don't believe in them 'God save you' we say. (The Sign of Being a Democrat: 2T(Tank and Turban)) The op-ed article 'Fire Like Hell and Those Who Proceed to Hell' is peculiar in its positioning of the individual as not being able to perform a cognitive act, but is only made to it. Throughout the article it is suggested that only Allah, but not individuals, is entitled to have the ability to 'know' and supernatural forces which, in our case are upgraded to the level of power over and above the individ- ual make people perform a cognitive act. (25) Of course, only Allah knows who will go to Hell. (Fire Like Hell and Those Who Proceed to Hell) The choice of a cognitive verb 'remind' instead of 'remember' brings about sig- nificant changes in the mapping of the semantic roles on the nominais in the sen- tence, which is, in fact, congruent with the way Islam positions the individual in the social practices. As pointed out in Van Dijk (1993) and Illie (1998), the hier- archy of semantic roles in the sentence may imply the distribution of power among social actors. The use of 'remind', instead of 'remember', demotes the ani- mate nominal 'I' to the object position, whereas an inanimate nominal 'this scene' or 'the hell-like fire' is promoted to the subject position on which the agent role is mapped. In this way, the human being is positioned as not being able to per- form a cognitive process ('remember') on his own will, but is only made to do it. (26) Frankly, when I saw, on the day of the horrifying fire incident, the flames reaching the sky and the firemen who were burning in these flames, this scene reminded me of Hell. (Fire Like Hell and Those Who Proceed to Hell) (27) This hell-like fire reminded me of many things. (Fire Like Hell and Those Who Proceed to Hell) Argumentation Dialectical theories of argumentation posit that any argumenta- tive text is constructed as 'one party's effort to convince another of a standpoint by answering doubts and objections and by grounding conclusions in mutually acceptable starting points' (van Eemeren et al., 1997: 219). In op-ed articles, the author acts like a protagonist who aims to persuade the reader as antagonist or a sceptical interlocutor. In our case, although argumentation is utilized in order to justify (legitimate) or refute (delegitimate) a standpoint in the op-ed articles of both newspapers, the way in which premises lead to the conclusion greatly dif- fers. Whereas the argumentative moves in the op-ed articles in The Cumhuriyet</page><page sequence="26">842 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) reflect logos orientation, those in The Akit are realized in terms of a mythic orien- tation to the world, in which the boundaries between the sacred and the social are blurred. We come across three types of argumentative moves in the op-ed articles: definitions, question-answer patterns and mythopoesis. Definitions As an effective tool for justification, definitions aim to answer the 'why' question in the reader's mind about the premise by stating 'because that's the way things are' (Van Leeuwen and Wodak, 1999). Writers' definitions differ in the information value they carry. Definitions in the op-ed articles of The Cumhuriyet are informative in nature, i.e. develop from the subject to the predi- cate in which the predicate provides new information about the entity being defined. As part of the effort to relegitimate the imperilled authority of the secu- lar state and the relevant institutional practices, the writers in The Cumhuriyet systematically formulate their arguments in the form of definitions to move from conjecture and opinion to more secure belief in issues such as 'Why secularism?', 'Why democracy?' and 'Why should we be against Sheria?' Thus, definitions with high informational value function as a vehicle for responding to, reinforcing, or altering the understandings of their audience and in this way guarding the dis- cursive practices of the secular state. Definitions are thus exploited as an expedi- ent presentational pragma-dialectical device for reaching reliable judgements and decisions in the community. In the following argument-conclusion pattern, the argument 'people are the sovereign in democracy' is grounded by the defini- tion of democracy which paraphrases the proposition by extending the meaning of 'sovereign' to 'participation' and 'decisions on the matters about themselves': (28) People are the sovereign in democracy. As I have written repeatedly, ' Democracy is people's participation in the process of decision about the matters that are related or will be related to themselves '. In other words, democracy is ' participation it is people's sovereignty on their own lives. (Sheria and The Importance of Democracy) The writers in The Cumhuriyet also use definitions as a means of delegitimation. A standard move of deligitimating the cognitive-discursive representation of 'democracy as the rule of majority' and the ensuing argument that 'since the majority is Muslim in this country, Muslims have a right to rule' by Sheriatists is to accuse them of being interested exclusively in getting things their own way and then systematically distorting the definitions of democracy, secularism and Sheria. In order to refute these, many op-ed articles in The Cumhuriyet as in examples (28) and (29), aim to formulate the definitions of democracy, secularism and Sheria so that properties ignored and obfuscated by Sheriatists are emphasized. (29) Ignorance, on the one hand, and bad intention on the other lead to the conflation of all concepts: Democracy is the rule of majority where human rights and freedom are indispensable. Secularism is the impartiality of the state regarding religions and beliefs. It is the state's</page><page sequence="27">Yagcioglu and Ay§en Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 843 preclusion of people belonging to a certain religion to seize the state and oppress other believers. Sheria is the foundation of the theocratic state based on the Islamic rules which organize this world and the other world. (Democracy, Secularism and Sheria) In The Akit , however, we have found out that definitions, as well as being few in number, are tautological in nature. Although tautology is considered an error as the predicate of the tautological statement does not give any new information about the subject, its non-informative nature can be a way of signifying an atti- tude of resistance towards change and progress (Bernsten and Kennedy, 1996). For these writers, the violation of the convention that the content of the message should develop from the subject to the predicate may signify an unchanging for- titude against change by supporting the belief that there is an everlasting basis of values which is uninfluenced by the changes that take place at the surface. Likewise, in The Akit , all definitions rotate around Islam and Sheria without adding any new information as in the statements 'Sheria is the religion' and 'The religion is Islam' or 'Sheria is Islam' and 'Islam is Sheria', in which tautology helps display a highly narrow-minded attitude towards the unchanging values of Islam. This also forecloses the possibility of contrary reasons to emerge, giving way to dogmatic orientations of meaning. As in example (30), the definition 'Sheria is Islam' is used to delegitimate the Secularist women's march against Islam. The re-appropriation of the definition by Mesut Yilmaz, the leader of the opposition party, is used to reinforce their argument that marching against Sheria is marching against Islam. (30) Sheria , against which the women marching in the streets of Ankara last Saturday condemned, is Islam itself. . . . The demonstrators, the experts and later the politicians have reached a consensus: 4 Sheria is the religion. The religion is Islam . . . One cannot walk against Sheria, but only respect it.' (One Cannot Walk Against Sheria) For the writers of The Akit , people who make a distinction between Islam and Sheria are infidels. The impossibility of making a distinction between Islam and Sheria precludes the possibility of the formation of a secular public sphere. The re-appropriation of the definition 'Sheria is Islam' by politicians is provided as a proof that Islam can only be experienced as a totality, i.e. as either/or, and that eventually this 'truth' will be accepted. (31) As you have been following very closely, when the fact that Islam is Sheria was admit- ted, certain people and circles who want to take a position against Islam, but forced to find a pretext for this, were forced to change their discourses, which they have been accustomed to saying 'we are not against Islam, but Sheria' and reach a point where they can say 1 Sheria is Islam, being against Sheria is being against Islam1. (Discussions on the Politicization of Islam)</page><page sequence="28">844 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) A close look at the argumentative structure of the text above reveals that, besides the definition being not informative, the propositions advanced leave much detailed information unexplained: 1. Claim: People against Islam admitted that Sheria and Islam are the same thing. 2. Argument 1: Islam is Sheria. 3. Implication from Argument 1: That Islam and Sheria are the same is an unquestionable fact. 4. Presupposed knowledge: There are people against Islam. 5. Implicit Argument 1: certain people cannot dare to announce that they are non-believers. 6. Implicit Argument 2: saying that 'we are not against Islam but Sheria' is a concealment of being a non-believer. We see that there is only one explicit proposition, which is the claim. The other propositions represent implicit arguments and presupposed knowledge, which serve to persuade the antagonist, who may also be one of the people against Islam, to become a believer. However, much information about who else, except the main opposition party, took part with political Islamists, why people against Sheria feel forced to find a pretext for their discourse, and most importantly, why they consider Islam and Sheria as the same, is left unexplained. Questions and answers We found out that question and answer patterns as argu- mentative moves are frequently embedded within the textual limits of the articles in our data. Wilson points out that providing a justification or reason for the ques- tion and the answer plays a significant role in deciding the pragmatic well- formedness of question and answers (1990: 149). In looking at the function of this argumentative strategy, one might argue that the term is a misnomer in that the writers who deploy the strategy are doing much more than simply requesting information and answering them. Any other actions they attempt to perform (criticize, demean, invite for inferencing) emerge from the primary act of direct- ing questions. In The Cumhuriyet, the pattern functions as a model of critical discussion that provides a procedure for establishing whether the standpoint advanced by the writer is defensible against doubt or criticism. Besides functioning as a means of maintaining critical standards of reasonableness in argumentation, it provides an occasion for a positive view of interaction. Among the 12 interactional func- tions of questions identified by Hargie et al. (1987: 61), The Cumhuriyet seems to operationalize the strategy mainly 'to diagnose specific difficulties a respondent may have', 'to encourage maximum participation of the respondent', 'to encour- age critical thought and evaluation' and finally 'to communicate, in group dis- cussion, that involvement and overt participation of all group members is expected and valued'. Of course, all these functions are in keeping with the telos of the Republic to position individuals as taking part in critical discussion. As a</page><page sequence="29">Yagcioglu and Ayçen Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 845 case in point, the writer in (32) deploys the strategy as a speech act which recon- structs an exchange of verbal moves ideally performed to resolve a difference of opinion. His main aim is to establish certain premises (yes/no questions) from which certain actions would follow rationally: i.e. 'there is no question that the WP wants to establish a totalitarian regime. Beware of the imminent danger!' The example is functional in integrating the well-known move of inviting readers to make inferences by working their way from analogy, i.e. what has happened in Iran. In other words, if X is known to be the case, then action Y should be taken. Delegitimation at this level is rhetorically oriented to bring out what is unaccept- able for the readers (sexual segregation) and consequently seek to establish nor- mative approval of institutional acts of the Republic (taking off the veil, coeducation). It may be argued that Yes/No questions are closed in a prop- ositional sense that constrains the answer along a certain continuum. Yet, Wilson argues that they are not closed in relation to the quantitative amount or detail, or in terms of the contribution of this information to the ongoing interac- tion (1990: 151). (32) Is there ' freedom of dress-code' in Iran ? No. All women have to go under black veil. Is there ' freedom of education ' in Iran ? No. Girls and boys, segregated in different classrooms, with different books and with different teachers, have to be educated 'in accordance with Sheria rules'. What does the Mayor of Sincan , who belongs to the WP, say? 'The regime we take as an example is the Humeyni regime'. So what does he want? A regime in which the testimony of women is not honoured even in premeditated manslaughter ... A regime in which a husband who kills his adulterous wife is not punished ... A regime in which women judges are fired. Then, what do people of the WP do? Do they fire this man out of the party? No! On the contrary, they defend his highness, increase his salary and support him, in the prison, by sending the Minister of lustice and Law to visit him. In other words, by doing this, the WP admits that the regime they have in mind is the Humeyni regime. (Where Does The WP Stand?) As opposed to the 'transparent' way of thinking in The Cumhuriyet , in The Akit the questions do not invite any answers which advance the line of reasoning, and thus indicating an 'opaque' discourse. The answers are implied within the ques- tions themselves through which the author forecloses the possibility of the reader to position himself in the discursive practice. In the following text, the author's questions which seem to act like reasonable arguments for justification of the actions of the Minister of Justice, in fact, serve to disguise the fallacious design, as they dictate the proposition A minister is free to act as the way he wants'. (33) Now they have started to pester Çevket Kazan, the Minister of Justice, and to disturb</page><page sequence="30">846 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) the public order. . . . How can he dare to visit the Mayor of Sincan in the prison. Does a minister ask for permission from big mouths for the words he will say or for the places he will visit ? Can you imagine what we have come to? You cannot come across such an intervention even in the Hotanto tribe. (The Almighty Allah) A further instance is provided in (34), in which the act of asking question does not function as a model of critical discussion. Rather it is used to demean the men who participated in the Secularist women's march by highlighting the centrality of gender issues for Islamist self-definition. (34) Were the men who participated in the march , in fact, women? Or were women in the photo- graphs, in fact, men, but is it the fault of our eyes? Are the General President of the RP and his gang included in the category of women, according to the headline? (Women to the Mountains! . . .) Mythopoesis In mythopoesis , as a major type of legitimation strategy deployed mostly by racist and anti-Semitic discourse (Van Leewen and Wodak, 1999), one story or event is taken as evidence for a general norm of behaviour (Mitten and Wodak, 1993). Only negative stories are functionalized in this way and positive stories always serve as an exception. In moral tales, the hero or heroes follow socially legitimate practices and are rewarded for this with a happy ending. In cautionary tales, however, the hero or heroes engage in socially deviant behav- iours that result in an unhappy ending (Van Leeuwen and Wodak, 1999). Although The Cumhuriyet accords no place for mythopoesis in the discursive for- mulation of argumentative moves, in The Akit it comes about as a form of repair and proof which must be understood in terms of general interactional and rhetorical principles. Storytelling in The Akit functions as a distinctive rhetorical form of argument, the enthymeme. Generally described as an abbreviated syllogism, enthymeme omits a premise whereby the readers are forced 'to create coherence in the incom- plete argument by supplying the "missing link" from the premises of their on belief system' (Gill andWhedbee, 1997: 171). First introduced in Aristotle's sem- inal work On Rhetoric , enthymeme as a useful theoretical construct allows us to examine the interaction between the writer, the text and the reader without sac- rificing our aim to analyse to what degree the coding orientations under examin- ation maintain critical standards of reasonableness. As in (35) and (36), in citing and responding to the stories from the Koran and real life, the writers and readers of The Akit reveal their implicit beliefs and values as to the nature of reality and their conception of the appropriate social relations in Islam. The argument usually emerges from this pseudo-collaborative activity, which helps the writers to evade specific confrontational stages in the refutation of claims put forward by Secularists in several ways. First, by citing verses from the Koran (35) and an inci- dent from a newspaper clipping (36) the writers avoid personal responsibility for the truth of what is argued. Second, by relying on conjecture to make the line of</page><page sequence="31">Yagcioglu and Ay§en Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 847 the argument coherent, the writers violate their dialectic responsibility. Drawing an analogy between a recent fire incident and Hell, example (35) cites one of the verses in Koran and proceeds to enumerate the blasphemous deeds committed by the Secularist, leading to the conclusion that they will surely go to Hell. As it stands it is hardly possible to arrive at the conclusion. In terms of the discussion procedure, however, the verse from the Koran , or rather its implicit content, which can be retrieved from the belief system of the readers, stands for the unstated, or missing premise of the following syllogism: [those who behave deviantly go to Hell] - unstated premise Secularists behave deviantly. Therefore, they will certainly go to Hell (35) Frankly, when I saw, on the day of the horrifying fire incident, the flames reaching the sky and the firemen who were burning in these flames, this scene reminded me of Hell. 'Watching a fire incident on TV is enough to horrify someone. I wonder what it would be like in Hell', I thought. I prayed to God, 'My Lord . . .' In Koran there are 1 1 5 places where Hell is mentioned. Here is one of them: Lo, the Tree of Ez-Zakkoum is the food of the guilty, like molten copper, bubbling in the belly as boiling water bubbles. 'Take him, and thrust him into the midst of Hell, then pour over his head the chas- tisement of boiling water!' Taste! Surely thou art the mighty, the noble. This is that concerning which you were doubting' (Smoke: 43-50) (Fire Like Hell and Those Who Proceed to Hell) Stories and events from real life, which are dubious as to when and where they took place, are also presented as evidence to delegitimate the general norm of behaviour of the Secularists. In the process of storytelling, 'the language becomes emotionally charged and patterns of identification are offered which replace common-sense and rational thinking' (Menz, 1989: 234). These stories represent the Sheriatists as a group combined by political symbols (the turban as the iden- tity of the Muslim woman and the white beard as the identity of Muslim man) and acting within a network of power relations (Muslims oppressed by Secularists) to justify their own claims. In order to refute the claim 'Sheriatists are imbeciles' the writer of 'The So-Called Contemporaneity!' tells a story about an old man who was killed when he was trying to stop a terrorist: (36) A few years ago, there was a meeting. There, Çiikran Ketenci, the writer in The Cumhuriyet, said: 'The believers are mentally retarded and wounds of the contemporaneous society. Don't hate them. Pity them!. They are the sick of our society. They are our injuries'. Now I would like to give an example. I have a piece of news which I cut out from the newspaper so that it would not disappear in the pages turning yellow. The incident is this: A terrorist who wants to hijack a bus targets his gun at the disobedient driver's head.</page><page sequence="32">848 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) An eighty-three-year-old citizen Kâmil Baçegmez is killed when he is trying to stop the terrorist. In his funeral, the citizens, who overflowed the streets from Çiçli to Feriköy Cemetery, were eager to carry the old man's coffin covered with the Turkish flag. We felt pity, when we saw, in the newspapers, the luminous look on the old man's face whose long white beard was soaked in blood.' Now I am asking you all those contemporaneous militants who do not believe in Allah: For those who flood into the squares and shout meaningless words, is Kâmil Dede who is faithful and committed to his country an 'imbecile'? Why do you speak calumnies about these people who do not have any sin but are only faithful to their beliefs? Who are the real imbeciles I wonder? (The So-Called Contemporaneity) In this case, the premises in the reader's own belief system comes from religious stories and films in which the figure of an old man wearing white beard symbol- izes a religious man of wisdom who shows the way to truth or good will. This evo- cation of a certain stereotypical image-schema, having a certain association with religious context and self-sacrifice and representing Kâmil Dede as the modern preserver of the Islamic values, which are unaffected by the modernization process, contributes to the reconstruction of the preferred mental model or the formation of an intended new model (Van Dijk, 1987, 1998) in the reader's mind, which is summarized in the questions posed after the story: believers sacri- fice themselves for the good of the society and never deserve to be called imbeciles. Conclusion From the analysis given above, we are now able to conclude that the linguistic choice is a function of the 'ontologies' built into the confrontational Voices', which conceptualize the world in distinct ways characterized by particular relations to the social and the subjective worlds as well as the objective world. In other words, the very organizing concepts which control the congruence of the selection of a particular set of options within a coding orientation are also the ones which underlie that social group's orientation to the world, extending over the style of non-verbal behaviour of its members. Each coding orientation as a category displays its own specific identity and boundaries through its systematic choice of vocabulary, syntax, argumentative moods and narrative appeals. The modernization project as an epistemology embodied in rationalization comes to be constituted as a communicative practice in the op-ed articles of logos orientation through the use of propositional knowledge encoded in definitions about what takes place in the world or what is to be effected in it. By means of the argumentative pattern of questions and answers, the writers of The Cumhuriyet display a communicative mode to convince the addressee about 'why the values of the Republic should be defended' by answering doubts and objections and grounding conclusions in the intersubjectively shared lifeworld. This commu- nicative employment of propositional knowledge assertions allows us to locate this coding orientation within a wider concept of rationality connected with the</page><page sequence="33">Yagcioglu and Ay§en Cem-Deger: Logos or mythos 849 ancient conceptions of logos (Habermas, 1987). Logos , or persuasion through the argument of the speech itself was included in the early textbooks on rhetoric as one of the 'modes of proof (Gill and Whedbee, 1997). The intersubjective recog- nition of the unity of the objective world based on insight rather than external authority (Allah) becomes possible by the interpretative accomplishments of the logocentric subject of modernity. This historical mode of being as the autonomous subject is linguistically realized through the positioning of social actors as sensors in cognitive processes in reactions. Thus, the form of legitimacy, which rests on the subject with the ethos of building a democratic polity in which the idea of the public citizenship is fulfilled, becomes inscribed in the linguistic choices made by the writers of The Cumhuriyet. In the mythos orientation the choices in meaning and therefore in lexicogram- mar are found to be systematically skewed to the legitimation of the rule of Sheria, which renders Islam tangible, both socially and culturally through daily practices, thus obliterating the secular differentiation of the social space. This in turn produces the effect of blurring boundaries between the sacred and the social, which seems to be one of the major characteristics of mythic orientation to the world. The congruence of the set of beliefs, values and attitudes in the mythos orien- tation can be said to be realized through the systematic use of cognitive processes in reactions. What we found to be significant is the levelling of 'this world' with 'the nexť on to the same plane (see Habermas, 1984) through the use of cogni- tive verbs with 'humanized' phenomenon as the subject. In instances such as 'fire like Hell', natural phenomena fitted with anthropomorphic features are not only drawn into the communicative network of social beings but their relation with the 'the next world' is established. Conversely, the fundamental positioning of the Muslim subject in the discourse of Islam is realized through his systematic posi- tioning in the category of the demoted subject in cognitive processes. This lin- guistic choice reproduces the hierarchical relations, which reproduced the same type of subordinated subject in the social order that had its foundation in divine will. We suggest that such a positioning mediates his fundamental experience as a 'kul' who lacks the capacity for action, intention and goal-setting unless Allah wishes. This experience profoundly evokes the experience of the members of the mythic world where they remain 'unprotected to the contingencies of the unmas- tered environment' (Habermas, 1984: 1, 47). Another feature that constitutes the particular potential of meaning in the mythos orientation is the use of mythopoesis and as a related strategy the use of mythic reference groups as a 'mode of proof. As a widely used strategy in The Akit, we think that the function of mythopoesis is to trigger frames and call pre- fabricated patterns into play to evoke emotions in the reader. Sarup, drawing on Lyotard argues that narrative knowledge certifies itself without having recourse to argumentation and proof (1993: 136). On a similar note, Menz argues that through 'emotionalisation common sense and rational argument are more or less eliminated The mythical language relieves the author of the responsibility for</page><page sequence="34">850 Discourse &amp; Society 12(6) his own thinking; it serves as an emotional crutch which one can lean on with- out exerting one's effort' (1989: 237). By prioritizing emotions, or pathos as a mode of proof, the writers of The Akit construct the discursive space of the mythos code as devoid of argumentation. This absence of the internalization of rational action orientations together with the tautological character of the definitions create the effect of 'empty words' for the autonomous subject of the Republic. From these premises, we conclude that the relations obtained within the coding orientations show that rationality as a regulative principle creates the insulation between the voices of Secularists and Sheriatists. The linguistic choices reveal that although the mythos code has emerged as the contestation of the unitary public space, which suppresses difference, it does not necessarily have a progressive character. It articulates a conservative desire, which seeks a profound transformation of the terms of the political discourse. By problematizing 'who is the authority' and under the cover of the defence of indi- vidual liberty, it seeks to legitimate inequalities and restore the hierarchical relations that obtain in a theological-political logic, which the struggles of the previous decades had destroyed, thus becoming a source of ontological threat.
