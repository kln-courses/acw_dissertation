Report from Rockport, 1940. Oil on canvas, 24 x 30 in. (61 x 76.2 cm). Edith and Milton Lowenthal Collection, Bequest of Edith Abrahamson Lowenthal, 1991 (1992.24.1) Bought in February 1944, Report from Rockport was the first work by Davis to be purchased by the Lowenthals. Three months after acquiring it, the Lowenthals lent the painting to the Museum of Modern Art's fifteenth-anniversary exhibition, "Art in Progress," and the following year (1945-46) it was again on view there in Davis's retrospective. Along with Arboretum by Flashbulb and The Mellow Pad (see page 22), also in the Lowenthal Collection, Report from Rockport is considered to be among Davis's most impor- tant canvases from the 1940s. It is one of the key works in his career because it was the first to utilize his newly articulated "color-space" theory. In this theory color could be used to indicate spatial relationships through its posi- tioning next to other colors. As Davis observed, "It is impossible to put two colors together, even at random, without setting up a number of other events. Both colors have a relative size: either they are the same size or they are not. And they are either the same shape or they are not the same shape." Some colors advanced, while others receded, which sug- gests the illusion of a three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface. In this painting a profusion of colors, lines, shapes, and decora- tive patterns almost obscures identification of the outdoor scene that inspired the artist. The setting is the town square at Rockport, Mass- achusetts, which is filled with gas pumps, trees, and storefronts. A garage is centered in the distance. The disjunction of so many elements and colors successfully conveys the vitality of modern American life. 8</page><page sequence="4">STUART DAVIS Arboretum by Flashbulb, 1942. Oil on canvas, 18 x 36 in. (45.7 x 91.4 cm). Edith and Milton Lowenthal Collection, Bequest of Edith Abrahamson Lowenthal, 1991 (1992.24.2) Arboretum by Flashbulb was the second painting by Davis to be purchased by the Lowenthals. Following its acquisition in January 1945, they agreed to lend it and Report from Rockport to Davis's 1945-46 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Although not yet part of the Lowenthals' collection, Landscape (1932 and 1935; see page 21) was also in this show and was used to illustrate the front cover of the exhibition catalogue. Painted in the spring and summer of 1942, Arboretum by Flashbulb is a lively example of the expanded role played by color in Davis's work of the 1940s. Here, the entire composition is fractured into many small, irregular shapes and patterns, painted in multiple bright colors. The effect is vibrant and kaleidoscopic, reverberating with the rhythms of American jazz and the dynamism of modern travel. Although the particulars of the scene are almost unrecognizable, the imagery was inspired by nature-the canvas is one of three related landscapes painted by Davis in 1942-43 (the other two are Ursine Park [collection unknown] and Ultra- Marine [Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia]). Davis wrote that this painting was based on "a garden which I loved. The picture is an objective record of many of the forms and perspectives which were present there....But that is not all, because I have integrated... many other observations, remote in time and place." References to trees (left and right), an aloe plant (lower right), a red- and-black bird (center left), and blue water and sky have been discerned among the abstract shapes, and the single yellow band with red star has been identified as the illuminated flashbulb of a camera. 9</page><page sequence="5">MARSDEN HARTLEY American, 1877-1943. Albert Pinkham Ryder, 1938. Oil on Masonite, 28 x 22 in. (71.1 x 55.9 cm). Edith and Milton Lowenthal Collection, Bequest of Edith Abrahamson Lowenthal, 1991 (1992.24.4) Hartley's portrait of Albert Pinkham Ryder (1847-1917) is a profoundly moving tribute to this American artist, whom Hartley greatly admired and with whom he closely identified. Ryder's reclusive, isolated existence, deep melancholy, and financial poverty struck a par- ticularly sympathetic chord with Hartley, who suffered from these same circumstances throughout his life. His first encounter with Ryder's artwork was in a gallery in 1908, followed closely in 1909 by a short visit to the older artist's studio while both men were living in New York City. For Hartley, the memories of these brief events lasted a lifetime. The ex- ample of Ryder's life and work provided inspi- ration for Hartley's creativity. Like Ryder, Hartley tried to inject his paintings with a romantic mysticism. Ryder was also the subject of sev- eral of Hartley's writings: two major essays, published in 1917 and 1936, two smaller unpublished pieces, and a poem titled "Albert Ryder, Moonlightist." Ryder's actual physical appearance in Hartley's paintings occurred just this once. While spending several months in Vinalhaven, Maine, Hartley began to produce a number of stark, iconic, figurative compositions and por- traits, some based on memory, that he called archaic. His portrait of Ryder, created from thirty-year-old memories, is part of this group, although it is uncharacteristically mono- chromatic. Ryder's deep brown eyes stare out vacantly from under dark bushy eyebrows, which Hartley said were "like lichens over- hanging rocks of granite." Ryder's long white beard is tucked inside his gray wool coat like a scarf, and his tight knit cap is pulled low over his forehead, "all a matter of protective coloration without doubt, having something to do with Ryder's shyness." Although tradi- tional portraiture held little interest for the Lowenthals, they were evidently moved by Hartley's attempts to capture not only a physi- cal likeness but a psychological one as well. Their purchase of this painting in 1946 was followed in 1950 by their acquisition of Hartley's portrait of John Donne (see page 28). 10</page><page sequence="6">MARSDEN HARTLEY Mt. Katahdin, Maine, No. 2, 1939-40. Oil on canvas, 30'/4 x 401/4 in. (76.8 x 102.2 cm). Edith and Milton Lowenthal Collection, Bequest of Edith Abrahamson Lowenthal, 1991 (1992.24.3) Between 1939 and 1942 Hartley created more than eighteen paintings of Mount Katahdin, which led him to characterize himself as the "portrait painter" of the site. (Hartley preferred the Indian spelling "Ktaadn," which was also used by Thoreau in The Maine Woods.) Located in Baxter State Park in north-central Maine, it is the highest mountain in Hartley's home state. He visited there with a guide for eight days in mid-October 1939. The trip involved an eighty- mile car ride and a four-mile hike through arduous terrain, undertaken mostly in the dark. For the sixty-two-year-old artist, however, it was a spiritual reawakening and provided him with a potent motif for his late-period work. Hartley stayed on Katahdin Lake in a log cabin at Cobbs Camp in the park. From his room he had a view of the water, and from the edge of the lake he could look up toward Baxter Peak, the summit of the mountain. His first pictures made at the scene were drawings and small oil sketches. Later, immediately after returning to Bangor, Maine (and for three years thereafter), the artist used these preliminary sketches and his memories to paint the larger canvases on this theme. Mt. Katahdin, Maine, No. 2 was the second in the series. By February 1940 Hartley had completed four more. None of the Mount Katahdin compositions replicate exactly what he saw. Rather, the artist took some liberties in altering the placement or per- spective of certain key elements. All of the works, however, depict the mountain from the northeast, so that its most recognizable conical shape is clearly silhouetted against the sky. Below it, in the immediate foreground, are the lake, rolling hills, and trees. Differences among the paintings occur in Hartley's manipulation of spatial perspective and in his depictions of color, light, and changing weather conditions. In this version of Mt. Katahdin the sky, clouds, mountain, hills, and lake are all pre- sented as separate large, flat shapes. Each is clearly defined by its precise form and color. The strong autumnal red of the intermediate hills is dramatically set off against the deep blues of the lake, mountain, and sky. The bright white clouds and the thin strip of white spray around the shoreline provide the only light notes in this somewhat subdued yet majestic view of the mountain. It seems to exemplify Hartley's sentiments about the beauty and wonder of the place and to convey the spiritual meaning that he found in nature: "I have achieved the 'sacred' pilgrimage to Ktaadn Mt....l feel as if I had seen God for the first time-I find him so nonchalantly solemn." 11</page><page sequence="7">CHARLES SHEELER American, 1883-1965. Americana, 1931. Oil on canvas, 48 x 36 in. (121.9 x 91.4 cm). Edith and Milton Lowenthal Collection, Bequest of Edith Abrahamson Lowenthal, 1991 (1992.24.8) Between 1926 and 1934 Sheeler produced a series of seven paintings-among them Americana-that depict the interior of his home and his prized collection of early American fur- nishings (including Shaker pieces), which he had begun to acquire by the mid-1910s. Dominated by a profusion of precisely rendered objects-but no people-these rooms are oddly frozen in time and emotionally distant. They are both an intimate and up-close por- trayal of the artist's living space and a more general and impersonal statement about nationalism and the values of home and crafts- manship. Americana may have been based on one of the interior photographs that Sheeler took of his South Salem, New York, house about 1929, some shots of which were taken from an elevated vantage point. (Sheeler worked for a while as a professional photographer and often made photographs of the same subjects that he painted.) From the high perspective of the pho- tographs the floor and furniture seem to be tipped upward toward the viewer, making them look off-balance and rather two-dimensional. This same effect is achieved in Americana, in which the long trestle table and two side benches seem to hover like flat boards over the other furniture and the tilted floor. The conflict- ing geometric and linear patterns of the four rugs, two pillows, woven sofa covering, back- gammon set, and cast shadows add to our visual discomfort, as does the unusual cropping of objects, which obscures their identities and confuses their spatial position. The verity of Sheeler's realism, however, makes us willing to accept these inconsistencies. This superb example of Precisionist painting was acquired by the Lowenthals about 1946 from the Downtown Gallery (two years after they purchased Sheeler's drawing The Open Door). Prior to the purchase the painting had already acquired a lengthy exhibition history, including Sheeler's one-man show at the Museum of Modern Art in 1939. Like the artist, Edith Halpert (owner of the Downtown Gallery, New York, where Sheeler's work had been shown since 1931) also appreciated early American handi- crafts and sold fine American folk art in addition to paintings and drawings. Upon hearing from the Lowenthals that they had bought this painting, Sheeler responded enthusiastically in a letter: "I am glad that Americana has a good home for it is one of my favorites among my work." 12</page><page sequence="8">CHARLES SHEELER The Open Door, 1932. Conte crayon on paper, mounted on cardboard, 233/4 x 18 in. (60.7 x 46.7 cm). Edith and Milton Lowenthal Collection, Bequest of Edith Abrahamson Lowenthal, 1991 (1992.24.7) Sheeler was a versatile artist who moved easily between the media of painting, drawing, print- making, photography, and film. For him, pho- tography was not only a tool used to derive compositions for his paintings and drawings but was also an independent art form that often preceded by several years his production of related paintings. In the case of The Open Door, drawn in 1932, Sheeler returned to a sequence of twelve photographs he had made about 1917 of his stone cottage in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. The house, built in 1768 by a Quaker settler, was used by Sheeler and his artist-friend Morton Schamberg as a summer and weekend studio between 1910 and 1918, when Schamberg died, and thereafter by Sheeler alone until 1926. As in the photograph upon which this conte crayon drawing is closely based, Sheeler presents a small corner interior occupied by two open doors, a darkened window, and a small mirror. The strong rectilinear character of the house, with its wide floorboards, thick ceil- ing beams, and plank doors, is emphasized in the tightly cropped scene. The dramatic artifi- cial lighting of the photograph, which creates strong chiaroscuro effects and brings out every flaw in the plaster wall and door, is somewhat softened in the drawing. With artistic license, Sheeler here has cleaned up the room's defects and eliminated certain small architec- tural details that detract from its pristine quality and dramatic power. The Open Door is one of about sixteen conte drawings Sheeler made between 1930 and 1937 that deal with mysterious light and shadows (four of them, including this one, were created in 1932). The exquisite range of tones and textures achieved solely with black conte crayon attests to Sheeler's mastery of the medium, which, he noted, was used "to see how much exactitude I could attain." 13</page><page sequence="9">ARTHUR DOVE American, 1880-1946. The Inn, 1942. Wax emulsion and aluminum paint on canvas, 241/8 x 27 in. (61.2 x 68.5 cm). Edith and Milton Lowenthal Collection, Bequest of Edith Abrahamson Lowenthal, 1991 (1992.24.5) Dove was one of three artists whom photogra- pher-turned-art-dealer Alfred Stieglitz regularly showed in his influential New York City gal- leries (ca. 1910-19). The other two were Georgia O'Keeffe and John Marin, who are also represented in the Lowenthal Collection. The works of these three artists, together with those of Marsden Hartley, Charles Demuth, and Max Weber (whose paintings were also shown by Stieglitz, but for fewer years), exemplify the direction of avant-garde American Modernism in the first quarter of the twentieth century. After Stieglitz died in 1946 and his gallery closed, Edith Halpert at the Downtown Gallery began to show the work of Dove (who had recently died), Marin, and O'Keeffe. The Lowenthals' close association with the Down- town Gallery began with their purchase there of Raymond Breinin's At Golgotha (Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio) in 1943. Their admiration of Halpert's strong commit- ment to contemporary American art led them to frequent her gallery on a regular basis. The result was that many artists in her stable found a place in their collection, if only with a single work (as in the case of Dove and O'Keeffe). Dove's painting The Inn entered the Lowenthal Collection in November 1947, after being included in two exhibitions at the Downtown Gallery: a one-man show in January 1947 and a group exhibition in September- October 1947. (Prior to that, Stieglitz had shown it in 1942.) The painting is an impor- tant late work by Dove, who since the 1910s had consistently abstracted forms from nature. Although its shapes are difficult to identify, the composition suggests an aerial view from a window onto a landscape, perhaps looking out of or toward one of the two inns near Dove's house in Centerport, Long Island. Aerial pho- tographs of the neighborhood, taken by the owner of one of the inns, were shown to Dove in 1940, and his paintings of that year reflected this new perspective. Made two years later, The Inn may be a return to this intriguing point of view. Dove's experi- ments with combining various media (here, oil and aluminum paints and wax emulsion), particularly during the last years of his life, and his continuous search for the essential distillation of form seem to have culminated in this complex and enigmatic picture. 14</page><page sequence="10">MAX WEBER American, 1881-1961; born in Russia. Hasidic Dance, 1940. Oil on canvas, 321/4 x 40 in. (81.8 x 101.6 cm). Edith and Milton Lowenthal Collection, Bequest of Edith Abrahamson Lowenthal, 1991 (1992.24.6) Hasidic Dance was acquired in the Lowenthals' first inspired year of collecting (1943), during which they purchased forty- seven works from sixteen different galleries and arts organizations. It was the most expen- sive work they bought that year, and marked their first dealing with Paul Rosenberg and Company, from whom they would also acquire important paintings by Avery, Hartley, and Rattner. The Lowenthals' admiration for Weber's work began with this initial purchase, and they remained great friends with the artist for almost two decades. Their papers contain numerous small woodcuts made by Weber that were sent out as greeting cards through- out the years. In 1961 Milton Lowenthal wrote a eulogy for Weber that is filled with personal reminiscences and passionate rever- ence for the artist's dedication to his work: "For him art was a temple, a holy of holies, it was life itself, to be approached with piety and devotion. To treat it otherwise, a desecration." Hasidic Dance is a prime example of Weber's mature, expressionistic style, which emerged about 1940 and in which fluid lines define the loosely drawn elements of the composition and color is intensified. In these pictures Jewish subjects-prophets and Talmudic scholars-and women at home pre- dominate, reflecting both Weber's strong cul- tural identity and his happy home life. Hasidic Dance, painted when the artist was fifty-nine years old, presents a vivid memory from Weber's early childhood in Russia. Six bearded Orthodox Jews are engaged in a fervent dance of religious ecstasy. The men are dressed in traditional black garb with tall black hats. As members of the Hasidic sect, originally founded in Poland in the eighteenth century, these pious men express their joyous praise of God through music and dance. They move together in a trancelike state, arms and faces stretched upward toward the heavens. After the Lowenthals bought this painting, Weber gave them a copy of his poem "Melodic Rage Hebraic," which recounts a similar scene: "Louder voices, / Louder drums, / Louder cym- bals... / Their bodies leap in fitting time... / And their souls again illumined." 15</page><page sequence="11">Selected Works from the Edith and Milton Lowenthal Collection MILTON AVERY American, 1885-1965. Artist's Daughter by the Sea, 1943. Oil on canvas, 36 x 42 in. (91.5 x 106.7 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Bequest of Edith and Milton Lowenthal, 1992 Avery's painting combines two of his favorite subjects: his only child, March (here about eleven years old), and a tranquil beachfront setting complete with shells, gulls, and rippling water. The canvas is characteristic of Avery's mature style, which incorporates a naive ren- dering of form with a Modernist flattening of space and a general simplification of color and pattern. The mutual artistic influence of the friendship between Avery and the somewhat older artist Marsden Hartley, which began in 1938, encouraged the development of this style. Although Avery often painted seascapes of Gloucester, Massachusetts, and various locales in Maine, this particular composition was inspired by a trip that he took to the Gaspe Peninsula in Quebec, Canada, during the summer of 1938. There he conceived of the painting Gulls, Gaspe (Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover, Mass.), an amusing tableau of hungry seagulls encircling an array of cut-up fish. The imagery is remarkably simi- lar to the more somber interpretation painted by Hartley in his 1938-39 Give Us This Day (Shaklee Corporation, San Francisco), which was intended as a memorial to three young men lost at sea. When Avery revisited his own 1938 composition five years later in Artist's Daughter by the Sea, he paid tribute not only to his beloved child but also to his friend Hartley, who had died on September 2, 1943. 16</page><page sequence="12">MILTON AVERY The Baby, 1944. Oil on canvas, 44 x 32 in. (111.8 x 81.3 cm). The Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio. Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Milton Lowenthal, 1955 In 1943 Avery joined the prestigious New York gallery Paul Rosenberg and Company, with which he was affiliated until 1950. The period of that association was marked by a prolific outpouring of work, a consolidation of his artistic style, and a new sense of financial security, as he received a stipend and his pic- tures sold. Between 1943 and 1945 alone Avery created more than 228 oil paintings, in addition to numerous drawings and water- colors. During those two years Avery's work was seen in several one-man and group shows and museum exhibitions, which gener- ated sales such as the Lowenthals' purchase of two oils in 1944 from Paul Rosenberg and Company and a gouache on paper in 1945 from the Kootz Gallery (The Rooster, ca. 1943, which they gave to the Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio). Painted in 1944, The Baby typifies Avery's works of this period: precisely structured com- positions of broad, flat color areas contained within sharply defined edges, with few descrip- tive details, patterns, or textures. Here, a small faceless infant rests diagonally across a blanket, propped up against an armchair. Unlike Avery's portrait of his daughter, March, on the beach, this child is not identified by facial features or a name, but there is a famil- iar intimacy to the scene that suggests that Avery based the figure on a real baby-per- haps a friend's or relative's-or on the many earlier drawings and paintings he made of his own daughter. WILLIAM BAZIOTES American, 1912-1963. White Silhouette, 1945. Oil on canvas, 36 x 42 in. (91.4 x 106.7 cm). Collection of the Newark Museum, New Jersey. Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Milton Lowenthal, 1951 Of the sixty-five artists represented in the Lowenthal Collection, Baziotes is the only one who can be classified as an active member of the avant-garde Abstract Expressionist group, which has exerted an enormous influence on the direction of American art since the mid- 1940s. His work, however, often remained out- side the mainstream of Abstract Expressionism, since it assumed neither the gestural applica- tion of paint that made headlines for Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning nor the extreme minimalism that characterized the mature work of Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. Rather, Baziotes remained constant in using biomor- phic and anthropomorphic imagery, which he had adopted from Surrealism, and in his intent to portray mythic and primeval subjects. Such steadfast commitment to one's own vision, despite outside pressures, would have appealed to the Lowenthals (who saw them- selves as pioneering collectors in the field of contemporary American art) and may have prompted their acquisition of White Silhouette in 1945. In this composition Baziotes placed a large, white, irregularly shaped figure in the immediate center foreground of a darkened space. Its shape suggests both animal and human forms but is clearly neither. The prece- dents for this type of image may be found in the artist's knowledge of Precolumbian objects at the American Museum of Natural History, New York, and in the art of Joan Miro and Pablo Picasso, regularly shown in New York museums and galleries in the 1940s. Picasso's Minotaur prints, in which man and bull are literally joined into one mythic creature, offered a particularly close example for Baziotes to follow. The sur- real overtones and stark abstractness of this painting make it very different from the other works in the Lowenthal Collection and may explain their decision to place White Silhouette at the Newark Museum in 1948, three years after they had acquired it. 17</page><page sequence="13">ROMARE BEARDEN American, 1911-1988. The Agony of Christ, 1945. Watercolor on paper, 18 x 24 in. (45.7 x 61 cm). The Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio. Extended loan from the Estate of Edith A. Lowenthal In 1945, after seeing the horrors of war first- hand for three years in the infantry during World War II, Bearden created a series of twenty-four oils and watercolors, titled The Passion of Christ, that was meant to convey the suffering of humanity and the possibility of redemption. The allusion to the Passion was not strictly religious but also humanistic, as the events in Christ's life were to be interpreted as universal symbols for all human experience. References to ancient and contemporary litera- ture (such as Homer, the Bible, Rabelais, and Garcia Lorca) frequently inspired Bearden dur- ing the mid- to late 1940s. Exhibited just after it was produced in 1945-first in Washington, D.C., and Paris and then in New York-the Passion of Christ series was both a critical and financial success for the thirty-four-year-old artist. Exhibited at the Kootz Gallery October 8-27, 1945, and marking Bearden's first one- man show at a mainstream New York gallery, the pictures sold immediately, with purchases made by Duke Ellington, Samuel A. Lewisohn, Roy R. Neuberger, the Lowenthals, and the Museum of Modern Art, among others. The Agony of Christ, which is the only work by Bearden in the Lowenthal Collection, typifies his dramatic, graphic approach to the entire series. Bold divisions of space, strong diagonal lines with sharp angles, and extreme distor- tions of the abstracted figures contribute to the emotional impact of the narrative. The suffering of Christ is here heightened by the agonized backward arch of his body and head and the extreme tension of his bent leg. BYRON BROWNE American, 1907-1961. Still Life with City Window, 1945. Oil on canvas, 47 x 36 in. (119.4 x 91.4 cm). Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. Gift of Edith and Milton Lowenthal Between 1944 and 1945 the Lowenthals col- lected four paintings by Browne (two dating from 1943, one from 1944, and the one shown here). These pictures demonstrate Browne's strong commitment to an abstract idiom, which had emerged in his art by 1930. Although he had had four years of traditional academic training at the National Academy of Design in New York (1924-28), his paintings reflect the fact that on his own he had studied Cubist works by Georges Braque, Juan Gris, and Pablo Picasso, which could be seen (beginning in 1927) in the A. E. Gallatin Collection at New York's Gallery of Living Art and in periodicals such as Cahiers d'Art. Some of his abstractions may appear to be nonobjective, but they were rarely executed without making reference to an actual object or person. Three of the Browne pictures acquired by the Lowenthals-those purchased in 1944- are figurative subjects: a woman reclining on a beach, a person reading, and a head of a man. The fourth, Still Life with City Window, acquired in 1945, is a large study of objects placed on a table in an apartment room and is one of many still-life subjects that he executed in the 1930s and 1940s. Browne depicts the tabletop as if it were precipitously tilted upward toward the viewer. Filling the lower portion is what appears to be some sort of elaborate basket, decorated with two crisscrossing branches and diamond- shaped pieces. At the upper end are several objects-some silhouetted, others described in more detail-a few of which can be identified. Among them are a footed bowl containing three apples (at left), an open book and a single apple (at center), and a tall decanter (at top center). In his quasi-Cubist analysis Browne depicts solid forms and their shadows as flat geometric 18</page><page sequence="14">planes, juxtaposing them with the more painterly, tactile rendering of the tablecloth, where white paint has been thinly brushed over dark underpainting. A tall vertical window occupies the left half of the background, and through it can be seen the related geometry of the city's architecture, illuminated by a full moon. Although the subject of Browne's painting is clearly a still-life arrangement, his towering construction of table and objects also suggests the form and monumental presence of a human figure. When this picture was shown in Browne's 1946 exhibition at Kootz Gallery in New York, it was singled out for praise in various arts reviews. Unlike the other three Browne paint- ings purchased by the Lowenthals, which were presented to various institutions within two or three years of their acquisition, Still Life with City Window remained in their possession until 1957, when it was given to the Whitney Museum. PAUL BURLIN American, 1886-1969. Homunculus, 1947. Oil on canvas, 42 /8 x 297/8 in. (107 x 76 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Gift of the Edith and Milton Lowenthal Foundation Inc. Within the Lowenthal Collection only six artists are represented by a large number of works. Among them are Jacob Lawrence, whose twenty-two gouaches actually form a single opus, and Marsden Hartley, whose thirteen oil paintings were all purchased after the artist's death. The works of the other four-Burlin, Stuart Davis, Abraham Rattner and Max Weber-were acquired by the Lowenthals during the artists' lifetimes, and all the men became personal friends of the Lowenthals. Burlin's association with the Lowenthals proba- bly dates to the 1940s, when they made six of their ten acquisitions of his work, beginning in 1943. Their scrapbook of 1944-45 contains an amusing sketch by Burlin of a couple appre- ciating country living. The man in the drawing bears some resemblance to Milton and is shown playing golf, a sport both the Lowenthals regularly enjoyed, so it may be that the sketch is meant to represent the couple. The sheet is inscribed: "To Edith and Mickey,/With memo- ries of happy Days/ Paul (Burlin)." Homunculus was purchased from the Downtown Gallery, New York, in 1947, the same year that Burlin had the first of his four one-man shows there. The literal reading of the painting appears to be a figure seated at a table, wield- ing a knife on some sort of fish or shellfish. However, the artist's title for this piece suggests that he intended to depict something more symbolic than just an ordinary domestic scene. The word homunculus (Latin for "little man") is variously defined as a manikin, dwarf, or pygmy. Webster's Third New International Dictionary adds that it is "a manikin that is artificially pro- duced in a cucurbit [a vessel used in distillation] by an alchemist." Such a creature, with the name Homunculus, is created in part 2 of Goethe's Faust. For Burlin, who often looked to myths for artistic inspiration, the artificial cre- ation of new life may have been a metaphor for the artist's creative endeavors. 19</page><page sequence="15">JOSE DE CREEFT American, 1884-1982; born in Spain. Iberica, 1938. Granite, h. 24 in. (61 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Bequest of Edith and Milton Lowenthal, 1992 The Lowenthals firmly believed that private patrons of American art should acquire ex- amples of contemporary sculpture in addition to works on canvas, which were more popular with collectors in the forties. In their own apart- ment several sculptures were prominently dis- played alongside their paintings. The two stone figures that they owned by the Spanish-born sculptor de Creeft were both purchased from the Georgette Passedoit Gallery, New York, early in the couple's collecting history: Iberica in 1944 and Une Ame in 1944-45. Like two other sculptures, by John B. Flannagan, that they acquired in those same years (Jonah and the Whale, see page 24, and Dragon Motif), these pieces were hand carved from stone by the artist, rather than by artisans. This method of "direct carving" was revitalized in America by de Creeft and Flannagan, who considered it to be a progressive mode for their time. De Creeft did much to disseminate these ideas to younger artists when he taught in New York at the New School for Social Research (1932-48, 1957-60) and the Art Students League (1944-48). Trained in Madrid and Paris (where he knew Rodin, Picasso, and Braque), de Creeft had already established a considerable reputa- tion in Europe prior to moving to the United States in 1929. His arrival here was marked by solo shows in Seattle and New York and, there- after, almost annual exhibitions throughout the 1940s. His inclusion in the 1942-43 "Artists for Victory" show, held at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, may have been the Lowenthals first exposure to his work. The first prize that he received there for one of his two sculptures (Materity, now in the Metropolitan's collec- tion, acc. no. 42.171) certainly would have attracted the Lowenthals' attention and proba- bly prompted their acquisition of Iberica shortly thereafter. The title Iberica refers to the ancient Latin name for the Iberian Peninsula of Spain. As in much of his work, the natural shape of the stone suggested to the artist the image he would carve; in this case, an elegantly elon- gated oval head. The primitive, masklike face finds precedents in the indigenous art of Spain and in African sculpture, two sources that also inspired his fellow countryman Picasso. According to the Lowenthals, the black granite used for Iberica was found in the waters of Long Island Sound and kept by the artist until he had a strong desire to carve it. 20</page><page sequence="16">JOSE DE CREEFT Une Ame, 1944. Carrara marble, h. 151/2 in. (39.4 cm). Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Alfred E. Bernstein Une Ame was produced the same year as de Creeft's marriage to his third wife, Lorrie Goulet, an American sculptor. The marble's exquisitely sensuous curves, undulating rhythms, smoothly polished surfaces, and dreamlike aura seem to celebrate this happy union, which lasted until the artist's death in 1982. Its poetic French title, which means "a soul," contributes a spiritual reading for this work that transcends the purely physical beauty of its form. Like almost all of de Creeft's work, this piece exalts the human figure, especially the female nude. His masterful juxtaposition of smooth and rough surfaces, both in Iberica and Une Ame, heightens the expressive quality inherent in his materials. Unlike Flannagan, who frequently worked with softer, more granu- lar stones of duller color, de Creeft preferred hard, smooth-textured stones, like marble, that could be highly polished, and those that were strongly colored. The lightness of the Carrara marble used here and the darkness of Iberica's black granite produce very different characters for the figures. When this work was included in de Creeft's annual exhibition at the Georgette Passedoit Gallery, New York, in November-December 1944, the Lowenthals immediately reserved it for their collection. They completed the finan- cial transaction in early January 1945. As in other instances, the Lowenthals maintained a long-term friendship with de Creeft and his family, and the handmade Christmas cards that they received from the artist over the years were kept with the Lowenthals' papers, which have now been microfilmed by the Archives of American Art. In 1962 Milton Lowenthal per- suaded de Creeft to donate his own papers to the Archives, where they currently reside. STUART DAVIS American, 1892-1964. Landscape, 1932 and 1935. Oil on canvas, 25 x 22 in. (63.5 x 55.9 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Milton Lowenthal Between 1944 and 1952 the Lowenthals amassed an impressive collection of seven pictures by Davis: six oils on canvas and one watercolor on paper. These paintings range in date from 1932 to 1947 and illustrate various phases in the artist's development of his abstract idiom. All were purchased from the Downtown Gallery, New York, from Edith Halpert, who was Davis's dealer for thirty years, from 1927 to 1936 and from 1941 to 1962. In recognition of their patronage, the Lowenthals were given the right of first refusal to buy Davis's work from the Downtown Gallery exhibi- tions. Halpert's enthusiasm for Davis's work must have influenced the Lowenthals' initial acquisitions, but their subsequent friendship with the artist and his family-which began in 1944 with their first purchase of one of his paint- ings (Report from Rockport; see page 8)- continued to fuel their support of his work. The friendship lasted long after the Lowenthals' years of art collecting had ended, and in 1964 Milton Lowenthal (who was also Davis's lawyer) spoke at the artist's funeral, characterizing him as being part of a "breed of creative giants." Davis's approach to abstract art was care- fully predicated upon a series of complex art theories that he began to devise in the 1920s and continued to evolve in his notebooks and paintings throughout his life. In his work of the early to mid-1930s, such as Landscape and Coordinance (an oil painting and a watercolor, respectively) in the Lowenthal Collection, Davis often relied on dark lines to provide the struc- ture for his imagery (color was either excluded completely or extremely limited). Such line drawings, although without form or modeling, were intended to denote three-dimensional objects in space. Landscape, painted in 1932 and 1935, was based on a small pen-and-ink drawing of September 1932 that depicted a waterfront scene in Gloucester, Massachusetts (with a fish-processing plant, a tower, and a wharf at which a schooner is docked). Davis's annotation on the drawing also applies to the painting: "Visualization in simple shape terms disregarding more detail incident than is the habit-with the idea of getting a simultaneous view instead of a sequential one." In later ver- sions of the same composition (painted in 1939, 1954, and 1956) Davis reintroduced full color within the linear framework. 21</page><page sequence="17">STUART DAVIS American, 1892-1964.

(35.6 x 45.7 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Bequest of Edith and Milton Lowenthal For more than five years Davis worked on the extremely complex composition of The Mellow Pad, exhibiting it atvarious stages of develop- ment between its inception in June 1945 and its completion in 1951. Alongthe way he also cre- ated five smaller paintings, Pad Nos. 1-5 (1946-49) and numerous notebooksketches containingtheoretical notations. Of the related paintings, Pad No. 4, in the Lowenthal Collection, executed in 1947, displays the mostsimilarityof alloverembellishmentto The MellowPad, although it does notfollowthe largerwork's bipartite format. In both ofthese paintings Davis attained his goal of usingabstractform to pro- duce meaningful content. The surfaces are filled with myriad small signs and symbols, numbers, letters, and words, colored shapes and patterns, all of which overlap and collide. The sensation of chaotic and constant motion, however, is mas- terfully controlled bythe solid background in Pad No. 4 and bythe painted "frame" around the edges of The Mellow Pad. Davis's choice of titles and the insertion of the words pad and mellow pad within the paintings themselves, reflect his interest in word associations and puns. Here the possible meanings forpad range from an artist's sketchbook, to a slang expression for a person's home, to ajazzterm art-historian John Lane defines as a "personal world with a mellifluous and genial emotional tenor such as that created by a jazz musician's expert and heartfelt performance." After completing The MellowPad, Davis embarked on the creation of larger paintings with brighter colors and fewer elements, an endeavor that he would continue throughout the 1950s. 22</page><page sequence="18">LYONEL FEININGER American, 1871-1956. Lunar Web, 1951. Oil on canvas, 21/4 x 36 in. (54 x 91.5 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Bequest of Edith and Milton Lowenthal In 1937, after fifty years in Germany, the sixty- five-year-old American-born artist Feininger returned home to New York, where he explored in his paintings, drawings, and prints architec- tural and landscape subjects similar to those that had interested him in Europe. The three pieces by Feininger in the Lowenthal Collec- tion-two watercolors and one oil painting- were all made in the United States and illustrate the qualities that informed his later work: ele- gant graphic delineation and atmospheric color. The two watercolors-one a church facade, the other a marinescape-were acquired in the early 1940s shortly after Feininger took third prize in the 1942-43 "Artists for Victory" exhibition for his large oil painting Gelmeroda (which was purchased by the Metropolitan, acc. no. 42.158). A decade later, in 1952, the Lowenthals purchased a large canvas, Lunar Web, from Feininger's one-man show at the Curt Valentin Gallery, New York, held in honor of the artist's eightieth birthday. It was to become one of the Lowenthals' favorite paintings. Unlike the more representational imagery depicted in the earlier watercolors, this paint- ing eliminates most ties with the real world, creating instead a nocturnal dreamworld meant to inspire spiritual contemplation. A few years after completing the work, the artist wrote, "I am nearing the stage where I am even commencing to annihilate precise forms, in the interest-as it appears to me-of unity. This is a precarious stage to enter into." In Lunar Web, however, he has found a suc- cessful balance between form and formless- ness. Despite the unreality of the scene, we recognize it as some sort of desolate land- or seascape. The horizontal ground is filled with dark craggy masses (mountains or waves?) that have been given definition by the thin white lines that skim diagonally across their edges. The upper portion is illuminated by a large orb, identified by the painting's title as the moon. Feininger's friend the artist Mark Tobey, from whom he may have adopted the idea of creating compositions with white lines, explained Feininger's work in 1954: "Recog- nition of the known is in all his paintings but never realism. He does not abstract for abstraction's sake. He draws the essence from the real, reshapes and relates in color, form and line-and gives us his world where- in, if we have the willing mind and take the time, we are rewarded by becoming more aware, and more sensitive within ourselves." 23</page><page sequence="19">JOHN B. FLANNAGAN American, 1895-1942. Jonah and the Whale: Rebirth Motif, 1937. Bluestone, h. 35 in. (88.9 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Bequest of Edith and Milton Lowenthal In 1939 Flannagan's stated aim as a sculptor was "to create a plastic idiom alive as the spoken word; sculpture as direct and swift in feeling as a drawing, sculpture with such ease, freedom and simplicity that it hardly seems carved but to have endured always." Jonah and the Whale: Rebirth Motif, produced two years before this statement, seems to epitomize all of these qualities. It is one of fifty stone sculptures, primarily depicting animals, that Flannagan created between 1933 and 1939. Its simple eloquence is derived from the organic shape of the stone, the fluid lines incised by the artist, and the readily recog- nizable Bible story, as well as from the direct- carving methods Flannagan employed. The artist started each project with a clear plan in mind and even sought out the specific stone in which he perceived the image "just bound up...awaiting release." However, since he did not use preparatory drawings or models, he was able to incorporate spontaneous changes and accidental occurrences into the making of the finished sculpture. Jonah and the Whale was carved from a large piece of bluestone that the artist had kept in his studio for two years. It was found near Woodstock, New York, which the artist visited frequently between 1924 and 1936. The incised image of Jonah curled fetally inside the belly of the whale relates to two major themes that recur in Flannagan's work: a pantheistic belief that all living things are integrally related, which led him to produce many animal figures; and a fascination with the life cycle-birth, growth, decay, death-and the hope for a rebirth. Here, Jonah, one of the minor prophets in the Old Testament, is already captive inside the great whale, his punishment for trying to avoid divine orders to reform the people of Nineveh. Jonah's eventual release from the whale and his acceptance of God's will are often related to Christ's Resurrection and explain why the artist appended Rebirth Motif to the title. Jonah and the Whale, one of three Flannagan sculptures purchased by the Lowenthals between 1943 and 1945, was prominently displayed in their New York apartment (see page 7). O. LOUIS GUGLIELMI American, 1906-1956; born in Egypt. Totem and Bridge, 1952. Oil on canvas, 325/8 x 261/2 in. (82.9 x 67.3 cm). Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts. Gift of Milton Lowenthal, New York, 1959 Guglielmi became a recognized figure in American art in the mid-1930s, when his real- istic (some called it magic-realistic) paintings were created to provide social commentary. His work was included in several group shows at the Museum of Modern Art in the 1930s and 1940s, including "American Realists and Magic Realists" in 1943, when he showed fifteen paintings. The Downtown Gallery also held three one-man shows for Guglielmi, in 1938, 1948, and 1951. Despite the acclaim he received during his lifetime, his untimely death in 1956, when he was just fifty, brought a swift end to the popularity of his works. The picture the Lowenthals purchased, Totem and Bridge, is a brightly colored abstrac- tion that exemplifies Guglielmi's attempts to find a new style of painting after World War II. (His earlier, Social-Realistic work did not con- form to the Lowenthals' artistic interests.) After 1945 the artist became much more experi- mental, and his pictures reflected a dramatic change from sharp, almost illustrational real- ism to geometrically abstracted scenes of urban life. Guglielmi explained his intentions in 1950: "The creative artist does not try an escape to the past. It is his creative responsi- bility to create new form new shapes new images that are adjusted to his time." For Guglielmi this meant creating pictures that expressed the "exuberance and organic means of life itself. Free from restraint, full of imagery of shapes moving in space." In Totem and Bridge the flat, strictly geometric organization of the compositional elements is offset by the garish colors, the small painterly passages, and the whimsical "cutout" figures, which seem incongruous in the otherwise strict precisionism of the work. The subject is an urban scene, most likely of New York City, where the artist lived. A construction site with workers and a huge diagonal crane (the "totem") is set against a backdrop of massive buildings and the delicate framework of a bridge. 24</page><page sequence="20">ROBERT GWATHMEY American, 1903-1988. Vacationist, 1945. Oil on canvas, 501/16 x 30 in. (127.2 x 76.2 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Milton Lowenthal Gwathmey, whose work was included in the "Artists for Victory" exhibition, was among the very first artists that the Lowenthals collected when they began to buy American works in 1943. That year they purchased both the oil End of Day (1942) and the watercolor Pick Until the Rain Hits (1941-43). Vacationist, a much larger and more monumental oil paint- ing, was added to their collection in 1946, after they saw it in Gwathmey's one-man show at A.C.A. Gallery in New York. (The Lowenthals also loaned End of Day to that show.) Although Gwathmey's work often has an underlying social message about the injustices caused by race and class, his paintings are not confrontational or overtly political. Rather, they present a sympathetic view of the human condition, particularly of the rural farmworkers and field hands in the South, where the artist was born and raised. This painting, however, presents a lighter, more droll commentary on the circumstances of the average middle-class worker who, after day in and day out at a rou- tine job, finally gets to enjoy the freedom of vacation only two weeks out of the year. In the artist's words, this is the person who will "go to the beach and get some sunshine, a tan, and...goes back to the office and talks about the crab he caught." If the weary look on the man's face is any indication, however, the attempt to attain a year's worth of pleasure in two weeks' time is as tiring as the job he left behind. Standing before us, net and crab in hand, the lumbering figure fills the entire space with his towering presence. The seg- mented body, dark outlines, decorative design, and vibrant colors are characteristic of the style of painting that Gwathmey had developed by the mid-1940s. 25</page><page sequence="21">MARSDEN HARTLEY American, 1877-1943. Flower Abstraction, 1914. Oil on canvas, with painted frame, 493/8 x 42 in. (125.4 x 106.7 cm). Collection of Dr. and Mrs. Meyer P Potamkin In 1944 the Lowenthals bought the first of thirteen paintings they would own by Hartley. These constitute the largest group of individual works by a single artist in their collection. That Hartley was so prominently represented not only reflected their own personal taste but also (albeit posthumously) acknowledged the important role that Hartley played in the devel- opment of modern art in America. No other artist of his generation was so well able to synthesize the lessons of pre-World War I European Modernism and then apply them to an American preference for direct subject matter and style. By 1952, when the Lowenthals obtained their last Hartley, they had amassed an impressive and varied array of the artist's output, ranging in date from 1914 to 1943. All but two of their acquisi- tions were purchased from Paul Rosenberg, who showed Hartley's work in his New York gallery from 1942 to 1960. The two excep- tions-Flower Abstraction and Handsome Drinks (1916)-were bought by the Lowenthals at auction in March of 1946 from the collection of New York dealer Charles L. Daniel, an early collector of Hartley's oeuvre. Flower Abstraction is a prime example of the work that Hartley produced during his sec- ond stay in Berlin (March 1914-December 1915). Evident here are various aspects of European Modernism that Hartley assimilated during his trips abroad, for example the com- positional structure of Synthetic Cubism, the bright colors of German Expressionism, and the radiating disks of French Orphism. Robert Delaunay's huge Orphic painting Homage to Bleriot (1914; Kunstmuseum, Basel), which Hartley saw in Paris when he was en route to Berlin, may have been the catalyst for Flower Abstraction. Hartley's overlapping disks, arcs, and bands, however, unlike Delaunay's, are presented in extreme close-up and seem to be cropped from a much larger composition. Their explosive energy is hardly contained within the edges of the canvas and, indeed, continues onto the picture frame, which was painted by the artist. Although the "sunflower" disk in the upper left corner of the composi- tion and the yellows, pinks, and greens used throughout may have suggested the title (which is indicated in the Lowenthals' hand- written inventory), Flower Abstraction's close connection to another 1914 work, titled Pre- War Pageant (Columbus Museum of Art, Ohio), relates it more convincingly to Hartley's famous early series of abstract military emblems. 26</page><page sequence="22">MARSDEN HARTLEY Handsome Drinks, 1916. Oil on composition board, 24 x 20 in. (61 x 50.8 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Milton Lowenthal When Hartley returned to New York from Berlin in December 1915, he found that strong anti- German sentiment in America cautioned against his painting or showing any more German military paintings. Denied this power- ful stimulus, which had been the focus of his work for the preceding two years, Hartley attempted to ingratiate himself into the American art scene by producing a series of more neutral still lifes. Among these, Handsome Drinks was immediately included in "The Forum Exhibition of Modern American Painters," held at the Anderson Galleries, New York, in March 1916. Although Hartley insisted that paintings like this contained "no hidden symbolism whatsoever" and that "the forms are only those which I have observed casually from day to day," critics of the time, and we today, suspect some covert meaning. Handsome Drinks presents a careful- and probably symbolic-placement of four drinking vessels on a rounded table. Presiding over the scene, in the center rear, is a large chalice, from which the top half of a mandorla arises. The shape also appears in other Hartley works of the period and may be a ref- erence to the mandorlas in which Christ is often painted. In the foreground below the chalice are three smaller vessels. At lower left is a stem goblet containing absinthe, identifi- able by its green color and by the sugar cube on a spoon. Absinthe was a popular liqueur in the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen- turies, even though it was thought to cause hallucinations, mental deterioration, and steril- ity. In the center front is a Manhattan cocktail with a cherry inside, and at right are a cup and saucer. The cup-and-saucer motif figured prominently in another Hartley painting of the period, One Portrait of One Woman (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis), thought to be an abstract portrait of the writer Gertrude Stein. If Handsome Drinks also was meant to be an abstract portrait, the identity of the subject or subjects has remained a mystery for eighty years. Even the letters written on either side of the chalice, which do not seem to form any recognizable name or word, do not provide the necessary clue. 27</page><page sequence="23">MARSDEN HARTLEY American, 1877-1943. The Last Look of John Donne, 1940. Oil on academy board, 281/8 x 22 in. (71.4 x 55.8 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Milton Lowenthal Two years after Hartley painted his "archaic" portrait of Albert Pinkham Ryder (see page 10) he produced this homage to the great seventeenth-century English metaphysical poet John Donne (1572-1631), whose work Hartley greatly admired. In terms of style, color, medium, size, and composition, the two works were conceived of as companion pieces, each paying tribute to a great creative mind. For Hartley, Donne's intellectual analyses of complex human emotions, conveyed through macabre imagery, irony, and paradox and expressed in vernacular language, provided a shining example for his own paintings. Hartley's painted portrait is based on an engraved likeness that was used as the frontis- piece for a posthumously published volume of Donne's last sermon, "Death's duell," deliv- ered when Donne was dean of Saint Paul's Cathedral, London. The same image was also used to carve the marble effigy of the poet that still lies in the cathedral. Both engraving and sculpture were based on a portrait draw- ing, in which he is covered with a shroud, that Donne commissioned during the last days of his final illness. Here, in Hartley's painting, the corporeality of the poet's waning existence is entirely hidden beneath the heavy pleated fab- ric that entombs him within its stonelike col- umn. Only his gaunt face, completely impas- sive, is visible; his eyes are closed, his mouth is slightly open. In positioning this painting as the companion piece to Albert Pinkham Ryder, Hartley offers interesting comparisons between the two men, each at the end of his life. Both figures fill the space of the composition with their enormous presence, but where Ryder's body is robust and massive, Donne's has all but disappeared inside its covering. Both seem to be no longer connected to this world. Ryder's dark eyes are wide open, but they stare out at the viewer, blank and unfocused; Donne's lids, on the other hand, are shut with fatigue but seem to suggest a repose of deep introspection as the poet reckons with his imminent death. MARSDEN HARTLEY Evening Storm, Schoodic, Maine, No. 2, 1942. Oil on fabricated board, 30 x 40 in. (76.2 x 101.6 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Bequest of Edith and Milton Lowenthal In Evening Storm, Schoodic, Maine, No. 2 Hartley uses a compositional arrangement and shapes very similar to those in Mt. Katahdin (see page 11) but for a marinescape. As the conical focus of the painting, Hartley substi- tutes for the mountain a high jagged wall of water as it rises and peaks above rocks. Cloud formations much like those in Mt. Katahdin also animate the sky, and a strip of blocklike rocks replaces the lake in the foreground. Although the scene suggests the ebb and flow of tumultuous movement (as does the title), Hartley renders the wave as a large solid mass. One historian wrote that Hartley "has immobi- lized the form, making the crashing wave as substantial and monumental as a mountain. The water has the brutal force of Homer's late paintings, but not the effervescence. Hartley is in search of permanence, not movement. For him even liquids must acquire permanence." This painting is one of at least three ver- sions (of comparable size and medium) that Hartley made of this subject between 1941 and 1942 (the other two are in the Worcester Art Museum, Mass., and the Museum of 28</page><page sequence="24">Modern Art, N.Y). For all three the scene depicted seems originally to have derived from the lower third of Hartley's slightly earlier seascape The Lighthouse (1940-41; William A. M. Burden, N.Y). While the locale for The Lighthouse is Portland Harbor, Maine, the set- ting for the other three paintings (as indicated by their titles) is Schoodic Point, in Acadia National Park, near the remote fishing village of Corea, where Hartley lived from 1940 to 1941. In 1942, the year that this painting was done, Hartley had moved to an inland section of northeastern Maine, away from the coast. This fact supports the knowledge that he often painted pictures from memory. Interest in his Maine seascapes (which he had begun to do only in 1936) evoked some critical acclaim. Hartley's work did not sell well during his lifetime, leaving him in perpetual financial crisis. The Maine seascapes, however, were fairly well received in the marketplace (some selling to museums during the last years of his life). The Museum of Modern Art pur- chased their version of Evening Storm, Schoodic, Maine in 1943 and included it in their 1943-44 exhibition "Romantic Painting in America." That exhibition was surely seen by the Lowenthals, who had lent to it two paint- ings (John Pellew, East River Nocture No. 2, and Max Weber, Hasidic Dance; see page 15). In 1945 they purchased this painting, their third by Hartley. JOSEPH HIRSCH American, 1910-1981. The Prisoner, 1942. Oil on canvas, 44 x 301/4 in. (111.8 x 76.8 cm). Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. Gift of Edith and Milton Lowenthal Even before his work was seen by the Lowenthals in "Artists for Victory," Hirsch had exhibited widely and had received several pres- tigious awards and fellowships. The Prisoner, which was one of the Lowenthals very first pur- chases (in February 1943), had previously won honorable mention in the "Fifty-third Annual Exhibition of American Paintings and Sculpture" at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1942 and had been reproduced on the cover of Art Digest in November of that year. The subject of the painting was particularly timely for 1942. A young German soldier, still dressed in full uniform, speaks to an unidenti- fied interrogator, whose presence is indicated only by the hands, in the lower left corner of the painting, holding a clipboard and writing. The soldier's demeanor is surprisingly casual and nonthreatened as he wearily imparts mili- tary information to his captor while drinking a cup of coffee. Hirsch presents the human face of the war, enabling our sympathies to lie as much with the predicament of the young German prisoner as with the noble cause of the Allied forces. In a statement made in 1942 in the catalogue for the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition "Americans 1942: Eighteen Artists from Nine States," Hirsch explained that the function of his art was to instill in others the artist's world view... In my painting I want to castigate the things I hate and paint monu- ments to what I feel is noble....Ours is an era of accelerated transition, this is the sea- son for weapons....The real men of art have invariably been keenly aware of the world around them. So it strikes me that a re- affirmation... in the common ordinary man will be as natural as was, for example, the emphasis by El Greco, in his day, on his faith in the Church. The cause of democracy is the cause of creative art, and the contempo- rary artist who cherishes his art freedom will accordingly fight for the democracy in which it flourishes. The Prisoner is one of several war images that Hirsch produced about 1940-42, prior to his becoming an official artist-correspondent between 1943 and 1944. This painting remained with the Lowenthals until 1953, when it was one of two works given to the Whitney Museum of American Art following its 1952-53 exhibition of the Lowenthal Collection. 29</page><page sequence="25">No. 9 No. 11 No. 6 JACOB LAWRENCE American, born 1917.

(35.6 x 50.8 cm) From December 4 to 29, 1945, Lawrence's twenty-two-part John Brown series was exhib- ited at the Downtown Gallery in his third one- man show there in four years. The sequence recounts the thoughts and actions of the white abolitionist John Brown, whose final raid on a federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (in December 1859), led to his capture and exe- cution and heightened tensions prior to the Civil War. A review of the show called these pic- tures "powerful and compelling" and reported that the Lowenthals had purchased the entire group of works on opening day. Over the next two years (1946-48) the paintings circulated around the country in an exhibition organized by the Boston Institute of Modern Art and the American Federation of Arts. By the time the Lowenthals acquired the series, the twenty- eight-year-old Lawrence had already achieved considerable recognition, not only through his gallery shows but also because of the purchase of his sixty-panel Migration of the Negro series (by the Museum of Modern Art, N.Y, and the Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C., in 1942) and his winning of a $500 purchase prize at "Artists for Victory" (where The Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired his gouache on paper Pool Parlor, acc. no. 42.167). Although the John Brown pictures were first exhibited in 1945, they had actually been painted four years earlier, while the artist and his bride were in New Orleans on an extended trip through the South. Preparations for the series had been started before their trip, including intensive research in the New York Public Library. There, Lawrence had read Franklin B. Sanborn's 1885 book The Life and Letters of John Brown, Liberator of Kansas and Martyr of Virginia, which likened Brown to Christ. In Lawrence's rendering of Brown's abolitionist crusade and eventual martyrdom, he, too, draws this analogy, making the point visually by including the crucifix in several pic- tures and by beginning the sequence with an image of Christ on the cross and ending it with Brown's body hanging in a similar composition. As he had done in his four previous multipart works-Toussaint-L'ouverture (1937), Frederick Douglass (1938), Harriet Tubman (1939), and Migration of the Negro (1940)-Lawrence wrote a caption for each panel to describe the depicted narrative.

In the John Brown series the compositions are graphically dramatic, filled with strong diag- onal movement and receding spaces. Most scenes contain figures engaged in meetings or combat, but some are more contemplative or poignantly empty. The complexities of Lawrence's designs and narratives are offset by the flat, simplified forms and the use of strong color, dramatic light, and dark contrasts. The gouache medium that the artist favored enabled him to work quickly with great fresh- ness of effect. However, his experiments at producing a homemade gouache (made from ground pigments, rabbit-skin glue, and water, dripped through cheesecloth) have not proved durable. Over time, severe flaking of the surfaces has forced the Detroit Institute of Arts (which now owns the series; see note) to deny any loan requests for these works. Instead, the museum is only able to lend a set of silk- screened prints made in 1974-77 after the original gouache paintings (with the artist's cooperation). Comparing the gouaches, illus- trated here, to the silk screens, visitors to the Lowenthal Collection exhibition at the Metro- politan Museum will see that the silk-screened prints were not intended to be precise tran- No. 15: John Brown made many trips to Canada organizing for his assault on Harpers Ferry, 20 x 14 in.

City Lights, 1940. Oil on canvas, 54 x 36 in. (137.2 x 91.4 cm). Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, Memphis, Tennessee. Gift of Edith and Milton Lowenthal City Lights, by Levine (who was a second-prize winner in the "Artists for Victory" exhibition), was the third work acquired by the Lowenthals from the Downtown Gallery, in 1943. Although it remained their only example of Levine's paint- ing, it was an intriguing picture and was kept in their collection for thirty-five years, until 1978, when it was given to the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, Memphis, Tennessee. Levine's work of the 1930s and 1940s may be classified as Social Realism, as are the paintings of Ben Shahn and Jacob Lawrence (both also repre- sented by the Downtown Gallery), Robert Gwathmey, and Joseph Hirsch, all of whom had works in the Lowenthal Collection. Together these pictures, which offer social commentary, form a special subset within the collection. Not surprisingly, considering their anomalous rela- tionship to the rest of the holdings, these pieces were all acquired during the formative years of the collection (1943-46), before the Lowenthals' taste in art had fully developed. Born and raised in Boston, Levine spent the first forty years of his life there before relocating to New York City in 1945. His depictions of people and places reflected the details (i.e., street signs and buildings) of the locale in which he lived at the time. Levine frequently produced several versions of a particular theme over the course of a year or two. In the case of City Lights, the meeting of three men (facing left, center, and right) and a skeleton on a brick street in Boston is closely based on a much smaller oil painted the previous year (City Lights No. 1, 1939; Midtown Galleries, N.Y), itself a variation on his large 1938 canvas The Street (Museum of Modern Art, N.Y), and all of the related paintings. Although Levine often used such works to make satirical statements about corruption in government, odd political bedfellows, or personality conceits of various members of society, his motivation here was much more personal. The death of his father in 1939 led him to paint this homage while feeling "a certain kind of preoccupation with blackness and death and sorrow." Just as his father had been a simple working man, the men in this pic- ture symbolize Everyman. "Behind and above them [is] some sort of ghostly figure, which could even be my father laid out in his coffin... a skeleton, but there's something like a white skull cap and a prayer shawl wrapped around it and under the jaws." The lantern at lower left, which often appears in Levine's work, may rep- resent the one beacon of hope in this otherwise macabre and melancholy scene. JACQUES LIPCHITZ American, 1891-1973. Portrait of Marsden Hartley, 1942. Bronze, edition 1/7, h. 141/2 in. (36.8 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Gift of the Edith and Milton Lowenthal Foundation Inc., in memory of Carl Selden Although the realistic sculpture by Lipchitz does not seem to fit stylistically or thematically with the rest of the Lowenthals' holdings, it was probably acquired because its subject, the painter Marsden Hartley, figured so prominently in their collection. In the same year (1952) that the Lowenthals purchased their last Hartley painting they also acquired this monumental head. The making of the portrait came about in 1941-42, after the two artists met unexpect- edly at an exhibition opening. Lipchitz, a pri- marily Expressionist sculptor, had just emigrated to New York from France and was on the alert for a good portrait subject, which he hoped would generate future commissions and income. He recalled seeing a man at the open- ing party who seemed "to have a typical Amer- ican face" and asked whether he would consent to pose for him before he even knew who the man was. Lipchitz was drawn to Hartley's "marvelous" head with its high fore- head, large sunken eyes, and beaklike nose, which the sculptor described as being "strong and...very, very sweet and almost feminine in his face." On Hartley's part, he had admired Lipchitz's work since 1935, when he first saw it in an exhibition at the Brummer Gallery in New York. In his written account "Posing for Lipchitz" (ca. 1942-43, published posthumously), Hartley called him "the only modern sculptor that has ever moved me." Although the two were never close, they respected one another and admired each other's work. (Hartley owned a drawing by Lipchitz.) After twenty-eight sittings Lipchitz made two portrait heads: a large one of Hartley look- ing straight ahead and a smaller one of him asleep with his head resting on his hand. Both poses were produced in unique terracottas and in cast-bronze editions. The Lowenthals owned one of the seven bronze casts made of the more formal head; the Metropolitan acquired the related terracotta in 1942 (acc. no. 42.142). 32</page><page sequence="28">STANTON MACDONALD-WRIGHT American, 1890-1973. Synchromy No. 3, 1917. Oil on canvas, 39 x 38 in. (99 x 96.5 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Bequest of Edith and Milton Lowenthal One of the gems of the Lowenthal Collection is this colorful Synchromist painting by Macdonald-Wright, which is the only work by this innovative early-twentieth-century Modernist to be represented in the Lowenthals' holdings. It was acquired from Weyhe Gallery in New York on January 13, 1953 (the only work they acquired that year), just after 101 pieces from the Lowenthal Collection went on view in a touring exhibition that was seen at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (October 1-November 2, 1952), and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (November 28, 1952-January 17, 1953). The exhibition allowed the Lowenthals to review their entire collection for the first time. Their subsequent purchase of this painting and one by Georgia O'Keeffe (in 1958; see page 35)-works by two important artists not previously included in their collection-may have been an attempt to present in their holdings a more definitive survey of American Modernism. As a picture from 1917, Synchromy No. 3 falls outside the main scope of the Lowenthal Collection. Its acquisition, however, added strength to their few select examples of World War I Modernism by Marsden Hartley, John Marin, and Max Weber. Together these paint- ings indicate the strong influence that Cubism had on the development of early-twentieth- century American art. For Macdonald-Wright and his fellow artist Morgan Russell, both of whom were working in France about 1912, Cubism, particularly the Orphism of Robert Delaunay, provided the structural foundation for their theories of painting, based on color relationships, which they called Synchromism. Macdonald-Wright followed the Synchromist principles from about 1912 to 1919. As evi- denced by -Synchromy No. 3, his best work was a lively mix of intersecting translucent planes and a spectrum of bright colors. Human figures and everyday objects were his primary sub- jects. Here, a room interior becomes a shifting kaleidoscope in which forms advance and recede, some solidifying, others being fractured by light into thin veils of color. Although the scene is not easily read, we can make out a wooden chair with vertical slats at the far right, a table set with a plate of fruit at center left, and perhaps the green leaves of a plant farther left. As the artist wrote about his Synchromist works in the foreword of the catalogue for his 1917 exhibition at Stieglitz's "291" gallery: "My ambition is to create an art which stands half way between music and architecture." 33</page><page sequence="29">JOHN MARIN American, 1870-1953. Street Movement, New York City, 1932. Watercolor on paper, 255/8 x 205/8 in. (65 x 52.3 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Bequest of Edith and Milton Lowenthal Throughout the twentieth century New York City has been a favored subject for both realist and abstract artists of many different schools. For artists, such as Marin, whose roots were found in Cubism, the city was a three-dimensional realization of that movement's theories of simultaneity and faceted construction. After training in Europe from 1905 to 1910, Marin returned to New York in early 1911 and created a number of Cubo-Futuristic works that glorified sites such as the Brooklyn Bridge, the sixty-story Woolworth Building, and the steeple of Saint Paul's Chapel (at Broadway and Fulton Street). In the foreword to the cata- logue for his 1913 exhibition of New York watercolors, Marin expressed his feelings about the city, which continued to inform his later work as well: "I see great forces at work; great movements; the warring of the great and the small....While these powers are at work push- ing, pulling, sideways, downwards, upwards, I can hear the sound of their strife and there is great music being played. And so I try to express graphically what a great city is doing." In Street Movement, New York City Marin cre- ates a dense abstract relief of overlapping rec- tangles and diagonal lines that suggests a busy intersection in midtown Manhattan. Buildings, billboards, lights, streets, and people are blurred together by the pulsating rhythm that drives the city forward. JOHN MARIN Movement, Nassau Street, No. 2, 1936. Watercolor on paper, 261/8 x 20 /8 in. (66.3 x 51 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Bequest of Edith and Milton Lowenthal By 1920 Marin's views of New York City no longer focused on single buildings but on the entire environment of buildings and people involved in what he called a mad dance in which "everything became alive...Buildings- streets-people-become a solid mass of moving aliveness...with a kind of order to it all." The underlying sense of order that he perceived within the dynamic movement is particularly apparent in this late schematic watercolor. Here, Marin has visually demarcat- ed different elements of the scene with dark borders, for example, a woman in the lower right corner, the collected mass of pedestrians, and a row of buildings. Together, however, these individual pieces fit into one another like an odd-shaped jigsaw puzzle. Movement, Nassau Street, No. 2 is one of at least seven variations on this same composition that Marin made in 1936. While others in the series evoke a greater sense of outward motion, this one is extremely stylized, controlling all of the street's energy as if it were pulling inward on itself. Although over the years Marin did create oil paintings on canvas, the largest part of his oeuvre consisted of-and his artistic reputa- tion rested solely on-the masterful watercolors that he produced for almost fifty years. Ever since his early exhibitions at Stieglitz's gallery, beginning in 1909, Marin's work had sold well. By the time the Lowenthals purchased their first Marin watercolor, Pine Tree (1917), in 1945 and his two later watercolors of New York in 1952, the prices commanded for his works on paper were considerably higher than for many artists on canvas. The acquisition of Street Movement and Movement, Nassau Street just prior to the entire collection being shown at the Whitney Museum in October 1952 may reflect the Lowenthals' desire at this time to exhibit a fuller representation of the early masters of twentieth-century American art. 34</page><page sequence="30">GEORGIA O'KEEFFE American, 1887-1986. Ram's Head, White Hollyhock-Hills, 1935. Oil on canvas, 30 x 36 in. (76.2 x 91.5 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Bequest of Edith and Milton Lowenthal In 1929 O'Keeffe made the first of many extended visits to New Mexico (where she eventually moved in 1949), and almost imme- diately her paintings were filled with images that evoked that part of the country. Of particu- lar interest to her were the majestic land for- mations and animal bones that she collected in the desert. What to some might seem an eerie specter of skeletal remains took on a deep sig- nificance for the artist, who wrote that "they are as beautiful as anything I know....The bones seem to cut sharply to the center of something that is keenly alive on the desert." These powerful motifs were readily adapted to O'Keeffe's already developed style, which combined an almost photographic realism with a strong sense of abstract design. The intensity of light and color that distinguishes her New Mexico paintings from her previous work reflected not only the natural conditions of the Southwestern setting but also the artist's renewed enthusiasm for painting after several difficult years. She began to experiment freely with juxtaposing disassociated images in the same picture. In Ram's Head, White Holly- hock-Hills, for instance-the Lowenthals' only example of O'Keeffe's work-the artist inter- jects into a panoramic landscape two close-up studies, of an animal skull and a flower. The incongruity of scale and perspective between these elements is dramatic and startling. The gently rolling sand hills of the Rio Grande Valley (west of Taos), which form an undulating mass at the bottom of the canvas, are depicted with- out much specificity, as if seen from a great dis- tance and from a high vantage point. The skull and flower motifs, on the other hand, are shown in scrupulous detail at close range. The strictly frontal view of the ram's head emphasizes its exotic contour, while the slightly upward tilt of the hollyhock reveals its shallow depth. Although the individual images are realistically described, there is no verisimilitude to the scene. O'Keeffe's painting joined the Lowenthal Collection in 1958 as a relatively late addition and was exhibited the following year at the Whitney Museum of American Art in a group show, "The Museum and Its Friends: Second Loan Exhibition." 35</page><page sequence="31">ABRAHAM RATTNER American, 1893-1978. Fisherman, 1943. Oil on canvas, 32 x 255/8 in. (81.3 x 65 cm). Collection of the Estate of Edith A. Lowenthal, on extended loan to the Brooklyn Museum Rattner had already established his reputation as an Expressionist painter, both here and in Europe, by 1943, when the Lowenthals first started to collect his work. The artist, then fifty years old, had only recently returned to New York (in 1940) after living in France for twenty years, because of the German invasion of Paris. While Rattner came to his maturity as a painter in Europe, he was readily embraced by America when he returned. His work from the period was included in two important books on the art of that time, which the Lowenthals probably saw: New Frontiers of American Painting (1943), by Samuel Kootz, and Abstract and Surrealist Painting in America (1944), by Sidney Janis. Throughout the 1940s Rattner's paintings reflected his deep concerns about the war and his strong disappointment in America's initial response of apathy and isolationism. In an effort to awaken some moral outrage, he pro- duced a number of what he called "violent Christ compositions." Rattner, who was Jewish, used the widely recognized Christian symbol of the Crucifixion to represent the wartime suffer- ing inflicted upon all mankind (Jew and Gentile alike). His powerful canvas Descent from the Cross (Art Institute of Chicago) was seen by the Lowenthals in "Artists for Victory," and in 1942 and 1943 his work was presented in one-man and group shows at Paul Rosenberg and Company. In December 1943 the Lowenthals purchased from Rosenberg three of their eight Rattner pictures: Fisherman, Jeweled Christ, and The Letter. With only two exceptions, the images in the eight works in the collection make use of Christian iconography, suggesting that the universal message intended by the artist was understood by the Lowenthals, who them- selves had strong ties to the Jewish community. A deep friendship grew out of these early purchases, and numerous letters from Rattner can be found in the Lowenthal Papers now at the Archives of American Art, Washington, D.C. Rattner's painting of a fisherman returning from work is both a genre scene and a religious icon. As the artist noted, the composition was painted after a trip to Martha's Vineyard (where boating and fishing are popular activities). A young man is laden down with the tools of this trade (ropes, pulleys, poles, and net), while over his shoulder hangs his meager catch. Although the scene is based on observed reality, Rattner also meant to signify "a fisherman of Galilee, caught in the struggle of the load he carries, which itself also suggests wings and redemption through suffering." ABRAHAM RATTNER Transcendence, 1943. Oil on canvas, 317/8 x 393/16 in. (81 x 99.5 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Gift of the Edith and Milton Lowenthal Foundation Inc. The religious implications are clear in Rattner's painting Transcendence, more so than in Fisherman, also of 1943. Here, the deposed figure of Christ is seen, scarred and bloodied, in front of a large cross (partially visible in the upper left). A small group of followers, huddled together beneath Christ's looming presence, fearfully eye the sinister band of masked sol- diers who stalk the darkness at lower left. Christ's growing spiritual transcendence is made visible through the use of light, which illuminates his body, and color and by the incredible transformation of Christ's head. Using a device that he first introduced in 1939, Rattner repeats the head in sequential, over- lapping planes that change in age and expres- sion as each approaches the upright position. The crucified Christ is depicted first as an aged and lifeless being with a sorrowful face. But slowly, as his spirit is awakened and embraced by God (whose outstretched hand touches another hand, possibly Christ's), and as angel wings appear (in the background at upper right), Christ's features change dramatically to those of a wide-eyed youth. 36</page><page sequence="32">In a related painting of the same year, Hallucination (collection Earle Ludgin, Chicago), the transformed figure is not Christ but an artist, holding a palette and brushes. In that canvas the head of Christ and a winged angel appear behind and to the side of the fig- ure of the artist, while one of his canvases, dis- playing a radiant sun, stands on an easel at upper left. Keeping this image in mind, in Transcendence we can recognize the shape of an artist's palette hovering over the folded arms of Christ like a ghostly apparition and can identify the glowing sun from the artist's can- vas, similarly placed in the upper left corner. The visual connections between artist and Savior made by Rattner in these paintings are confirmed by Rattner's own statement: "It is myself that is on the cross, though I am attempting to express a universal theme- man's inhumanity to man." ABRAHAM RATTNER Figures Waiting, 1947. Oil on canvas, 391/2 x 59 in. (100.3 x 149.9 cm). Collection of Madison Art Center, Wisconsin. Gift of the Edith and Milton Lowenthal Collection Figures Waiting was painted in 1947, the year that Rattner's first wife, Bettina Bedwell, died. In November the Lowenthals purchased this painting (one of only eight pieces added to their collection in 1947). It was their sixth and largest oil painting by Rattner; two pen-and-ink drawings were the last Rattners to be acquired (both gifts from the artist in 1952). Rattner and Bedwell had married in France in 1924, while she was a fashion correspon- dent there for a newspaper syndicate. The cen- tral importance of the seated female figure in this composition and the artist's inscription on the front left of the canvas-"to Bettina"- strongly suggest that this picture was created as a memorial to his wife. Compared with the other four figures at the table, she is clearly the most poised and serene, exuding a Madonna- like grace that differentiates and elevates her from the rest of the group. Surrounded by their awkward bodies and worried faces, she seems spiritually distant from their worldly uncertain- ties. Specific elements of the composition that often appear in Rattner's paintings of the 1940s, like the lit candle (top left) and the cross (top right), imbue the scene with religious symbolism. The heavy outlines used to describe the figures and the setting, as well as the juxtaposition of bright and intense dark colors, approximate the luminous effect of stained-glass windows viewed from inside a church. Such windows were frequently studied by Rattner and his wife during the 1930s on their many visits to Chartres Cathedral and other nearby churches. 37</page><page sequence="33">PAUL SAMPLE American, 1896-1974. Lamentations V:18 (The Fox Hunt), 1938. Oil on canvas, 30/8 x 36'/8 in. (76.5 x 91.8 cm). Addison Gallery of American Art, Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts. Gift of Milton Lowenthal, in recognition of the 25th Anniversary of the Addison Gallery, 1956 Among the very first paintings bought by the Lowenthals-in January 1943, following their many visits to the "Artists for Victory" show- was this one by Sample. Although the Lowenthals purchased many other landscapes, this is the only example in their collection by a Regionalist. Like Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood, with whose works Sample's paintings are often compared, the artist celebrated a vision of rural America that is almost always romanticized and moralistic. In Lamentations V:18 Sample depicts a pristine but barren hillside blanketed with freshly fallen snow. Even the scattering along the slope of eight men with rifles and four blood- hounds does not seem to disturb the eerie stillness of the scene. Silhouetted in sharp out- line, men and beasts look like cutout paper dolls placed on the surface of the landscape. Their poses signify movement, but they, like the setting, seem inert. Sample's close atten- tion to the descriptive details of clothing and posture emphasizes the importance of the nar- rative being told over the objectives of pure landscape painting. The setting is based on Sample's many visits to Vermont throughout the years to see his wife's family in Montpelier and to attend Dartmouth College in Hanover, first as a student, beginning in September 1938, and then as an artist in residence through 1962. In style and subject the picture shows the strong influence of the sixteenth-century Flemish artist Pieter Brueghel the Elder, whose work Sample greatly admired. Brueghel's painting, Hunters in the Snow (1565; Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) may have been the immediate source for Sample's exploration of this theme and may have been studied by Sample either in Europe, during his 1938 trip abroad, or in reproduction. Sample, however, noted only that the subject derived from his having participated in a fox hunt, hence the biblical reference in the title to Lamentations 5:18, which reads, "Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it." This was the first of two paintings that Sample titled with such citations; the other was The Auction-Matthew Vl:19 of 1939, which was one of Sample's entries in "Artists for Victory." Considered in the context of the precar- ious political situation of the world in 1938, on the verge of World War II, Sample's reference to Lamentations, in which the people of Jerusalem are following a path of destruction and self- destruction, seems to be sending a cautionary message in the guise of genre painting. MAX WEBER American, 1881-1961; born in Russia. Russian Ballet, 1916. Oil on canvas, 30 x 36 in. (76.2 x 91.4 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Bequest of Edith and Milton Lowenthal The Lowenthal Collection contained six works by Weber, including one watercolor on paper. A seventh painting (Poor Fishing, 1936, oil on canvas, purchased in 1945) was returned to the artist in 1946 and subsequently destroyed because its condition had irreparably deterio- rated. The final selection, of works acquired between 1943 and 1962, presents both the early and late stages in the artist's stylistic development, beginning with his experiments with Cubism and Futurism in the mid- to late 1910s and jumping directly to his mature, expressionistically painted narratives of the 1940s. Russian Ballet was purchased in 1945 from Paul Rosenberg and Company, the second of Weber's works to be acquired by the Lowenthals (Hasidic Dance was the first, in 1943; see page 15). It is an exuberant and ambitious composition that attempts to project the sights, sounds, and movements of a ballet performance in terms of Cubist and Futurist vocabulary. Having studied art in Europe between 1905 and 1908, Weber returned to the United States in 1909, fully open to avant-garde ideas. His early paintings, drawings, and sculptures 38 _ Ir</page><page sequence="34">display a great variety of styles, as he tried one and then another, emulating the most recent works by artists such as Picasso, Matisse, Delaunay, Rousseau, and Larionov, which he followed in current publications and exhibitions. During 1915 and 1916, Weber created some of his best works, a series of Cubo-Futurist pictures, including Rush Hour, New York (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.) and Grand Central Terminal (Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid), that use fragmented forms, diagonal lines, and radiating planes and arcs to effectively convey the dynamic motion of a busy metropolis. In Russian Ballet Weber uses similar devices to paint an interior scene that suggests a darkened theater, where one or two people are posed onstage within the circle of several spotlights. As the title and date of the painting indicate, these are impressions gathered during a performance of the Ballets Russes (under the direction of Sergey Diaghilev), most likely during their first New York season, either in January 1916 at the Century Theater or in April of that year at the Metropolitan Opera. Weber recalled many years later that he had attended the performance with the artist Arthur B. Davies. The angular mass in the lower center of Weber's painting correlates in spirit to some of the more stylized poses and costumes assumed by Diaghilev's dancers, most notably the legendary Nijinsky. MAX WEBER The Visit, 1919. Oil on canvas, 40 x 30 in. (101.6 x 76.2 cm). The Brooklyn Museum, New York. Bequest of Edith and Milton Lowenthal Between 1917 and 1919 Weber produced a number of paintings that were specifically fig- urative but in which the figures were depicted in a primitivist, semiabstract manner, akin to some of Wyndham Lewis's Vorticist figures and Picasso's costume designs for the Ballets Russes's Parade (1917). Although Weber's characters are severely fragmented into flat planes, geometric shapes, and linear patterns and are hard to differentiate from the surround- ing architecture and furnishings, the artist pro- vides just enough descriptive detail to at least cursorily identify them and the scene. In The Visit four people are intimately gathered in a domestic interior-a man on either end and two seated women, each of whom keeps an eye on the man nearest her. Elements of clothing and jewelry identify their gender. Both men wear brimmed hats. The standing gentleman at left is dressed in a long jacket and striped pants and carries a cane. The other man has all but disintegrated except for his prominent head, seen in profile (with a large eye, pointy nose, and stringy hair), and his slender trouser bottoms and small shoes near the turned chair leg. The women each have their hair parted in the middle and pulled back, which reveals a necklace on the one on the left and a hanging earring on the other. They are seated in armchairs, and their long skirts graze the floor. The formality of the scene and the deliberate pairings of the people into two couples suggest that this visit is part of a courtship ritual. Judging by the body language shown, the pair on the right seems amenable to their coupling, while the two on the left eye each other suspiciously. 39</page><page sequence="35">BEN SHAHN American, 1898-1969; born in Lithuania. The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti, 1931-32. Tempera on canvas, 841/2 x 48 in. (214.6 x 121.9 cm). Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. Gift of Edith and Milton Lowenthal in memory of Juliana Force Shahn's painting The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti holds a singular place in the Lowenthal Collection for several reasons. It is the only piece purchased by the Lowenthals specifically for a museum without first having been part of their own personal holdings. Motivated by the death in 1948 of Juliana Force-the Whitney Museum of American Art's founding director, whom they greatly admired for her ardent promotion of American art-in 1949 the Lowenthals presented this work in her memory. It is also notable for being the first gift to be accepted by that museum after Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney's initial donation of her collection in 1930. In size and subject the Shahn painting is also quite unusual for the Lowenthal Collection. Measuring seven by four feet, this tempera on canvas was never intended to be exhibited pri- vately but rather had been submitted by Shahn to the Museum of Modern Art's 1932 mural competition and exhibition as a full-scale detail of a larger mural. The imagery is decidedly political, taken directly from Shahn's series of twenty-three small gouaches on paper depicting incidents from the trial and execution of two Italian-American anarchists, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. Sacco and Vanzetti, a shoemaker and a fish peddler, respectively, had been charged with the murder of a paymaster and his guard during a robbery of a shoe factory in Massachusetts in 1920. Although they were convicted after a much publicized trial, many believed the case against them to be biased and inconclusive. Their subsequent execution in 1927 caused an international uproar. Shahn was among those who were incensed. His return to these events some four years later, in 1931-32, as a subject for his art, came about after he had produced (in 1930) a much smaller series of watercolors on another well- known incident, the Dreyfus case. Shahn said: "Ever since I could remember I'd wished that I'd been lucky enough to be alive at a great time- when something big was going on, like the Crucifixion. And suddenly I realized I was. Here I was living through another crucifixion. Here was something to paint." Shahn based his Sacco and Vanzetti series on materials he found at the New York Public Library, such as photographs in newspapers and in pamphlets published by their defense commit- tees. In The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti the two martyrs lie in their coffins. Standing directly behind them are the three members of the Lowell Committee, who, after reviewing the case in 1927, determined that no "racial feeling" had influenced the outcome. Their findings led to the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927. On the wall of the courthouse hangs a portrait of the judge who had presided over the trial. The visual power and political message of this painting caused new protests to erupt when it was announced that it was to be included in the Museum of Modern Art's mural show. A museum trustee went so far as to offer to pur- chase it just to keep it out of the exhibition. Shahn declined. Although the small gouaches of the initial Sacco and Vanzetti series had been quickly acquired from Shahn's 1932 show at the Downtown Gallery, this monumental coda to the series did not find a suitable home until it was purchased by the Lowenthals and presented to the Whitney Museum. 40</page><page sequence="36">Checklist of Works Formerly in the Edith and Milton Lowenthal Collection JOHN ATHERTON American, 1900-1952 Barn Detail 1942.

Bequest of Edith and Milton Lowenthal 53</page><page sequence="49">Notes Introduction p. 4, "a lifelong passion for the art of their own time": The Lowenthals, both native New Yorkers, were married in 1938 and began to collect art as a couple not long after Milton (1910-1987), known to family and friends as Mickey, received his law degree from Fordham University, and Edith (1909-1991) earned a master's degree in psychology from Columbia University. The Lowenthal Papers at the Archives of American Art, Washington, D.C., are informative about the types of printed sources that the Lowenthals consulted in their study of contemporary American art. Included are the scrapbooks they compiled, con- taining magazine and newspaper clippings and gallery catalogues. p. 4, "when they began to seri- ously study contemporary art": The Lowenthal Papers at the Archives of American Art, Washington, D.C., are informative about the types of printed sources that the Lowenthals consulted. Included are scrapbooks they compiled, which contain magazine and newspaper clippings and gallery catalogues. p. 4, "1,418 works by contempo- rary American artists": The 1,418 artworks exhibited (532 paintings and drawings, 305 sculptures, and 581 prints) were selected from a larger number of entries by a jury of thirty-six American artists appointed by Artists for Victory Inc. A second jury of seven museum professionals (directors and curators) appointed by the Metropolitan Museum chose the forty-one recipients of the pur- chase prizes (totaling $51,000)- 14 paintings, 13 sculptures, 3 drawings, and 11 prints-all of which were accessioned into the Metropolitan's collection. Two additional winners, who rejected the prize money, received medals instead. These medals went to Ivan Albright, for That Which I Should Have Done, I Did Not Do, and John Rogers Cox, for Grey and Gold. p. 4, "'expressing itself in canvas and stone"': Milton Lowenthal, 1952, quoted in John R.
