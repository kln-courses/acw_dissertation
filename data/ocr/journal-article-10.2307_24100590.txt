<plain_text><page sequence="1">GENERAL ARTICLES Existence and reality in mathematics and natural science* N. Mukunda It must appear somewhat presumptuous of me to venture to speak on the topic mentioned in the title of this lecture. No less a figure than Albert Einstein had once said: 'Behind the tireless efforts of the investigator there lurks a stronger, more mysterious desire: it is existence and reality that one wishes to comprehend. But one shrinks from the use of such words, for one soon gets into difficulties when one has to explain what is really meant by "reality" and by "comprehend" in such a general statement...'. Nevertheless, realizing full well that I am no profes sional in these matters, and running the risk of often being naive, let me proceed. From ancient times to the present there have been many deep and learned discussions on this subject. Many shades of reality have been discerned. Both philosophers and scientists, particularly physicists, have contributed to the debate. It also happens that with each major phase of development in physics, new vistas and pers pectives open up, which could not have been imagined previously. Our picture of reality changes constantly as we learn from nature. In recent times, to mention just a few names, thinkers like Reichenbach, Margenau and d'Espagnat, and in their general writings Schrödinger and Heisenberg, have expressed themselves on these matters. In my own limited attempt I will try to say something about physics, something about mathematics, and then of their links. Some points will be highlighted, and more questions raised than answered. We can trace the origins of mathematics to human and social needs and experiences in antiquity. Thus numbers and arithmetic most likely grew out of trade, barter and commerce; and geometry out of the need for land survey, especially after the annual floods of the Nile. To some degree at least - and this will be elaborated later - this capacity to create and use mathematical con cepts can be traced to features of the brain developed during phylogenesis - the long period of evolution of our species - subject to the pressures of natural selection while interacting with nature. The origins of the reali zation that mathematics is also useful in the description of natural phenomena is also very old-one thinks of N.

In the modern sense, the crucial role of mathematics in understanding nature was first clearly stated by Galileo1 in 1623: 'Philosophy is written in this very great book which always lies open before our eyes (I mean the universe), but one cannot understand it unless one first learns to understand the language and recognize the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical lan guage ... ; without these means it is humanly impossible to understand a word of it....' Around this time came Kepler's three laws of planetary motion and Galileo's laws for the motion of falling bodies. We must also remember that Galileo was the first one to measure time intervals of the order of a second reliably; and the person who first realized that in describing natural phenomena it is most fruitful to regard time as the basic independent variable, while other quantities varied with respect to time. This link between mathematics and natural phenomena has been expressed in various ways with increasing eloquence and persuasiveness over the centuries. From the present century I would like to present a few examples; first of course Einstein again: 'Our experience ... justifies us in believing that nature is the realization of the simplest conceivable mathematical ideas.' Actually this seems a bit over simplified! Then in his James Scott Prize Essay of 1939 Paul Dirac says that there is no logical reason why mathematics should be so useful in describing nature but offers this thought2: 'This must be ascribed to some mathematical quality; in Nature, a quality which the casual observer of Nature would not suspect, but which nevertheless plays an important role in Nature's scheme.' In a famous 1959 lecture titled 'The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences', Eugene Wigner says3: '... the enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is something bor dering on the mysterious and ... there is no rational -explanation for it'. And later after commenting on the unbelievable accuracy with which certain predictions of theory have been verified he continues: 'This shows that the mathematical language has more to commend it than being the only language which we can speak; it shows that it is, in a very real sense, the correct language.' Lastly I turn to Richard Feynman from the next generation4: 'Every one of our laws is a purely mathe CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 73, NO. 3, 10 AUGUST 1997</page><page sequence="2">GENERAL ARTICLES matical statement in rather complex and abstruse mathe- All this raises many deep questions.

In the Platonic view, symmetry in nature, especially symmetries of natural there is a World of Ideas, of perfect forms, and things laws.

Hilbert like Poincaré was better understanding of Kant's ideas in ways which were a constructivist. For him, mathematics was a human not available to him in his time". The key point is that creation. Ways of logical thinking, of working out in their struggle for survival according to the principles consequences of assumptions, arguments, the notion of of natural selection, different species have to learn to consistency - all these are also the results of biological cope with natural phenomena taking place roughly at evolution, when faced with a world having mathematical their own scales of length, mass and time. This is the qualities, and subject to laws governing its behaviour, 'world of middle dimensions'. These are the phenomena However, behind this level of understanding stands directly relevant in a biological evolutionary sense; and another mystery. Why does the human brain have so natural selection favours the development of those many faculties, so much more capacity, than seems faculties which are able to pick out the most important necessary for biological survival? We can surely under physical features of this part of nature.

Natural laws unify individual phenomena or '... we now see that we have to change the principle occurrences in nature, each obeying the laws concerned, of simplicity into a principle of mathematical beauty.' In turn, transformations and symmetries bring together This is of course subjective, but both Dirac and the different laws sharing the same symmetry, and so belong mathematician Hardy, in their respective contexts, justify to an even deeper level of functioning of nature, it in remarkably similar words213: After all that has happened since the 19th century, 'This is a quality which cannot be defined, any more we should surely not tie ourselves down to a mechanical than beauty in art can be defined, but which people view of nature, or ultimately to a view based on sense who study mathematics usually have no difficulty in impressions alone.

But now we must be willing to go beyond this One must only add that with some modern poetry and face up to the question: are these subtle ideas and there may be difficulties. aspects, where mathematics is the main guide, also Parallel with this development, the notions of existence present in nature somehow?

Then with the I honestly feel a retreat into a point of view ignoring coming of relativity and quantum mechanics, things all these 'intangible' elements of the mathematical 240 CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 73, NO. 3, 10 AUGUST 1997</page><page sequence="6">GENERAL ARTICLES description of nature, hanging on only to the results of calculations and experimental predictions, is not available to us. That would be no way to judge the situation. Long ago in 1910-11, while Einstein was teaching a course on electromagnetic theory, he made this remark able comment14: 'We set up a conceptual system the individual parts of which do not correspond directly to empirical facts. Only a certain totality of theoretical material corresponds again to a certain totality of experimental facts.' In the same spirit, when we judge theories of physics, even though they are incomplete and evolving, we must judge them in their wholeness and taking account of their mathematical structures. Here I cannot avoid quoting from Heisenberg's15 recollection of his feelings on the night he discovered matrix mechanics in June 1925: 'I had the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought that I now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structure nature had so generously spread out before me.' So the mathematical structure itself is a part of nature! Mathematics then is a language but a special one because it is the language of nature, it is also a method of reasoning, and the least ambiguous mode of com munication we possess. Through phylogenetic evolution we have acquired the capacity to create mathematical objects. In this way we acquire a new sense independent of and in addition to the other ordinary ones, and so we reach aspects of nature beyond space and time. This should make us sympathize with the Platonic view of mathematics as well. On the other hand, as in other respects recounted above, we have got more than we could have anticipated. Once created by us, mathematical objects take on a life of their own. The consequences of initial ideas are not all evident at the beginning but are revealed only after much effort. There is more in them than was consciously put in. Strange as it may initially seem and hard as it may be to accept, we seem driven to this conclusion - because mathematics is essential to describe nature, we have to adopt a more open view of existence and reality going beyond space, time and the tangible. The problem of existence and reality is much subtler than our naive expectations may have been. Mathematics then, like nature, has also an intangible level of existence. This line of thinking seems to bring us close to the point of view expressed by Connes and recalled earlier. So, have we solved the problem of the existence of mathe matics by saying that it is the language of natural science? No, not quite. There remains a gap, this con nection between mathematics and its use in natural science goes only a certain distance and does not cover all aspects of the situation! Some differences remain since, as far as one can see, we can imagine mathematical objects and structures which may not have counterparts in nature. Thus as the mathematician Atle Selberg says16: 'If one looks at mathematics as a body of knowledge, I think it definitely can be characterized as a science, but if one looks at the way in which it grows and accumulates, the actual doing of mathematics seems much more to be an art.' And for the physicist's expression of the difference, I conclude with C. N. Yang17: 'It would be wrong, however, to think that the dis ciplines of mathematics and physics overlap very much; they do not. And they have their separate aims and tastes. They have distinctly different value judgements, and they have different traditions. At the fundamental conceptual level they amazingly share some concepts, but even there, the life force of each discipline runs along its own veins.' So at the end we just have to say: it really seems like a case of 'so near and yet so far apart!'. 1.
