In India racial classification has so long proceeded on very scanty anthropometric data, and hence it has been quite unsatisfactory. Risley initiated anthropomorphic measurements in India, but the data obtained by him supplemented by those collected by others, are quite inadequate for such a vast country as India, especially as the Indian peoples are divided into innumerable independent groups that do not intermarry. Risley's classification of the Indian peoples, based upon this inadequate material, into seven racial types, has rightly been rejected by anthro pologists. Risley gave, for example, the racial designation of Monaolo-Dravidian to the peoples of Bengal and Orissa, though they are not marked by Mongoloid features at all. Then again, Risley's Dravidians fall at least into four racial types: (1) the dark, long-headed, wide nosed type which has been given the unsatisfac tory designation of Pre: Providian by some and which has been called Proto-Australoid by Dr. Hutton in the last Census Eeport of India although craniological measurements have shown clearly that the theory of a common racial stock for the jungle tribes of the Deccan and the abori gines of Australia is quite untenable ; this type had better be called simply Veddaic ; Button's theory of its migration from Asia Minor is also disproved by the great difference in the nasal index between the ancient Mesopotamian and Indian skulls ; (2) the Munda-Kol group of Chota Nagpur which possesses considerable affinity with the former, but has points of difference also ; (3) the long-headed, fine-nosed type, speak ing Dravidian languages who, on account of their Mediterranean affinity, had best be called Indo Mediterranean, independently of any reference to the language they speak; (!) and lastly, the round-headed, fine-nosed type with Alpine affinity which claims numerous individuals amongst the Dravidian-speakers. The two latter types are not peculiar to the Dravidian-speaking area alone, but are of a much wider distribution in India. Intensive anthropometric work involv ing 60 measurements and 31 somatoscopic observations on each individual among the people of Bengal by the author, shows the pre sence, both among the high castes, such as the</page><page sequence="2">512 CURRENT SCIENCE [January 1936 Radlii Brahmins, as well as the low castes like the Muchis, of a predominant round-headed type, and also of an appreciable number of the Indo-Mediterranean type, this latter type being more numerous among the lower castes than among the higher. Anthropometric investiga tions in other parts of India would probably show a very wide distribution of these two types. Both of them are represented in the skulls excavated at Molienjo Daro, and they appear to have been the earliest importers of advanced civilisation and culture into India. The speakers of Aryan languages are represent ed by two groups in India, one, the round-headed type with Alpine affinity mentioned above, and the other, a tall and long-headed type which has been called Proto-Nurdic, and the dialects spoken by two groups belong to two distinct branches of the same Aryan tongue. The present distribution of the round-heads in India in the marginal areas in the west, south and east, as also their presence at Adichanallur, shows that they must have entered the country earlier than the Proto-N ordics. As such they must have initiated the Vedic culture in India which the tall, long-heads, arriving later, absorbed from them. The Vedic culture was carried, even in the H ig vedic age, by the long-haired, brown-robed Munis—pioneer missionaries of the Vedic religion—over a great part- of India, from the Western to the Eastern Ocean, as the RiriJfda ( X. 130) puts it. The Brahmana portion of the Vedas speak of mighty empires established by the Vedic Aryans in eastern India. The charge of impurity brought against the peoples of Sind, Gujerat and Konkan in the west and Bengal and Orissa in the east, belongs to a much later literature, and is due to their trade and inter course with foreigners by land and sea ; this the purists in the midland where the later Vedic literature flourished, condemned in severe terms, and prescribed the most distressful penances for them : in the midland itself, the people were getting fossilised in their habits and customs, with a narrow outlook towards life, and they began to think that the habitation of the pure Aryans was confined within very narrow limits,— between the Ganges and the .Tumna. But the presence of tribes at a low stage of culture, but resembling the Indo-Aryans in their physical features over the wild area from the borders of Assam to the hills of Annam, amply proves that people with Indo-European features had traversed the whole of northern India from the western gates to the eastern frontier, and passed through the forests and hills beyond, even up to the Pacific, in very early times. No sound and definite conclusions, however, about the racial composition of the Indian peoples, are possible without further anthropological material, and therefore extensive measurements should be taken in all parts of India, preferably by local investigators with an efficient training in anthropological method, and possessing a know ledge of the language of the people among whom they work. In England, an appeal has recently been issued "to set on foot a comprehensive survey of the past and present populations of Great Britain" ; the need for such a movement in India is much more urgent, as the anthropo logical work so far done is of the nature of a preliminary survey only.</page></plain_text>
