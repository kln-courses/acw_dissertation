<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV.-REALITY. By SIADWORTIH H. HODGSON. I. OBJECT. AT the very basis of philosophy lies the distinctioln between consciousness as a knowing, or knowledge, and that same consciousness as anl existent. In philosophy we are making consciousness, our whole knowledge of things, our whole mental content, awareness, or furniture, the object-matter of our enquiry. In other words, we are exercising the psychological function of Apperception, as (listinguished from perceptioil ol conisciousness simply, wlhich nevertheless is pre-supposed therein, and pre-supposed as an inseparable part, constituent, or element, of the apperceptive process. All consciousness is a reflective or retrospective process, and appercept.ion is there- fore nothing more than attention to somiie particular colntent of that process, or perception plus attelntion to its own content as it recedes into the past, or becomes objective to the attention. Apperception itself, with its content as apperceived, is there- fore a necessary part, but by ilo means the whole, of the object- matter of philosophy. It is with consciousness as a kinowilna that we are specially concerned in philosoplhy, n1ot with its ilnseparable aspect, con- sciousness as an existent, which is the fact or acttal process of perceiving, atteniding, and apperceiving. To confuse these two aspects, though in fact inseparable, to attribute to one what is true only of the other, is tlhe ruin of philosophy. Of course we must not lose sigrht of the existent aspect of consciousness, while occupied with the other aspect. It is the distinction between them which it is necessary to keep in view. The ground or reason for drawing the distinction is discoverable by</page><page sequence="2">54 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. apperception in the process of simiple perception itself, wlhich, prior to apperception, is always a perceptioni lhaving content, or whatness, that is, being, of sonme particular kind, though this is not a whatness as distinguiished from atn existence, until apperception las distinguished the fact of the content beinga perceived from the content as a whole, and thereby also from the remainder of the content which is its whatuess in the narrower sense. The order of knowledg,e as distingiiluished. frolmi the order of existence thus begiins witlh a perception of a content, or of wbatness in the larger sense. Before you can know that anything exists, you m1ust know something of what it is; its existence alone, its bare existence, without a whatness of any kind, cannot in any way be conlveyed to us, or realised in thought; without a content, existence would be the existenice of nothing, consciousness the consciousness of nothing; both alike would be noni-entities. Consciousness thus, in virttue of its beilng an objectifyiig process, always makes us aware of the existence of some content of consciouisniess; the ideas of existence and object are ideas rooted in the natuire of consciousness itself. But these ideas, or ratlher the experienices which they represent, are not of themselves enough to give us the knowledge, or accouniit for the idea. of a Conscious Being, the Subject of objects, such as we take ourselves to be in comnmon-sense thlinlking, and suclh as is assumed by Psychology as its special object-matter-a knowledge or an idea, into the nature and validity of wlichl, as of all other apparently fundamental ideas, it is the business of Phlilosophy to enquire. A loing course of experielnce would seem to have been requisite before ainy such kilowledge or idea could have been attained, a couirse of experience comlpelling us to recogniise consciousness as such, anid to make it as such our object, that is to say, as distinlguished from other objects whiclh are recognised as not-consciousness, and the existenice of which is recognised as indepe.ndenit of our own. Only as the result of some such lonig, course of experience does it seem</page><page sequence="3">1EALlTY. 55 possible tllat we should attain the knowledge or the idea, that consciousness not only has an existent or objective aspect, inseparable from its philosophically subjective aspect, or aspect as a knowing, but also that as a particular existent, the differentia of a conscious being, it belonas to an order of existence, in which we must coniceive it as in some way generated by something niot itself, and its existence as the prior condition of its lhaving contents or objects as a knowing process. The order of knowledge and the order of existence (which latter is in knowledge derived, as we have seeni, from the former) are thus the reverse of one aniother, or run in opposite directions, both being processes. But it is with the order of knowledg,e tllat we are specially concerned in philosophy; and it is in knowledge, that is, in consciousness as a knowina, that the ultimate data of experience lie. Till events or changes in the order of existenee have produced into existence, or determined to exist, a state or process-content of consciousness, there is no knowledge from which the knowledge of an order of existence, or of the existelice of anything, can be derived. But this derivation is based, not uipon perception of the series of events or changes by wvhich the state or process-coltent of consciousness has beeln produced, but uponi features, or changes in features, of the process-content itself, which featuires or changes are immediately perceived in retrospection from what we call the presernt moment, and the perception ot which is the prolongation of the same process-content into thle future. In elucidation and support of the foregoing paragraphs I may refer to nm Mletaphysic of Experience, Book I, Ch. II, ? 5; -Refectice Perception, and imore particularly to the first half of the sectioni, Vol. I, pp. 72 to 91. The place anid funietion of consciousness as a klnowing, the reason (so to speak) for its existenice, thus lie in its being the evidence of everythingr else, and of itself in all its modes. Its knowledcre of its own existence is irnmediate; or rather let ius</page><page sequence="4">56 SHADWORLTH If. HODOSON. say, to avoid misconception, ouir idea of existence itself, the Ineaning wlichl we attachl to the term, is derived fromi the immediate perception wlhich the process-content of conscious- ness has of itself, in conitiniuing as a process-content. The tmeaning of all termiis belongs to consciousness as a knowin.g. Kniowledge colnsists of consciouslness. To ut-se a paradoxical expression, niothilng, matters but colnsciousiness. What else may exist besides consciousness as a knowing, or whether conscious- niess may be causa sui, that is, whetlher it is sole existent, or self-existent, are questions, the answers to which, if attainable at all, nmust be sought in the alnalysis of the process-content of consciousness as a knowing, wlhich is the only source, as it is the only issue, of evidence. In all enquiries we begin with a knowing and we end witlh a knowing, and we are modifying our knowing throughout the process. But this does not imlply or necessitate thie tlhought, that in that process we can have true perceptions, or ideas, or thoughts, of such olbjects only as are or nay be themselves part of the process of knowing, and owe their existence to that process. For it is only the knowledge of the indepenident existenice of objects, nlot that independent existence itself, whlich is included in the process of knowing. In other words, Existence does not of necessity consist of colnsciousness, as knowledge does. In philosophy we liave to see what the analysis of conlscious- ness as a kinowing, tells us on this point. And this must be an anialysis without assumptions. Tlje process-content of consciousness as a kinowing, not as aln existenit process, is the object-matter to be analysed. To suppose that, because it is itself an existeilt process, therefore all that falls within it, in the sense of being its object as a knowing process, also falls within it, or is part of it, as an existent process, and cannot exist otherwise than as part of an existent process of conscious- ness, is an illegitimate assumptioni, founded on confusilng the distinction between consciousness as a knowing and coniscious- ness as an existent. Conscioussness as a knowina may be a</page><page sequence="5">RtEALITY. 57 kniowing of maniy otlher existents besides itself, as well as of the fact of their, and of its own, existenice being indepenident of the knowledge which it has of tlhem-i. But all assumniptions, and not only the one iowv signalised, iiiust be put aside in the philosoplhical analysis of consciousness as a knowing. The true mleanliing of all the genieral terms we eirploy in analysis miust first be ascerthined and jtustified by that analysis, before their use cai l)e anytlingi&gt; biut provisional; anid as provisional, till that las been done, we imulst be contenit, anid tlhankful, to employ tlhelm. The im eaning of the term Reality is the special object of the preseAt paper.

We hiave, of couirse, at tlhe ouitset of otur plhilosoplhical anialysis, a provisioial idea of reality, derived f'romi ouri lpre-plhilosophic experieInce, wlhiclh is our guide in the eniquiiry; aiid our purpose is to ascertaini, by iiieanis of analysis, what form, if ally, of that provisional idlea is also tlte sole valid formii of it, (le fctelo unavoidable, and(I ii lharmony witlh otlher de f cto iuInavoidable ideas, which are also derived from experieilce anid ascertained Iby similar processes of analysis.

HODGSON. contradistinction from, all the other sciences. We then find ourselves asking, in the case of reality, Is this real ? Is that real ? and so on, instead of asking, What we nmean by the term Reality, or what is the anialysis, what the validity, of the idea. We are then doing actuially, though perhaps uninten- tionally, what Kant for ever, byI his failure, showed to be futile, when he worked out a theory of it-takingr Categories to explain howv we arrive at a cornsistent experience, instead of showing how categories, or any general terms, are derived from de facto inevitable experience. We are glorifying the a priori, that is, the constitution of some assumed Subject of consciousness. There is no greater error, no greater delusion, than to take the distinctioin between Subject and Object as the ultimate basis of philosophy. It may be tr-mie that there is no colnscious- ness without a Subject, as there is none without anl Object. But this is not anl immediate datum of consciousness, not an imme- diate piece of knowled(re. The validity of botlh idea.s, Subject and Object of consciousiiess, lhas to be ascertained by analysis of tlle content of consciousness, without calling in either an assumed Subject or ani assumed Object to account for it. These are objects of provi.sional ideas derived from pre.-philosophic experience, the ultimate constitution, or orig,in in the first irnstance, of which has to be ascertainedl by analysis, just as miuch as that of any other pre-philosophic ideas. You cannot in fact assume a Subject as the basis, or as part of the basis, of philosophy, without tllereby changc,inia philosopliy into psychology When. we say.l, and IVe, aind so oni, in philosophy, and speak of themii as agents, as everywhere muiist be the case, since language is formed on a pre-philosoplhic basis, we nlust rememiber that we are usinlg terims provisionially only, without prejudice to the results of philosoplhic analysis, whatever these results mliay be. We miust relmember also, that the very purpose of analysis is to give us back the analysanbdim in a different slhape from itself, that is, in the shape of constituen-t elemnents and their inode</page><page sequence="7">REALITY. 59 of conijunctioni, whichl account for, or correspond to, the anctiysandum as a whiole, but do not coutain it over again, as one of its own constituents. The validity or non-validity of the idea, in the true shape which it assuines under analysis, is the result at which the analysis ainms. This may show that it h as a true and valid meanina, though it may divest it of that explanatory character which it seemiied to possess, wheni supposed to stand for ani immediately known and unanalysable entity. It is in tle light of considerations like the foregoing that we must interpret such phlrases as Esse is Percipi, which taken by themselves are susceptible of very different and conflicting constructions. If these considerations are true, when we say, or think, Esse is Percipi, our mneaning can only be that the term percipi is the imeaning of the terni esse, or that esse (in its utmost generality or abstraction, inicluding all its particulars, i.e., all cases of existere, under it) is the object of percipere, or of con- sciousness (in its utmost generality) in its character of a knowing, not in its clharacter of an existent; anid perciper-e the evidence of esse, which is its object as a knowing. Outr meaning, cannot be (what it is often supposed to be) that thie secret, or essence, or ininer nature, in virtue of whiclh Esse is Esse, or Being is Being, consists in Percipi, or is identical with the percipcre of a percipient. The logical fallacy of this latter interpretation is, that it supposes IIs to have some knowledge both of esse and of pereipere, before we have any perception, consciousness, or knowledge at all, that we kinow them as different from each other, and( that (so knowingr them a priori) we proceed to ask of one of thein, viz., esse, not wlhat it is, but upon what it (lepends, or in virtue of w;hat it is esse. Tihe phrase Esse is Percipi is then interpreted as if it was the answer to this illogically put questioin, and was an asser-tion that the innler nature or essence of Being was Knowing, instead of assertingr that Being, could only be thouglht of as the olbject of a Knowing.</page><page sequence="8">60 SIIADWORTH H. HODGSON. Briefly stated the truth is this. Esse is Percipi expresses n1either (1) that. perception gives us a knowledge of the whole uature of being,, or of any beitng, nor (2) that being, or an) being, depends ulpoin perception, either for its lnature or for its existence, but (3) that we nmust think of being, and of every being, as at least the object of perception, inldependently of the question as to the existence of such a perception. For, in saying esse is percipi, nothingr depends upoil the mere existence of the perception, but all depends uponl its natulre as a reflective or self-objectifying process, i.e., upon the fact that, as it proceeds, it differentiates its content, perceiving part after part as past, that is, as object, different in poinit of time from the then present momenlt of perceiving, which will in its turrn be perceived as having been a present moment of perceiving, or content of perception niot yet objectified as past. The fact that a per- ception, when it exists, is l)erception and objectification of a content, not the fact that the perception itself exists, is that wlhich determiiines the mlieanino of Esse. Hlere perlhaps I miiay be allowed to say, Ithat this whole paper (barrinig minor corrections and additions, nioine of which affect the three precediing paragraphs) was written before seeing Mr. G. E. Moore's article "The Refultation of Idealism," in Mind for October, 1903, No. 48 N.S., containiing his skilful dialectical attack on the logic of the phrase Esse is Percipi. Though I still see nio reason to alter anlything in what I lhave written, I am (rlad to recognise that Mr. Moore (if I have rightly uinderstood him) rejects Idealism, however diflerent froin mine the route m-ay be, by whichl lhe reaches his concltusioln. II. MATTElJ. AVe are far away at present, I mean so far as this paper has as yet gone, from anything that can be called Realitv. Or rather, if we use the term at all, there is no reasoni for prohibiting its application to aniything which is or can be</page><page sequence="9">RlEALITY. GI thought of as an object of consciousness. Now the provisional idea of reality, witlh wlhich we start in philosoply, and which we have to examinie and, if requisite, to correct by philosophical analysis, I take to consist of three points, namely, the object (includiing event) called real must, first, exist or take place independently of the existeDce of a percipient: secondly, it nust not be illusory, but, in unlclhanged ciretcumstances, miiust continue to be or to appear as it is or appears at any given moment; thirdly. it muist have some efficienlt operation in changing or inaintainingc the state of thing,s arouniid it. Stated briefly, by the real is meant, in pre-philosophie thoughlt, the opposite of that which is appearance only. Now whence arises this distinction in the first instance, or wlhat are the facts in actual experience whicll compel us to perceive it ? And will they justify us, or in wlhat form will they juistify us, in miiain- tainina it as a true distinetion, and the idea of reality as a true idea, wlhen examinled by phlilosophical analysis ? The answer will be found, as I shall now Lbriefly endeavour to show, in those plhenomena of acttual experienice which compel uis to form the idea cf Matter, and of an external material world, in the first instance; or wlich, in other words, give us our first perception of Matter and an external miiaterial world, including our own organiisms as material oljects which are spatially inclusive of, as well as diflerent from, otur consciouis- ness which is the perceptioni of them. The first forniation of three cardinal ideas, or original perceptioni of three objects involving those ideas, will then be found to be ilcluded in that perception which we call briefly the perceptioli of M.atter, namely (1) the differentiation, in poilnt of kinid, of consciousness from some of its objects, wvhich are tlheni tlhought of as not- consciousness, (2) the local separation of consciouisness fromn the greater part of these latter objects, by its localisation in one of them, the physical organism, andl (5) the idea of efficienicy or real conditioning, derive(d frollm the perceivedt fact, that certain states of consciousness arise onlyl, but then arise</page><page sequence="10">62J SHADWORTH }I. IIODGSON. inevitably, on the comina of two or more material objects inlto contact with one another. The perception of Matter, it will thereby be shown, gives us our first perception of Reality; that is, the idea of Reality is derived from the idea of Matter, which in its turn is derived from facts of immediate experience. And the question which is commonly stated as that of the Reality of Matter, as if the idea of Reality was an a priori or standard idea, under which Matter must be brought if we would conceive it as other than an idea, is thuis clhanged into a question concerning the nature and the truth of our idea of Reality, anid the answer showii to depend, not on any a priori colncept or provisional idea, but upon facts of actual experience, namely, those which together constitute our perception of Matter. In what I have here alleged and am about to allege concerning the reality of Matter, I do not think there is anything whichl is not to be found in my Metaphysic of Experience, Book I, Chapters IV to VIII inclusive, thoulgi I here attempt to bring the essential points together in a single conspectus. Indeed I think there is little, if anything, in this whole paper, which will be new to readers of that work. The perception of Matter is a comiplex perception, and it is evident that lno attempt can be made to ascertain the historical order or genetic sequence of those experiences which are its colnstittuents, or the suiccession of steps in its formation whllich depend upon attention to the repeated comibinations alnd changes in the comibiniations of those constituent experieinces spokeni of in the last paragraph but one, and of the still more simple elements of those experiences. We have no data upon which any such historical enquiry could proceed, the reason being that they are facts belonging, for the most part at rany rate, to the period of infancy, which it is beyolnd the power of memory to recall. We have comiiplex experiences which we can analyse into their constituents, and when we take either these comiplex experiences or their coinstituelnts, or the</page><page sequence="11">RIEALITY'. 63 elements of those constituenits, one by one, as being such and such in the first instance, what is intended is, lnot to indicate their position in the historical order of the genesis of knowledge, but to insist on what they are per se, ap(art from association with other facts or ideas whicl), in pre- philosophic experience, may have become so closely bound up with them, as to appear to furnish a reason or explanation ofl them. It is of course true, that whatever empirical state of consciousness appears anywhere, in order of knowledge simply, must also have had a first appearance, relatively to its own later appearances, in order of the genesis of knowledge; but it by no means follows that this first appearance is prior in time to that of other empirical states of consciousniess, in that samne order of genesis. It is silmiply as an aid to abstrac- tion in analysing, that the phrase in the first instance nmust be understood. But now for the facts. It is solelv with the content of colnscioussness as a knowing, which is the evidence of every- thing, itself included, that we have to do; not with conscious- ness as an existent, or with consciousness as a psychological function, both of which, as shown above, derive their mrleaning, or are known to be what they are, from colnsciousness as a knowing. When, tlherefore, I proceed to state, that our perceptiorn of Matter is formed out of perceptions belonging to the psychological functionis of sight and touch, I ama USiDg these functions solely as nieans, and the ornly miieans at nmy disposal, of designlating, the experiences beloniging to consciouis- ness as a knowing,, upon which I mneani to rely as contributing to constitute the perception of Matter; I must niot be held to be assuming the existence of those functions, or founidinga any conClusions upon their supposed nature or capacities. I do not assumwe the existence of a Psyche, any mliore than I assunle the existence of Matter. To do so would for a metaphysician be illogical. The sense of siglit gives us no imnmediate percep- tion of its own organ, the eye; mleitlier does touchl grive us any</page><page sequence="12">64 SHADWORTH H. IIODGSON. immeldiate perception of its organ, the sensitive skin surface. It is solely the immediate objects, that is. the contents of these sensationis objectified in consciousness (wliich as shown above is a reflective or objectifying process) wbhicl can furnislh legitimate grounds for relying on the validity of the complex perception of Matter, which they compel us to construct by their varying, combii tations and dissociatioiis. We construct it, nio doubt, by the active exercise of attention, tlhouaht, and reasoning; but here again notlihig in my argument is buiilt upon, no conclusion is dr&lt;awn froml, the natuie or capacities of these psychological functions; it is the facts belongring to the immediate content of consciousness -which compel us to attend, think, and reasonr as we do, in construieting the complex percep- tion of Mawtter. And it is such processes as those employed in this construction, thouhll not these processes alone, wlichl originially give us the data fromi whiclh our knowledge of the existence, nature, and capacities of these psychological functiolns is derived. NoWv visual anid tactual sensations lnormally occur in con- junction with eacli other, we experience selnsations of botlh kinds simultaneously. And, as contents of consciousness as a knowing, the sensations of both kinds are spatially extended. Both are what we may call surface sensations, and these sensations themselves are extended, tlie sensations themselves occupy two of the dimensions of space, mneanilng here by the term dimensions that they lhave length and breadth inseparably united with their seilse-quality. And this I take to be aln indisputable and cardinal fact of immediate experielnce. Tlle sensations themselves lhave spatial extension in the two diiiensions (so to call them) of lengrth an(d breadth. The iiext point I would notice is, that attention to these two sensations in combination, as when we see and touch wlhat we afterwards call a small object which we can grasp with the hand, gives us our first notioni of such objects, and adds the perception of time third dimension (so to call it) of space, dleptlh,</page><page sequence="13">REALITY. 65 or distance otlher thail suiperficial, to the perception of the two first dimensions, wlhiclh belong to sensations of both kinds severally. These coimibinations are our first perceptions of solid objects, as we afterwards c.all them. So far as we have Done at present, they conisist of surface sensations enclosing a space of three dimiensions. And it may be noted, that our conception of solidity never gets beyond or away from this origuinal perceptioln. Space in three dimensions, tangible on the surface, is essential to it, however far we may go in dividing any so called solid object. Solid matter is a continuum of solidity, divisible ad idtra, thou(rh niot necessarily divisible in infinitum, as th- space is wlhich it occupies, or which its tangible surfaces eniclose. That is to say, minima of volume, atoms of inass, are conceivable, aniything less than which would lot be matter, or a material solid. Thirdly, we obtain from attention to these two sensations, in alternating and varying comblbination and dissociation with each other, our first perceptionl of what we afterwards call our Olwn body, as the constant central object of a spatial panorama in three dimensions of space, a panorama containing various solid objects, moving, and stationiary, in ever varying relations of distance relatively to each other and to the constant central object of the panorama. All these contents composing or contained in the panoraina are contents of consciousness. Some are visual contents only, others tactual as well, while those which in certain cases are tactual only, as when we touch or feel in the dark, or with eyes shut, become also visual as well as tactual in changred circumlstances, and the visual and tactual contents of sensation then combine and harmonise with each other into one complex content, or single object of conscious- ness, single because occupying one and the same portion of space. And this is the case with that central object of the panorama which] we afterwards call our own body. In short, we then have experience of what we afterwards call an external and material world, a world whiclh, as then E</page><page sequence="14">66 SHADWVOItTH H. HODGSON. experienced, conisists of niothing but contents of consciousness as a knowing. Now up to this point, that is, so far as our analytical description of the experience of visual and tactual sensations has gone at present, notwithstanding that this experience is experience of an external and material world, there has beent nothing but colnsciousness in knowledge, that is, in consciousness ais a knowing; nothing but what we now call consciousness. B,ut the idea of consciousness lhas never presented itself or occurred therein; for there has beeni nothing presented, no state of consciousness has occurred, from which it could be distinguished; it is not kvnown or recognised as consciousness; oinly its several contents have been known and recognised, because different aiid distinguishable from one another; but the whole whiclh they compose has not been namied or classed- simlply because nothing which is not-consciousness has occurred. Perception and object perceived have not as yet, in any case or class of cases, been distinguished as different in kind from one another. If it should be objected, that we may or even must have had perceptions, though not of what I have called not- consciousness, yet of unconsciousness, that is, intervals or inter- ruptions of consciousness, which are not the contrary but the contradictory of consciousness, and that these suffice to give us a distinct idea of consciousness, my reply is this. Such intervals of unconsciousness must either be perceived as void portions of the chain or time-stream of consciousness as a knowing, in which case they are still parts belonging to consciousness as a knowing, and do not lead to the distinct recognition of conscious- ness, or else they pre-suppose the distinct recoanition of con- sciousness, that is, suppose it to have already taken place, in b)eing opposed to it as its contradictory, unconsciousness. That is to say, the occurrence of perceived intervals of unconsciousness (loes not in any way involve or lead up to what I have called the recognitioni of consciousness, or suffice to give us a distinct idea of it.</page><page sequence="15">REALITY. 67 What, then, are the facts or the circumiistances, or are there any, which in the first instance, that is, withouit aid from other sources than the experielnces now described, compel us to break up this undivided phelnomenoni into consciousness and not- consciousness, wlhile retainingy in consciousness the positive sense-quality of that part of the whole which we distinguish as not-consciousness: or in. other words, to distinguish the undivided phelnometnon into perception, wlicil is consciousness, and object perceived, whiclh is not-consciousness ? This, I: think, is the crucial questioln. I proceed to show that there are suchi facts, and that they are to be fouind in our tactual experience, in conjunction always with facts of visual experience. The comlpelling Iacts are two: first, the fact that onle and the. same sensation can1not be in two or more places at onie and the same time; seconidly, the fact that what we afterwards call the priinary properties of matter are an exact replica of the tactual sensations whiclh, in combination with visual senlsationis, go to constitute our original knowledge of solid objects, and wlhich we afterwards call our perception of those primary properties, that is, of matter. The fact that one and the same sensation cannot be in two places at once compels us to duplicate in thouoht the content of that sensation, to locate one of its two memnbers in the central object of our panoramia of consciousness, as a state of consciousness which is a perception of the other member, and to refer that other member to a non-cenitral object of our panorama, to which it belongs as a constitutive property, perceived but not perceiving, that is, as something which is not-consciousness. Let us now see more particularly how this is. A solid object as above described comes, let us suppose, into visually apparent contact with the constant celntral object of our painorama of consciousness, that is, with our body. A sensation or set of sensations of touch and pressure occurs. Now to which of the two objects, the central or the non-central, does this sensation beloing ? (I speak of the whole set of sensationis E 2</page><page sequence="16">68 SHADWORTH 11. HODGSON. in the singular for the sake of simplicity.) In which is it located ? It seems to belong to both; indeed to eInter into both, as a constituent contributingr to constitute both of them as solid objects. The inseparability of the distinguishable elements, the extension-element and the sense-element, in the least and simplest phenomena of sight and touch, as also the inseparability of the distinguishable elements, the time-element and the sense-element, in all plhenomena whatever, was shown in my Time and Space (1865), Part I, Ch. II, ? 11, "Elements and Aspects of Phenomena." And this fact, which is a fact of experience, I for one have never ceased to insist upon, as fundamental in philosophy. The appearance just spoken of tlherefore, should it occur, would be illusory. One and the same sensation cannot be in two separate objects at once. As a matter of fact, we cannot imagine or coniceive it; in trying to do so, we ipso facto break up the one, sensation into two. Observe what happens when contact, the visually apparent contact, between the two solid objects is broken. The tactual sensation ceases to exist as a sensation, but in its stead there arises, or rather there remains alone in con- sciousness, a representation of that tactual sensation as belonging both to the central and to the moving or non- central object; all three alike, I mean the two represented sensations and the representation of them, making part of the hitherto undifferentiated panorama of consciousness. This is the fact of experience, this representing process is the process of experiencing, which breaks up the panorama of conscioiis- ness as a knowing into consciousness and not-consciousness, the part which is not-consciousness being perceived but not in turn perceivina, though still belonging, as a perceived part, to the panoramia. We must now see more particularly how this is. Representation or redintegration is an essential part of that process-content of consciousness as a knowing, which gives us our original panoramria of consciousness. Without it, there is</page><page sequence="17">REALITY. 69 no continiuous consciouslness at all. Btut representation is a termn colntaining two meanings; it miieans at one time a repre- sented, at another, a representing, representation of the same content. Of these, the represented representation, or memory image, of a sensation, as in the case of the tactual sensation now in question, is necessarily represented as belonging to the solid object or objects which the sensation orig,inally contributed to constitute in our panorama, a panorama which, as continuous in time, has throug,hout one alnd the samne central object; but the representing representation of the sensation, as will presently appear, can be conceived as belonging to that central object alone. Buit first (to keep strictly to our present instance) of the tactual sensation represented as belonging to the moving non-central object. If we imangine or try to inmagine this represented tactual sensation as making part of the process-content of consciousness as a knowing, that is, as belonging to a perceiving as well as perceived object, we can then no loncger regard it as making part of the same panorama as before, which, so far as our present kniowledge g,oes, is identified as one and the same by the constancy, or continuity in time, of its central object. The moving non-central solid object, to which the represented tactual sensation belongs, and which we are now endeavouring to imaaine as a perceiving as well as a perceived object, must in that case (oni the analogy of our own original panorama) have a panorama of its oWln, of which it is the constant central object, when perceiving as we are now imniaginina it to perceive. And this is no doubt the case, when we thinik of such solid moving objects as seats of consciousness, that is, as persons. But as continuing to belong to one and the same panorama of con- sciousniess, the tactual sensation, represented as belonging to the moving non-celntral object, cannot be represented as con- sciousness, but must, along with that lnon-central object whiclh it contributes to constitute, bee represented as an object which is not-conlsciousness, perceived but not perceiving. It must,</page><page sequence="18">70 SHADWORIIT H. HODGSON. therefore, as conisciousness, be represenited as located in, and in some way or other as belonging to, the body, which is the central object of the panorama. Briefly to suni up the argumiient. The tactual sensation we have been speaking of can only be in one of the two objects, the celntral or the non-central, of the panorama, this panorama remainina the same as hitherto, that is, continuing to have the same central object. It muist, therefore, as a sensation, be in the central, and n-lot in the non-central, object of the panorama, since, if it were in the non-central, it would be in a different panorama, a panoraama in whiclh that lnon-central object would be central. That is to say, there would be a breach in the continuity of consciouisness as a knowingr, a breach which, besides involving a change of the object-matter spoken of, niamely, the panorama to whihll the central and the non-central objects alike belong, would leave the dilemma which has been occupying us in precisely the same unsolved condition as before. And the same reasoningr holds good of the representatioin representing the sensation. On the other hand the represented sensation and the represented represenitation of it must by the same reasoning be located in the non-central object of the panorama, and conceived as properties contributing to COnl- stitute it as an object which is not-consciousness. If we suppose, as I think we miust, that the experience now described as containing acts or processes of sensation, perception, representation, and reasoning, takes place in the period of early infancy, we must of course suppose also, that it takes place without any recognition by the infanlt of the nature of the process, or of its several steps or component elements. He h1as the sensations, perceptions, and representations, and he performs the reasoning, which vwe can now recognise, distinguish, and describe as wrhat they severally are, in terms derived from later knowledge, that is, ultimately, from analysis of our own later actual experiences. Still the infant's experience is inot the less real because he cannot recognise or analyse it as it</page><page sequence="19">REALIT'V. 71 actually occurs to him, or because we cannot nolw reproduce, in memory or in imagination, the thoughts and feelings composinlg that experience of his as it actuially occurred. Who shall say what an act of reasoning feels like to the infant ? But now observe the great and unique significance of the step which we have now taken. We have obtainied, indeed have had forced upon us by experience, our first idea of existence as distinguished from consciousness, for the questioni as to location, the question twhere as distinguished from what, is a question concerning the existence of that concerning which it is put. Besides this we have obtained our first idea of the existent aspect of consciousness, as distinguished fromi its aspect as a knowing; and we hiave also obtained our first idea of concrete consciousness itself as an existent, of its location as such a concrete existent in its own central object, the body, and also of certain different modes of it when so located; that is to say, we have obtained our first idea of existent conscious- ness and its modes, which afterwards, in their character of existents, become the object-miiatter of psychology. The perception of the difference betweein the two subjectivities, the philosoplhical and the psychological, has here its origin; for we have obtained our first idea of an object possessing, but not beingr, consciousness. Observe, moreover, that the sensation and its representing representation do not cease to make part of consciousness as a kniowing, when, owing to their location beigr ascertained, they are thought of as existents also. Both our originial tactual sensation arid the representing representation which represents it are alike, of necessity, located b)y thought in that central object of our panorama which we call our body, the representing representation (though it still continues to be a knowing) losing, as an existeint state of consciousness, that definite spatial extension which still remains an essential element in the sensation, and in the representina representation of it as a knowing. And in the moving solid object, in which we locate</page><page sequence="20">72 SHADWORTH }I. IOVDOSON. the represenited representation, or olject as we afterwards call it, of the original tactual sensatioln, tllere is lnotlhing represented but what is a repetition or duplicate of that original sensation. The surface feelings of touch and pressure, when represented and located in the ob.ject, become in thougfrht, or are thought of as, the primary properties of matter, nlamiiely, space occupation, hardness, and resistance to pressure, properties which are actually perceived in tactual sensationi. Of what these properties are im themiselves. that is, if we attempt to imagine them as separate entities or agencies, actingr in, through, or upon matter, as wve do when we grive them separate single names, such as Force, Energy, or Acrency, we have no notion whatever, save what we gather from the sensations by which we know them, whlich belolng, to our consciousness as a knowing, and wvlichl thev are said to cause or produce in us. They consist of the represented motion or tenldency to motion, which is represented as belongini to matter in all its parts, down to its miinutest particles, another mode of representing space occupation, hardness, and resistance to pressure.- These properties must in the first instance be thought of as objects of consciousness as a knowing, not as an unknowable entity or agency, or Ding-an-sich, as would be the case if we started with an capriori idea of PReality, manifesting itself in or as the phenomena of consciousLness. Force, Energy" or Agency, taken as ani entity actiing in, throughl, or uponl matter, but havina an existence separable from it, is a fictioni, the fruit of a wrong analysis of the experiences which con- stitute the perception of miiatter, wrolng becauise it mixes up with their analysis an attempt at accouintilng for their genesis. These conisiderations bring us to another nmost essential point in the colnception which experielnce compels us to form of miatter; and this is the third of the three constituent experiences, mentioned above as necessarily contributing to our perception of it. Observe what happenis when the visually apparent contact, after being brokeen, is renewed between the</page><page sequence="21">I'EALITY. 7 central anid the noin-cenitral solid objects of our panoraimia, in combinationl withl thle ideas of them wlhiclh we are now sup- posing to have been formiied. The renewal of the contact is immediately attenlded by a new tactual selnsation, which wouldi not occur without it. The contact causes (to use the ordinary term) the occurrence of the new sensation, but it cannot be said to cauLse its nature as a tactual sensatioii, or as a repre- sentationi. These belong to consciousness as a knowinig, an cannot be tlhought of as caused by anytlhing, conisisting as they do in ultiimiates, or combinationis of ultitnjates, in knowledge. The nature of the thing causing and the tlhing caused are botl assumed as kniown, provisionally at least, before the quiestion of a causal connectioni between tlhem can arise. At the sam}e tinme, the occurrence of the contact is essential to the occurrence of the new tactual sensation, and that dowvni to the niijutest particulars of chainge, so that any difference in eitlher of the bodies, or in the miode of their coming into contact, would be attended by a corresponding change in the sensation. In this respect the two solid objects and their contact are more properly characterised as real conditions, in contradistinctionl from causes, of the sensation, which latter term implies, that the whole niature of the consequent as well as its occurrelnce. is determined by thje contact. The Law of Uniformity does not accounit for the qualities of the things whlichl it connects, thoughll kiowledge of it enables prediction. Froilm this experience of Matte}, that is, of the contact of solid external objects with the body, whiclh is also a solid object and the constant central object of our panorama, we form, I thinl, our origrinal coniception of Reality, that original conception upoln which we mould otur ideas of the reality of whatever else we call real, though we may apply the termii to very differenit and even to immnaterial agencies aand objects. The real in miiatter lies in its primary properties, which froma the subjective point of view are known as represented tactual sensationis, andl from the objective or existential poinit of view</page><page sequence="22">74 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. are tllought of as (leterininingr by conitact witlh our bodies, but inidependently of our ideas or volitions, the occurrerice of new tactual sensations in uis, the same in kind as those whiclh we have already received from them. A tangible object is at once the object and the cause, or rather real condition, of a sensation of touch. That we know it only by sensation and repre- sentation, rnodes of consciousness, is no argument against its existence as represented, independently of the existence of conciousness. Its efficacy in producing a new tactual sensation, by its action on coining into contact with ouir body, is the evidence of its independent existence and activity, that is, of wlhat we call its 9-reality. We think of it as existing, in order of real genesis, prior to the sensations aind representations which it causes or determines to exist in us, while, in order of the genesis of knowledge, these sensations anid representa- tions are prior to the knowledge wlhich we have of its nature and existence. Ancd it is difficult, if not impossible, to see how anything whateveer which we call real, not being inme- liately known to us, even if it should be something non-material, can escape fromi this law of mediate representatioln, that is to say, of being thlought to exist in the slhape and wNith the qualities wlhichl coOii)ose our representing representation of it, objectified as its properties. Touch holds an unique position among tlle avenues of knowledge. It is the only sense, the only kind of feeling, which has an objectified representation or replica of its own content for its ieal condition as well as its object. In handling, a solid object we have presented in sensations the very thing which gives rise to those sensations at the time. Moreover, all other sensations, feelings, and states or process-contents of consciousness, not only have not such replicas of themselves as their real conditionLs, buit, whatever their ownl kind or quality rmay be, they have real conditions of one kind only, and that the same as in the case of touch, namely, iimotions and inter- actions of miiaterial particles, in which term all miiodes of matter</page><page sequence="23">REALITY. 7 5 in motion, as, e.y., ethereal vibrations, electrical charges, alnd cerebral activities, must be held to be included. Sight, for instance, is evidence of the existence of ethereal vibratioiis proceedingO or reflected fromn the object said to be visible, impinging upon our organ of vision, alnd evoking the visual sensation, quite different in point of kind from tactual sensa- tion. Thouhlit again, and emotion, in all their modes, seelm to depend for their occurrence upon cerebral activities, in whatever way we may conceive these activities to be related to the action of external objects upoln the organistml. Matter, theii, seems to be not only that object wlich gives us our first conception of Reality, but also that which includes every kind of real condition of whichl we have positive know- ledge. All human kniowledge is conditioined upon the real existence and operatioln of matter, in endlesisly varied modes of motion and their comnbinations. At the same time, while g,iving us our conceptioin of Reality, and our conception of Real Condition, it gives us no knowledge whatever of its own real conditioning. It does lnot explaini its own existence, while the conceptions to wlicih it grives rise comipel us to regard that existence as requiring and capable of explanation, if only modes of consciousness were accessible to us, other than those which we derive from matter itself. The possible irmodes or qualities of consciousness must be conceived by us as iflimited in number, since we hlave the experience of an indefinite number of them, and know of nothing by wlhich that nunmber canl be limited. The nature and operationis of matter limit the number of inodes of consciousness which material beings can experience, but within this numnber is inievitably included the thought of a world of reality and real coilditioniing, evidenced (though not to us) by modes of consciouisness whiclh are not withini our experience, and containing, the real condlitions of our material world.</page><page sequence="24">76 SLIADWORTH H. HODGSON. III. S UBJECT. We may see froimi whlat precedes, that the result of approaching experience fromti the sutbjective side (philosophically not psycholo,gically subjective), that is, of en-quiring what we know of thinlgs rather tlhani what we tacitly assuime them to be, as if we knew a prioib what being meant, is to suLbstitute the philo.sophical distinctioni betweeni real conditions and tlheii conditionates, a distinctioin arrived at by analysis of the process-content of consciousness, for the pre-philosophic dis- tinctions of Substances aind their Attiibutes, Agrents and their Actions, Causes and their Effects, in wlichl the conceptionis of Substance, Agrent, anid Cauise are taken as ultimate andc explanatory, and to bring, the phenomena, whlich were previously referred to one or other of the tlhree latter distinctions, uinder the former single distinction, as particular cases of it. But it is also evideiit, that this does niot enable the coniceptione of Matter, to which all positively known real conditions lhave been shown to belong, to take the place or performii tlhe function previously supposed to be held or pei for med by one or other of the three pre-philosophic conception-s of Suib- stance, Agent, or Cause. To tlhink in this way would be to ignore the result arrived at, sinice it would be attemptino, to bring the conceptioni of Real Conditioni iunder one or other of those pre-philosophic coniceptions. The stubstitution of the conceptioni of Real Conditioni for that of Cause is nio mere chaiige in nomiienclature, but lhas important colnsequences in psycholog,y. It enables an alternia- tive hypothesis concerning the genesis anid developmeint of con-isciouislness to be offered to psychologists. It mnakes it possible for any onle to nmaintain, that the function of being the proximate real conditioii of consciousness, as distinguislhed from its cause, can (to sav the least) be equally well perfornied by a material as by anl immiiiiaterial agenit or aoenicy, witlhouit his thereby incurring the iimipuitation of being a Materialist in</page><page sequence="25">REALITY. 77 philosophy. And the practical advantage of adopting this alternative can hardly be overrated. Briefly stated it is this, that a scientific physiological psychology can be thereby incor- porated with, and assigned a definite position in, a philosophy in the strictest sense of the term. But now to turn to our present question-the term Subject. The conception of Subject in current philosophy, in whlich it is taken as if it were an independent philosophical concep- tion, and not merely as another side or aspect of a concrete conscious being or organism, is nothing but one or otlher of those three pre-philosophic conceptions mientione(d above (substance, ag,ent, cause), taken as ultimate and explanatory of the phenomena of consciousness and conscious action. It is the conception of an immaterial conscious being, or conscious agency, inhabiting and actuating the concrete conlscious organism, and so accounting for the phenomena of conscious- ness and conscious action which it displays-a conception which merely repeats as an explanation the very thing to be explained. But these phenomena, as shown above, are divisible into objects known as real conditions of consciousness, which are not-consciousness, and states or processes of consciousness which are conditionates of therm. And this division neither is, nor professes to be, any explanation or theory of the phenomena, into which we are compelled by analysis to introduce it. Philosophy is of necessity the ultimate fornmula- tion of the questioning we put to the Universe in which we find ourselves, but it does not change that questioning into unquestionable knowledge, nor does it assume that it is of niecessity capable of attaining, a speculative conception explanatory of the nature of that Universe, which is the object-matter of its enquiry. It may be found to issue in the attainment of a conception whiclh can be shown to be the hiighest which we are capable of attaining, though not sufficient as an explanation of the Universe. Now the real conditions of consciousness must, we have seen, be conceived</page><page sequence="26">78 SHADWOIRTII H. 11ODGSON. as somethinig which is not-conisciouisness, whatever further conception we may fornm of it or themii, whether. as material or as non material. But the culrrenlt conception of Subject in plhilosophy is an attempt to override this division, by identi- fying, consciousness with somethinig, not, otherwise specified, which, bOesides beina consciousness, is also its Substance, Agrent, or Cause. It is virtually ain assertion, that the conception of a Coniscious Beinga is incapable of analvsis, and ultimate alike in thouight and in existence. Generalising, this fallacious conception woulld, it is evident, supply a ready tho-ugh fallacious explanation or theory of the Universe, by supposing it to be iimagip,ineid as a sinigle vast Person. It; then, we adopt in philosophy, as I thinik we must, the term Subject as a philosoplhical term, and not as another mode of designating the conscious organism, we must restrict it to mean either something which is consciousniess, or somtething, which is not-consciousness but which is among its real conditions. And we have to make our choice between these alternatives. Now cons(iousness, not agency, is the essential clharacteristic of what, in philosophy, we want the terms Subject to express. Sub- jectivity imiplies coilsciousness, irmplies knowing as distillngished fromi object known. At the samiie time it is inot consciousness as a general conception, but a particular, individual, and existent ccnsciousiiess, that we wanit to express, and this the term Subject necessarily imiiplies. Accordingly we muist say, that the coln- sciousness in any sequence or grouping of contents of colnscious- ness connected in memory, wlichl at any present momlent is being conitinued into the future. is that whiclh is imiost properly called the Subject, beinig a condition of knowing, conditio cogno.scendi, in relation both to its past already objectified states or contents, and to its own continuation as consciouslness inito the future, of which it is the pre-requ isite. The mneilmory bond is that which mlakes it a single unified conisciousniess. The Subject is thus consciousness of itself, that is, of conlsciousness, niot of a supposed substance, agent, or cause of iLself. And this is the</page><page sequence="27">I'EALITY. 79 true meanling of the pre-phlilosophic termiis " I " and " Self," whein these are taken as philosophical termis with a definite and ascertained nmeaning. "Stbject," " I," and " Sc&amp; " are termiis which in philosophical use are applicable solely to consciousness, as distinguished from any Being or Agency 'which, as such, is not-consciousness. I should here observe that the opposite alternative as to the meaning of the term Subject was the one adopted in my Afetcaphysic of Ex_perience, Book II [, Clh. I, ? 4 (Vol. III, pp. 59 to 78), where it was taken to iiiean the sum of the proximate real conditions of consciousness. Trhat is its true ieaning in Psychology, which I was tlhen conisidering. Blit we also want the ternm in Philosophy piroper. And there is no reason whiy we slhouild not adopt it in botlh, with a different miieaning, in eaclh, so long as we clearly discrimiinate its p)hilo- sopliical frolmi its psyclological use. In philosophy it is a conditio cognoscendi, in psychology a conditio existendi. Light is thus thrown uipon the formination of the pre- plhilosophic conceptions of " I" and "Self," wlhich being embodied in all languagre exercise so powerftul an influence upon philosophical thought, in preventing(i analysis, and securinmz their own adoption in philosophy, as if they were philosophical conceptions. For we have seen (1) that there is nio im-mediate experience of an Eao or Self, as a Substance, Agent, or Cause, that is, of a Feeler, Perceiver, Thinker, or Doer, as distinguishe(d from a Feeling, Perceiving, Thinking, or Doing, and (2) that there is a positive experience from which the existence of proximate real conditions of consciousness may be iniferred, the existence, namely, of neural and neuro-cerebral activities in living conscious organisms, which activities are never immediatelv presenited as contents of the consciousness whiclh they proximately condition. Now since pre-philosophic thouiglht invariably assumes that, in order of existence, there must exist a doer, before a doing of any kind can take place, that is, since it always in thoug,ht places a doer before a doing, referrilng, the</page><page sequence="28">S0 SHADWORTH H. HODGSON. existence of the doer (not of his doing) to solmie imiimediately preceding real condition, and so on in infinitum ; and since, in the case of consciousness, we are conscious of modes of being conscious-feelincg, perceiving, thinking, doing -without being conscious of any proximate real condition of them; we resort to an expedient, in pre-philosophic thought, to supply this absence of an immediately perceived proximate real condition by the idea of an agent stmi generis, an agent whose agency consists in modes of being conscious, anid upon whom those mDiodes can re-act so as to modify his subsequent actioni. It is thus, I think, what I have ventured to call the pre-philosophic conceptions of "I" and "Self" arise, conceptions which are uniiobjectionable so long as they are frankly accepted as what they are, nlamely, pre-philosophic designations of inidividual conscious beings, also called Persons, designations always calling, for analysis; but which are fatal in philosophy, tllat is, when treated as ultimate, true, and unanalysable conceptionis; for wvhen so treated they not only put a stop to further analysis, buit appear of themselves to secure a basis for a tlheory of the IUniverse, by idlentifying all agency with consciousness. The conceptions of a concrete conscious organismii, alnd of an " I," "( Self," or "Subject," which is consciousness and agent or agency in one. are alike pre-philosophic, anid cannot be adopted as ultimate conceptions, incapable of analysis, in philosophy. The fact that in consciotus process and conscious action, both volitional and nlon-volitioinal, we are never immediately aware of the neural or cerebral activities upon which that conscious process or action proximately depends, is the fact which not only eniables, buit almost irresistibly compels us to look for the agency of the process or action withini the consciousniess; that is, so long as we have not acquired or, having acquired, disregard the knowledge of the existence of these neural and cerebral activities, or in other words confine our view to what is sometilmies called introspection alone, which is virtually to assumiiie that lnothing but consciousness exists. The whole real</page><page sequence="29">VIEALITY. 81 mechaniism, so to speak, of consciousness goes on without our beingt immediately aware of it, aware as we immediately are only of the consciousness which proximately depends upon it. But it is a fatal error in philosophy to treat this real mechanism as non-existent, its existence and its function, as the proximate real condition of consciousness, beinig established by analysis of the contents of consciousness itself without assumptions. Now it is on introspection alone, disregrarding all knowledge of the mechanism, that all our ordinary thouaht and ordinary language concerning conscious process and conscious action are founded. Everything that we call a motive or a determinant of conscious process or action is a state or process-content of consciousness;-some sensation or perception, some pleasure or pain, desire or aversion, representation or idea, wish, initerest, emotion, thought, anticipation, purpose, volition. The laws of association are ordinarily held to be laws expressing connections directly obtaining between states of consciousness. All conduct, we say, is determined by motives, anid no motive is ever any- thing buit some state or mode of consciousness. The agency in consciousness is thus found, or seems to be found, within the consciousness itself. By disregarding the real mechanism we erect consciousness itself into a systemn of what we call purely mental or psychical processes and actions, a system having its agency within itself. In the ordinary or pre-philosophic use of the terms I, We, Self, or Subject, we do not enter on the consideration of the seat of the agency imlplied in those terms; we take them to designate concrete self-conscious agents, without further analysis of tlhem. It is only to concrete self- conscious agents, not to their constituents taken severally, that Moral Responsibility can be conceived as attaching. The Freedom of action attaches, when it exists, to the mechanism or real conditioning alone, and is pre-supposed in moral responsibility. But moral responsibility includes both con- stituents, the real action of the mwechanism, and the consciousness wvlich is dependent upon it. F</page><page sequence="30">82 SHADWORTH IT. IIODGSON. But the disregard of the mechanism is arbitrary, and consequently the independence of the psychical or mental system, having its agency within it, is imaginary. Once admit the existence of the mechanism, and its relation to conscious- ness as determining the occurrence of its states anid contents, and the mode of applyina this conception in explanation of the whole course of conscious process and action is clear; that is to say, no new difficulty arises in applying it, such as to call for the supposition of a real agency within consciousness itself. I do not say that there is lno difficulty in seeing how mierely physical miovements, actions and re-actionis, in living nerve or brain imatter whrich is not-consciousness, movenments not initiated or directed by feeling, or thought, can bring about trains of conscioussness which are called rational because they are apparently so initiated and directed, that is, in which conscious purpose seenis to be the guiding motive. A great deal has still to be done both in facing and overcoming this difficulty. But the mode of applying the conception in question is clear. Say, for instance, to take the case of volition, where the difficulty just spoken of is most apparent, that in a case of conscious choice between alternatives, the idea of the one is more pleasureable than that of the other, or that it is the idea of an action whichl is right while the other action is wrong or dubious, and that I select and resolve accordingly-what really takes place is, niot that the more pleasureable idea, or the idea of right as compared to wrolng or dubious, determines the occuirrence of the state of mind called selection or resolve, but that the cerebral activity coniditioning that idea, in interaction with the cerebral activity conditioning the alternative idea, determines the occurrence of the cerebral activity conditioning the state of consciousness called selection or resolve, which latter cerebral activity againi coniditions the efferent neuro- cerebral activity requisite to produce the presentations, if any, which are involred in what we call the realisation of the</page><page sequence="31">RlEALITY. 83 selected idea, or the carrying out of the resolve. The course of thie action runs entirely, so to speak, throuikgh the activities of the miiechanism and their interaction; it does not run at all through the states or processes of consciousness which they condition. And the same account obviously holds good of other cases of conscious process or action, of the most varied kinds, front those in which the motive seems to be a simple sense- presenitation, as where we withdraw the hand from a hot coal which we have inadvertently touched, to those in which the mliotive seems to be some complex moral idea, or some intense emnotion, or vividly felt desire, whatever may be its kind, or the rank it inay hold in the scale of moral and spirituial significance. There is always some activity in the mechanism which determines its occurrence and its intensity, and in which resides that efficieney in contributing to direct the course of action, which we wrongly attribute to the feeling or idea itself iln calling it a motive. When psychologrists talk glibly, as they so often do, of the undoulbted irnfluence which mental or psychical states, ideas, thoughts, affections, desires, volitions, and so on. exert on the body and bodily actions, they forget, as it seems to me, the high probability (to say the least) that psychical states may be themselves conditioned, not upon a em niind,"' or psychical agency within consciousness, but upon neuro-cerebral processes, and that their supposed effects may be conditioned 'upon the continued operation of those same processes. It is solely to express this relation of consciousness to the mechanisnm which proximately conditions it, that consciousness is rightly called an epiphenomereno7. As consciousness simply, it does not act as a motive in coniscious process and action. But this is not to give the mechanism alone the place or function of the whole conscious being, nor is to deprive consciousness simply of its own place and function in the scheme of things. We canniot but analyse conscious process or action into its two constituents, the mechanism and the colnsciousness. And it F 2</page><page sequence="32">84 SHADWORTH 11. HODGSON. must never be forgotten, especially in calling consciousness ati epiphenomenon, that its iultimate nature or qualities as such stand altogether outside any possibility of being accounted for by any cause or real condition whatever. They are ultimate data of knowledge, from which our very idea of causc or of real condition is originally derived. We indeed receive them as data, through channels the nature anid existence of which we infer fromii them, after having received them; previously to which inferenice we do not recognise theni or tlhink of tlhemx as data. Our whole knowledge inmediate and inferential thus consists of consciousness, whiclh only in point of its occurrence aind genesis can be accounted for; the real con- ditions accounting for these latter being, inferred objects, not consisting of consciousness, which objects, however, give us no insight into their own causes or real conditions. And suich causes or real conditions we must of necessity think they have. The very same evidence wlichl forces us to infer their real existence, as part and parcel of a real physical worldl of Matter, forces us also to infer, that they along with the rest of that world depend for their nature and existence upon somse real world or worlds, other than themselves, the nature of which cannot possibly be inferred from anything we knlow, or can ever get to know, of their own nature anid activities as physical or material existents. The evidence for the rea.l existence and efficiency of Matter is also evidence for the real existence and efficiency of the Supra-material or Unseen. To return to the place and function of consciousness as a constituent of conscious process and action, we have seen that it is not an efficient link or motive therein. All the agency or efficiency therein belongs to the other constituent, the livingi nerve or brain mechanism. What, tlhen, is the place or function of the consciousness ? It is tlle evidence of the nature and direction of the activities of the mechanism; not of course, of its physiological structure and activities, or of the laws which it obeys as living and organised matter, but of its character,</page><page sequence="33">REALITY. 85 tendency, and value, as kniown from the consciousness itself, whiclh is its c.Inditionate. It is the knowledge which the concrete conscious being has of his own nature and activities as a conscious being, and therefore of the mechanism or active constituent of that beinig, when once the two constituents are distinguished fromii eaclh other as we have now distinguished then. And the evidenice thus afforded is of the highest significance. Briefly stated it is to the effect, that in all conscious process anid action, volitional and non-volitional alike, the tendency or direction of the activities of the mechanism is froni the bad to the good, from the good to the better, and inot vice versd. We shrinik from pain and seek pleasure, in:voluntarily as well as voluntarily, and all voluntary action is inidisputably directed towards the attain- rnelt of some as yet iunattained end or good. There is, I think, no serious controversy on the question of direction or tendency. The only difference mnade by an analysis of conscious process or action like the present is, that it attributes that direction and tendency solely to the mechanism, excludingr the attenidant eonsciousness, whichi it considers solely as conditionate and evidence of the direction and tendelncy of the mechanism, not as also contributing to (letermine it. But it is the mechanism, andl not the consciousnless, which is the real linik, or link of real conditioning, connecting us as real and material beings with the real supra-material and unseen world, of which it is the real conditionate. It is a Power (usingcr this ternm in the most genieral sense) wvith which it thus colnnects us, but a Power of whose nature we ean know nothinrg but wlhat is involved in that Hope which is inseparable fromii, because it is the emotional elenment in, the tendency of our living mechanism to the good, combined with the thought of the infinite possibilities (so to call them) of the nature and qualities of consciousness, which as qualities are wholly independent of causation or conditionilng.

It is this Hope, inseparable from connected consciousniess, combined with the thoualgt of the infinite possibilities of consciousness, and not any speculative coniception of the nature of the Divine Being, wlhich is the livinig root and well- spring of religion.

They are the roots which Christianity lhas in the niatuie of imian.
