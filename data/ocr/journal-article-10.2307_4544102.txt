I MUST confess, at the outset of this short paper, to a doubt whether philosophers ever seriously question the objectivity of science in any deeper sense than they question the objectivity of perception: and this for a very real reason if Santayana's view be the true one; namely, that science is " nothing but developed perception, interpreted intent, common-sense rounded out and minutely articulated."* It is true that for generations the fashionable philosophies of science have been sceptical: but none of their creators have behaved as though they believed their doubts to be solidly founded. There is a peculiar cold feel about the first-handedness of the thing itself which makes all " theories about " science seem woolly. They have the kind of improper ornateness which comes from an unreal and artificial sophistication. It is as though one had gone further and fared worse. Perhaps it all comes down, ultimately, to a matter of style. It is a truism to say that in literature a certain dry austerity may be a more powerful and more subtle descriptive weapon than a rich luxuriance. And something of the same difference in atmosphere is, I think, observable in passing from the work of men of science themselves to that of writers on the meaning of science. The inspired simplicity of a Chekhov, like the fresh directness of a Newton or an Einstein, may leave its roots in the same soil. Mr. J. B. Priestley has recently described the method of Chekhov * G. Santayana, The Life of Reason: Rea8on in Science, p. 307. z</page><page sequence="2">212 A. E. HEATH. in the following words: "Being a man of his time .... what he is really interested in are not actions but states of mind. But he does not make it his business, as do most representative modern writers, to describe states of mind. He describes, as shortly as possible . . . . actual incident, action, and dialogue, and from them we infer what .his people are feeling."* In other words, the solidity he attains in suggesting subtle mental charac- teristics is achieved by direct treatment of bare fact. So too, in general, the complexity and beauty of man and his world are more likely to be conveyed by concentration on the immediate than by romantic elaboration. Miss Rebecca West, in one of her novels, seems to have sensed something of what I am trying to express. " It is a curious thing," she says, " that if you think and talk about the spirit you only look into the mind of man, but if you cut out the spirit and study matter you look straight into the mind of God."t A materialism, I would emphatically urge, is not necessarily implied in this view. What is, rather, suggested is that anthropomorphism is death to recognition of the true character and intricacy of the real. It is precisely this avoidance of anthropocentric views which gives to science its range and power. And it is because I believe that the importance of this factor has not been sufficiently emphasized in recent work that I offer this note on the subject. II. The place of the " impersonal " view in the development of a rational scientific procedure can best be brought out by exhibiting science as a growth related in definite fashion to earlier modes. In his book on Scientific Method, Mr. A. D. Ritchie spoke of * J. B. Priestley, Saturday Review, 1925, Vol. 140, p. 446. f The Judge, p. 337.</page><page sequence="3">OBJECTIVITY IN SCIENCE. 213 science as " the process of exploring the external world." This definition is, however, too wide. It does not exclude the mere accumulation of dead lumber. Science must be viewed as a particular kind of exploration, fashioned slowly to its present form through the ages. It is a characteristic mode of approach to the study of any field of human experience, and consists essentially of two steps whose alternations are comparable to the placing of first one and then the other foot forward in walking. These steps are (1) the observing and testing of a body of facts, and (2) the " ordering " or systematizing of those facts, by the discovery or creation of appropriate conceptions and hypotheses, into general and easily grasped truths. Knowledge of a chaotic body of facts does not constitute a science. To step (1) has to be added step (2). The body of fact has to be, in Professor Nunn's phrase, " rendered intelligible." Moreover, this double process is never finished; for the ordering of any field always directs attention back to a closer examination of the body of fact con- cerned. Theories constructed to co-ordinate facts lead to the discovery of new groups of fact; these, in turn, are susceptible of further ordering, and so on in an endless series. It should be noted that both steps are essential. In certain periods the need for constant critical and first-hand observation was overlooked, and science degenerated into system building; in other ages there have not been wanting those who regarded empirical and experi- mental processes as the sole requirement in scientific work-a denial of man's most valuable possession, the power of imaginative reason. For healthy scientific development a proper balance between the two factors must be maintained. With these considerations in mind we can now take what must, of course, be a very fleeting and simplified survey of scientific procedure as it emerges from earlier modes. In broad outline we may say that in Greek science at its best the balance between the two steps was already won in certain z 2</page><page sequence="4">214 A. E. HEATH. domains. The first victory was in the field of spatial experience; and the importance for thought of the step from the empirical results of Egyptian mathematicians to the general theories of Greek geometers cannot be over-estimated. Greek geometry not only developed the logical machinery necessary for the scientific mode of approach to the world of external physical nature, but also fostered the objectivity of outlook essential to that approach. Especially in those domains of nature where deductive processes play an important part, the emergence of a balanced " scientific " treatment became possible. This balance was lost again in succeeding ages in which, for complex reasons, there is a failure to value step (1). Much mediaeval scientific work may be regarded as coming under this description. It should not be forgotten, however, that such work often served a real function in co-ordinating known facts and views. Thus Dr. Singer, in his account of " The Scientific Views and Visions of Saint Hildegarde, 1098-1180,"* speaks of the use of the supposed relations between the macrocosm and the microcosm as a co-ordinating conception in which her theological and physiological knowledge, together with her notions of the working of the human mind and of the structure of the universe, are all synthetized. "The scheme, though complex and difficult, is neither incoherent nor insane. ... If at times it passed into folly and fantasy, it should be remembered that it also fulfilled a high purpose. It gave a meaning to the facts of nature." Indeed, Prof. Whitehead, in his latest book,t suggests that Galileo and the founders of modern science must, in their reaction from the " reasoned meanings " of their predecessors, be regarded as anti-rationalists conscious of the need to break clear of co-ordinating systems and contemplate " irreducible and stubborn facts." It is clear that the lack of stress, in early * Studies in the History and Method of Science, Vol. 1. f Science and the Modern World.</page><page sequence="5">OBJECTIVITY IN SCIENCE. 215 mediaeval science, on the first of our double steps represents 'a definite falling away from the " direct, detached, objective temper " which has been spoken of as the generative pnrnciple of the whole Greek achievement for civilization. In short, it was a regression to a more primitive form of treatment, and only a little way separates it from an earlier form still-animistic magic. Magic, like mediaeval s-cience, is too personal. Men read themselves, their feelings, and their desires into their explanations of the world. Aniniistic interpretation, however, like anthropomorphic ones, may still perform a true co-ordinating function. But there is this important further character of magic: it is developed in a much less conscious and deliberate way. The origin of sympathetic magic, for instance, does not appear to be intellectual illusion. The view which seems to be gaining ground is that the first element is the immediate discharge of longing in action. If the savage wants rain he " acts " rain by croaking as he has heard frogs croak when it rains. These acts stiffen into ritual, on this view; and beliefs in the efficacy of similarities follows later. Magical beliefs and practices are not, then, mere unorganised collections of baseless superstitions, any more than mediaeval science is altogether incolherent and insane. Both are primitive forms of approach to the world of nature; and they differ from the form characteristic of science in lacking, respectively, the qualities of being reflective and impersonal. So long as these embryonic modes of treatment of nature were the product of unreflective acts they could only take the stiff and self-central form of magical beliefs, corresponding to the social organization which Bagehot called the " cake of custom " of primitive societies. In some marvellous way we find, in ancient Greece, that the break-up of the cake of custom has been suddenly effected. Man's outlook on the world is not only deliberate and conscious; it is also objective. The loss of objectivity in later times was not, however, a complete regres-</page><page sequence="6">216 A. E. HEATH. sion to magic; for though mediaeval astrology was primarily concerned with human hopes and fears, and only secondarily with the stars, yet its vision did reach to the stars. Nevertheless the lack of appreciation of step (1) made even the newly-gained knowledge of Greek scientific results sterile for centuries. The re-discovery of what Roger Bacon called scienta experimentdis was needed to revive the balanced temper essential to science, The growth of this can be traced through transitional figures like Kepler to its full fruition in Galileo. III. It is important to notice that scientific procedure viewed in this way as a particular mode of approach to the study of any subject was, through many vicissitudes, first attained in its complete form by man in the realm of mathematics and external physical nature. The seventeenth century saw it applied to the complete domain concerned with the study of the rest and motion of material bodies; it was the age of mechanics. Succeeding centuries brought its extension to even wider fields of human endeavour: to various physical forces in Nature, and to the field of chemical fact, in the eighteenth century; to the domain of biology in the nineteenth. And in our own time there is the attempt to apply it to the realm of mind and to the products of mind, including social institutions. The order of application is important because it brings out the pregnant fact that the series brings us ever nearer to man's inner nature. The reflective impersonality necessary for scientific treatment was won first, naturally, in regions furthest removed from his personal interests and desires. Extensions into regions nearer home to his hopes and fears have had to be achieved by hard struggle, and each has been hailed at first as blasphemous or indecent intrusions into domains not susceptible of scientific treatment. M. Bergson once tried to conceive what would have been the effect on the</page><page sequence="7">OBJECTIVITY IN SCIENCE. 217 world of knowledge if the sciences of mind had been developed before those of physical nature. But the thing is impossible. It was only by easy stages that man could win through to the " ethical neutrality " needed for that stepping aside from the anthropocentric position without which a science is unattain- able. This is the heart of my contention that the character of imper. sonality is an essential to science, and indeed to all knowledge. I hold, too, that it is just as necessary in the sciences which deal with man himself as in those dealing with physical nature. On this point I imagine I differ from Prof. G. C. Field. I find myself in agreement with most of what he had to say in the admirable paper he recently read to this Society.* I can follow him in be- lieving that the background of " ideals of explanation " which were sufficient for the progress of the physical sciences may, be inadequate for other branches of knowledge. But at the same time I feel that these ideals of explanation vary in character in each autonomous branch of science; that, in other words, it would be nothing strange if psychology needed a philosophical background different from that of physics. On the other hand, it seems to me that this would not necessarily destroy its char- acter as a science. What would do that would be the presence of serious anthropomorphic elements in that background. On all questions, whether physical or mental, where his passions are roused, man is too anxious to be certain to have time to know. And it is probably that, rather than the absence of a body of suitable ideals of explanation, which delays the science of psycho- logy. Mr. J. W. N. Sullivan has put the case in his usual racv way. "Psychology is the latest of the sciences," he says, " not so much because of the difficulty of its subject-matter as because our interest in the subject-matter is so vehement that it is almost * " Ancient Philosophy and Modern Science," pp. 117-134.</page><page sequence="8">218 A. E. HEATH. impossible to be indifferent to the results. An intelligent fish would probably have found most of the painfully-won results of human psychology fairly obvious."* IV. A critic might well ask at this stage, whether the very presence of " ideals of explanation " does not vitiate the de-humanised character of a science at its source. Prof. Leonard- Russell sug- gests this possibility in the paper in which he develops the notion of wide and pervasive types of generalization which guide the investigator and which are so much more challenging than preliminary hypotheses that he calls them " demands."t Humai nature, 'is part, of the nature of things, he says. But the funda- mental thing is not, on this view, the projection of man's nature into the nature of things; " it is the way in which man enters into nature, through his various activities, by making such demands as his nature constrains him to make." Professor Russell, however, does not take so anthropocentric a stand as these quotations would suggest. For he answers, in some degree, his own difficulty: man, he says, must submit his " demands" to the discipline their working out involves. That is to say, the demands which form the background of guiding ideas in the estab- lishment of the broad framework of a science must, like the more restricted hypotheses of the science, be brought ultimately to the test of fact: There is always an objective reference back to the field of " primary fact " (to use Prof. Nunn's useful term) in which all these growths have their rmots. The initial form of a hypothesis or of a demand may be anthropomorphic, but it would be committing the genetic error of supposing that the origin of a thing determines its ultimate nature, if we assumed that its * J.

It does not seem to be commonly realised how all-pervading the act of selection is in scientific work. The scientist chooses his facts; he selects from a range of possible laws; he picks out the hypotheses which best conform to his body of more generalized theories; and finally (as Prof. Russell has shown) he comes to realise that there has been an element of choice in his general theory-systems determined by his ' demands" or "ideals of explanation." Yet at no stage in this hierarchy is the objective reference lost sight of. The scientist selects his facts in order to produce the widest possible co-ordinating hypotheses, though the facts must be there to choose from. " In order that the facts obtained by observation and experiment may be capable of being used in furtherance of our exact and solid knowledge," wrote Whewell long ago, " they must be apprehended and analyzed according to some conceptions which, applied for this purpose, give distinct and definite results." The man of science chooses also his laws-generally on the grounds of simplicity. It would be possible, for instance, to replace Ohm's law by a more compli- cated expression which would agree equally well with observation. Mr. Norman Campbell, in his book Physics: TIke Elements, brings out this arbitrary element in scientific laws. The " truth " of a law, according to Mr. Campbell, depends on its fitting the observations; but its " meaning" comes from the intellectual satisfaction which the particular law chosen affords. The laws of science, then, are chosen from among other possible laws because they fit into theories " the form of which is dictated chiefly by preconceived ideas of what a theory should be." This intro- duces a personal element which often determiines the type of laws characterizing an age or a country. Nevertheless, we must not forget that if any law can be shown to be " untrue " it will at once be rejected, however much " meaning" it may .have.</page><page sequence="10">220 A. E. HEATH. Again, theoines and hypotheses, the next stage in this series of levels, are subject to choice. But here also the selection is alin to natural selection in the animal world. "The world little knows," Faraday said, " how many of the thoughts and theories which have passed through the mind of the scientific investigator have been crushed in silence and secrecy by his own severe criticism and adverse examination." And, finally, it is possible that it is the existence, side by side, of alternative theory-systems (such as those based on general mechanical theory as contrasted with those brought into being by quantum theories) which has focussed attention upon this same element of choice at the highest stage of all. Here, again, we must be careful to avoid assuming that a bare and arbitrary element of personal choice is involved. It is not nearly so simple as that. Dr. Dorothy Wrinch puts the whole matter in regard to these wider and more generalized theories with admirable clearness. She shows that the unusual assumption of a discrete series of states for a physical system, made necessary by quantum theories, can be put in terms of abstract properties of the relation between different states of a single physical system.* The choice between a discrete and a continuous series of states can be related to the general character- istics of compact and well-ordered serial relations. As so often happens, she says, the cogency of our objections, which come from the initial strangeness of the ideas, disappears as soon as those objections are stated in their most fundamental terms. " Physical intuitions," she continues, "as to whether very complicated and obscure relations are discrete or compact are clearly, if I may say so, out of place. We have to assume to be true, whatever fits the facts of experience most adequately." The discontinuities of the Quantum Theory are, she insists, like the paradoxes of the * " The Quantum Theory in Relation to the Logical Concept of Con- tinuity," Goncept8 of Continuity: Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volume iv, 1924, pp. 29, 30.</page><page sequence="11">OBJECTIVITY IN SCIENCE. 221 Theory of Relativity; they are " not introduced to fit into our private unofficial view of the universe . . . Their justifi- cation rests on their usefulness in knitting together the facts of physics." There is, thus, at every stage in this series of selective processes, an objective reference which purges the choice of anything arbitrary or personal. V. Nevertheless, our critic might pursue us still further. Viewing the bewildering range of choice and the litter of discarded facts, laws, hypotheses, and theory-systems, he might exclaim with Mr. Sullivan: "To judge from the history of science, the scientific method is excellent as a means of obtaining plausible conclusions which are always wrong, but hardly as a means of reaching the truth."* Or he might declaim, in the fashion of Mr. Belloc on "The Microbe ": "Its eyebrows (of a vivid green) Have never, never yet been seen, But scientists, who ought to know, Assure us that it must be so. 0, let us never, never doubt What no one can be sure about." What the critic would overlook, if he followed these leads, would be the fact that the conceptions and hypotheses of science are never entirely discarded. There is always, as Mr. Sullivan is quick to point out, a part which is incorporated in the next advance. Moreover, as Prof. Poynting once said, " the classi- fication of known phenomena which a hypothesis has suggested, and the new discoveries of phenomena to which it has led, remain as positive additions to natural knowledge when the hypothesis itself has vanished from thought." There is a real sense in which the scientist is (to use a phrase coined by Air. E. M. Forster for a very different purpose) at an angle with the universe: the man * J. W. N. Sullivan, op. cit., p. 18.</page><page sequence="12">222 A. E. HEATH. who is always immediately in the wrong because he is ultimately in the right. The apparent immodesty of this claim is lessened if we consider the successive modifications in the definition of any particular scientific conception. We shall usually find great variation: but though the changes are startling to the uninitiated, there is generally a solid core of positive and cumu- lative knowledge embodied in the successive definitions and at the same time a drift towards greater objectivity as well as towards greater expressiveness. The difficulty is largely one of language. What is presented on the border lines of knowledge, either to the scientific discoverer or to the ordinary man trying to express some half-conceived but as yet inarticulate thought, is what we may canl a syncretic whole. This whole may be somehow realized long before analysis and subsequent synthesis have made possible its satisfactory expression. The words we assign to the complex things of experience may provide a leverage for the understanding prior to any proper knowledge of their true nature. It has often happened that vague and indeterminate scientific conceptions, like that of sether or of the unconscious, have had an instrumental value far beyond what their looseness would lead one to expect- which accounts for the dictum (due, I think, to Helmholtz) that in science a living error is worth more than a dead truth. Many mathematical notions, such as that of continuity, are made practical use of long before they receive satisfactory logical definition. The successive definitions, in cases like these, are pushed at each stage to the limit of their functional value, closer definition following only as the need is felt for it. The final concept, however, approximates more and more to a purely logical entity as it is cleared of the psychological impurity con- nected wvith its origin.* If, during this process, we are unsure * Many examples- could be given of this, but I will refer to one only. The conceptions centred about the second law of thermodynamics had, in their early stages, a pronounced anthropomorphic flavour. Yet Planck</page><page sequence="13">OBJECTVITY IN SCaENCE. 223 of the finality of the conception used at any stage, we need not be over-concerned so long as we can feel assured of a core of objec- tivity in the complex. I cannot do better, here, than quote Santayana again: " It matters little, therefore, to the pertinent knowledge of reality, if the substance of objects remains recondite or unintelligible, while their total movement and operation is rightly conceieved. It matters little if their very existence is vouched for only by instinctive faith and presumption, so long as this faith happens to be true and this presumption prophetic; for the function of perception and natural science is not to flatter our sense of omniscience, but to bring us presently important news of the strange world we live in."* VI. A more fundamental attack on the disinterested and detached character of scientific procedure might be made on the grounds that the whole notion of " rendering intelligible " the bodies of primary fact is a regulative ideal which is itself an anthropocentric prejudice. Prof. Whitehead speaks of " the inexpugnable belief that every detailed occurrence can be correlated with its ante- cedents in a perfectly definite manner exemplifying general principles." "Without this belief," he says, " the incredible labours of scientists would be without hope. It is this instinctive conviction, vividly poised before the imagination, which is the motive power of research : that there is a secret, a secret which can be unveiled."t had only to set out the series of modifications of the conception, stated in terms of the varying definitions of entropy, to be able to show that it can be expressed in a form independent of all anthropomorphic suggestions connected with early ideas on the subject.

Whitehead, op. cit., p. 17.</page><page sequence="14">224 A. E. HEATH. It seems to me clear that here is a " demand " behind which we cannot go because it is at the root of all our search for know- ledge. Prof. Broad has stated what is involved in this assumption that the world is intelligible. The natural scientist must assume not only that the world obeys the laws of logic, but also that certain other conditions are fulfilled. For example, the changes in the world must be subject to general laws which are not too numerous or too complex for us to unravel; and we must be in such a situation that our sensations come to us in an order which reveals the laws really present. Concerning these further con- ditions he says: "There is no logical reason for believing them, but there is a practical motive for acting as if we believed them. The practical motive, of course, is that, if we act on these postulates, we shall go on investigating; and that if, and only if, we go on investigating, we may discover explanations of what is at present unintelligible."* These conditions seem, therefore, to possess the characteristics of a minimum " demand " which must be conceded for rational knowledge of the world we live in: but they also form a maximum beyond which we cannot go if our body of knowledge is to be a science. * C. D. Broad, The Mind and Its Place in Nature, p. 510.</page></plain_text>
