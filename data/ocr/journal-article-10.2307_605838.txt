The expedition of Cyrus the Younger is twice (pp. 16 and 23, n. 39) dated 404 instead of 401; in the latter place it is credited to A. T. Olmstead and R. M. Cook who, of course, have the correct date. The prae- nomen of Pompey the Great was not Q. (p. 251) but Cn. Grainger follows the style of using Greek names in their origi- nal Greek spellings and not in the Latinized forms that are com- mon in English. This is perfectly legitimate, but then one should be consistent and write, for instance, Laodikeia he pros thalassei, or at least "Laodikeia-on-the-sea," rather than such awkward and nonexistent Greco-Latin hybrids as "Laodikeia- ad-mare." In his striving to replace every Latin -us by Greek -os, Grainger fell into the trap of hypercorrection by making "Anthemos" (p. 45) of the actual Greek Anthemous, -ountos. Grainger's appendix I, "Concordance of City-Names," which shows the "Pre-Greek Name," "Greek Name," and "Moder Name" of twenty-eight cities, leaves much to be desired. As the pre-Greek name of Apamea, not only should the cuneiform Niya have been mentioned but also the Persian Pharnake, pre- served by Malalas. The pre-Greek name of Arados should have been spelled Arwad instead of "Arvad," and its moder name likewise Arwad (colloquially Ruad) and not "Arad." The mod- em name of Beroia is Aleppo only in some European lan- guages; in Arabic it is Halab. The village at the site of "Chalkis-ad-Belum" is still called Qinnasrin. Duluk is not the pre-Greek but the post-Greek name of Doliche, the Arabic form of this purely Greek toponym; the pre-Greek name of the site is unknown. The pre-Greek name of Emesa is also unknown; the name, and the very existence of the city, are attested only since the first century B.C. The moder name Karkamis (not "Gargamis") is a recent renaming of the site previously known as Gerabis and should not be mistaken for a survival of the pre- Greek name. For the pre-Greek name of Hierapolis, Aramaic Mabbog should have been listed along with, or instead of, its Greek form, Bambyke. The pre-Greek name of Larissa, for which Grainger put "?," is perfectly well known from Stepha- nus Byzantius s.v. ("called Sizara by the Syrians") and from Res Gestae Divi Saporis (Syzry in Parthian, Sncly in Middle Persian, Sinzara in Greek). It goes back to the Late Bronze Age and possibly to the time of the Ebla archives. The pre-Greek name of Marathos is listed as "Marathus (?)." The Phoenician name of the city, Mrt, is, however, amply attested on its coins. Rhosos was certainly so called at the time of Alexander's con- quest. An older form of the name, Orossos, is attested in a codex of Plutarch's Demetrius, which strengthens Forrer's ten- tative equation of Rhosus with Assyrian Urrus, a city of Unqi. Certain place names are misspelled: "Khummmukh" (p. 43, n. 67) instead of Kummukh; "Atcharne" (pp. 69, 73, 104, 106) instead of Aacharne on French maps and in Courtois' survey report (standard spelling, CAsharnah); "Atcherine" (pp. 205, 220) instead of Akhterine in the survey report by Matthers et al. (standard spelling Akhtarin); "Tell Durak" (pp. 16, 117, 209, and even in the title of the excavation report by Oldenburg and Rohweder, p. 222), instead of Tell Darak; "Tell Tuqun" (pp. 19, 116, 209) instead of Tell Tuqan; "Rasm et-Tanjera," suppos- edly in the title of H. Athanassiou's thesis (pp. 114, n. 88, 212) instead of Rasm et-Tanjara, as it actually stands there. But the place of honor here belongs to Grainger's listing of Athanas- siou's study as "Ph.D. thesis, University of Mississippi, Colum- bia." One may know little about American states, and less about their universities, but it is impermissible to mistake "Missouri" for "Mississippi." Several names of moder scholars and the titles of their works fare no better. The venerable Israeli archaeologist, B. Mazar, be- came "Mazur" and was alphabetically ranged in the bibliogra- phy (p. 220) after Mazloum. Another Israeli author had his historic name, Bar-Kochva, changed to "Bar-Kockva" (pp. 95, n. 23, 212). The British archaeologist M. V. Seton-Williams, despite her double last name clearly hyphenated in the study quoted by Grainger, is called simply "Williams" (with the pro- noun "he" [p. 24]) and is listed in the bibliography under "W". Another bearer of a double last name, the Comte du Mesnil du Bouisson, appears in the bibliography under "B" instead of "M" and with de instead of the second du. P. van der Meer is listed as Meer, P. V. D. Some titles are excessively abbreviated. The series to which some books belong are not indicated. This does not facilitate the use of Grainger's bibliography for further read- ings. French titles are treated worst of all. Accents are often missing or misplaced; thus Bouche-Leclercq became "Bouche- Leclercq" and Dhorme, "Dhorme." That Rey-Coquais became in the bibliography "Rex Coquais" may be a simple typing error, but the way in which many French titles (too many to be listed) are quoted is of a different order. Singular instead of plural, mas- culine instead of feminine (and vice versa), superfluous letters ("d6scouvertes," "notre" instead of "note"), and spellings of French words (like "d6veloppement") as their cognates are spelled in English ("development") are rampant. Yet all that was needed to avoid these bugs was a little attention. I wonder why Oxford University Press, a prestigious publishing house, did not assign a technical editor to see Grainger's book through the printing? MICHAEL C.

Sun- dermann, and F. Vahman; the biography and bibliography of the honorand; and the acknowledgment of the financial support of the Danish David Foundation. The articles are arranged accord- ing to subject matter, as indicated below. I. Iranian texts and languages. A) Old Iranian. G. It6, in "Gathica XVI: On Yasna 32:16," proposes a number of new readings and interpretations of Gathic words: aighyd [i.e., a4hiia] with ms. J3 instead of ayhaiid, 1st sing. subj. of ayhiia &lt; lah "to throw," i.e., the manthra; usruiie &lt; *as.uru- "happiness" &lt; "very wide."1 J. Kellens, in "Une Vari- ation du timbre de l'anaptyxe en vieil-avestique," examines the distribution of the forms siiaoOnangm, siiaoOananqm, siiao- O5nanqm in Old Avestan: the third was the original one. R. Schmitt, "Achaemenideninschriften in griechischer liter- arischer Uberlieferung," concludes that none of the self-styled inscriptions of Cyrus the Great and Darius I, as reported by Greek authors, can be regarded as authentic. W. Skalmowski dis- cusses "Old Persian vazraka-": &lt; *varzda- &lt; *vrzda-, cf. Skt. vrddha-, and the semantic development of OPes. vasna &lt; lvas.2 B) Middle Iranian. M. Back discusses the word "Kirdegan" of the Sasanian inscriptions, as well as its attestations in Book Pahlavi and Manichean texts, concluding that it means "liturgy, Gottesdienst"3 &lt; Avestan &lt;kar "to recite" but later influenced by \kar "to do." H. W. Bailey derives garo of "Garo-Saman" &lt; &lt;gher "to enclose" (cf. Eng. garden, Lat. hortus), the whole meaning "enclosure, garden."4 B. Hjerrild discusses "Zoroas- trian Divorce" on the basis of passages from the Pahlavi law books: "We find the divorce laws subject to alteration and mod- ification that reflect different exigencies at different times .... The Sasanian period reflects a tolerant and realistic point of view.... Subsequent considerations about divorce are no longer primarily legal: they become instead spiritual and moral" (p. 71). H. Humbach and Wang Shiping present a new 1 But "wide" is vouru- in Avestan. 2 P. 40: Pers. bald is not &lt; Ivrd but *bard-, Av. baraz- "high." 3 P. 48 No. (13): KNRb 8 'wgwnms means "thus he (showed) me," or better, in my opinion, emend to 'wgwnms(n) "thus they (i.e., the gods, showed) me." Thus also Ph. Gig- noux, Les Quatre Inscriptions du mage Kirdir: Textes et con- cordances, Studia Iranica, cahier 9 (Paris: Union Acad6mique Internationale; Association pour l'Avancement des Etudes Iraniennes, 1991), 37. On p. 49, Back suggests 'dwyn mhly might mean "customary hymn" (or the like) and refers to the Avesta. 4 Khot. gramna occurs once in the Khotanese summary of the Ramayana, where its meaning is not clear from the con- text. Emmerick, in a new unpublished translation, takes it to be from gran- "to growl," also attested in the Jatakastava. edition of "Die pahlavi-chinesische Bilingue von Xi'an." The inscription, discovered in 1955, dates from 441 C.E. and was written on the tomb of the woman *Mahanos.5 M. F. Kanga ed- its and translates "Epistle I Ch. XI of Manuscihr Yudanmiyan." M. Shaki, in "Pahlavica," discusses the Book Pahlavi word haspanwar "resting place" &gt; Persian aspdnur; awadag "gen- eration," the derivation of which from Old Persian uvdda "lin- eage"6 cannot be correct, as intervocalic d would not survive in Middle Persian (other than in Avestan loanwords). He also discusses 'wsl'yn', which he regards as a misspelling of xwa- rayen, a legal term for a woman who arranges her own mar- riage.7 A. Tafazzoli discusses a mention by al-Biruni of "The King's Seat in the Fire-Temple," transmitted as ^ LS^ , , to be read as dengahi. C) Other Middle Iranian languages, Irano-Aramaica. W. Eilers, in "Euphonisches i und der aramaische Emphaticus auf -ya," surveys in characteristic manner a "universal" linguistic phenomenon. R. Emmerick edits and translates "Some Verses from the Lahkavatarasatra in Khotanese" included in the 10th- century Khotanese miscellany of Buddhist doctrinal texts, the Manjusrinairatmydvatarasitra. The Sanskrit and Tibetan texts are compared. J. Greenfield discusses the expression "Nergol dhspt," connecting the Iranian title dhspt with the Iranian loanwords in Armenian dahc and dahepat, "executioner, chief executioner," a reference to Nergal's function as "keeper of the underworld and the god of pestilence" (p. 141). N. Sims- Williams, in "Syro-Sogdica III: Syriac Elements in Sogdian," gives a list of all the Syriac words in Christian Sogdian texts and discusses their morphology. P. 0. Skjaerv0 edits and trans- lates "The Khotanese Hrdayasutra," a prajinparamitd text.8 The Khotanese translation is from the "longer" version. The Sanskrit and Tibetan texts are compared, and a glossary and ex- cerpts from a Late Khotanese (10th century?) commentary on the sutra are included. W. Sundermann, in "Der Schiiler fragt den Lehrer," edits and translates "a collection of Biblical puz- zles in Sogdian," as the subtitle says. A glossary is included. 5 The conclusion of the inscription: "And may her place (gah) be with Ohrmazd and the Amahraspands in the lumi- nous(?) Garodman and the best existences (pahlom axwan)" indicates that she was a Zoroastrian rather than a Manichean, as, to my knowledge, pahlom axwan (transl. of Avestan va- histam ahum) is not found in Persian Manichean texts. 6 The word should probably be read as *uvddatam; see J. Har- matta, "The Bisitun Inscription and the Introduction of the Old Persian Cuneiform Script," Acta Antiqua Academiae Scientia- rum Hungaricae 14 (1966): 280. 7 Another possible derivation might be from Avestan *xva- Oraiia- "protecting her own (rights?)." 8 On the probable Chinese origin of this text see J. Nattier, "The Heart Sutra: A Chinese Apocryphal Text?" Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies (forthcoming). 271</page><page sequence="3">Journal of the American Oriental Society 114.2 (1994) D) New Iranian. B. Alavi, in "Neologismen in der moderen persischen Schriftsprache," surveys the efforts to develop a mod- em Persian technical terminology for translations from Euro- pean languages in various modem fields such as sociology, philosophy, and politics. J. Be6ka discusses the work of the Bukharan Jewish poet Mordexay Hiyo Bacayev, "A Continuator of Judeo-Persian Literature." G. Lazard, in "Remarques sur le fragment judeo-persan de Dandan-Uiliq," returns to a Judeo- Persian letter repeatedly discussed in moder times. He dis- cusses yzyd "God," for ezie or izi6; kwdh "Lord," for xuSa, xu6ah, or xu6ah; and 'y, which he interprets as the hortative par- ticle e &lt; Middle Persian ew.9 M. Lorenz, in "Die Anfange der Pasto-Literatur," discusses several aspects of the Peta Xazana, or "Hidden Treasure," which-it has been claimed-contains the oldest Pashto poem preserved. Lorenz ranges himself with those who reject the opinion that the work is a falsification but recognizes that more research is needed to determine its exact nature.10 S. Shaked publishes "An Early Geniza Fragment in an Unknown Iranian Dialect," a Judeo-Iranian text containing in- struction in an Iranian language for how to use certain Aramaic magical formulas. The Iranian language clearly belongs to the group of Central dialects, and the fragment is therefore one of the oldest (10th-12th centuries) specimens of these dialects.ll B. Utas discusses "The Manuscript Tradition of Misbah ul-arvah and the Application of the Stemmatic Method to New Persian Texts." F. Vahman publishes "Two Baxtiari Prose Texts: Stories of the Fools." E. Yarshater discusses "Approaches to the Trans- lation of Persian Poetry." II. Religious science. A) Zoroastrianism. M. Boyce, in "The Lady and the Scribe: Some Further Reflections on Anahit and Tir," elabo- rates on some of her previously published discussions of the early Iranian pantheon. G. Gnoli's "A Note on the Magi and Eudemus of Rhodes" contains reflections on the use of the 9 Lazard does not explain why we find ... bdaad, with the subjunctive rather than the indicative, which is the usual form (bottom of p. 209). We can, however, compare the Manichean Middle Persian usage, where ew beh "may he be, amen" is the only instance in which the optative is used after ew. 10 See now also L. S. Loi, II tesoro nascosto degli afghani (Bologna: Il Cavaliere Azzurro, 1987). 11 One might consider naming it "Judeo-Median," as op- posed to "Judeo-Persian." Shaked has published further such fragments in "Judeo-Median" in Iranica Varia: Papers in Honor of Professor Ehsan Yarsater, Acta Iranica 30 (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1990), 230-39. On the Central dialects see P. Le- coq in Compendium Linguarum Iranicarum, ed. R. Schmitt (Wiesbaden: 1989), 313-26; and G. Windfuhr, "Central Dia- lects," in Encyclopaedia Iranica (Costa Mesa, Calif.: Mazda Publishers, 1991), 3:242-52. term "Aryan" and the Zurvanism of the Achaemenids. S. S. Hartman, in "Questions au sujet du &lt;&lt;temps&gt; de l'Avesta," dis- cusses various aspects of the Avestan terms "unlimited" and "limited time." F. M. Kotwal publishes a Pahlavi text pertain- ing to the ndwar ceremony: "Initiation into the Zoroastrian Priesthood: Present Parsi Practice and an Old Pahlavi Text." B) Manichean and Gnostic studies. U. Bianchi, in "Sur la question des deux ames de l'homme dans le manich6isme," re- examines the significance of St. Augustine's statement, duae animae vel duae mentes "two souls or two minds," one good and one bad, the bad one being the origin of sin. Bianchi pro- poses that the two animae are the soul as consubstantial with the deity (essential dimension), the second the soul as dispersed and exiled in the world (existential dimension).12 A. Bohlig, in "Zum Selbstverstandnis des Manichaismus," examines the Manicheans' view of themselves and points out, along the way, the Gnostic models, especially the Valentinian system, for vari- ous elements of the faith. H. J. W. Drijvers discusses "Mar- cion's Reading of Gal. 4.8: Philosophical Background and Influence on Manicheism," showing the relationship between Marcion's, Bardesanes', and Mani's conceptions of the creator god and matter (hyle). J. Duchesne-Guillemin, in "On the Ori- gin of Gnosticism," gives a resume of S. Petrement's Le Dieu separe (Paris: Editions du Cerf, 1984; English translation by Carol Harrison, A Separate God: The Origins and Teachings of Gnosticism [San Francisco: Harper, 1990]). H.-J. Klimkeit, in "Das Tor als Symbol im Manichaismus," discusses the image of the gate, which Manicheism took over from Gnosticism and which symbolizes liberation and redemption. Gates play a role on the cosmic level, in the (macro)cosmic structure made by the Living Spirit, as doors leading out from the world, and on the microcosmic level, as the doors of the senses, which lead out to the world and which one should endeavor to close. S. N. Lieu collects the "Sources on the Diffusion of Manichaeism in the Roman Empire," which were later fully exploited in his book, Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China: A Historical Survey (Manchester: Manchester Univ. Press, 1985). 12 It seems strange that the soul even in its second aspect would be the origin of sin. It seems to me more likely that Au- gustine is referring to the doctrine of the "mentality (of the body)," Middle Persian menogih (i tan), which is part of man as a creation of the forces of darkness and with which the "soul," Middle Persian gyan, is mixed "like silver in copper."

Gignoux, in "Les Antece- dents nestoriens de la Chahada," traces the history of the Islamic formula, "there is no god other than God," in pre-Islamic sources: a coin with the formula inscribed in Pahlavi, in the early Christian Pseudo-Clementine Homilies (4th century), the Gnos- tic Secrets of John (late 2nd century), and the Syriac acts of the martyrs (5th-6th centuries). T. Olson discusses the "Imagery of Divine Epiphany in Nusairi Scriptures." D) Buddhism. J. W. de Jong discusses "Buddhism and the Equality of the Four Castes." C. Lindtner, in "Buddhist Refer- ences to Old Iranian Religion," presents numerous references to the teachings of yondka-deva, "the god of the Yonakas," said to have been created by Brahma, and the maga-sastra, "code of the Maga," or that of the parasikas, "Parsis," in Bhavya's Tarkajvala (6th century C.E.) probably derived from a Kashmirian 2nd-century Sarvastivada compendium, the Ma- havibhdas. Lindtner identifies yonaka-deva with MiOra and Brahma with Ahura Mazda but quotes in a note (p. 443) an opinion of W. Sundermann's that they may also be Zurwan and Ahura Mazda, respectively. P. Zieme, in "Das Pravdrana- sutra in altturkischer Uberlieferung," publishes and discusses Old Turkish parallels to a text containing instructions for a Buddhist confession ritual. III. History, geography, ethnography, mythology. A) History and geography. M. Dandamayev and V. Livshits, in "Zattumesu, a Magus in Babylonia," propose to interpret this name, attested in the Murasfi documents (2nd half of the 5th century B.C.E.), as Old Iranian *Zantu-vaisa- "a servant of the tribe." R. N. Frye discusses "Minorities in the History of the Near East." W. Hinz, in "Grossk6nig Darius und sein Untertan," discusses the content of Darius's exhorta- tion to the marika, his "subject." G. S. Jakobsd6ttir publishes and translates "An Icelandic Manuscript on Iran" from the late 18th century. 0. Klima, in "Samo: 'Nationale Francos,"' dis- cusses the Avars and their king Samo (mid-7th century), prob- ably "one of the Syrian subjects of the Frankish king" (p. 490). D. Weber, in "Zu einigen iranischen Ortsnamen bei Ptolemaios," discusses two place-names: Tribazina &lt; *tri- bajina "of the three temples" and Rizana &lt; *Ricana &lt; 1raik "to flow." B) Ethnology and mythology. G. S. Asatrian and N. Kh. Gevorgian, in "Zaza Miscellany: Notes on Some Religious Cus- toms and Institutions," publish materials from "the archives of Gevorg Halajyan-a former inhabitant of Dersim-kept in the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian Soviet Republic" (p. 499). A. D. H. Bivar, in "The Allegory of Astyages," concludes that the Iranian "legend of Azidahaka ... arose initially from the reality of the Caspian sturgeon" (p. 513) and that it was later reinterpreted al- legorically (though not etymologically) to refer to various harsh rulers, among them Astyages. J. R. Russell describes "The Rite of Muskil Asan Behram Yazad amongst the Parsis of Navsari, India." F. Thiesen discusses "A ghazal by Badrun-Nisa 'Biban,"' a Pakistani poetess of the 20th century. F. Thordarson discusses "The Scythian Funeral Customs. Some Notes on He- rodotus IV, 71-75," comparing recent archaeological discover- ies and the Ossetic Bcekh fceldisyn ritual. PRODS OKTOR SKJERV0 HARVARD UNIVERSITY Gott und Gotter im alten Agypten. By SYLVIA SCHOSKE and DIETRICH WILDUNG. Mainz am Rhein: PHILIPP VON ZABERN, 1992. Pp. viii + 240. DM 88. This is a provocative and infuriating catalogue! The 143 objects here presented for the first time were col- lected by an anonymous, presumably German, collector, over the course of thirty years, whose guiding principle was the Qualitat der Objekte. Indeed, the authors, long-time advocates of the value of art history and the primacy of the object over the text in the discipline of Egyptology, repeat this collector's prin- ciple in their introduction. They, too, are interested in quality. Since collector and curator are so in accord on this issue and since this collecting principle dominates the discussions found in both the foreword and introduction, why is there absolutely no exegesis anywhere in the catalogue either about issues of quality or of the criteria by which quality may be measured or determined? One cannot simply accept ex cathedra that quality is self-evident to the connoisseur. The blind acceptance of the bald assertion that the objects in this catalogue are of high quality leads to a second, some- what tendentious, premise: Masterpieces provide more infor- mation about certain aspects of ancient Egyptian culture than do texts and inscriptions. This emotionally charged polemic, which champions the cause of art historians within the field of Egyptology at the expense of philologists, who have long dominated the discipline (see the comments in the volumes edited by N.-P. Grimal and by M. Eaton-Krauss and E. Graefe), is not supported by any comment in the book. So, for example, in espousing this position, the authors take the unex- pected step of prefacing the entire catalogue with a provoca- tive statement about the frontispiece, an uninscribed faience figurine of a kneeling anthropomorphic ram-headed deity who offers an image of a baboon. Challenging the philologists to explain this extraordinary group by recourse to a textual refer- ence, the authors maintain that objects, not texts, provide the discipline of Egyptology with the exceptional window on the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians, because no known text has prepared anyone for this particular image which is unique, authentic, and of high quality, a tricolon which in 273</page></plain_text>
