<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ancient Farmers in the Tedzen Delta by I. N. Hlopin In the ancient delta of the Tedzen River, about 20 km. southwest of the city of Tedzen (today in the middle of the sand and clay desert in the southeast Kara Kum) there is a group of nine hills that were formed on the sites of Chalcolithic villages (fig. 1). The largest of these hills is called Geoksjur. From 1956 to 1965, these sites were the object of archaeological research carried out by the Kara Kum Archaeological Expedition of the Archaeological Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, headed by V.M. Masson. The entire group of sites took its name from the Geoksjur oasis. Apart from its name, every hill was given a temporary number: Geoksjur 1, Geoksjur 2, and so forth O (fig. 2). The general exploration of this compact group of ancient agricultural sites took place mainly in two directions: 1) the stratigraphic excavation of the sites, for the clarification of the quantity and cultural location of the component strata involved, and 2) excavation principally of the upper building horizons of all the sites, possibly over a very wide area. Methodical choice turned out to be of value throughout, and confirmed the posi? tive value of such an approach in examining the archaeological objects brought to light: at the same time, this procedure let us take note of certain regularities that had pre? viously escaped notice, and furthermore, let us raise a whole series of theoretical and methodological problems that can serve for all the archaeology of the Middle East. The enormous amount of material on hand does not permit us a full description of the research carried out in the Geoksjur oasis or a satisfactory formulation of all the historical con? clusions to be drawn from it. In the present article, therefore, we can only offer a general summary of the archaeological sources, as well as those conclusions that can be drawn from them regarding the social aspect of the history of this territory's ancient peoples.

The vast stratigraphic excavation of the site of Geoksjur 1, the series of explora? tions of other sites, and the upper building horizons of all nine sites at the Geoksjur oasis, not only enabled us to link together in a single system the sites and monuments of the ancient delta of the Tedzen River, but also allowed us to establish their chrono? logical link with the main sites on the plain at the foot of the Kopet Dagh (fig. 3). On the basis of geomorphological research in this area, we were able to distinguish three great periods in the history of the Geoksjur oasis, the culture of which differs in var? ious ways from that of the hilly strip at the foot of the Kopet Dagh. The first of these periods, that of Daslydzi, corresponds to late Namazga I; the second, that of Jalangac, to the oldest and most evolved Namazga II; the third, that of Geoksjur, to late Na? mazga II and early Namazga III. 53</page><page sequence="4">^^^^^^^^^^ jSSS?BBS ^^j^^jjjj^j^^^ s^^y \ J \ / 5 S 7 II y of * -| W If IB 17 Fig. 4 - The cultural complex of the Daslydzi period: 1-7, earthen pots; 8, unbaked clay statuette of a small ox; 9, terracotta female figurine; 10-11, terracotta objects; 12-13, stone objects; 14-15, copper objects; 16, bone; 17, plan of the settlement of Daslydzi-tepe.</page><page sequence="5">1. Archaeology Daslydzi Period This is a period of occupation and appropriation of the delta of the Tedzen River by peoples originally from the sites of the northern plain at the foot of the Kopet Dagh. The three-strata site of Daslydzi-tepe and the lower building horizons of five other sites can be entirely referred to this period: Geoksjur 1, Akca-tepe - Geoksjur 2, Jalan gac-tepe - Geoksjur 3, Ajna-tepe - Geoksjur 6, and Geoksjur 7 (fig. 4). This period's architectural remains are well preserved in the second and third building horizons at Daslydzi-tepe. They show that the site consisted of 8-10 inhabited com? plexes; each complex of this type was made up of a one-room house of about 8-10 sq. m., surrounded by domestic and business edifices. The rooms of the dwellings were built of moulded unburned bricks; the walls were covered with plaster and the floor was of beaten clay, with traces of various layers of plastering; the door openings have thresh? olds but usually lack the stones set as pivots, on which the lower part of the door axis could move. The hearth, built of brick-on-edge courses, was in a corner of the room. 55</page><page sequence="6">Despite the slight differentiation of the dwellings at Daslydzi-tepe, we must single out house no. 1, which is found in two building horizons. It is 28 sq. m. large, the inner part is very carefully planned and it has a special raised area, divided from the rest of the house by a barrier with openings for passing through; this suggests that this room was not only a dwelling but also a building for social use, one that in the first stages of evolution of a productive economy usually differed from dwellings only in size, and not in ground-plan (2). The main finds on this site are ceramics, with fragments of pots, jugs, cups, tureens and cauldrons. The first four of these ceramic shapes are usually decorated with designs applied in one colour (brown) on the inner or outer surface (cups, tureens). The main motifs are: a series of triangles in silhouette, shovel shapes in silhouette, outlined triangles, triangles and rhombi with hatched filling, chevrons and zigzag, ribbon motifs, and in a few cases drawings of trees and animals (fig. 5). The shovel silhouettes enable us to fix the period of colonization of the ancient delta of the Tedzen River by farm communities, since almost identical drawings can be found in the lower building horizon at Daslydzi-tepe, as well as in the sites of the foothill strip from Namazga-tepe (26th 27th level of excavation no. 1) and Jassy-tepe and Kaahka (2nd-3rd building horizon). These drawings may indicate that the delta of the Tedzen River was about to be oc? cupied, since settlements existed in the above-mentioned strata at Namazga-tepe and Jassy tepe; as for absolute dating, this event took place at the start of the 4th millennium before our era. Stone and bone tools, and organic remains: these elements form the basis for our conclusions regarding the economic level of the ancient population of the Tedzen River delta. Agriculture was the basis of that economy, along with fully developed breeding of livestock: herds included both large and small horned animals; there was a proportion of 1:3 between the two sizes. Large animals (boar, gazelle and onager) were hunted and provided about 10% of the entire meat supply. Material revealing the elements of the spiritual culture of the first colonists includes female statuettes of terracotta and animal figurines of unburned clay. Two female stat? uettes represent an iconographical type not met with in any other part of Southern Turk menia. The small head with barely sketched eyes and a small indented nose sits on a torso without hands and breasts, to which only a row of glass beads has been applied. The greatly enlarged buttocks are completely covered with small notches and are joined to the stunted lower part; the front side is perforated by a deep hole. The animal figurines are mostly small (goats) but larger examples have also been found. On the whole, the cultural characteristics of the early sites at the Geoksjur oasis are similar to the culture of the peoples of the northern plain at the foot of the Kopet (2) A phenomenon of this kind was also pointed out for the Neolithic culture of Dzejtun; see O. Berdyev, ?Nekotorye rezul'taty izucenija drevne zemledel'ceskih poselenij ?, Karakumskie drevno sti, III, Ashabad, 1970, pp. 14-32. 56</page><page sequence="7">Dagh, even though there is a noticeable tendency to form local differences. The preser? vation of certain Neolithic traditions of the Dzejtun culture in the construction of the houses and in the planning of the villages, and the conservation of a complex of ceramic decoration, known as Namazga I, let us sustain the local, Southern Turkmenian origin of the population of the delta of the Tedzen River, and the preservation by that popu? lation of this social and cultural heritage, in possession of which it arrived in the new areas. Jalangac Period This is the most intensive period of colonization of the Geoksjur oasis. The strata of this period include all the sites of the oasis except for Daslydzi-tepe, abandoned by its inhabitants at the end of the preceding period. They were penetrated by excavation on the sites of Geoksjur 1 (building horizons 7-4) and Cong-tepe (Geoksjur 5) - levels VI X; six of this period's sites (Jalangac-tepe, Mullali-tepe (Geoksjur 4), Ajna-tepe and Akca tepe (Geoksjur 7 and Geoksjur 9) were explored over a fairly broad area. It was seen that they all consisted of a row of houses for habitation, that can already be considered as having undergone a certain process of differentiation; then there were houses not in? tended for habitation, that combined the function of both sanctuary and social dwelling; and lastly, the defence walls, with round rooms included within the planning of their circuit. The largest site of this period was that on the hill of Geoksjur 1. The overall study of the finds from all the sites supplied us with detailed and multi? lateral characteristics of the Jalangac period (fig. 6). The dwelling-houses, distinguished above all by the accurate separation between walls and floors, can be divided into three groups: 1) one-room houses without hearths; 2) one room houses with domestic charcoal-burning hearths, usually located near the door; 3) two room houses, containing not only a hearth, but also a clay platform-brazier, or else a round altar. Besides these dwellings, the round constructions included in the circuit of the walls were probably inhabited as well; in fact, tiny hearths were found in some of them, evi? dently more useful for heating the room than for cooking food. Given the variety of these buildings, we can discover here the reflection of a real social differentiation within the community that had settled in this or the other villages. It is very likely that these one-room houses with hearths served as dwellings for what were ordinarily pair families. The houses without hearths may have been used to shelter the unmarried members of the collectivity or families that were being formed at the time. Finally, the houses in the third category may have belonged to the repre? sentatives of the older generation who, thanks to their authority and experience, seemed to have had the right to carry out various magical and religious rites, not only publicly but also individually. In carrying out such rites, meant to guarantee prosperity and the improvement of the community's standard of living, the privileged and dominating class managed to justify in the eyes of the other members of the tribe the appropriation of part of the community's products and earnings. 57</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 6 - The cultural complex of trie Jal?ngac period: 1-8, earthen pots; 9-11, flint objects; 12-14, copper objects; 15-16, bone objects; 17, clay female figurine; 18, plan of the Jalangac settlement.</page><page sequence="9">The large (22-37 sq. m.) rectangular buildings, located in the central area of all the sites (Jalangac-tepe, Ajna-tepe, Mullali-tepe, Akca-tepe and Geoksjur 9) belong to a special type of construction. They have some peculiar aspects: a more compact wall construction (with two rows of bricks), permanence in the same locality during several building periods, a lack of hearths for daily living inside them and, above all, the existence in them of a rectangular clay platform-brazier, surrounded by a cylinder and divided into two parts. In one case (Jalangac-tepe) an extremely stylized anthropomorphic sculpture with openings filled with charcoal was discovered on the wall of such a building. Nevertheless, the peculiarities mentioned above do not allow us to classify these constructions as dwelling 59</page><page sequence="10">houses; there can be no doubt that in this case the archaeologists have come across very ancient fire sanctuaries, which in those times could fulfil also the functions (well-known from ethnographic parallels) of the "men's houses", represented by the alou hona of the Tajiks as well as by that of other agricultural peoples of Central Asia (3). The defence constructions of the middle of the 4 th millennium before our era typical of sites dating from the time of Jalangac, are remarkable, both in appearance and in the nature of the building technique used. They consist of a polygonal enclosure about 50-60 cm. thick, formed of straight segments of wall about 8.5-10 m. long; at the joints between segments we find round rooms about 3-4 m. in diameter, with plastered floors and hearths inside. As we noted above, these rooms may have been used for living purposes. The reason for the appearance of these buildings is still not wholly clear and demands more thorough examination of the details of the social history of the Late Chalcolithic communities. We have a fairly good-sized collection of pottery from the sites of the Jalangac era; this enables us to draw some historical conclusions. Since the ceramics of this period are basically uniform in all the sites we have listed, it is not necessary to supply their characteristics for each separate site. These can be summed up for the entire period. All the ceramics of the Jalangac complex can be divided up into three main groups, starting with the patterns that form their decoration. The first and largest group includes the pottery with the so-called Jalangac painting (fig. 7). The motifs of this type of painting are extraordinarily simple: horizontal lines along the upper rim ? two or four ? linked by twos with any kind of geometrical shape, or else simply by a line; sometimes lightly curved arcs hang down below that line. The zig? zag and chevron pattern belong to this group. The origin of the Jalangac type decoration can be established in a perfectly precise way: it is a further development of the painting of the preceding period, that of Daslydzi, a development towards simplification and decline. The material we possess enables us to put the Daslydzi and Jalangac patterns on the same level of decline, from the frieze of high artistic value of the silhouettes of triangles of the Namazga I type down to the four stripes, closely tied together, that run along the upper rim of vases of the late-Jalangac type (fig. 8). These patterns help us define the relative chronology of the sites brought to light, since, in the oldest strata of the Geoksjur excavation, the stripes are further apart than in the later strata. Further study made it clear that on the basis of this feature, all of the Jalangac painted decoration can be divided into three successive groups. The earliest group consists of those vessels, and consequently the strata of the sites that contain them, in which the distance between the stripes varies from 13 to 16 mm.; these are building horizons VI-VII of the site of Geoksjur 1, two upper building horizons of Jalangac-tepe and three building horizons of Ajna-tepe. The second group consists of the friezes with a distance of 4-5 mm. between the stripes; these appear in building horizon V of Geoksjur (3) Hlopin, Geoksjurskaja gruppa cit., p. 150. 60</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 8 - Evolution of Namazga I patterns in painted motifs of the Jalangac period. T T 1 and at Mullali-tepe. The narrowest stripes, with a 2 mm. interval, correspond to the latest strata; these are horizon IV of Geoksjur 1, levels V-X of the Cong-tepe site, and the upper sites of the hills of Akca-tepe and Geoksjur 7. At the site of Geoksjur 9, the distance between the stripes is reduced to as little as 1 mm. This correlation of the cultural strata of the oasis' sites reflects the actual picture of the dynamics of the occu? pation of the delta of the Tedzen River. The second group of patterns includes the motifs of a geometric type, applied in the same colour on the same assortment of pottery, with one exception: the large "storage" vases with almost vertical sides, decorated with painting that is only found in this group. A total of 85 containers decorated in this way was found, and it was possible to divide them into five groups, shown in fig. 7. At first sight, these designs stand out quite a bit from the local line of evolution of decoration, so much so that for a long time it was believed that they originated from other regions; in fact, the roots of this kind of decoration were actually sought for in the culture of northern el-Ubaid (4). Accurate ex? amination of these pictorial themes against the background of the entire field of ceramic decoration in Southern Turkmenia ? that is, a dialectic and not a metaphysical approach to the archaeological material ? let it be shown that the production and origin of the entire group of geometric patterns of the Jalangac era was in fact purely local (5).

Most of the prototypes, shown in fig. 9, were found in the sites of the delta of the Tedzen River, and that gives us the right to assume that these very vessels may have served as models for the local potters. In covering the tall pots with decoration, the potters laid them on their sides (at a 90? angle) and applied the same decoration used on the cups, but in a different direction. When the pots were set upright, they appeared covered with broad vertical stripes. All this can be clearly seen in fig. 9; we thus cannot share the point of view of those scholars who find it pos? sible to assign this group of ornaments of the Geoksjur oasis to some immigrant people linked to the el-Ubaid culture of northern Mesopotamia. It is now possible, in fact, to state without hesitation that this ceramic decoration is not at all proof of the arrival in South-eastern Turkmenia of an alien people, and its contribution to the evolution of the Chalcolithic period; the cultural and historical evolution of the local agricultural collectives took place without external influence, without stimulating impulses that came from else? where. This still does not mean, though, that the population of the Geoksjur oasis in the Jalangac period was completely isolated. It preserved its earlier and very active contacts with the population of the small sites scattered along the foothill strip. These contacts and links took shape in the third component of the Jalangac ceramic complex, that is, in the pottery with polychrome decoration of the Namazga II type (about 120 examples of pottery of this type have been found in the sites of the Jalangac era). There was a con? ception that vessels painted in this manner may have been manufactured in the sites of the Geoksjur oasis, but this hypothesis must now be abandoned: a far more developed firing technology is needed for producing such pottery, and not a single fragment of a large vessel with polychrome painting was found in the oasis. Vessels of this type have only been found in the places where they were manufactured, that is, the sites of the foothill strip; it was hard and, above all, unnecessary to transport them many kilometres to the east. Since this pottery cannot be considered a local product, we shall not devote our attention to it any longer (6). As compared with the Daslydzi period, the sites of the Jalangac period supplied us with a huge collection of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic terracotta sculptures. More than 70 fragments of female statuettes were found, one of them entirely intact and another series almost intact. The wholly intact statuette appears to be unique of its kind, a small sculpture about 28 cm. high: it represents a seated female figure with no hands, the face rather weakly modelled but the loins highly accentuated with a very interesting painted (6) Hlopin, Pamjatntki razvitogo eneolita ctt. 63</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 10 - Figurine of a goddess from Jalanga?-tepe. decoration of fifteen small solar circles on the thighs (fig. 10). The magical meaning of this decoration is still unknown, but the most probable explanation is that it is a very ancient account of the calendar of these old farming groups (7); according to their sys? tem, the solar year at that time was made up of 15 months of 24 days each; and as in other parts of the world, 5 "supernumerary", "unlucky" days were left over, shown as angular figures. From a summary examination of the cultural remains of the Jalangac period we may come to the conclusion that during its course there was an exceptional enlargement of the occupied area of the Geoksjur oasis, with an increase in the inhabited points and, as a result, an increase in the population of the oasis. The differentiation of the buildings on the sites is not casual; it reflects certain real processes that took place in the society of the (7) Hlopin, Geoksjurskaja gruppa cit., pp. 103-108. 64</page><page sequence="15">ancient farming peoples of this zone. The evolution of the ceramic decoration reveals that the historical process in the ancient delta of the Tedzen River evolved, in that pe? riod, spontaneously and without outside influence, apart from traditional ties with the peo? ples of the foothill strip of the Kopet Dagh. Geoksjur Period This is the period of population decline and therefore of a progressive diminution of life in the ancient delta of the Tedzen River, the result of the drying-up and shifting of the delta's river-beds. Nevertheless, this period is marked by a further progressive de? velopment of all branches of the culture and economy of the ancient population. The archaeological material (fig. 11) permits us to distinguish two stages within this period, an earlier and a later. In the earlier stage there is a concentration of the population in two single sites, that is, at Geoksjur 1 and at Cong-tepe (life barely continues at Mullali-tepe); all the remaining sites of the oasis reduce their existence to a great degree. In the later stage, the site of Geoksjur 1 is neglected, and life continues, in what once was a flourishing region, only at Cong-tepe; and very soon even this remnant of the population moves south, establishing the new site of Hapuz-tepe about 18 km. from Cong-tepe. Life in the Geoksjur oasis then vanishes until our own day. Some large excavations on the hill of Geoksjur 1 revealed important sections of the ancient site, which were sharply distinguished in their planning from the earlier small sites of the Jalangac period. The site of the Geoksjur period was made up of a series of many roomed buildings, joined together to form quarters isolated by streets and dividing walls. In every building of this type there are rooms for living with hearths for heating, rooms for storing supplies for home and business, small inner courtyards that served as kitchens, manufacturing areas in the form of pottery kilns and, finally, sanctuaries. These last appear as a relatively small square room, at times preceded by a small courtyard; its entrance door, walls and floor were carefully finished, and in the middle there was set a low round altar (up to 15 cm. high). The altar was made of clay and was baked hard by the fire lit on top of it; in the centre was a deep opening with uniform white ashes in it, and cylindrical rims forming a kind of small border; the altar measures an average of 70 cm. in diameter. Apart from the sanctuaries with round altars, there have been brought to light on the same site large rooms evidently destined for cult purposes like the above, but pro? vided with square altars; their line of development can be clearly followed on the exam? ple of other similar buildings from the Jalangac period: this suggests that the latter are sanctuaries intended for the entire site, while those with round altars might very likely be considered domestic or family sanctuaries of a "quarter". The planning principle of the sites of the Geoksjur period is completely different from that of the preceding era, even if we cannot state that the two have nothing in com? mon. Single elements of the future many-roomed constructions already appear at a very early date (at the start of the Jalangac period, at the site of Ajna-tepe), but at that time 65</page><page sequence="16">15 16 !7 Fig. 11 - The cultural complex of the Geoksjur period: 1-7, earthen pots; 8-11, terracotta female figurines; 12, burial chamber in the site of Geoksjur 1; 13-16, flint arrow-heads; 17, plan of the settlement of Geoksjur 1.</page><page sequence="17">these elements do not have an important effect. The really basic difference in the plan? ning principle of the sites and in the structure of the habitations, in the two consecutive historical and cultural periods, reflects an equally concrete difference in the social organi? zation of the people of those periods. Without trying to draw historical conclusions from this fact now, we shall merely say that this problem should only be studied on the basis of the entire complex of archaeological facts, part of which we shall use in what follows. Unlike the sites of the Jalangac period, on which not one ancient grave was found, we might say that the Geoksjur period filled the gap. An immense necropolis was brought to light and studied on the site of Geoksjur 1; it was made up of a few dozen round constructions (with a few rectangular ones), that is, of burial chambers with their relative collective burials (8). The number of burials in these chambers varied, and took place suc? cessively. Apart from the skeletons of the dead, the chambers also contained an excep? tional number of furnishings, made up of stone and ceramic vessels, jewels and other pro? ducts. But also isolated graves dug in the ground were found in the lowest strata of the hill. Returning, in this connection, to the most remote periods, we should note that no graves were found in the small sites of the oasis, not because people did not die or were not buried at that time, but because ? in contrast to an opinion widespread among 20th century archaeologists ? in the Chalcolithic Age the dead (or in any case, not the adults) were not buried beneath the floors of the houses still used as dwellings. They were buried outside the limits of the village, if its area was so small as to be entirely occupied, or else in those sections of the village that were free from housing at the moment of burial; this last circumstance could only take place on large sites, when people lived on just one part of the hill, while there were the ruins of earlier houses on the other part, also used as cemeteries. One can therefore presume that the presence of graves in the village confirms that in the period to which such graves can be dated, the village did not occupy the entire hill but only part of it; the site of Geoksjur 1 and many other sites of this period in the foothill strip can be referred to hills of that type. This fact should definitely be kept in mind when one considers the size of the population in this or that site; the real area of the site on which graves were discovered must have been related to the area of the hill in a proportion not inferior to 1:2. The ceramics of the Geoksjur period are surprising in their variety of colour and their rarity. Their decoration consists of various geometric figures, executed in two col? ours: the combination of pattern and colour creates a singular play of artistic effects and gives us full authorization to consider the Geoksjur decoration as one of the most inter? esting phenomena in the art history of the Near Eastern and Central Asian countries. The entire variety of ceramic decoration can be divided into two main groups: geometric patterns not containing a cross, and patterns containing a cross or part of it. The motifs (8) V.l. Sarianidi, ? Geoksjurskij mogil'nik ?, Novoe v sovetskoj arheologii, 1965. 67</page><page sequence="18">4e) oO oa</page><page sequence="19">of these groups can be assigned in the following way: 40% to the first group, 60% to the second. The friezes of the first group, with geometric filling, are divided into three types, in which this subdivision reflects the real genetic roots of the decorative motifs (fig. 12). The designs of the first type originate from the small reticulate squares that come about in a natural way when the coating of the vessel is washed, in much the same way as, in later times, the splitting of glaze on porcelain led to the formation of a special decorative motif, known as craquele. The second type of pattern (rhombi with reticulate filling of the inner space) stubbornly repeats the ornamental motifs characteristic of the preceding period. The third type of pattern, which can be subdivided into other more detailed varieties, also finds its genetic prototype in certain motifs, in the case in point, of the polychrome decoration of the Namazga II period and type, decoration found in the ma? terial from the sites of the foothill strip of the Kopet Dagh. Words are not needed to confirm the accuracy of this opinion: it suffices to observe fig. 12, where the main motifs of the painting of the Geoskjur period are shown along with their origins. Those friezes that contain the pattern of a cross with equal arms, or parts of it, are basic for the Geoksjur style of polychrome ceramic painting. But even for them we can differentiate by studying their origin; despite their late nature, it is possible to establish the different genetic prototype of each of them, which of course also has chronological differentiation. The oldest design of a cross with equal arms, included in a six-cornered car? touche painted red, predominates in the two upper building horizons on the site of Geok? sjur 1. Finds from the preceding cultural period let us define in a fairly clear way the entire development pattern of this type of cross, a pattern represented graphi? cally in fig. 13. The upper series shows the design from a vessel of the first Geoksjur period, in the form of a background cross (fig. 13.1); next to it on the left is the pattern of a frieze from a vessel of the Namazga II type, with a coloured polychrome decoration. Since we definitely know that this group of ceramic decoration had a certain effect on the formation of a series of designs of the Jalangac ceramic complex, we can also extend this judgement to the pottery of the first Geoksjur period; the unquestionable resemblance and genetic affinity of these patterns leaves no room for doubt. Another cross motif was being formed under the influence of the geometric painting of the Jalangac complex: at the beginning (fig. 13.2), the cross was formed by the reciprocal intersection of the frieze of the cups with the vertical stripe of the vessel, shaped like a storage jar, but later (fig. 13.3) the potter no longer left unhatched two small triangles in the central part of the cross, with the result that a very spacious rectangular rhombus was formed in the centre. The proportions of the cross pattern were not accurate, so that the sides of the central rhombus were doubly shortened. The design which then appeared (fig. 13.4) was far more elegant and better proportioned, and was reproduced in large numbers, so that it then became the starting-point for the further variants of this pattern (fig. 13.5-7) (9).

The cross-shaped patterns of the second type were mainly found in the excava? tions of the upper stratum of the Cong-tepe site, a stratum some building horizons later than the upper site on the hill of Geoksjur 1. Despite a superficial resemblance, there is no genetic relationship between the patterns from both sites: the cross decoration of the late Geoksjur culture is based on patterns from the pottery of the Namazga III period, patterns that show as clearly as possible the traditional nature of the mutual dealings be? tween the population of the Geoksjur oasis and the foothill zone of the Kopet Dagh; this fact is demonstrated by fig. 14. This design clearly shows that all the cross-shaped motifs of the Geoksjur type have counterparts in the sites of the Namazga III period, above all at Karatepe near Artyk. Only these designs were what we might call "trimmed" at Geok? sjur, and thanks to this operation they lost their usual appearance, which it was not so easy to recognize again. And in fact, this illusion gave rise to the opinion that there were no local genetic roots for this group of patterns. The result was that there was not one group of ornamental motifs left which did not originate from the Southern Turkmenian material; this means that there is no point in look? ing for the source of the Geoksjur polychrome painting outside the boundaries of this zone, and still less in wanting to extend such research to such distant zones of the Near East 70</page><page sequence="21">Fig. 14 - Outline of the formation of the cross shaped decoration of the late Geoksjur period. as southern Mesopotamia and Elam (10). The population of these areas was extraneous to the historical evolution of a small group of related sedentary agricultural communities, set at the extreme northeast of the agricultural oikumene of the Near East. istumm Apart from clay, stone too was used as material for making vessels, especially a white or pink limestone very similar to marble; but other kinds were used as well, including a gray sandstone. The first kind of stone was employed for making thin-walled vases with horizontal upper rims, and massive cylindrical vessels resembling mortars, with vertical grooves; sandstone was used for mortars, or vases with round or square recep? tacles on a small base. Many fragments of elegant vessels made of a red layered stone were also found. We unfortunately have only fragments to represent a vast collection of anthropomor? phic terracotta sculptures. It is nevertheless possible to distinguish in them certain stylis? tic and chronological groups. One part of the female statuettes continues the old Jalangac tradition, another part reflects the strong influence of the plain population at the foot of the mountain, and this fits well with the general tendency inherent in the traditional influences. A certain amount of terracotta sculpture has no visible roots in the preceding periods, and this fact was the cause of the search for its genetic roots in the Mesopota mian cultures.

In fact, new iconographic approaches, such as the appearance of male stat? uettes, must be explained as the result of a change in the ideological sphere. And so, our description of the characteristics of the archaeological material from the sites of the Geoksjur oasis ? a description that as a summary one has no intention of representing an edition of that material ? can at any rate be considered definitive. What remains to be done is to draw some conclusions from this classification, those suggested by the concrete archaeological material on the basis of the data and the chronological succes? sion; in other words, to sum up the conclusions in regard to the evolution of ceramic decoration in the oasis for all the periods in which that decoration existed, with the aim of verifying once and for all, if possible, the presence or absence of influences from other cultures in the Geoksjur oasis. At times pottery and particularly its decoration acts as a kind of "litmus paper" for the historical process, as an indicator that helps answer certain questions asked by the investigator. In all likelihood the decoration of the ceramics of the Namazga I period, taken as a whole, was a local product, even if it is possible that some influence on the formation of certain aspects of that decoration may have come from the communities further south, that is, from those peoples living in the territory of what is now northern Iraq and Iran. This decoration is so thoroughly uniform for all of Southern Turkmenia that one can speak of the absence of a strong cultural differentiation in this period, as regards this very extensive area; still, the presence of certain palaeo-ethnographic differences cannot be excluded. At about the Namazga II period we note an isolation of the eastern districts, an isolation that takes concrete shape and is evident in the ceramic decoration. In the western region, the monochrome patterns of the Namazga I type are replaced by polychrome painting of the Namazga II type and period; in the eastern region, on the other hand, the Jalangac deco? rative complex predominates in this period. As we mentioned above, this complex is made up of three parts: degraded motifs of the Namazga I type, imported polychrome painting on pottery of the Namazga II type, and local imitation of the imported polychrome deco? ration, carried out in one colour only. The polychrome decoration of the Namazga II type continues its evolution in the western region along the line of its natural development, gradually losing its earlier so? lidity and substantiality of design and its original two-colour technique. This process is in? terrupted by the appearance in the foothill zone of the Kopet Dagh of a substantial geo? metric decoration, of the early Namazga III type, after which there appears a stratum of pottery with zoomorphic decoration and other patterns, a highly particular stratum in the stratigraphic scale of the Southern Turkmenian sites of the Namazga III period. A similar phenomenon takes place in the eastern region too, even if the internal reasons for this phenomenon should perhaps be sought for in various spheres; the Ja? langac decorative complex is interrupted, and shortly thereafter gives way to the Geoksjur polychrome painting. These Geoksjur polychrome motifs, in their original appearance, can 72</page><page sequence="23">at first glance be seen to be completely different from all the other ceramic decoration in Southern Turkmenia; this is why ? as we tried to show above ? they have a completely local origin and are all-important for this style of cross motifs. They originated thanks to the cultural influence of the polychrome decoration of Namazga II type and the mono? chrome decoration of Namazga III. This decorative system later develops along the path of a breaking-up of decorative representation and then ends its existence at the introduc? tion of the potter's wheel and the mass production of pottery in the Namazga IV-Namazga V period. To make this process of evolution clearer, we have shown its outline ? which is that of the development of ceramic decoration in the Chalcolithic era ? in fig. 15, where we see distinctly the absence, in the Geoksjur oasis, of traces of the arrival and the presence of a population that has come from without and belongs to another culture, as some scholars would prefer to believe even now, scholars who unfortunately still have not surrendered to the evidence. 73</page><page sequence="24">co O co Q&gt; u cd s co o cd cm cd a cd co cd a cd i ? o co o L ?*?? co o ? cd O co o cd a cd ? co O a cd co o cd a cd 05 co o 1? co o cd o. co O cd a cd &gt;N ??? &gt;co Q 16 12 co ? 3 co o cd co O cd a cd co cd a ? 5 * ? co O cd o co cd a cd ? ?8 co cd a cd CO CO o cd a cd ? 05 co o JL. 3 **-&gt; co o cd O 00 co o a cd &gt;N 3) J-1-1_I_I ? i OL J_I_I-_1-1? Fig. 16 - Relative height of the hills and number of building horizons. 2. The Dynamics of the Occupation of the Ancient Delta of the Tedzen River The material described above gives us a general idea of the dynamics involved in the occupation of the ancient delta of the Tedzen River: at the very beginning there were three sites, but in the subsequent period their number increased tc eight, and in the last period diminished to only two; after that, life in these places was interrupted, since under the influence of neotectonic phenomena in the Turanian plain the waters of the Tedzen River stopped flowing there as its delta slowly shifted towards the south. In fact, some observations based on the correlation of figures expressing the height of the hills, their area and the thickness of their cultural strata (that is, the thickness of the cultural horizons), and so forth, let us detail and define this process to a high degree. But even though the dimensions of the hills are objective data, we must dwell here on the problem of the variation in the thickness of the building horizons. For this purpose, we have calculated the height of the walls of the buildings in the excavated sites, as well as the thickness of the building horizons in numerous excavations; this thickness can be established satisfactorily on the basis of the partition walls of the floors and the height 74</page><page sequence="25">of the intersected walls. The average thickness of the cultural stratum turns out to be 60 cm. It is now possible to fix, without any difficulty, the number of building horizons in any site of the oasis, by dividing its height by the figure of the average thickness of the cultural stratum, that is, by 60 cm. The figure reached in this way is not completely definitive, since there may be fluctuations within the limits of 1-2 building horizons. Nev? ertheless, the increase in the soil stratum took place in a wholly uniform and normal manner over the entire area of the oasis, and this allows us to ignore similar fluctuations. Having calculated in this way the number of cultural strata in each of the nine sites of the oasis, we arrive at a series of figures; these figures are shown in a graph in which each hill is represented by a column with the corresponding number of building hori? zons (fig. 16). It should be pointed out, however, that the column that corresponds to the site of Geoksjur 1 has been fixed at a height of 18 building horizons, while in reality 75</page><page sequence="26">excavation carried out there only cut through in their entirety 10 building horizons. This lack of correspondence is neither arbitrary nor accidental. In fact, the excavation did cut through 10 building horizons, but also showed that on the hill of Geoksjur 1 the interments were made in the cultural strata since the Jalangac period. That means that in that earlier per? iod the hill was already so large that the actual inhabited site only occupied part of it, while the cemeteries took up the other part of the hill (see above). In other words, starting from the Jalangac period, we have the right to consider each building horizon of the excavation as the reflection of two of the site's building horizons: that is, of one that really existed on that site, and of another that existed somewhere else on the hill, but was represented by the dead buried at that moment in an "empty'" spot. That is why, starting with the eighth building horizon, we have doubled the number of building hori? zons at the excavation, thereby obtaining a minimum calculation, even though in reality there may well have been others. It is also true that, if we compare the areas of each site of the oasis, we should cut down the real area of the hill of Geoksjur 1 by at least one half, to ascertain the area of the site that existed on that hill. We shall carry out this comparison below, on the basis of the unit of measure obtained from the size of the smallest site of the oasis: Daslydzi-tepe. When we know the relative number of building horizons on each site of the oasis, the relative size of each site, the material of the upper building horizon of each site and the relation of this material to the corresponding building horizon of the site of Geok? sjur 1, then it is possible to draw up a stratigraphic table. This means comparing the upper building horizon of each site to the corresponding stratum of the Geoksjur exca? vation, and lowering the corresponding number of building horizons; the width of each column should therefore correspond to the relative area of this or that site. The strati graphic table obtained in this way (fig. 17) lets us draw certain conclusions. We see from the table that the most ancient sites are the following: Daslydzi-tepe, Akca-tepe and Geoksjur 1. Three other sites ? Jalangac-tepe, Ajna-tepe and Geoksjur 7 ? arise later, and the last two only occupy the end of the Daslydzi period. The Jalangac period is represented by eight sites. There is a fact of basic importance which should be noted: three sites, founded at the end of the Daslydzi period, go out of existence towards the middle or second half of the Jalangac period; on the other hand, just about the same time, three other sites arise: Mullali-tepe, Cong-tepe and Geoksjur 9. Furthermore, at the end of the Jalangac period, Akca-tepe dwindles out of existence. The start of the Geok? sjur period is characterized by material from four sites, while for two of these (Mullali tepe and Geoksjur 9) this period was the final one. As can be seen from what we said earlier, in the Geoksjur period life in the oasis continued in only two areas; and after the population had abandoned the site of Geoksjur 1, Cong-tepe continued to exist through three building periods. These facts might not seem to offer anything new relating to the problem, but if the data listed in the table we have examined are referred to the real locality on the basis of the reconstructed hydrographic system of the delta of the Tedzen 76</page><page sequence="27">3 0 3 6 O2 ?'3 ?i Km W W Fig. 18 - Stages in the occupation of the ancient delta of the Tedzen River: 1, existent site; 2, aban? doned site; 3, artificial canals; 4, separation and diffusion; 5, transmigration.</page><page sequence="28">River the history and the dynamics of the occupation of the delta of the Tedzen will be seen in a new light. At the end of the Namazga 1 period, the plains of the Tedzen delta were colonized (fig. I8.1). The pioneers founded the small sites of Daslydzi-tepe and Akca-tepe on the western river-channels, and the site of Geoksjur 1 on the next river-channel situated further east, the largest of the entire delta of the Tedzen River. The Daslydzi period lasted no longer than the period corresponding to the existence of three or four building horizons, but a certain dynamic tendency can already be noted (fig. 18.11). Daslydzi-tepe was the first to be abandoned: its inhabitants were the first to feel the drying-up of the delta and were therefore forced to move to areas with a more plentiful water supply (perhaps to Akca tepe). Three new sites were born later, Ajna-tepe, Jalangac-tepe and Geoksjur 7, situated southeast of the site of Geoksjur 1. Let us point out that the first site is based on the same tributary as Geoksjur 1, while the other sites develop on a more southern branch of the main river-bed of the delta. All the new sites are relatively small, and the distance from Geoksjur 1 to these sites is approximately as follows: 4 km. (Ajna-tepe); 7 km. (Jalangac tepe); and 9.5 km. (Geoksjur 7). These sites should not be thought to have arisen after the arrival of a new population in the oasis, but as a result of the spread of the people of the major site of the oasis itself, Geoksjur 1 (see below). Five sites exist in the ancient river delta from the very start of the Jalangac period: Akca-tepe, Geoksjur 1, and three that were only small villages at the beginning but later became independent sites: Ajna-tepe, Jalangac-tepe and Geoksjur 7. As the drying-up process of the oasis continued, especially from the middle of this period onwards, we note a change in the picture of the occupied lands. The lateral tributary to the southeast, on which the sites of Jalangac-tepe and Geoksjur 7 had been founded, dries up and slowly goes out of exist? ence; the tributary that had supplied the site of Ajna-tepe shifts 1.5 km. to the west. The population of these small sites was forced to abandon its old inhabited centres and move to places closer to water and irrigated land. Three new settlements then arose: Mullali tepe, Cong-tepe and Geoksjur 9 (fig. 18.ni). The dynamics of the local change in inhabited points can be expressed in the fol? lowing terms of successive periods: first of all, in the south, on the upper course of the tributary that feeds it, the population of Ajna-tepe moves to found the new site of Geok? sjur 9 near the small fan-shaped area formed by the delta. At about the same time, the po? pulation of Jalangac-tepe also abandons its water-course, which is drying up. A bit further south, and further up on this same water-course, there lived the inhabitants of the Geoksjur 7 site, but the inhabitants of Jalangac-tepe had to completely abandon this water-course and transfer themselves to lands further south, founding there a new site on the hill, now called Mullali-tepe. After a certain length of time, the old-water course dries up com? pletely, and the population of Geoksjur 7 also leaves it; it advances around the Jalangac Lisicyna, op. cit., p. 51. 78</page><page sequence="29">Fig. 19 - Outline of the evolution of the population of the Geoksjur oasis: a, separation and diffusion; b, transmigration. Numbers in cir? cles refer to sites (see fig. 2). population, which now lives at Mullali-tepe, and founds Cong-tepe, the southernmost set? tlement of the oasis, closer to the main river-bed of the delta, a few kilometres further east of the sources of the southernmost arm of the delta. The stratigraphic table shows that only the interruption of life at Altyn-tepe cor? responds to its start at Geoksjur 9; taking into account the closeness of the two hills, one can state that the population of Ajna-tepe moved immediately and completely to the new location. The shifting of the seats of the population of Jalangac-tepe and Geoksjur 7, which, as it appears from our chart (fig. 19), took place towards Mullali-tepe and Cong tepe, was really a fairly steady and gradual kind of process: in the beginning, a certain section of the community may have left to found a new site, with the others arriving later; or perhaps part of the community remained on the site until it died out naturally. It is most interesting that the upper building horizon at Jalangac-tepe was more than doubly reduced in comparison with the horizons of the lower strata, thus proving that there was a real diminution in the size of the population on this site. It might be thought that an arbitrary choice was made in regard to the above-men? tioned pairs of sites that followed one another. But these pairs have basically an almost identical extension in size (from the map): Ajna-tepe and Geoksjur, 0.65 ha.; Jalangac tepe and Mullali-tepe, in round numbers, each 0.9 ha.; Geoksjur 7 and Cong-tepe, each 1.7 ha. These figures show that the newly-founded sites were inhabited by approximately the same number of people as those that had been abandoned. 79</page><page sequence="30">There are no particular doubts about the transfer of the site of Ajna-tepe to that of Geoksjur 9: the population simply moved upstream about 4 km. on the same tributary. But couldn't the population of Jalangac-tepe have settled on the site of Cong-tepe, and the population of Geoksjur 7 at Mullali-tepe? Even though this question is not a funda? mental one it still must be examined to obtain confirmation of the correctness of the meth? od of research proposed and applied. Above all, the best refutation comes from the correlation of the site areas, mentioned above. Another argument against it is the dif? ference in time involved in the abandonment of the original sites and, in connection with that, the founding of secondary settlements. The archaeological material tells us that Jalangac-tepe was abandoned by its inhabitants a few building periods before Geoksjur 7. And at the time, when the inhabitants of Geoksjur 7 had to change sites, the contraction of the southern arm of the delta of the Tedzen River was already quite perceptible. If Cong-tepe had already been founded by the population of Jalangac-tepe, there was no sense in the foundation of a small new centre on the site of Mullali-tepe, that is, down? stream on the same tributary. This fact convinces us of the correctness of the explanation of this pair of sites already proposed above: in the beginning, the population of Jalan? gac-tepe moved to Mullali-tepe, but some decades after that the citizens of Geoksjur 7 transferred their village to the locality of Cong-tepe. In that same period the site of Akca-tepe crumbles away, but we cannot establish the locality to which its population emigrated. In the oldest Geoksjur period, the delta of the Tedzen River contains four small sites in all: Geoksjur 1, Cong-tepe, Mullali-tepe, and the last period of Geoksjur 9; only two of the first sites can be referred to the Geoksjur period in the strictest sense (fig. 18.iv). The population of Mullali-tepe and Geoksjur 9 may have fused with the Cong tepe community, but it could also have left the delta of the Tedzen River. All the efforts made by the population during the Geoksjur period to-control the waters ? with arti? ficial cisterns and specially-dug canals ? turned out to be unsuccessful. The desert moved in relentlessly on the fields and the remains of dense groves of trees, foretelling the in? evitable and catastrophic end of the oasis. If people wanted to go on living, they had to abandon places in which they had lived for centuries and move south, following the withdrawing water. Hapuz-tepe: this is one of the great "road signs" along the desolate path of these "refugees". The possession of an accurate stratigraphic scale of the Geoksjur sites, one that we use constantly, urges us to clarify as well the later events involving life at the Geoksjur oasis. In such an attempt, one must try to establish the average life-span of a fixed building horizon. Unfortunately, the excavations do not supply us with direct evidence for such an effort, or at least have not done so up to now. Some indirect data and suggestions may nevertheless be obtained, and these ? in our opinion ? can help us in the attempt to define with greater clarity this problematic section of time, it goes without saying with a high degree of conjecture and approximation. The length of time for which a dwelling is used can be determined by two factors: 80</page><page sequence="31">by the stability of the material used in constructing it, and by the need for a given con? struction. A building of unburnt brick with rather thin walls (up to 0.5 m.) does not turn out to be a structure with a long life. Contemporary Turkmenian habitations built of unburnt brick or pah s? (beaten clay) can last for a few decades if subjected to constant plastering and repair. All the wooden finishings, and especially the roofs, are taken from abandoned houses, and are then used again for building new homes, while the walls are left exposed to the elements for many years. Only the lower part of the walls, sur? rounded by a kind of isolating layer made up of the destroyed material itself, manages to be preserved, sometimes for centuries. During the entire existence of this group of sites, the habitations were used as the settlements for entire families, groups which made up the kollektiv of the site. In all probability, the construction of a house can be tied in with the formation of a new family, a new nucleus of the community: in other words, with the moment when a couple entered into marriage. In that house they lived and raised their children, but when the new member of the community became an adult he could leave that house and start his own family, setting up the new generation in a new house. The parents went on living in the old house, and eventually died in it; it is not likely that their home passed into other hands at that point: it was probably demolished because of its poor condition, and its lack of economic value. Judging by the corresponding ethnographic and anthropological data, the age of marriage of the population in the southern agricultural belt rarely exceeded 16-20 years, while the average life span was about 50-60 years. If we use all the sites mentioned as starting-points, we can presume that a given Chalcolithic house could not last for more than 35-40 years, which more or less corresponds to the life span of two gen? erations, or in other words, to the period of existence of a given building horizon. Supposing that each building horizon corresponds to about 40 years, and that a mini? mum of 20 building horizons should be placed in each stratigraphic column of the sites, we can come to the conclusion that the time sector in which life flourished in the ancient delta of the Tedzen River can be calculated at about 800-1000 years. Within that space of time, 160-200 years can be assigned to the Daslydzi period, 320-360 years to the entire Jalangac period, and another 320-360 years to the Geoksjur period. But these figures are simply theoretical, and should only be thought of as useful for orientation. 3. The Geoksjur Tribe At the end of the 5th and the beginning of the 4th millennium before our era, that is, at the end of the proto-Chalcolithic period of Namazga I, there takes place a phenomenon of relative overpopulation in one of the regions of the northern foot-hill strip of the Kopet Dagh (in all likelihood, in the region of the present centres, Kaahka - Dusak). The size of the population in one or more sites increases to such a degree that the land under cultivation can no longer nourish and maintain the entire population; despite an increase 81</page><page sequence="32">in working effort on the part of each member of the community, the food quota for each member gets smaller and smaller. To resolve such a situation, it became absolutely necessary to carry out that segmentation of the community that ? as a stimulus and instru? ment of the historical process of a primitive and proto-class society ? was discovered and formulated more than a century ago by Karl Marx (12); it is well documented, on the strength of a great many ethnographical and archaeological examples (13). The collective detached from itself a certain group of people, internally bound by family relations and production affinities; they were supplied with grain, cattle and domes? tic wares and then left the basic collective which usually remained on the original site. This separate group, representing the social organism on a tribal basis, even if numeri? cally weaker, did not then emigrate to some distant and unspecified spot; it moved to some locality that had remained unused up until then (in the region of the unoccupied lands), until it came across a site that fulfilled two conditions: first, that its natural condi? tions permitted the economic habits of these emigrants to continue in practice, and second, that these lands belonged to nobody at the time. If these conditions were present, the group stopped there, if they were not, it continued moving on until it found a suitable site on which finally to settle down. Obviously people in those days were in no position to examine and choose with scientific criteria the complex of these natural conditions, with the result that the place chosen for founding a new settlement was not always adapted to their needs. At times the site turned out to be hostile to human life; at other times life continued on there successfully, even for a millennium. Thus, as the result of the segmentation of the central region of the foothill strip of the Kopet Dagh, there took shape a certain number of population groups that in a given concrete case, for a series of objective causes, turned out to be "in excess". The small rivers at the foot of the mountain, flowing down from the Kopet Dagh, irrigated land already occupied by other peoples, and no more living space was available; the problem of where to head and where to live demanded a new solution. The closest and most suitable place for a settlement was the delta of the Tedzen River, located about 50 km. east of the foothill strip and undoubtedly known to these peoples. There was enough water there and as a result, irrigated land. So that our "refugees" headed for that zone and settled down to found their new sites on the western branch of the "blind" delta. Thus began the occupation and appropriation of the delta of the Tedzen River. Three small sites (Daslydzi-tepe, Akca-tepe and Geoksjur 1) became the settlements of certain collectives, undoubtedly of a tribal nature; the size of these small sites lets us suppose that the first two were founded by parts of tribal collectives which themselves remained in the foothill zone, while the third group, on the basis of its size, gives the im (12) K.

But even if the Geok sjur tribal collective (let us call it such) had not already been exposed to segmentation in the foothill strip, this fate now awaited it in the new locality. Within a few genera? tions, the number of clan components that formed it increased so much that it could not be contained within the framework of a single economic collective. A relative segment? ation then took place, with the result that groups were detached to found three sites nearby: Jalangac-tepe, Ajna-tepe and Geoksjur 7. Their exodus from the original com? munity and their settling at such a close distance to it, led to a certain economic isolation of the new derivative collectives, without however cutting tribal links. The tribal bond only held real power when people lived in one place as a single community, but with the de? struction of the social order tribal power no longer functioned as efficiently as before. Nevertheless, the archaeological material shows that the entire population of the Geok? sjur oasis remained to a very high degree a closely-bound network of various groups; and that was only possible because of continual intercommunication, and a unified line of de? velopment of both material and spiritual culture. This means that even after the original sites such as Akca-tepe and Geoksjur 1, and the branch sites derived from them ? Ja? langac-tepe, Ajna-tepe and Geoksjur 7 ? continued their existence in the oasis, some force kept these five sites within a single community, even though that community had spread over a considerable area. We know of some stages in the social organization of primitive society: the family, the clan and the tribe, traditional triad of primordial communism. The oldest and most basic organization is the clan, whose origins are already fixed at the dawn of human so? ciety's formation; this is the instrument that made possible the evolution of man through social principles, principles destined to counterbalance and master the merely biological ele? ment. After a long stretch of time, occupied by the complete predominance of this social organism, a period which sees the evolution of a food-gathering economy, and after the switch of part of humanity to a food-producing economy, in this sector prevails the most detailed cell of human society: the family. The original family was formed spontaneously only after man, transforming himself from a hunter and food-gatherer into a farmer and livestock-breeder, had understood the gist of the process of generation; this family only ex? isted as a sanctioned community and unity between man and woman, for the purpose of generating offspring, but it had no economic meaning whatsoever. The economic life of society remained just as before, concentrated on the level of clan organization, and the exist? ence of a higher step in social organization was not necessary in the early stages of a produc? tive economy. The population of a vast region consisted of a number of small clan sites, each of which was exogamous and, consequently, ascribed its origins to an independent ances? tor; due to the law of exogamy, husband and wife in each clan belonged to different clans, but that does not mean that extraneous clans of heterogeneous origin were united in en dogamous tribes, simply because of their nearness to each other. When we have proof that the sites, even when separated from one another by a 83</page><page sequence="34">considerable distance ? sites that represented autonomous economic units ? continued to preserve ties with one another, we are forced to the conclusion that they were united more by a higher form of social organization than the clan. The only possible organization could be the tribe, since it corresponds to two basic conditions: first, we can consider it as proved that the populations of the three branch sites were related, by common de? scent, not only among one another, but were also related to the population of Geoksjur 1, the mother site; second, we can clearly see the spread of the related collectives over a vast stretch of territory, which however originally (when Jalangac-tepe, Ajna-tepe and Geoksjur 7 existed) was not as vast as in later times (when the population of the three sites just listed had to move elsewhere because of dire necessity, that is, to Mullali-tepe, Geok? sjur 9 and Cong-tepe respectively). But as is known, the characteristic trait of a tribe is in fact the tribal territory (the clan as such does not possess territory, but has only the usufruct of it), and this territory is occupied by many clans, genetically related. This is pre? cisely the case of the Geoksjur group of the chalcolithic sites, and this is why we think it right to see in this compact cultural and economic community the reflection of the ancient tribal organization. That the size of the population of the Geoksjur tribe was sufficient, also results from the dynamics of its evolution. There is a widespread opinion in literature on this subject that, in the overall picture of the population of the oasis, the population of Geok? sjur 1 amounted to between 700 and 1500 inhabitants (1000-1200 individuals on the aver? age) (14); this figure was reached on the basis of the built-up land and population density of the Mesopotamian cities of that era. And this figure is probably close to the truth, even if we do not have at this time further objective data for obtaining a more precise calcu? lation. Something can be specified, though, for defining the method for such a calculation; above all, if one starts from the stratigraphic table presented above (fig. 19), it becomes necessary to reduce the general total of the population in the oasis in the Jalangac period; if earlier all eight sites of the oasis were counted as functioning simultaneously, it is now perfectly clear that in reality we can only include five inhabited centres as exist? ing at the same time in the oasis. This means that the entire population at that period must have been one third less than had been supposed. It is highly probable that the building density in the Jalangac period was normal and uniform on all the sites, and that gives us the possibility of indicating a means for obtaining the size of the population, even if only approximately. To do so, we must take into account the area of the sites, which we listed above. If we use the number of houses, that is, the number of inhabitants, as the unit of measure, the minimum size of the site (in the present case, this means a pair of sites, Ajna-tepe - Geoskjur 9, equal to 0.65 ha.), it turns out that we need 1.5 of such units for Akca-tepe and the pair Jalangac-tepe - Mullali-tepe, and 2.5 units for the pair Geoksjur 7 - Cong-tepe. The sum of the units of measure totals 6.5, and in the area of the site of Geoksjur 1 (not in the area of the entire hill ? see below) (14) Lisicyna, op. ext., p. 129. 84</page><page sequence="35">it amounts to 6 of such units. When we know the number of habitations in the best preserved horizon, the third at A;na-tepe, it becomes possible to calculate without any difficulty whatsoever the number of houses, that is, of families too, on each site and on all the sites of the oasis. If we examine the correspondence of the areas of the sites in another way, we can list the relative size of the population which had abandoned the original site after the segmentation of its collective. Taking the area of the site of Geoksjur 1 as the unit of measure, we easily discover that the area of Ajna-tepe equals 1/6, that of Jalangac-tepe 2/9, and that of Geoksjur 7 2/5, of this unit. This obviously suggests that from 15% to 40% of the people who formed the original collective may have migrated from it; it may also mean that within a relatively short length of time (from the penetration of the area to the first half of the Jalangac period) the size of the population in the oasis may almost have doubled; it later became stabilized, but towards the Geoksjur period there was a ten? dency towards diminution connected with the progressive drying-up of the delta of the Tedzen River. All investigators agree that in the passage from the Jalangac to the Geoksjur period, there is a decisive transformation involving the material culture as well as certain features of the spiritual culture (burial rites) of the population of the ancient delta of the Tedzen River. These changes were so complete that the idea arose that a large group of new peoples had arrived from the regions of Elam and Mesopotamia and settled in the Geok? sjur oasis ("). But the evolution of the social relations of the oasis, presented above, lets us explain the appearance of such transformations in a different way. There is a widespread opinion that matriarchal relationships formed back in the age of food-gathering economy, that is, in the Stone Age, governed society in the early and evolved Chalcolithic Age in Southern Turkmenia. Even if this is correct, we must know exactly what lies behind this term. The fact is, that a matriarchy in the sense of gynaecocracy did not exist anywhere, since the control and organization of the clan collective, even in the matriarchal framework, was in the hands of the male kinsfolk. Still, the degree of relationship was only determined through the female line, and the matrilocal marriage domi? nated the origin of the family; this fact lets us assume that a tie as important for the primitive family as the clan and relationship bond may only have been thought of through the female line, since at that time another means was inconceivable. One must keep this sphere of life in mind when one deals with matriarchal relationships. With the evolution of tribal organization, like that we have encountered in the Geok? sjur oasis, the leadership of the tribe is concentrated from the very beginning in the hands of the male members of the population; and this fact can be proved, since there is no example in ethnography of the existence of a matriarchal tribe. Gradually, during the Jalangac pe? riod, there was a shift from the matrilocal to the patrilocal marriage; in other words, the features of a matriarchal relationship were slowly overcome. This decline reached such (15) Sarianidi, Pamjatniki pozdnego eneolita cit., pp. 47-50. 85</page><page sequence="36">a point that only a final effort was needed to abolish that conception definitively, an effort aimed at driving it out of people's minds. The structure of the family changes, and this fact is also reflected in the structure of the houses; to consolidate this transformation in the community's conscience, even the ritual burial of the dead takes on a new form: the living must know that the social relationships set up in this world also continue in the afterworld, since everyone could see that all the members of a given social nucleus were buried together. This means that the changes ascertained can be interpreted not as the effect and result of the influx of a new population into this small region, but as the result of the spontaneous evolution of the region's society. We can presume that the exploration of a small closed group of sites has allowed archaeologists to discover certain phenomena that have been unknown up to now: that is, the reflection of the real social history of a given human community, a real reflection of the formation of patriarchal relationships. 4. Conclusions The comprehensive study of a closed group of sedentary and agricultural sites of the Chalcolithic Age has let us formulate, on the one hand, some concrete conclusions that refer only to this group, and on the other hand, some conclusions that apply to history as a whole. 1. The occupation of the ancient delta of the Tedzen River took place in the period between the end of the 4th and the beginning of the 3rd millennium before our era, and was carried out by "refugees" from the foothill strip of the Kopet Dagh, at the end of the Namazga I period, when the productive forces of society had increased to the point of conditioning any real chance of a sizable growth in the population. The settlement in the delta of the Tedzen River is real evidence for the action of one of the basic laws of the historical evolution, of primitive society; that is, the pressure applied by an excess of population on weakly nucleated peoples, but above all on those communities whose pro? ductive strength is weak, factors which cause the segmentation of the collectives thanks to the difficult situation in which such communities find themselves: unable as they are to meet the needs involved in a population increase with their own production, and above all with that of food. 2. The dynamism of the appropriation of the ancient delta of the Tedzen River, clar? ified on the basis of the objective archaeological material found, lets us distinguish four consecutive stages: a) The colonization of the delta, with the foundation and existence of the first set? tlements in the Geoksjur oasis: Daslydzi-tepe, Akca-tepe and Geoksjur 1; the culture of this period cannot be distinguished from the culture of the population of the foothill zone, of the age and type of late Namazga I. 86</page><page sequence="37">b) The separation from the collective, settled on the sites of Geoksjur 1, of three branch sites: Akca-tepe, Jalangac-tepe and Geoksjur 7; cultural peculiarities bear witness to the separation of the population of the delta of the Tedzen River, and the pottery imported from the foothill zone lets us synchronize this stage with the oldest stage of the Namazga II period. c) The transfer of three branch collectives, because of the shift of the river-beds of the Tedzen delta, and the foundation in new areas of three new settlements: Geok? sjur 9, Mullali-tepe and Cong-tepe; the local line in the cultural evolution of this region continues, contemporary with the period of evolved and late Namazga II. d) The abandonment of three preceding sites and the concentration of the pop? ulation in two single points: Geoksjur 1 and Cong-tepe; this ends the existence of sites in the Geoksjur oasis; the culture of this period gives impulse to polychrome painting on ce? ramics and corresponds to the oldest Namazga III period in the foothill strip. 3. Ceramic decoration is the ^litmus paper" of history; it reacts without error to any kind of action from without, but at the same time develops according to fixed inter? nal laws. Study of it, on the basis of the material supplied by the sites of the Geok? sjur oasis, for the entire period of its existence, lets us affirm that it shows no trace of any influence from another culture on the sites of the Geoksjur oasis. All the transfor? mations that took place in it, at times of fundamental importance, can easily be explained on the strength of the local material, and on the basis of the traditional contacts with the genetically related populations of the foothill zone of the Kopet Dagh. This lets us, as far as our present knowledge goes, deny any influence from other cultures, such as those of Elam and Mesopotamia, on the population of the Geoksjur oasis. 4. The spatial diffusion of the clan collective, starting from the site of Geoksjur 1, over a certain territory, through the above-mentioned segmentation of this collective, shows us in a tangible way the formative process of the tribal organization of society. And apart from this, the chronological definition of this process, a process that depended above all on the level reached by production and on the actual size of the population, calculated by units of area measurement, lets us clarify the nature of this community and of the for? mation of a tribal organization of society. In other words, this social organism turns out to be rather belated: generically speaking, it could only originate during the growth of a relatively high level of productive economy. The formation of the tribes came about everywhere in different periods, but always, in this or that society, after a certain level of evolution of production and an exceptional numerical strength of population had been reached, when this social and organizational form made itself felt as an indispensable social need, one that did not depend on the conscious will of the peoples involved.
