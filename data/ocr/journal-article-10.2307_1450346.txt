<plain_text><page sequence="1">TRIBAL NAMES AND TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL 239 HEBREW TRIBAL NAMES AND THE PRIMITIVE TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL. I. IF any shortcoming can be found in Mr. G. Buchanan Gray's instructive book (Studies in Hebrew Proper YNames), it is that, in accordance with the plan of his investigation, he has attached less importance to tribal than to personal names, although it is the former which possess the higher significance for the origin of history and religion. In a previous essay (J. Q. R., X, p. 662) I have en- deavoured to explain the Divine Name rnrr by referring it to the same class with such names as npy and gDV, and interpreting the whole group as formulae of invocation of the tribal deity. I now propose to inquire whether the names of the twelve tribes may not also be in part interpreted upon a similar hypothesis, to consider some historical results arising from this supposition, and to discuss the significance of celtain names, analogous to these or traditionally associated with them, which will naturally present themselves for examination in the course of the inquiry. It is generally recognized that two of the tribal names of Israel are those of the deities Gad and Asher. The former need not detain us, except to note the importance of the fact that a Hebrew tribe should derive its very name from a Syrian and Phoenician god (see Cheyne, P. I,, lxv. I ). But the latter deserves closer attention, for it is really impossible to suppose that the worship of '1.. was</page><page sequence="2">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW unconnected with that of the ,n.. Grammatically, the two terms are related precisely as 5 is to 1^K, and it is difficult to avoid supposing that the latter was the symbol of the former, the " tree " the dwelling of the god. But we know from Deut. xvi. 21 that the rmw was associated with the altar of mr;r. And as we cannot suppose that either the cultus of nmrr or that of the r,nyK was unknown to this particular tribe, we are led to the conclusion that for the Asherite the worship of Asher was equated with that of Jahveh. And it would seem from Isa. lxv. ii (Cheyne, Iztrod. Isa., p. 365) that a similar syncretism marked the cult of Gad. Both these deities were gods of fortune, whom the shepherd and the tiller of the soil might alike invoke to bestow fruit upon their labours. No student of the Old Testament will need to be reminded of the importance which this material prosperity--say rather, this daily bread-possessed for the religion of Israel. Its source was one of the leading points in dispute in the long controversy Ietween the prophets and the people. It is sufficient to refer to Hos. ii. 5 b, 8, 12; Deut. xxviii. 4; Jer. xliv. I7, 18. The name of the Asherah indicates that it was regarded as a source of fortune, and as every reader of The Golden Bough is aware, the prosperity of crops and flocks is just what is sought in the worship of the tree-spirit. Now I have previously shown (J. Q. R., VIII, p. 704; X, 489) that at Beer-sheba the tamarisk was associated with the cultus of vy i rmnn, that the same tree was also sacred to Osiris, that it was known to the Egyptians under its Semitic name (Heb. ~w), that the Didu-the symbol of the Egyptian god-was analogous in its nature to the Hebrew Asherah, that at Byblus on the Syrian coast the worship of Osiris was identified with that of Adonis, that "in inscriptions Osiris is referred to as 'the one in the tree,' the solitary one in the acacia"' (probably the mon of Exod. iii. 2), and that his worship under that title is apparently denounced in Isa. lxvi. 17. But the persons who worship Osiris-Adonis in Isa. lxvi are presumably 240</page><page sequence="3">TRIBAL NAMES AND TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL 241 the same who in the preceding chapter make offerings to Gad and to Meni. We are here well within a circle of beliefs and rites common to the nations surrounding Israel, and the settlement of the tribe of Asher on the borders of Phoenicia must have exposed it to these influences in a peculiar degree. Is it going too far to conjecture that the cultus of Asher was related, both name and thing, to that of Osiris ? Some confirmation of this view may be derived from the singular name of an Asherite clan or town n=Un (i Chron. vii. 36) which admits of being interpreted 'Horus the Good," the son of Osiris. The names of Simeon and Levi received from Robertson- Smith an interpretation in terms of totemism, the latter being brought into connexion with that of Leah (Kinship, p. 30 and note, p. 257, also pp. I95, 219, 220. For Simeon see Jacobs, Archaeol. Rev., III, I53). If this view be accepted it is in complete harmony with the general hypothesis that tribal names are appellations of tribal deities. But at present we are suffering a reaction from the charms of totemism, and in the case of Simeon and Levi I cannot regard this interpretation as necessary. If '. be derived from the root n1, it may be explained on the analogy of ?t. (,XX Trv'X) as equivalent to a'vayKr ; or it may refer to the obligations of religion; or to the " binding of a god ," with a possible allusion to the Ark of Jahveh; or, lastly, it may express the attachment conceived to exist between the community and its old ally2. The name i^.W ' Hearer," may fairly be regarded as the correlative of .Y. . ' "God hear! " For the form compare i'5PY 5., Gen. xiv. 18, while the meaning of both names may be illustrated by those of David's sons Ws?, (a noun of the qettAl formation) and Ynvw .xK "God hath heard!" 2 Sam. v. 14, i6. Cf. Ps. lxv. 3 n.in pw. With Wyrw thus interpreted may be classed i?2!, and 1 See Mr. Crooke's valuable paper, Folk-Lore, VIII, 325; also Lang, The Making of Religion, p. 282, "binding charms, Aeyo6eval Oe&amp;v dva'yicat." 2 See Note: the Name of Levi, p. 264 below.</page><page sequence="4">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW I would add l?:. Both the significance of the names themselves, and the analogy of the preceding examples, render it probable that the Exalted and the Upright were in the first instance appellations of deities rather than mere names of tribes. The word in1 is applied in I Kings viii. 13 to the earthly, and in Isa. Ixiii. I5 to the heavenly dwelling of Jahveh; and as Canon Cheyne points out in his critical note on the latter passage, the 5nt tn of i Kings viii. 13 is described as 11?y in ix. 8. It seems a fair in- ference that tS:t (m) may be equivalent to ;^ry 5, and it is not improbable that i! the praepositus of Shechem in Judges ix derived his name from the same divine appella- tion. So too in ~5?. the latter part of the name is prob- ably a predicate of ^3 (v. Lex.), and in the New Testament BEEXSf,3ov' (NB BEECe/ovA') appears as ruler or chief of evil spirits. In an earlier age he may have been ruler of the gods. Canon Cheyne has justly interpreted his name "lord of the (heavenly) height." Before leaving this branch of the subject it may be worth while to note that not only is the Heb. nt n'N equivalent to the Assyrian bit zabal, "lofty house" (Lex.), but "the Accadian sag-il or sag-gd, lit. 'high head,' is explained by the Syrian zabal" (Cheyne, sup. cit.), and the great temple of Bel-Merodach at Babylon, whose immense ruins still bear the name of Babel, was called :-Saggila (Sayce, Primer of Assyriology): The temples were miniature reproductions of the arrangement of the universe. The "Ziggurat" represented in its form the mountain of the world, and the halls ranged at its feet resembled approximately the accessory parts of the world: the temple of Merodach at Babylon comprised them all up to the chambers of fate, where the sun received every morning the tablets of destiny..... This idea, analogous to that which had determined the distribution of the Egyptian temples, arose from the form of the mountain which the Chaldeans gave to their temples, and from the name "Ekur," a common designation of temples and the earth .... The earth rises gradually from the extremities to the centre, like a great mountain, of which the snow-region, where 242</page><page sequence="5">TRIBAL NAMES AND TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL 243 the Euphrates finds its source, approximately marks the summit. It was at first supposed to be divided into seven zones, placed one on the top of the other along its sides, like the stories of a temple. (Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 543, 674.) It is the Kharsag kurkura, the "Mountain of the World" of the cuneiform texts, which is usually placed at the north or to the east, more accurately to the north-east. Jensen seems to me to have proved that this was a name used to indicate the earth itself. (Ibid., p. 543, note 3.) An analogous conception appears in the mythical cosmo- gony of India, "Mount Meru," if I may trust my memory on this point. It was suggested, we may fairly suppose, in the former case by the high mountains of Armenia and Kurdistan, in the latter by the world-topping Himmaleh. It appears again, in a very striking manner, in Isa. xiv. 13, 14: KD3 1DK SN K 25S SDn 0yK h Wm wnil n1In: n nZK innstl 1tI :;1}$Pv nutK wy Nnnr y gnyp :;-py W^n : P n nw n m v^w m?u wn3n Sm nin S)N 5t. The same antithesis occurs apparently in Ps. xlix. 15 if we read with Cheyne i 5~! D,:iy 7:*, and in Ps. xlviii. 3 the phrase pt1 tnz- is transferred bodily by a significant gloss to the ptr' -n. These passages point, I think, to the conclusion that the mythical 3tr is the dwelling of ;-,y, and that trlt and ir 3:i were originally equivalent to the latter deity, the Zeus of a Semitic Olympus. In a later age Mount Zion itself assumed the Olympian character (cp. especially Isa. ii. 2; Ezek. xl. 2 with Davidson's note, and Cheyne on Isa. xi. 9, Introd. Isa., p. 67). But the expres- sion ~r nm: is applied by Solomon to the temple in a poetical citation which is probably derived from the QDD -w,n (0. T. J. C., 2nd ed., Note B). And if we may rely on Gen. xiv, a late document which derived its historical data from Babylonian sources, then ;'ry is was the god of Jerusalem in the time of Melchizedek. Finally, the myth of the 5nr enables us to understand why the Tower of Babel was designed to reach the heavens 1. 1 A reference should be added to Ezek. xxviii. II-19 (where "Eden the</page><page sequence="6">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW In Deut. xxxiii. 26 it is possible that ;nw~ [K retains its original force (reading 53), and even the n-in CnD may more probably be understood as the "book of Jahveh" than as the " book of Israel" (cf. Num. xxi. 14; Isa. xxxiv. I6). It should be remarked that the epithets -nw and nw are perhaps to be explained in a physical sense by reference to such symbols as the rn:K and the o: (J. Q. R., X, p. 675 and note). The moral signification of these terms would then represent a secondary development. Their relation to the names of the great gods Asshur and Osiris is a problem which may repay the investigations of the Assyrian and Egyptian archaeologist. From actual names of deities such as u: and nwm, :to and perhaps 4, from epithets by which, we may suppose, the deity was invoked, such as tpy and pvlyw, inw and ~t-- if indeed there be any real distinction between these two classes-we pass to names which express a predicate of the tribal god and imply a proposition with regard to him. Among the names of the twelve tribes I find but one which can with any probability be referred to the type of in:pyp and [5t1', consisting of a verb in the imperfect tense (or jussive mood) preceding or implying the divine subject. This single and doubtful instance is the name nWw. The simplest interpretation of this formula nzt'r.. "there's a reward !" equally with the readings '? KN 'C "he shall bear a reward," and _w? "he shall be rewarded," may be taken to assert that the assistance of the god is hired by a pledge of the spoil (I Sam. xv. 9, I5). For the interpretation nW WnK cf. Ex. xv. 3 nnnon vw nlW,, but this is less appro- priate than the rest. The name 1i has been preserved in the full form as the personal ~mn or i:n. It may be explained either as a perfect of anticipated certainty, a shout of assumed victory, "God hath judged," or as a participle, the nominal ter- garden of God " and "the holy mountain of God " are apparently identical, and the fall of Tyre resembles that of Babylon in Isa. xiv), and to the mount of vision in Matt. iv. 8. 244</page><page sequence="7">TRIBAL NAMES AND TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL 245 mination ,_ being preserved by close juxtaposition with the subject, and the sense being that of the fut. instans, which, allowing for the difference in idiom between the two languages, may perhaps be best rendered by the English present, " God judgeth " our cause or his people (Gen. xxx. 6, xlix. 16; Deut. xxxii. 36). The punctuation 51., even of the shorter form, favours the interpretation as a parti- ciple. To account for the dagesh in i.s it is only necessary to try and pronounce the word without it. In English it tends to become a dissyllable:-- A Daniel come to judgment! The signification of the last two names may be illus- trated from Ps. lviii. I2 y;n^ , .vD: vrn iW ' pn' I ^N n N, where "the righteous probably are the Israelites as a nation" (Cheyne, in loc.). [9],nP: may be explained on the analogy of swn, as a Niph'al participle (implying the same subject) in which the vowel of the preformative has escaped the usual attenuation. Its meaning, " God wrestleth," is equivalent to that of 3piv. n~W_ is obviously a Pi'el participle. I would suggest that the original form may have been [5S] KW:_ "God lifteth up his people" (Ps. xxviii. 9). In all these cases it is the predicate which constitutes the distinctive appellation of the tribe or tribal god, and from the emphasis it thus receives precedes the subject, which at last was omitted altogether. Unlike the preceding examples, ,n~a, as the termination shows (Gesenius-Kautzsch, Eng. trans. ? 88, c), is apparently a place-name, equivalent to nnPs or n1ns, for the in- dividual member of the tribe was called an nnnS. No doubt the Ephrathah in question was that associated with the tomb of Rachel. But in spite of the misleading gloss, Gen. xxxvi. I9 (see Addis, in loc.), xlviii. 7, it is not to be identified with Beth-lehem. " It is most unlikely that any early tradition should have placed the tomb of Rachel, the</page><page sequence="8">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW mythical ancestress of the great northern tribes, in the territory of Judah" (Addis, sup. cit.). "The mention of 'Rachel's grave' here appears to show that it must have been situated on the north border of Benjamin, at no great distance from Beth-el" (Driver on I Sam. x. 2). And, we may add, from Ramah (Cheyne on Jer. xxxi. I5). Prof. G. A. Smith (Hist. Geog., ed. I894, p. 325, note 2) writes with reference to nmqm Kti (sic), "Of course the name spread originally from the hill-country immediately north of Benjamin's territory, which fell to the tribe of Ephraim, and in which we must seek for the site of the city called Ephraim ... perhaps the modern et-Taiyibeh." In 2 Sam. xiii. 23 we read of ntK mj rK iinn ~Iy, i.e. beside the city of that name. So far, so good; this is in agreement with the site assigned to nin Sg3, if that be the modern Tell 'Asur (with V) (cf. Neh. xi. 33). But in the passage of Samuel, Lucian's Septuagint gives ropqatri. In Joshua xv. 9 the Heb. text has t?014 n, and in 2 Chron. xiii. I9 ;n3y with the marginal reading 1?_'. Against this may be set the Greek of 2 Sam. xiii. 23 (B, 'EqpatC), 2 Chron. xiii. 19 (B, 'EqpcSv), and John xi. 54 eks 'EOpaluA XEyop,/rlv Trod&amp;v (W. H.). "It was," says Prof. Smith (Hist. Geog., p. 352, note 4; cf. p. 254), "the Aphairema of I Macc. xi. 34; [Josephus] xiii. Ant. iv. 9, one of three toparchies taken from Samaria and added to Judaea ... about I45 B.C." "The Talmud censures the substitution of K for y, and disallows special classes of people from acting as readers 'because they speak the alefs like ayns, and the cyns like alefs"' (Dr. H. Hirschfeld, J. Q. R., IV, p. 500). One is reminded of the "terrible news" in Catullus:- Ionios fluctus postquam illuc Arrius isset Iam non Ionios esse sed Hionios. In spite of the obscurity which thus overhangs the city called Ephraim, we are not obliged to doubt its existence. But it is against analogy for a tribe to derive its name from a city, or to bear an appellation without religious significance. 246</page><page sequence="9">TRIBAL NAMES AND TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL 247 I venture to suggest, in accordance with the etymology of nt-M given in Gen. xli. 52 (n,n5K 4:nm) and with the analogy of ,~]!_K ("a nomen verbale of Hiph'il, answering to the Aramaic infinitive of the causal-stem 'Aph'el" Ges.-K. ? 85, b), that n o 1 or n?.K (compare the forms of the 3rd sing. fern. perfect of verbs ,n", Ges.-K. ? 75, i) is in fact an appellation of Rachel herself signifying "her that maketh fruitful," and that nain, an expansion of Db-', is the masculine equivalent. The mythical implications of these terms will be dealt with in a later part of this paper, in connexion with the legend of Rachel. In Gen. xxxv. 18 we read how the dying mother bestowed upon her child the name swK j; but his father called him r'n:. A beautiful touch, but has it any historical signifi- cance? Did the tribe originally, and as a member of the house of Joseph, bear one name, and was another imposed upon it by the authority of Jacob, or of united Israel? Bearing in mind the significance of ;m, as in pir n4, Hos. iv. 15 et al., and the situation of 'Anathoth within the territory of the tribe, with Isaiah's play upon the name fnlW:r .Tr (x. 30 al. ;1?), I am inclined to regard '*:Ns n as a possible substitute for nmv m. In the Song of Deborah (Jud. v. 6) we hear of n: tIn nw, and in iii. 31 he appears among the " Minor Judges." Moore and Ruben incline to see in him a foreign oppressor. Is it possible the name should be read .w ? Again, comparing nmsi with the 'Pov-ioXos of Josephus (Gray, Heb. Pr. Names, p. 66, note 3) and the clan-name Klvn (Edom, Gen. xxxvi. 4, P; Midian, Ex. ii. 18 ; see Addis, p. 107), also nr in Gen. xi. i8 (P), I would suggest that the original name of the tribe may have been nrzin. Confirma- tion or disproof of such hypotheses must be sought in their implications. Before considering these it will be well to take into account the significance of the last and most important name among the twelve, that of the tribe inr1. Here, and here alone, I find an explicit reference to the cultus of Jahveh. The interpretation given in Gen. xxix. 35</page><page sequence="10">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW ,n'l: l 'w ni p z 5 m r1n, nK ; Dn- ny.in 'nrn has, I think. been misapprehended both by Mr. Spurrell and the compilers of the Oxford lexicon. The meaning of the writer, if I mistake not, is simply that Tnn_ = n1.n P1. The final n of mn coalesces with the initial n of r1n, and as a consequence the vowel of the divine name (really that of the preformative of mnm) suffers vo]atilization as it loses the accent. It will not, I think, be alleged that the vowel should be lengthened in compensation for the omitted doubling! We have to deal with a matter of usage, not of grammatical form, the usage of an invocation once shouted in war, but in time (its meaning forgotten) passing into a familiar name. Nevertheless a trace of the original signification may be found in the Song of Moses, Ex. xv. 1-3:- isylr9 1S ,nx141 in, Mr-t I*tv D^ non 133m DID n^ n^a ) m m^ rrwt mloo-wC wK 'ilnK ,im^iK Jl?5K nt 'w mmns ,onSi tw mmn1 Here, in a song of victory, we have the formal ascription of the due praise, to the ancestral warrior god, by his name nm. Such, I take it, is the meaning of the invocation mnn n,. It is a shout of triumph, Jahveh is glorified! and in accordance with Hebrew idiom may be employed in anticipation as well as in thanksgiving. Possibly the same form might result from the contraction of ;ll 'l . The hypothesis that Jahveh was in fact the ancestral deity of the tribe of Judah involves consequences of great importance for the history of religion in Israel. II. The union of the twelve tribes, such as it appears in historical times, like the bond which united ancient Hellas, antecedent to and independent of political ties, always involved the presence and the rivalry of two leading elements, the house of Judah and the house of Joseph. It has been held indeed by very distinguished scholars 248</page><page sequence="11">TRIBAL NAMES AND TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL 249 (Robertson-Smith, Kinship, p. 257) "that Judah was not originally included in tlhe name of Israel, but was only a brother tribe." This view is based, I believe, partly upon the absence of Judah from the tribes enumerated in Jud. v, and partly on the opposition of Judah to Israel in the book of Samuel, especially 2 Sam. v. i. The obscure and mutilated text of the song of Deborah offers a precarious basis for any inference of importance, and the absence of Judah from a struggle in which ex hypothesi it was not concerned, hardly proves its complete isolation. The language of the book of Samuel seems explicable upon the supposition that the part is contrasted with the whole, and the whole identified with the remainder, just as in a cricket-match (if I am not mistaken) Yorkshire or Kent or Surrey may be opposed to "All England." Judah in fact was often in the position of the juryman who complained that he had never met eleven such obstinate fellows in his life. But apart from its insufficient basis the view taken by Robertson-Smith is liable to a serious and indeed fatal objection. Israel we know is by ancient tradition identified with Jacob; and Jacob is distinguished from Joseph not only in tradition, but even in the inscriptions of Thothmes III. If, then, Jacob-Israel is to be identified with any narrower group than the whole twelve tribes, it must be with the sons of Leah rather than with those of Rachel. But among the sons of Leah, Judah enjoyed the pre-eminence, and although in a later age when the historical books were compiled, the name of Israel was naturally applied to the kingdom which included the majority of the tribes, in which the primacy was held by the house of Joseph, and more especially by the tribe of Ephraim; yet there can be no justification for transferring this state of things to the earliest times, with the result of confounding Joseph with Jacob, and excluding the sons of Leah from the tribes of Israel. Looking at the map which represents the geographical distribution of the tribes, it is difficult to avoid the sup-</page><page sequence="12">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REViEW position that the sons of Rachel, Joseph and Benjamin, imposed their avvo&amp;KLO-pOS on the rest of Israel, so as to separate the elder from the younger sons of Leah, at the same time dividing Gad from Asher, and Dan, in its original seat, from Naphtali. Among the sons of Leah, as Mr. Jacobs has well pointed out, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah form a distinct group in which the Right of the youngest has passed to Judah. But in the larger Israel the same preference is accorded to Joseph and to Benjamin. Of the southern tribes, Reuben early disappears from the page of history. Simeon is absorbed in Judah. Levi, the tribe of Moses, survives only as a religious guild, which in its subsequent history appears at once devoted to the cultus of Jahveh and especially associated with Judah. In early times the Levites seem to have found a centre at Bethlehem. There is nothing improbable in the conjecture that the Levite Moses may have adopted as the god of Israel the ancestral deity of the important tribe of Judah. If this hypothesis be entertained it clears up a serious difficulty. Why is the invocation of Jahveh represented in J, Gen. iv. 26 (J2) as beginning with wmK ;-a name which must have originally signified the first man;-while in E, Ex. iii, it is for the first time revealed to Moses 2 The answer is very simple: J expresses the point of view of Judah where the worship of Jahveh was in fact immemorial; E that of Ephraim, where tradition could recall its introduction. A stronger confirmation of the hypothesis could hardly be desired. And if it be accepted we can the better understand not only the enthusiastic Jahvism of David, that typical hero of Judah, but the whole religious history of the southern as contrasted with the northern kingdom. And the enigma in Gen. ix. 25-27 (J. Q. R., X, p. 676) can be brought into still closer connexion with the facts of history if we regard mrn, as primarily the god of the tribe arnn (,. Shem and Japheth will then symbolize the house of Judah and that of Joseph, the sons of Leah and those of Rachel. 250</page><page sequence="13">TRIBAL NAMES AND TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL 251 If, then, the tribal deity of Judah were accepted under the leadership of Moses as the God of Israel, what would be the relation between his worship and that of the gods of other tribes ? Prof. J. F. McCurdy (Expr., 4th Ser., IV, 392) lays down "that a certain form of religious worship, or the cult of a particular deity, was bound up with the very idea of national existence, and when the political life of any community was modified by the influence of another community, a religious syncretism was regularly the result." As we have seen, there is some late evidence of such a syncretism in the worship of Gad, and the ,n-s may well have supplied a connecting-link between the cultus of ~w~ and that of nmin. The tribe of Levi must early have taken nnr to be their god. tpyn' i and 6r) i might be regarded as appellations; i "m-, rKn'i, 5K8nm9, ~sbw as invocations of nnw ; and in general the god of Moses would be considered as vnv ,n, is (Gen. xxxiii. 20). The masculine DKNs might be applied to him. But if the tribe of Benjamin were ever known, as I have ventured to suppose, as nry ;1, that goddess could not be identified with Jahveh. And if Reuben were originally 5y31yi, the identification of ig3 with nur, was precisely the object against which the prophets of the latter's exclusive cult directed their fiercest polemic. Jahveh, as the symbol of national unity, was essentially t~p is, a jealous god, and the predominance of his worship may have led, at a date prior to the composition of the historical books, to the modification of these two names into the innocent forms in which they have come down to us, while in other instances it has tended to obliterate the original religious significance of the tribal names. The decay of Reuben is attributed, apparently, to an attempt to assert its authority, as ;:, so to speak, over the tribes of Dan and Naphtali, the sons of Bilhah. Such a claim (which cannot be reconciled with the geographical distribution of the tribes in the historical period) must be brought into connexion with the claims of Reuben as the firstborn of Jacob. But these claims may well have led VOL. XI. T</page><page sequence="14">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW to a conflict between Reuben and Judah, in which case the victory must have rested with the latter. Note that in the story of Joseph, according to the Elohist, it is Reuben who intervenes to save his life (Gen. xxxvii. 22), but accord- ing to the Jahvist, this part is played by Judah (ver. 26, Addis, Doc. Hex., I, 71). In the case of Benjamin, we have a late and indeed untrustworthy narrative (Judges xx) of a conflict between Benjamin and all Israel. But it is not impossible that this may be based on some genuine tradition of a struggle between Judah and Benjamin. "The oldest form of the story may perhaps be derived from J ... It is, of course, incredible that the tribe of Benjamin was almost exterminated only a generation or two before the time of Saul; but the events related in these chapters probably fall in a much earlier period" (Moore, Grit. Coqmm., p. 405). Analogy makes it probable that like zpy and o-1, %K pn was originally the invocation employed by some actual tribe or group of tribes (J. Q. R., X, p. 677). If we seek to identify this community, we have to note that pnir is represented as the brother of Ishmael, the father of Esau and Jacob, and the cousin of Lot. He leads a pastoral life in Gerar and the Negeb, and is especially associated with Beer-sheba. If we regard Judah as the offshoot, and in later times the representative of this stock, we shall not depart widely from the spirit of the narrative. In fact the name mrn, and a fortiori that of m'wn, as here interpreted, must have had a definite origin, and may have been preceded by the formula in question. Who then is Abram? This, according to Mr. Gray, belongs to the most ancient type of personal names. I welcome the possibility that it is that of a real individual, the Moses of an older day, the leader of the first Semitic migration across the Euphrates, the reputed founder of the sanctuaries of Hebron and Beer-sheba. The oldest authentic tradition of Israel is that which tells how their fathers dwelt beyond the flood and served other gods. It is not improbable that tradition might preserve the name of their 252</page><page sequence="15">TRIBAL NAMES AND TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL 253 leader. Pressed on by their successors, the first immigrants would make their way to the southern extremity of Canaan, and it is known that Abram "was originally a Judaean hero" (Kinship, p. 257). He may have been the chief of b pnm. The hypothesis will account for his position at the head of the genealogy of Israel and the cognate tribes. III. We have now to consider the maternal side of this genealogy. The patriarchs had to be provided with wives, and in some cases their names may be merely fictitious. Those of Leah and Rachel have been explained byRobertson- Smith in terms of Totemism and the Matriarchal System. Upon this view they would represent tribes of Aramaean origin, probably exogamous, and belonging to an earlier stage of social evolution, presumably therefore to an earlier period of time, than the historical tribes of Jacob and Joseph. From this standpoint, the story of Jacob's wooing would obscurely shadow forth the transition to the patri- archal reggime. I should prefer a simpler interpretation. According to the traditions systematized in the Book of Genesis, the ancestors of Jacob have already been brought to Beer-sheba. Driven thence by fear of Esau, he enters into relations of dependence upon Laban the Syrian, and these in turn lead to his marriage first with Leah and after- wards with Rachel. Now we know that Rachel is historically equivalent to the house of Joseph, and we have seen reason to suppose that in like manner Jacob primarily represents the tribes believed to be descended from Leah. The marriage of Jacob and Rachel will then symbolize the o-VVOlKtcr^O of SnpP' and ~5oN , adding only the valuable fact of the dependence of Joseph upon Aram, while yet in the pastoral stage. All this is probable enough, and the preference assigned to Rachel is a sufficient proof of the origin of the story in Northern Israel, and a presumption of its value so far as concerns the tribe of Joseph. It may point to T2</page><page sequence="16">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW intermarriage between that tribe and those of Aram. But the migration of Jacob from the Negeb to this region, though not impossible, is more probably a fiction devised to make him appear as the suitor of the Syrian Rachel, while his marriage with Leah is indispensable, from the genealogical point of view, to account for the place occupied by the remaining tribes within the larger Israel. It remains to consider the ancestry of Rachel. rn: = ewe, is the daughter of pi= white, and accordingly the story of Jacob's bargain with Laban, obscure and confused as it is, turns plainly on the distinction between white and particoloured flocks. See Gen. xxx. 28 sq., esp. ver. 35 1u 2z nWK i: and ver. 37 n6 n..n5 .pw rpt i5 np,1. Noting further that ,nr is used of the moon in Is. xxiv. 23, xxx. 26, we may next observe that in Gen. xxix. 5 Laban appears as the son of Nahor. He is also represented (Gen. xxiv. 29, 50,53, 55; xxix. 10-14) as the brother of Rebekah, but it is not expressly stated that he was the son of Bethuel, and in Gen. xxiv, where Laban plays an important part, Bethuel is conspicuous by his absence; even it would seem in v. 50, where as Dillmann suggests, the mention of Bethuel is clearly not original (Spurrell and Bull, in loc.). If we suppose that the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah is an anticipation of that of Jacob and Rachel, pointing to the same historical data, we can understand how it is that Laban has to do duty in two successive generations, in each of which he appears as the nearest male kinsman of the Syrian bride. Bethuel, however, we are told repeatedly (Gen. xxiv. I5, 24, 47), was "the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor." But iKnn is neither more nor less than the familiar [K n1:, i.e. "God's house."

And Milcah, as Mr. Gray 254</page><page sequence="17">TRIBAL NAMES AND TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL 255 (Heb. Pr. Names, p. 116) following Kuenen suggests, "is a town name in Num. xxvi. 33, and, as such, perhaps an abbreviated form of Beth Milcah, if, as would appear prob- able, Milcah is a divine name or title. In Gen. xi. 29 Milcah is wife of Nahor.. . and, according to Noldeke, is "in such a mythical context, scarcely anything else than nn?n, who was worshipped by the Phoenicians." Who then is Nahor? In Gen. xxiv. Io the nln: n ' is the home of Rebekah, as in xxvii. 43, xxviii. 10, xxix. 4, rnn is that of Rachel. I suspect that both these names bore originally a divine significance , and are related to the roots Inn "be or grow white," and '11n "be hot, scorched, burn," as pi? is related to ?5 "be white," and t??, of which the mean- ing is explained in Gen. xi. 3 ,na1 1, ntn,wl :I ,M:M:3. You cannot make bricks without baking them, whether in an oven or by exposure to the sun's rays. The notion of brightness supplies a connecting-link between that of whiteness and that of heat. Nahor, again, is the son of rn_, a name perhaps connected with nn and nn 2. Terah and his sons migrate from nD'3 'nK, a name which to a Hebrew must always have suggested the idea of light, to lnn. Now Uru and Harran, though far remote from one another, were alike ancient seats of the worship of the moon-god Sin (Maspero, Dawn of Civ., p. 648). Such a string of coincidences cannot possibly be accidental. But this is not all. Revenons a nos moutons. Rachel, as we have seen, is an ewe. But by an ancient mode of speech, reflecting the religion of pastoral life, and so deeply rooted in the usus linguae, that it has even survived in the book of Deuteronomy (vii. 13), the ewes of Cf. iin inn. Mr. Gray observes, "The term following Beth in place- names is so frequently of a divine character as to lead us to expect it to have been the same even in names where this is no longer manifestly the case" (p. 324). Note that it was apparently in the pass of Beth-horon that Joshua invoked the sun and moon to stand still, according to the lwnl qDD, JOS. xi. II, 12-14. 2Cf. P 'r , ', rlr'.</page><page sequence="18">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the flock were known as tnn, nrinw. The rams, one sup- poses, must have been tIn :39p. Now "the attributes of the Babylonian moon-god," writes Prof. Sayce (Variorum Aids to the Bible Student, Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, I893), "were transferred by the Phoenicians to their Ashtoreth." This explains the concurrence of masculine and feminine epithets in the genealogy just discussed. "In time... Ashtoreth came to represent the moon ... whence the title Ashtoreth-Karnaim, 'of the two horns,"' Gen. xiv. 5. This, as Robertson-Smith observes (Rel. Sem., 2nd ed., p. 310 and note), is probably derived from the sanctuary of a horned Astarte. "The Astarte of the Northern Semites is essentially a goddess of flocks and herds, whose symbol and sacred animal is the cow, or (among the sheep-rearing tribes of the Syro-Arabian desert) the ewe," ibid., pp. 355, 356. "The sheep-symbols on the Tanith cippi, which are commonly called rams, are hornless, and so presumably stand for ewes. On the other hand, all wild sheep and many domestic breeds are horned in both sexes, so that there is no difficulty about a horned sheep-goddess," ibid., p. 478. Early Man, that versatile and delightful reasoner, argued, the moon has horns, ergo the moon is a cow, or a sheep, according to his employment. But it should be noted in passing that the Heb. anp appears applicable also to the rays of the sun, and the flashes of the lightning (Davidson on Habakkuk iii. 4). In the second edition of the Religion of the Semites (p. 469) will be found a most instructive paper, read before the Cambridge Philological Society in 1888, which should be carefully perused by any one who wishes to understand the mythical significance of Rachel. The lamented author traces to the Syrians of Harran-the very country and people whence Rachel sprang-" who clung to the ancient Astarte-worship far into the Middle Ages," an annual spring-feast which appears with variations in detail, not only in Cyprus but also in Rome, where it was introduced in the historic period. The rite in question- 256</page><page sequence="19">TRIBAL NAMES AND TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL 257 "is known to us from a passage in Joannes Lydus, De Mensibus, iv. 45 ... Lydus . .. begins by describing the practices by which women . . . did honour to Venus on the Calends of April. Here, of course, he is speaking of Roman usage. ... The honourable women did service to Venus v7rep O6ovoLas Kai [lov acr&amp;qpovo. ... . This agrees with the worship of Venus verticordia, the patroness of female virtue, whose worship Ovid connects with the Calends of April (Fasti, iv. 155 sq.), and Mommsen conjectures to have been mentioned under that day in the Fasti Praen .... The transition from this Roman worship of Venus to the Cyprian ritual of the same day is made by a remark as to the victims proper to the goddess.... What he says is that on the Calends of April-a special occasion-Venus was worshipped at Rome with the sacrifices of Juno. And as he is speaking of a ritual in which the worshippers were women, I think we may go a step further, and recall the fact that the Calends of every month were sacred to Juno Lucina, to whom on that day the regina sacrorum offered in the Regia a sow or ewe lamb (Macrob. i. 15, I9). The functions of Lucina, as the patroness of virtuous matrons and the family life of women, were so nearly identical with those of Venus verticordia, that their sacrifices might well be the same." Discussing the piacular nature of these rites, Robertson- Smith mentions incidentally that "when Epimenides was brought to Athens to check the plague, he suffered black and white sheep to stray at will from the Areopagus, and ordered each to be sacrificed where it lay down, to the nameless deity of the spot (Diog. Laert. i. io). This form of atonement came from Crete, which was one of the stepping-stones by which Oriental influence reached Greece, so that the example is the more appropriate to our present argument" (ibid., p. 476). Again we meet the herds of Laban. The reader will by this time have anticipated the con- clusion. Rachel is Ashtoreth, the divine ewe, goddess of the flock and of the moon, the type of bride and mother, the patron of the female sex. Her name, her birthplace, and her ancestry, taken in connexion with the known worship of the moon-god and the ewe-goddess by the Syrians of Harran, and the known transference of the attri- butes of the former to the latter by the Phoenicians, admit no other interpretation. We see now that no epithet could</page><page sequence="20">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW have been more appropriate to her office than that of Ephrath, "fruitful," or rather "fructifying," whence the leading tribe supposed to be descended from her derived its distinctive appellation, and that the invocation EDD', has a special propriety in the mouth of her offspring. We can at the same time understand that the cultus of Ephrath might well extend beyond the bounds of Joseph and Benjamin; and if there be anything in the well-known suggestion that Beth-lehem "was originally the sacred place of Lakhmu, a Chaldean god of fertility," it is easy to see why Beth-lehem was also called Beth-Ephrathah (Micah v. 2, LXX), and disputed with the northern Ephrath the possession of Rachel's grave. It should cause no difficulty that the Pillar which marked this spot was at a certain distance from Ephrath, for, as Robertson-Smith has pointed out (Rel. Senm., 2nd ed., pp. 172, 489), "the sanctuaries of the Northern Semites commonly lay outside and above the town." The existence of this pillar, or nro, is itself a proof that Rachel received some kind of venera- tion, and, bearing in mind the legend of her death in childbirth at this very spot, we may fairly conjecture that her aid was invoked by women in labour. The famous 7rpoOrolTroTroLa of the Second Jeremiah (xxxi. I5) shows her as an immortal, grieving at the destruction of her posterity. Compare the apparent reference to invocations of Abraham and Israel in Isa. lxiii. 16 (see Cheyne's note and '"Last Words" on this passage; also Introd., pp. 352, 353), and contrast Job xiv. 21, 22. We are now in a position to understand the significance of the story that Rachel on her flight with Jacob carried with her her father's god (Gen. xxxi. 19, 30-35; cf. Ges.-K. ? 124 h and note). Later on we find the teraphim, an image of human form, in the custody of Michal, Saul's daughter and David's wife (i Sam. xix. 13). Still later, in the lifetime of Jeremiah, "in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem" (vii. 8), nay, even in exile in the land of Egypt (xliv. 15-25), the women offer incense and cakes and drink-offerings 258</page><page sequence="21">TRIBAL NAMES AND TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL 259 to the Queen of Heaven ('DWnW nfS?), and attribute to her former favour their lost prosperity. These sacra of the women of Israel, brought by Rachel from her Syrian home, were no other than the cultus of Ashtoreth. Viewed in this connexion, the parable of Nathan acquires a fresh signifi- cance (2 Sam. xii. 2, 3), and even Rachel's excuse to Laban (Gen. xxxi. 35) is seen to be appropriate to her character. No doubt the "honourable women" of Israel served Ashtoreth, or implored the Euhemerized Rachel, with the same purity of intention with which the Roman matrons sacrificed to Venus verticordia or Juno Lucina. The view here set forth of the identity of Rachel-Ephrath with the Syrian goddess is not necessarily inconsistent with the hypothesis that at a still earlier period Rachel may have borne a purely totemistic and matriarchal significance. When she is represented as the daughter of a line of male ancestors whose names are really epithets of the moon, this only means that, Rachel being already identified with Ashtoreth, the attributes of Sin have been transferred to her. According to some authorities (Geo. Smith, Chaldean Genesis, pp. 56, 57, 59), Ishtar was Sin's daughter. When, on the other hand, we are told that Beth-Milcah was the mother of Beth-El, this may point to the worship of mother and son as associated deities, itself a token of the matriarchal system (Kinship, pp. 179, 292; Rel. Sem., 2nd ed., p. 56 sq.). Note here that Milcah is the sister of ninn in Num. xxvi. 33, and that in I Chron. vii. 18 nrnn is a daughter of nlSb,, presumably the Dlnrw nfnl. "Hammolecheth" is the sister of Gilead the son of Machir, and Machir is the son of Menasseh by a Syrian concubine (I Chron. vii. 14). In Numbers, Milcah, Mahlah, &amp;c., are daughters of 1_r.- D?n-l; In.rM (should this name be read In_ i5 ?1), and the laws relating to them Cf. Num. xiv. 9, oD;, and Gen. xxxi. 42, 53, with Spurrell's note. This passage, like that of Chronicles sup. cit., deals with the relations of Israel and Aram in the borderland of Gilead. Considering that the five matri- archal clans or towns cannot originally have traced their common descent</page><page sequence="22">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW (xxvii. I-II and xxxvi) appear to presuppose a system of inheritance through females, combined with a practice of exogamy. For the legal aspect of Jacob's "beenah" marriage see McLennan, The Patriarchal Theory, pp. 44-48. The apparent substitution of onas or aiaK for nnmS as the tribal name may point to the change from female to male kinship. At the same time it should be remembered that even in Hosea Israel is sometimes represented as the spouse, sometimes as the son, of Jahveh. It is possible that the change from nnm to DamK indicates the victory of exclusive Jahvism, but this is not a necessary supposition, for the masculine invocation i PD1' is as old as 1500 B.C. On the other hand, the all-but complete obliteration of the divine character of Rachel in the historical books of the Old Testament is a fact of considerable significance. It implies both that those books afford a one-sided view of the traditional popular religion, and at the same time that monotheism was diffused more widely and at an earlier date than some scholars would be prepared to admit. IV. There is an undoubted attraction in the hypothesis of a connexion between ;o the moon-god of Ur and Harran, and ':s the primitive seat of Jahveh; for the migration ascribed to Abram bridges the distance which separates Horeb from the Euphrates. Abram, as we have seen, from a male ancestor, it seems probable that -b2 or -nr 2 may have been substituted for nrzrn, the Fear of Isaac thus replacing the Syrian goddess. bs seems to point to an actual image, the object of common sacra. But is rnD really a divine name, or an euphemism, perhaps for P:, as indeed the assonance suggests? Compare b58Sa, which Cheyne (J. Q. R., X, 570) corrects into 5sb5yn 'God rescues," after the Phoenician personal names bnr5n and yrno:T. With equal justification we might suppose that .:=rn was the origin of ,na '?s, and that the nsn, which Queen Ma'acah made for the Asherah, was simply a rrnrn, or robe of state. The compiler of the Book of Kings probably took it for an idol, and treated it accordingly. 260</page><page sequence="23">TRIBAL NAMES AND TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL 261 represents the remote ancestors of Judah, the tribe in our view more especially identified with the cultus of Jahveh; the "other god," whom those ancestors are said to have worshipped beyond the river, can have been no other than Sin; and to this deity was addressed the early hymn, composed in the city of Ur, which is thus cited by Professor Sayce:- Father, long-suffering and full of forgiveness, Whose hand upholds the life of all mankind! ... First-born, omnipotent, whose heart is immensity, And there is none may fathom it!... In heaven, who is supreme ? Thou alone, thou art supreme! On earth, who is supreme ? Thou alone, thou art supreme! (Primer of Assyriology, p. 92.) Was this, then, the religion of Abram? I fear not; for in the first place we have already seen how the attri- butes of Sin were transferred to Ashtoreth; in the second place there is but scanty evidence to connect the worship of the moon with that of Jahveh; and lastly we must, I think, on other grounds, seek a somewhat different origin for the latter. The feast of the new moon, "undoubtedly familiar to the ancient Israelites," is yet " completely ignored in the' Book of the Covenant' and in Deuteronomy." It makes its appearance in Ezek. xlvi. 6 sq. and in a late stratum of P (Addis on Num. xxviii. I, II, vol. II, pp. 430, 43I). In other words, it formed a part of the national religion, and of the priestly tradition, but was disapproved by the pro- phetic reformers. But there is no proof that it was origin- ally a feast of Jahveh at all. And it is not certain that the Sabbath was originally lunar (but see Wellhausen, Prol. Eng. Trans., p. 1 2 sq.). Ashtoreth, as goddess of the moon, is naturally associated with the solar Ba'al. But here again there is little evi- dence to justify us in ascribing a distinctly solar character to Jahveh. In this place it may be right to mention his early identification with Melech, as recipient of the sacrifice</page><page sequence="24">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW of the firstborn (see esp. Ezek. xx. 26), his connexion with the ram (esp. Gen. xxii. 13), with oxen, lions, and the mythical cherubim (I Kings vii. 29), in the ornaments of the temple and the visions of Ezekiel (chaps. i and x; cf. i Kings vi. 23 sq.), to which from the last source (cf. Deut. xxxii. ii) we may also add the eagle. Some of these attributes may possess a solar or celestial significance. As a god of herds and flocks, Jahveh assumes the function of Ashtoreth, and the allusion of King Mesha' to wz n inwy may warn us of the possibility of a similar confusion with regard to the God of Israel. And here perhaps should be placed the " calf" of Beth-El. When, however, 'Ashtoreth is regarded in her primary character- Alma Venus ... ..... quae terras frugiferentes Concelebras, per te quoniam genus omne animantum Concipitur visitque exortum lumina solis-- we look for her beloved companion, the divine tree-spirit (as Mr. Frazer has shown), the Semitic Adonis, the Egyptian Osiris. We find him symbolized in the Asherah, in the tamarisk of Beer-sheba, and the thorn of Sinai. Observe that the worship of thorn and tamarisk, like that of the sacred ewe, belongs not to the settled life of cultivated lands, but to the pastoral existence of the nomads of the wilderness, and therefore, as tradition requires, to an early stage in the history of Israel. According to the hypothesis set forth in this and the foregoing paper on the Tetragrammaton (J. Q. R., X, p. 662) the name nin, equally with npys and rDol and with many of the names of the twelve tribes, is simply a predicate of gK, a particular mode of invoking the god of the community. In the words of Wellhausen, Prol. Eng. Trans., p. 433, " Jehovah was only a special name of El which had become current within a powerful circle [on the view here ad- vocated, the tribe of Judah], and which on that account 262</page><page sequence="25">TRIBAL NAMES AND TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL 263 was all the more fitted to become the designation of a national god." He was not a new god, but the god of their fathers. He might be represented by a tree, a ser- pent, a standard, or perhaps a stone; closed in a chest, "carried about, lifted up, or worshipped," like the Host of a later age (Art. XXVIII of the Church of England). With all this, Moses, it would seem, had no quarrel. He accepted it, one may suppose, as Mahomet accepted the Kaaba. It supplied the indispensable point of contact with the tradi- tions and the modes of thought of his people. ao 7iroV OTt) KaL Ko0aLov Klvr0oTw. In what, then, did the distinctive character of Jahveh consist? What was the mission of Moses ? The answer to this question, as I conceive, is not new. Moses proclaimed a deity who was at once national, the God of all Israel; therefore exclusive, tolerating no divided allegiance, and distinct from the great powers of nature, whose worship was common to the whole world; lastly, as is required in some degree by the very nature of society, a God of Righteousness, of Social Justice. "The religious starting-point of the history of Israel was remarkable, not for its novelty, but for its normal character. In all ancient peoples there exists a relation between God and the affairs of the nation, and religion is employed as a motive for law and customary morality; in none, however, did the relation exist, or was the motive employed, in such purity and power as in Israel." (I quote Mr. Montefiore's translation of this passage, J. Q. R., III, 267. I am, of course, much indebted to his suggestive statement of the problem.) Here, I think, is the answer to much that is put forward in The Making of Religion. What Mr. Lang has done further is to show that, if we may rely upon the evidence which he has adduced, this conception of a Moral Supreme Being is by no means confined to nations advanced in civilization, but occurs independently among many of the lowest savages. If this be so, we may ascribe a moral character to the primitive Semitic El. Upon this view, the work of Moses,</page><page sequence="26">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW or of Mahomet, would consist in reverting to an earlier and purer faith, and impressing it upon the national con- sciousness of the Hebrews, or the Arabs. Moses made Israel, Mahomet created Islam. The religious conceptions of mankind appear to me to express the nature of man's faculties, and reflect the con- ditions of his existence. Hope, as well as fear, generates expectations which become beliefs. The speculations of the intellect, the creative workings of the imagination, have alike their share in the making of the gods. The Object of Religion participates in the moral nature of the Subject. It is possible to admit this, and yet to attribute a Divine origin to the human mind, or to suppose a Divine influence upon its operations. How far Man's thoughts of God conform, either to the Ultimate Reality or to the Supreme Ideal, is the last problem of the Philosophy of Religion. NOTE. THE NAME OF LEVI. Yet another explanation of this name is possible. If we compare the two series, , n5, 1.5, 125, l, and n?M, )nM, n.nlr, nn:, it is curious to observe that in the former case the final term represents the World-Serpent of mythical cosmogony, in the latter the Brazen Serpent set up by Moses, presumably as a symbol of Jahveh (2 Kings xviii. 4). The root m0, we may suppose, describes the coils of the serpent, wn: perhaps the metallic gleam of its scales. Assume now that the tribe of Levi derived its name from a serpent-god (not necessarily a totem), and we shall the better understand why the Levite Moses selected such an emblem for the God of Israel. In Num. xxi. 8 (cf. ver. 6) the nr.nl _n is described as a !71, and we can hardly suppose it unrelated to the anthropomorphic Mb,. which in the vision of Isaiah are associated with the throne of Jahveh. I do not know what evidence there is that the Brazen Serpent stood " in the royal courtyard" at Jerusalem 264</page><page sequence="27">TRIBAL NAMES AND TRADITIONS OF ISRAEL 265 (Robertson-Smith apud Jacobs, Archaeol. Rev., III, I56). But if so, David may well have removed it thither from Bethlehem, apparently a Levitical centre in the days of the Judges (Moore, Grit. Comqrm., pp. 371, 408). The reading 'n: n= in 2 Sam. xvii. 25 is by no means above suspicion (Budde, in loc.). The sacrifice of Adonijah was certainly offered to Jahveh, and if nmntn ;N really means the Serpent's stone, the serpent was probably the genius loci haunting the fountain of En-rogel (Rel. Sem., 2nd ed., pp. I68, 172). Of course, the lower may have been taken up into the higher cult. Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, appears as a prince of Judah in the Priestly Code, Num. i. 7; among the ancestors of David in I Chron. ii. io. Ruth iv. 20; while in Exod. vi. 23 he actually figures as the brother-in-law of Aaron. The passage last cited, it is true, is of somewhat uncertain provenance (see Addis. in loc.). According to Kuenen (Hex., trans. Wicksteed. p. 330) the name of Aaron's wife is taken " from Levitical genealogies, a number of which were in circulation after the captivity." In any case it may serve to show the relation of Levi to the tribe of Judah, to the house of David, and, shall we add? to the worship of Nehushtan. G. H. SKIPWITH.</page></plain_text>
