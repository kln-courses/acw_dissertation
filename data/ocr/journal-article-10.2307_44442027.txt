In 1907 in London's Battersea distria, antiviviseaionists and medical students clashed over the statue of a brown terrier dog, a gift to the borough to commemo- rate the viviseaion and death of the animal in the physiological laboratories of Uni- versity College. The Brown Dog Riots produced an unlikely coalition - trade unionists and woman suffragists joined antiviviseaionists in proteaing the statue from "the medical hooligans." Lansbury analyzes the leading aaors in the Brown Dog Riots: the union men, who viewed the suffrage movement with contempt; upper- and middle- class women, devoted to saving animals from the laboratory; and the research com- munity, which embraced vivisection as a tool for professionalization. Drawing extensively on the literature of the Viaorian and Edwardian periods, Lansbury, a professor of English at Rutgers University, provides compelling analyses of such dis- parate works as Black Beauty (1877), the "autobiography of a horse" used as a text by both the English and American antiviviseaion movements, and Claude Bernard's Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine (1865), which Lansbury argues cast physicians and physiologists in a new priestly role. Lansbury draws upon a provocative literary source for her explanation of the emotions and prejudices that led women to embrace antiviviseaion. Challenging</page><page sequence="2">274 BOOK REVIEWS other historians of the movement, she contends that "women were the most fervent supporters of antivivisection, not simply for reasons of humanity but because the vivisected animal stood for vivisected woman: the woman strapped to the gynaeco- logical table, the woman strapped and bound in the pornographic fiction of the period" (p. x). She argues that the language of gynecology (the emphasis on the stirrups and straps of the examining table) resembled that of Victorian pornography; the vivisector and the riding master became recurring characters in both pornogra- phy and women's fiction. The ubiquitous antivivisectionist posters of animals stretched out and bound to a table stirred women to anger, Lansbury infers, because it touched on their own sexual victimization. Lansbury concedes that for most women, this occurred at a level beyond conscious awareness, deriving its power from the very fact that it went unrecognized. However, she suggests that Frances Power Cobbe and Elizabeth Blackwell, two women prominent in the antivivisection movement, were aware of the connections between vivisection, pornography, and the subjection of women. Blackwell, as a physician, was perhaps even familiar with contemporary pornography. However, Lansbury does not make such connections explicit. Certainly Elizabeth Blackwell criticized the vogue of sexual surgery and voiced concern that vivisection made physicians less sensitive to the needs of the sick and helpless poor. But the relationship Blackwell allegedly saw between sexual sur- gery and the disregard for lower-class female sensibilities and pornography is not clear. This book is a challenging addition to the historiography of antivivisection. The concluding chapter in particular is a penetrating examination of the consequences of Victorian anthropomorphism. Lansbury observes that animals were first sacrificed to fiction before they were sacrificed to science; the disparity between real animals and the superior creatures of fiction allowed human beings to deny the reality of animal existence. These observations are pertinent to the current discussion of animal rights and human obligations. Reviewed by SUSAN E.
