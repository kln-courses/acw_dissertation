CERNING CANNIBALISM REVISIONISM Derek Petrey Ohio State University "Why are you always asking about eating the ones who died?" one man complained to me. "You talk to me about eating; [Denise Meireles] came here and asked me about eating. The missionaries and the priests used to say, 'Why did you eat people? Why did you eat?' Eating, eating, eating! Eating was not all we did! We cried, we sang, we burned the house, we burned all their things." Pointing at the notebook in my lap, he directed, "Write about all of this, not just the eating!" (Conklin xxii) Introduction This paper is derived from questions that followed an ongoing discussion I engaged in during the NEH Seminar on Brazil: the Invisible Giant. The participants found it hard to discuss colonial Brazil without being confronted by the texts of Staden, de L?ry, Thevet, and others, all of which mention the topic of cannibalism. During the conference, we spoke with a number of researchers who, although providing rather insightful comments on Brazilian culture of the period, were possessed of diametrically opposed beliefs as to the existence of indigenous acts of anthropophagy1 in colonial to modern-day Brazil. As the question has been so aptly stated, "Why does the issue of cannibalism's very existence drive the people dedicated to its study into opposing camps?" (Osborne quoted in Goldman 11) Some researchers insisted that there was no credible evidence that the Tupinamba ever committed acts of cannibalism. Some researchers took the notion of Tupinamba anthropophagy as historical fact. Apart from these two opposites, there were 'I use "cannibalism" and "anthropophagy" (and their grammatical derivations) interchangeably throughout this paper merely from an esthetic desire for variety. I resist the notion that one can remove the negative stereotypization surrounding a concept merely by changing the lexical term, substituting "cannibal" with a Greek word that means, in effect, "man-eating." 113</page><page sequence="2">114 Write About All of This: Concerning Cannibalism Revisionism intermediary positionings. Some stated that although that the historical record had obviously been contaminated by the biases of the discoverers, missionaries, and settlers, cannibalism could indeed be established as a sporadic occurrence between warring tribes. Others claimed that the actual historical facts of colonial cannibalism, buried in time and mired in prejudice, are irrelevant, postulating that the cultural imaginary surrounding cannibalism is a vivid dynamic independent of actual historical events. Take, for example, Lawrence Goldman's critical agnosticisni regarding cannibalism : "For the most part, the authors here regard questions about the historical incidence of cannibalism as passe2; providing answers to skeptics is not a driver in their trials." (3). Albeit that all of the essayists in the book have substantial parts in their essays either attacking revisionist historians that deny records of cannibalism or challenging the unjustified use of the label of cannibal (I include Goldman here, who does both), Goldman still sees that enunciating arguments from merely one side of the divide is critically unproductive. Although the anthropological field appears to have weighed strongly in support of the historical notion of frequent incidences of cannibalism endemic to many societies on many continents, there is still debate in the field of cultural studies on the interpretation and reception of such data. In particular, the works of William Arens, who in 1979 published an iconoclastic book entitled The Man-Eating Myth, completely deny any reports of ceremonial or ritual anthropophagy in the Americas, Australia or New Guinea, and Africa. I would charge that such blanket disbelief in ritual cannibalism arises from an ethnocentrically-produced preconception, just as does the blanket condemnation of precontact indigenes as bloodthirsty savages. In my paper, I examine the views of Arens and his supporters in the light of present-day anthropological research and in the context of previous scholarship. The Demons of Nineteenth-Century Anthropology The anthropology which Arens takes such pains to attack is the nascent one of the nineteenth century, a time when positivism and Social Darwinism reigned supreme in the epistemology of societal progess. Arens respects the generalism and intellectual ambition of these "founding fathers of the field", while severely criticzing their ability and impartiality. (5). According to the notions of anthropomorphic progress held by these critics, societies were divided into levels of primitiveness (lacking refinement but possessing vigor), modernity (combining the best of both virtues), or decadence (having spent their vigor and a lessened refinement). The third category was reserved for those once great Classical civilizations that later fell into decline. These civilizations often escaped ethical scorn, protected under the aegis of Western civilization's genealogy. The first category was primarily that of the non-Western, and the non-European. "The sites for European cannibalism and human sacrifice are all dated to the prehistoric eons and those for the non-European world to the present or recent period. However, such a 2The use of italics here is original to the text, and serves as a reminder to the reader that the collection of articles is inspired by Montaigne's Essai, which is an archetypal model both for reflections on the topic of cannibalism and of ruminations that do not necessarily respond to direct assessments of truth-value.</page><page sequence="3">Derek Petrey 115 correlation is not a valid historical analogy but merely matches a fictionalized past with a dubious present." (16) This is just one of the logical twists Arens is forced to make in his categorical denial. Although he does in three instances briefly pause to deny cases of reputed European witchcraft-related cannibalism, he does so only to prove that these false accusations were repeated in the New World. He makes no mention of European medicinal cannibalism, which was known to have occurred as regular practice from the fourteenth to eighteenth centuries in Western Europe. Although in other places he states that European cannibalism was underreported, it does not help his case to actually affirm that any such cannibalism existed. Not knowing what to do with the data, he ignores it. In 1998, when Arens was presented with the credible evidence of medicinal cannibalism in Europe (typically in the form of ingesting blood from the recently executed and solutions that contained powdered corpses and corpse wrappings) and bone-ash cannibalism in Peru, he went so far as to state that these were not strictly defined cases of cannibalism.3 I want to emphasize that I do not wish to make a facile elision of the ethical concerns surrounding cannibalism by merely stating that its ubiquity makes it more approachable. The fin-de-si?cle anthropologists, educated in the ways of the nineteenth century, tried a similar comparative approach. After the barbarity European inflicted upon European during the First World War, this moral integrity of the colonial mission was challenged from within. Anthropologists, while still drawing a marked line between modern and primitive practices, desisted from forming readymade value judgements about either. In 1922, Sir James Frazer's multivolume work The Golden Bough, served to explain the nature of regicide. In doing so, Frazer offered a coherent worldview that explained primitive, classical, medieval, and modern religious manifestations as an inherent need for collective acts of sacrifice and adoration. In many cultures this was acheived through cannibalism, at first of a real nature, and then symbolic. His section on cannibalism presents the existence of the lurid practice to a scandalized audience while simultaneously relating it to the Eucharist: It is now easy to understand why a savage should desire to partake of the flesh of an animal or man whom he regards as divine. By eating the body of the god he shares in the god's attributes and powers. And when the god is a corn-god, the corn is his proper body; when he is a vine-god, the juice of his grape is his blood; and so by eating the bread and drinking the wine the worshipper partakes of the real body and blood of his god. (578) Although several criticisms of Frazer's worldview and methodology have been presented, we must remember that this vision is one of the first to seek out elements of the so-called "primitive" within "modern" systems of belief, and as such breaks down the 3For more information regarding the practice of Paracelsian cannibalism, see P.K. Himmelmann's article "The medicinal body: An analysis of medicinal cannibalism in Europe, 1300-1700," Dialectical Anthropology 22: 183-203 (1997); Teresa Conklin's 2001 book Consuming Grief, 8-13, and 253nl for Arens's reaction to it; also Karen Gordon Grube's articles "Anthropophagy in post-Renaissence Europe: The tradition of medicinal cannibalism," American Anthropologist 90 (2): 405-09 (1988) and "Evidence of medicinal cannibalism in Puritan New England: 'Mummy' and related remedies in Edward Taylor's 'Dispensatory'," Early American Literature 28 (3): 185-221 (1993).</page><page sequence="4">116 Write About All of This: Concerning Cannibalism Revisionism barriers of the barbarism/civilization divide. While writers such as E.M. Loeb traced a linearity from primitive behavior to modern, Frazer asserted that the former was a vital part of the latter. The next step in this tendency was to suspend any and all value-judgments about the morality of any culture, the ethical approximation of French structural anthropologist L?vi-Strauss: "We then discover that no society is fundamentally good, but that none is absolutely bad; they all offer their members certain advantages, with the proviso that there is inevitably a residue of evil, the amount of which seems to remain more or less constant and perhaps corresponds to a specific inertia in social life resistant to all attempts at organization" (387). In other words, evil was to be judged only against the grain of norms of behavior specific to that certain society, and the role of the anthropologist was to study her or his specific narrowly focused area. Arens sees in these changes as a generational reaction to the intellectual ambition of the founding fathers of anthropology: "There are a number of explanations for this retrenchment in addition to the realization that the pioneers suffered from the delusions of intellectual grandeur which often accompany a lack of appreciation for the difficulties attending on a previously untried endeavor." (6) Arens, the same one who rails against his colleagues for a lack of generalist vision and "big-picture" perspective, is now taking his predecessors to task for delusions of grandeur. While these developments in anthropological discourse were concomitant with a number of changes in the methodology, the goals, and the intended reception of learned information, these changes did not reach the mainstream, and the media reception of anthropological information regarding certain topics remained as sensational as ever. "What is clearly illustrated is the rampant dependence on, and indulgence in, metaphoric play for the delight of readers. Alliteration and assonance are manipulated to foreground the resonant ludic potential inherent in the consumptive and homicidal metaphors invoked." (Goldman 5-6) These preconceptions of the public, ones based on an antiquated, distorted, and unjustifiable anthropology, are the ones that Arens seeks to combat. Proindigenism vs. Antioccidentalism Arens's railings against any sort of prejudicial mistreatment of the non-Western pervades his text: The academic record indicates that despite assurances to the contrary, scholars in all fields occasionally have functioned as little more than erudite purveyors of attractive pedestrian myths. (7) Though the flaws in this line of reasoning are now obvious, nineteenth century evolutionary social theory attempted to assign specific social and cultural features to corresponding eras of history. . . . The notion of cannibalism neatly fits into this picture. In a subsequent period characterized by the most complex non-western civilizations, human flesh was used ... in religious rituals. (14-15)</page><page sequence="5">Derek Petrey 117 In addition to collecting, translating, and filtering the requisite data, anthropology has often served as a reviver and reinventor of the notion of savagery. (166) However, in connecting cannibalism to savagery, Arens disallows any reconsideration of the topic, or even the possibility that complex cultural systems might incorporate (and much less revolve around) anthropophagy. "However .. . Arens's foolhardy denial of the reality of cannibalism is a particularly attractive strategy when the ethical issues are pressing" (Gardner 41). Arens's preconditions as to what constitutes "acceptable" evidence revolve not around a set of methodological criteria but an ideological position motivated by laudable and noble precepts: antiracism, the defense of indigenous peoples, and a resistance to the abuses of Western civilization. Lewis Petrinovich goes further when he charges that Arens is operating under a ". . .political agenda: that white, male, Christian, European paternalists have collectively presented the thinly disguised prejudices of western culture about others as facts about human nature." (150) This ideology appears to have blinded Arens to fact. He attacks only the most noteworthy of reports on cannibalism, while ignoring the vast quantities of informants of lesser renown. As stated in Petrinovich's exhaustive study of cannibalism, "If anthropologists don't want to believe in evidence for regularly-practiced, culturally-sanctioned cannibalism it is because they are purposely avoiding the evidence" (149). Arens's particular dismissal of Tupinamba cannibalism consists mainly of a critique of Hans Staden's and Las Casas's accounts. All further accounts made by Europeans regarding the Tupinamba, alleges Arens, are acts of plagiarism, although each author he cites gives a different version of the "revenge statement." He finds it inconceivable that these different Europeans would be able to witness such scenes, although such interchanges would be quite common during a time of multiple invasions and war. "What about those who came after Staden, whose written works also confirm the Tupinamba practice?" (28) Arens, supposedly a stickler for quantitative measurements, conveniently forgets to note the exact quantity of these reports, and in doing so leaves the reader to minimize them. As such, all other reports are patly dismissed: "It would be unreasonable to imply out of hand that they all misrepresented their observations; but they might have resorted to a common shortcoming of authors both past and present called plagiarism." (28) Apparently Arens does not find it unreasonable to state that every single report ever made during 300 years of Portuguese colonialism is a piagarism of Hans Staden's, and that every author who did plagiarize was not using these words to refer to witnessed acts of cannibalism. Arens regards cannibalism as being so terrible, so horrid, that any report of it in the Americas must be considered as a trope, a heuristic, and a lie. While he is more than willing (as are Montaigne and Vieira) to accuse Europeans of all sorts of cannibalistic tendencies, metaphoric and others, he will not admit that some civilizations in the New World did engage in acts of ritual cannibalism, even when presented with evidence to the contrary. How does this mentality benefit either logical debate or the indigenous communities which Arens so vigorously defends? How does this mentality differentiate from that of the "noble savage" envisioned by Rousseau? To what end does this inverse stereotyping serve? I share with Arens and Castro-Klaren (and all of the anthropologists cited here) the assertion that, throughout the history of colonial contact, false claims of</page><page sequence="6">118 Write About All of This: Concerning Cannibalism Revisionism cannibalism have been used by Europeans to justify inappropriate acts of overt racism, enslavement, genocide, and dispossession of lands and goods. I also empathize Arens's and Castro-Klar?n's impulse to distance themselves from people who have used the moniker of "man-eater" as a slur. Yet in doing so, I must insist that to deny that anthropophagy existed as an accepted social practice is both untenable and illogical. "Although most researchers would agree that archival sources leave much to be desired, the inferential passage to the 'inexistence' of cannibalism is unacceptable. In particular, the restriction of what can constitute adequate documentation to 'personally observed' firsthand accounts rather threw out the baby with the bathwater." (Goldman 14) Sara Castro-Klar?n, in her article "What Does Cannibalism Speak?", states that even if de L?ry had been able to understand Tupi, "the essentially monologic situation attendant on the colonizing gesture would nevertheless deeply mark the text." (1993 34). Yet there is a difference between saying that de L?ry's reading is plagued with inconsistencies and laden with symbolic imagery and saying that it has no basis in observed fact. Unlike Arens, she does not claim that de L?ry has committed plagiarism. For her, it is as if he has entered the realm of psychosis; de L?ry has made a complete break with reality. De L?ry is incapable of commenting on Tupinamba society, his truth . . . "will always be partial and it will belong to the realm of the subject and its Imaginary." (35) For Castro Klar?n, de L?ry's text was written solely for the purpose of contributing to the European debate on the Eucharist and propagating a misogynistic worldview that sees indigenous women as ravenous crones who mock the Creation by devouring the righteous and stating "It is good". Castro-Klar?n's emphasis on de L?ry's religion is key here. Just as she accurately and caretakingly portrays the position of the Protestant cleric de L?ry struggling with an internal debate over the Catholic concept of transsubstantion, she also finds herself struggling with evidence that seems to contradict her long-held belief, or better said, disbelief, in cannibalism. A Crisis of Ideology-cum-Faith Stephen Greenblatt characterizes the image of the cannibal as a nee plus ultra, that trope beyond which one cannot go. For Greenblatt, the moment of wonder is a transformative one, because the encounter with the new and previously undefined is a moment that forces the observer to supersede established logical boundaries. In that moment of awe lies the capacity for invention, but not true dialogue with the Other. William Arens casts his polemic treatise as if he were caught on the road from Damascus: "The essay which follows is the result of a conversion process" (v). He becomes, in effect, the prophet of a new ideology, replacing the flawed vision of his predecessors with his own. This new pessimism, fed by his continued reading against the grain of various texts, abandons traditional investigative evidentiary procedures: "Thus while he accepts anthropological reports of informant's denials of the suggestion that they practiced cannibalism as evidence ... he omits to mention the numerous anthropological reports of informants who do state that they had practiced it, which by parity of argument, should be taken, other things being equal, as evidence that they had." (Gardner 37) Arens, while thus denying that cannibalism was ever practiced in the New World, yet states that</page><page sequence="7">Derek Petrey 119 Old World accounts of cannibalism are being covered up by historians. His evidentiary standards regard any cathexis with Western interference as a moment of possible (for him probable) contamination. Arens makes a differentiation between cannibalism as accepted practice and cannibalism as a atrocious singular act. Yet he never sufficiently defines either, combining both of them in the same conflation made by Columbus down to L?vi Strauss. He never defines how large the group would have to be to qualify as a social group. Nor does he ever define how often cannibalism would have to be observed to be an accepted practice. One imagines that even a teledocumentary produced completely by indigenes, carefully portraying "pot to plate" preparation and consumption of a human corpse, would still be considered dubious by Mr. Arens (maybe someone doctored the film). In other words, Arens is not predisposed to accept any credible evidence of cannibalism being a socially acceptable part of any society. Sara Castro-Klar?n comes to a similar uncomfortable logical point in her 1992 article on cannibalism. I quote from her footnote on Dr. Chanca: "I find Arens's general case to hold in spite of the fact that Marshall Sahlins and Peggy Sanders claim that he may have overstated his case. A distinction between anthropophagy as a dietary custom and as a religious ritual is specifically pertinent here" (31). If she truly believed that Arens's general case (no cannibalism in the New World) held, it could not be overstated. Arens's statement was an absolute statement. It appears that Castro-Klar?n is ceding the possibility of ritual cannibalism. Otherwise, her distinction would be not only impertinent, but irrelevant. However, by the time she reaches her essay on Oswaldo de Andrade, she has resolved her crisis of faith. "No doubt the force of the [cannibalistic] trope lingered in a many layered cultural matrix. ... A reading against the grain of Oswald de Andrade's Manifesto antrop?fago ([1928] 1981) could begin to make such a force visible. Genealogy, Michel Foucault reminds us, requires patience and knowledge of details." (296) Details, however, such as credible reports of bone-ash cannibalism, speak little to her. In the end, her gloss of the cannibal question is relegated to footnote status. "The idea that the Tupi warriors literally ate their enemies out of revenge appears in the reports of Hans Stadthropology. . . . The whole anthropophagie complex has come under much debate in the last decade. The question is not yet settled." Of course, given that the majority of debate in the last decade has arisen overwhemingly against Arens's position, she fails to actually refer the reader to any of it. "For a challenge to the idea that the Tupi and other colonized peoples practiced "anthropophagy" on a regular basis see Arens 1979. See also Castro-Klar?n 1992b, 1997." In other words, the only credible evidence she mentions is Arens's uncorrected and unrepentant 23-year-old text and two of her own articles. Once critics have placed themselves on one side of the divide or the other, it is easy to reinterpret the facts as they see fit. For example, Zinka Zwiebel, in her comprehensive work on European accounts of colonial Brazil, Terra dos canibais, comments on the title of Hans Staden's manuscript whose title begins Verhaftige historia. She suggests that something odd is occuring here: the usage of the word "history", one would think, would suppose that a modifier such as "true" (verhaftig) would be unnecessary. It is easy to suspect, as do the relativists, that Staden "doth protest overly" and is affirming how truthful his invented experience really is. It is just as easy to imagine that the title was</page><page sequence="8">120 Write About All of This: Concerning Cannibalism Revisionism used merely to reassure the reader that the experience, albeit harrowing and grotesque, is really as true as the author claims it to be. In addition, one might ask as to whether the connotation of "history" as "true testimony" would be as rigorously held in 16th-century Europe as it is today. How to Write It All Down Gardner makes a very cogent point regarding how the fine line between emotionally reactive and ethically reflective positionings affects the character and quality of anthropological reportage. He states that other anthropological studies differ in perspective from Arens's because they "take for granted an experience-distant, functionalist perspective that facilitated ethical disagreement". (42) The question here is avoiding what he terms as "syllepsis". We must disregard the overwhelmingly negative stereotypification of the cannibalistic act without averting our gaze from the actuality of the practice. "[To] euphemize a practice is to backhandedly support precisely those straightforwardly ethnocentric judgments that appalled us" (43). In other words, to defend cannibalism is to suggest that it needs defending. There is now conclusive evidence that nonstarvation cannibalism has been intrinsic to many groups of humans throughout history, including Cro-Magnons, the Anasazi, the Aztecs, the Tupinamba, and Europeans practicing Paracelsian medicine up to the 18th century. My position is that once we accept the reality of cannibalism, historical and current, European and non-European, we may move past it to understand the people who practice it and the systems of meaning involved in its practice. In such a manner will we truly abandon the hysteric and unproductive denial and/or labeling that accompanies these practices. I would suggest that a strict examination of the deeds coupled with an honest consideration of the intuitive reactions elicited by the researcher (and reader) would be of greater help. The direct connection of many of these practices to kidnapping, homicide and war crimes means that we in Western society tend to see cannibalism as a loss of rights, an extreme violation of boundaries. Mortuary cannibalism, endogenous cannibalism practiced after the natural death of an ingroup member, is often given a different status by researchers, as does Castro-Klaren in her footnote on Dr. Chanca. However, this differentation was not one made by colonial authorities, national governments, or the media. Many forms of cannibalism exist, and while some of these are understandable, all of them elicit in the Western (and many non-Western) observers a visceral repugnance. Indigenous tribes themselves often also used false claims of cannibalism to malign an colonizing outgroup or rival tribe. The association between masticating and ingesting human tissue and some characteristic of monstrosity and/or vice is ingrained in many cultures, ranging from the classical Greek to the precontact Melanesian, as Arens comments. It is not that cannibalism is the act of those driven to insanity, argues Petrovich. His analysis of the proceedings of hundreds of records of starvation cannibalism in European sea archives proves the contrary. To wit, starvation cannibalism follows a logical and</page><page sequence="9">Derek Petrey 121 precise order which has clear rational precepts.4 These precepts strictly adhere to the imperative of group survival, which improves the chances of group reproductive success. In the case of nonsurvival cannibalism, exocannibalism and endocannibalism are not mutually exclusive practices. In many cases, both are also practiced with the goal of enhancing ingroup cohesion and survivability. The tribal group reinforces its self-identity when, during times of intertribal conflict, it consumes the bodies of enemy warriors. In times of strife, such acts of cannibalism provide protein to warriors who are unable to raise crops, create a scare tactic to demoralize enemy factions, and psychologically dehumanize the opposition, enabling the conflict to continue and more enemy to be killed. When members of the ingroup die of natural causes, the group consumes the body as an act of remembrance and collective mourning. But this is not the only way in which these groups reinforce their cultural identity. Beth Conklin's compassionate book on the Wari, Consuming Grief, does an excellent job of conveying the Wari concept of the "porousness" of the body, the belief that bodies are fluid entities with protean boundaries and not discrete objects. This notion of difference persists through rites of birth, adulthood, lovemaking, and death. As such, her work presents the entire Wari cosmology, preserving the practices and beliefs of a precontact people. Her intense attention to detail, humane and humanistic approach, and rigorous documentation is an example for anthropologists and cultural critics alike.5 The arbitrary divisions Western civilization places between human mammals and other mammals (especially the white-lipped peccary) is ablated in Wari discourse. For the Wari, mortuary cannibalism is a final act of connection with the lost one, and it humanizes death in an intimate way. The concept of enclosing the cadaver in a container and leaving it to 4Petrinovich gives a protocol for how starvation forces humans to reconsider previously ignored sources of nutrition. First, the subject slowly widens the potential sources of food (grasses, seaweed, leather, animal skins, and the like). Then, living creatures that were not previously considered as edible are scavenged or killed for food (domesticated animals, insects). Then either someone perishes or is killed for consumption. While almost all survivors claim that killings were decided by random selection (the casting of lots or drawing of straws), a disproportionate number of minorities or outgroup members (slaves, Indians, Eskimos, children, women, and the elderly) are chosen and a disproportionate number of skilled healthy ingroup adults are "blessed" with the luck of the draw (doctors, cooks, navigators, skilled crew, guides of the same race as the majority of the survivors, etc.) Survival cannibalism obeys the logic of desperation, and is not an act of the insane. 5It is also interesting to see how cultural critics respond to accounts of how quickly Europeans learned languages. While it is a given that some people (in Colonial times as now) are talented with powerful linguistic and mnemonic skills (considering the various accounts of degredados learning enough of a language to survive for years abandoned abroad by Portuguese sailors, or of Jesuit-trained priests speaking a great number of languages and having astounding feats of memory) some of the NEH participants were incredulous that Columbus might have remembered details years after his voyages or that Staden or de L?ry or Richard Burton learned non-European languages as quickly as is reported.</page><page sequence="10">122 Write About All of This: Concerning Cannibalism Revisionism rot like garbage is horrific to the Wari, although they are now conforming to Western practices. Surprisingly enough, it is Conklin and not Castro-Klar?n or Arens who goes the furthest in unearthing evidence of European cannibalism. It is Conklin who provides bibliographical references and comments on how this practice occurred. It is her position that European cannibalism is unique in that no other civilization has commodified human body parts for consumption to the extent that European civilization has. European cannibalism was mass-produced and international, as was European colonialism. Is it not ironic that an anthropologist who the anti-Western Arens might regard as hopelessly anti indigene would provide a more rigorous analysis of European cannibalism (and colonialism) than he? Or is it that Conklin, not having blinded herself to the possibility of these acts, sees further and more objectively than the relativists? Conclusion "The overall meaning to this scene is, however, that it is not enough to marginalize oneself in order to cause change" (Glissant 39). One cannot conflate the discourse of colonial encounters into one monolithic (Europe/Other) dialogue. Every component of precontact culture is important and merits understanding, even those components that have been used by Europeans (and their descendants) to demean and destroy these cultures. While it is noble to glorify the survivors of the colonial onslaught, the present-day denial that such aspects ever existed does little to enhance the remnants of these indigenous cultures. Blinding ourselves to this reality in fact diminishes our understanding of these cultures, and in some way denies them cultural agency. The error made by the Arens and his followers lies in creating a center from which to speak, a center directed at the heart of Western epistemology. However, the mistake is that this center is a construction of ethnocentric misgivings just as the mechanisms of oppression which Arens was fighting. As Glissant recognized, "The West is not the West. It is a project, not a place" (2). For any provincialization to take place, one must recognize that all spaces are provincial, cut off from the center in some manner. The trope of cannibalism is not a nee plus ultra too horrid to contemplate, but rather a wormhole which the Western-trained observer can only escape by trying to move through and thus comprehend.
