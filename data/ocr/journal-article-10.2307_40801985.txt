In this debate, the distinction between fine hand binding and commercial cloth binding was of less concern than the function of the book as a designed object, the book cover's relation to the text it enclosed and the appropriate forms of decoration for book bindings. It is generally acknowledged that the field was reinvigorated, if not transformed, by two bookbinders, Thomas James Cobden- Sanderson (1840-1922) in England and Henri François Marius Michel (1846-1925) in France. Both men rejected the duplication of traditional decorative schemes and aspired to a more personal, artistic expression. These ideas are analysed as responses to the challenge of designing objects for the world of mass production. Keywords: bookbinders- book binding - book design- decorative arts- decorative design- ornament 'Modern book-bindings and their designers/ the 1899-1900 special issue of The Studio, began with the statement: 'Books hold a distinct place among the subjects of applied art. Whatever beauty they may claim in form and ornament belongs to an order quite their own'.1 Sarah Wyman Whitman (1842-1904), the leading designer of cloth bindings for Houghton Mifflin, wrote that the well designed book was 'an aesthetic tract' and argued that the book should not be thought of as simply a three-dimensional object to be adorned: When we speak of book-illustrating in any of its forms I feel that we should be thinking of the book all the time, of this thing as apart from everything else. A book is a little issue all by itself. It is like nothing else, and the method of its decoration must be in a sense unique also.2 For bibliophiles in the last decades of the nineteenth century, the aesthetics of book covers became a topic of intense interest and sometimes passionate debate. Numerous national and international expositions included bookbinding exhibits and were regularly reviewed in the press. Historical studies, manuals and many periodicals devoted to the subject were published in France, England and the USA. Bibliophilesand binders founded bookclubs. In order to raise the quality of American binding, members of the Grolier Club even hired French master binders and brought them to New York to run the Club Bindery. The French bibliophile, Henri Beraldi, characterized the era as 'le temps fameux', the renaissance of bookbinding. 3 New technologies of manufacture played a key role in driving this intense interest in the aesthetics of mass produced objects, including book bindings. All objects of common use- from shoes to tableware, chairs to hammers- were reproducible in standard sizes and patterns and priced for all markets. Contemporary transporta- tion systems made possible their dissemination throughout Europe and America. In the process, the value of the individual objects, including books, was changed. The value of 'uniqueness' was now problematic. Many design theorists, following William Morris, insisted that manufacturing return to its pre-industrial roots or that mass produced goods mirror the same rules as handcrafted ones. ©The Author [2010].

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, he wrote, people of all classes enjoyed a pleasurable and nat- ural relationship with their possessions. By the end of the century, the sheer quan- tity of objects made the individual's relationship to possessions problematic, more self-conscious. The multiplicity of things created a feeling of oppression- of being overwhelmed by the need to choose which among them to purchase, how to care for or use them and how to use them as a means of self-presentation. Endlessly changing fashion and its relationship to class now made the acquisition of objects and their display an occasion of some tension.4 The Aesthetic movement and later the Arts and Crafts movement and Art Nouveau can be thought of, in part, as responses to this changing relationship between objects and their owners. In this context, the rapid development of machinery able to produce books by the millions began in the 1820s and resulted in bindings made of cloth-covered boards called publisher or edition bindings. American publishers, unlike those abroad, regarded cloth bindings as permanent, rather than temporary covering and saw decorated cloth as an important advertising tool. Whitman, speaking of the indus- trialization of, and dramatic increase in, book production, believed this gave designers the opportunity to put 'a touch of art' into commercially produced books. According to the Chicago binder Ellen Gates Starr (1859-1940), hand-crafted bind- ings had a beneficent effect on commercial designs; they served as exemplars, providing 'a canon of good taste'. Amidst this growth in quantity and search for quality, participants and critics sought to identify aesthetic principles that would describe the particular attributes of the well-bound book.5 The following essay examines the aesthetic issues that binders and their chronic- lers addressed in France, England and America from 1880 to 1910. Histories of bookbinding by nationality and by individual binders were published during the period, but they did not focus on design issues.6 Two excellent modern studies of French cultural life during this period describe the interest in book binding design, and English and American publishers' bindings have been studied in some detail.7 Most current literature, however, tends to be either instructional or celebratory. I am not aware of any discussion that focuses on the shared aesthetics across national boundaries. The distinction between fine hand bookbinding and commer- cial cloth binding, though significant with respect to economic and cultural values, did not significantly influence discussions of design aesthetics. None claimed that mass produced books could compete with individually bound books in quality of materials, but it was assumed that the aesthetics of decoration applied to both and they were discussed in similar fashion. Individual writers tended to focus on the nationality of the binders or designers, but I will argue that this had less to do with the works themselves and reflected the intense nationalism of the era. Two mutually antagonistic impulses were at work: an attempt at universalizing ideas of beauty and a drive to return to pre-industrial national roots. By the middle of the nineteenth century in England, Owen Jones, and later Christopher Dresser proclaimed the universality of design, derived from the historical past and other cultures, freeing (or ripping) ornament from its historical and cultural context. To escape what was universally conceded to have been a century in which book binders endlessly repeated historical patterns, many called for a new approach in keeping with modern times. Yet the most admired of the reformers, paradoxically, turned to national or folk tradition for ideas.8 When William Morris looked to England's medieval past for political and cultural inspiration, he adapted medi- eval ornament and type as part of a reforming mission. Similarly, his work inspired French designers to go back to their own sixteenth-century rococo bindings as a source for renewal. They combined this with studies from nature, specifically the plants of the French countryside. L'École de Nancy, founded by French designer 230 Aesthetic Issues in Book Cover Design</page><page sequence="3">Emile Gallé was part of this movement.9 Although most literature of the period was organized by country and nationalism played a significant part in craft revival movements, the stylistic evidence from the bindings themselves fails to reveal their national origin. Most binders and designers worked in a wide variety of styles in re- sponse to market demands. Only a few individual binders created a personal voice. It was generally accepted by their contemporaries that bookbinding was reinvig- orated, if not transformed by Thomas James Cobden-Sanderson (1840-1922) in England10 and Henri François Marius Michel (1846-1925) in France.11 Both men re- jected the replication of traditional decorative schemes and aspired to a more per- sonal, artistic expression. Cobden-Sanderson dismissed Morris's medievalizing and wrote in his Journal: 'We are the men of the middle and all other ages, but our setting, actual and acquired, is different, and consequently our "creations" take other forms. To force ourselves into the forms of other times is to be affected, and to be useless for our time that is'.12 Henri Marius Michel insisted, above all, that the decoration of the book cover re- flect its content. More than any other binder during the period, he proclaimed necessary and special the relationship between book design and book contents. The binding should be designed to enclose a specific work whose meaning, tone and character would be evoked for the reader before he opened it. For Cobden- Sanderson, however, the beautiful binding was only one aspect of creating a total experience of beauty: the book beautiful, or the ¡deal book, to which paper, type font, printing and illustration- all physical aspects of the book- contributed.13 The function of the book as a designed object, the book cover's relation to the text it enclosed and the appropriate forms of decoration for book bindings were the issues central to this debate. The book as art object Marius Michel criticized those who admired bindings on the basis of their price, provenance or the rarity of the book. The primary function of a book cover, wrote Cobden-Sanderson, is to protect the text and is, 'an act of homage to the genius of the writer whose book is bound'. He argued that book cover decoration should be a 'tribute of the binder to the author' and not attempt to enhance the prestige of its owner.14 Ellen Gates Starr, who had been apprenticed with Cobden-Sanderson and shareä his Arts and Crafts betters, was more 'nc'uswe, not'ng 'ha' once booVs'Neve no longer rare possessions, only books prized for their intellectual content, rarity or valued for personal associations should be hand bound.15 Sarah Whitman, on the other hand, argued that binding decoration should be directed to its audience rather than celebrating the author. 'It is the reader, the person who owns it, who cares for it, who is going to have a certain feeling about the book, to whom the book cover will have significance'.16 Writers of the period relied on two analogies to explain the function of the book cover: as an element in interior decorating, or as clothing. Books were objets d'art Libraries in wealthy homes were treasure rooms created for display- as much as they may have been places to store books or to read them. Douglas Cockerell, Cobden-Sanderson's first student and an accomplished binder and teacher in his own right, believed that a book cover could not be designed as a beautiful object in isolation, but only as part of its environment. It should be seen as: 'a spot of brightness and interest among its surroundings. If a room and every- thing in it is covered with elaborate pattern, then anything with a plain surface would be a welcome as a relief; but in a room which is reasonably free from orna- ment, a spot of rich decoration should be welcome'. Ellen Mazur Thomson 231</page><page sequence="4">Important books used in public, such as Bibles, 'may be decorated with gold and colour until they seem to be covered in a golden material. They will be but spots of gorgeousness in a great church or cathedral, and they cannot be said to be over- decorated as long as the decoration is good'.17 French avant-garde bibliophiles such as Robert de Montesquiou also valued books as treasures to display, as elements in an interior environment designed to dazzle and inspire occupants and visitors. But he also eulogized the bookbinder Charles Meunier (1866-1940) as a 'clother of dreams', a designer of bindings that lured the viewer into the text by animating the inanimate: 'when you dress our Book/If it is mortal; make it live/Under the embossing of leather'.18 Other writers of the period also drew a parallel between clothing the human figure and the author's text. Esther Wood wrote that 'the nearest analogy to the art of bookbinding is that of dress. The apparel we associate with some gracious person- ality, the garments of ceremonial or of daily use and wont, have their counterpart in the covering and adornment of books The art of the bookbinder is to contrive a garb becoming to the author and to the nature of his work, just as the art of dress is to express in some degree the character and function of the wearer'.19 Pursuing this metaphor, Pène du Bois criticized conservative binders for producing covers that might be used for any book: They are not dress but uniform or livery. They are not the art of bookbinding, but the art of decorating book-covers of leather with marks of ownership or conventional designs'. Instead, he wrote The art of book- binding is the art of creating in the reader, by the composition of the covers of a book, the state of mind desired by the author of the book'.20 Or the reader might respond to a cover that mirrored his state of mind, as did Oscar Wilde's protagonist, Dorian Gray: 'He procured from Paris no less than nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have almost entirely lost control'.21 During this period, two recognized masterpieces of book art raised issues about the meaning or purpose of decorated books. The Kelmscott Press's The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer (1896) is a massive folio of 554 pages. Considered by many bibliophiles, then and now, to be one of the greatest examples of bookmaking ever produced, it represents an impressive achievement of artistic printing. It was laid out in two columns on handmade paper with 13 copies printed on vellum. The volume included 87 woodcuts made from original drawings by Edward Burne-Jones and elaborate initial letters and large border decorations designed by William Morris. Four hundred and twenty- five were published and the run had already sold out be- fore it was completed. T. J. Cobden-Sanderson bound one copy using William Morris's design in white pigskin, with heavily embossed decoration, held with silver clasps. Only the lettering was gilded. Now in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, it is incontestably a magnificent and unwieldy artefact. It cannot be read sitting down and would have to be placed on a lectern, like a Bible, for an entire page to be seen. The text, in heavy black and red gothic type, used a system of spelling 'revised' by a Chaucer scholar, that is neither faithful to Chaucer's own orthography nor is it easily comprehensible to the modern reader. Yet for many, it is a glorious object to be marvelled at and Fig 1 . Histoire des quatre fils Aymon. Paris: H. Launette, 1883. Bound by Henri François Marius Michel.

The binder William Dana Orcutt wrote, 'I have never felt that the Kelmscott volumes were books at all, but were, rather, supreme examples of a master- decorator's taste and skill. After all, a book is made to be read, and the Kelmscott Chaucer is made to be looked at'.22 Similarly, for aesthetes such as the French bibliophile, Gustave Uzanne, it was important that a book cover be a unique creation and like any work of art, it might be ex- hibited in a private room or an art gallery, like a painting or a piece of sculpture. He cited Charles Meunier's cover for Histoire des quatre fils Aymon as a '[mjasterpiece of binding; one of the most beautiful examples of incised leather of this time'.23 The Histoire des quatre fils Aymon was designed by Eugène Grasset and published in Paris by H. Launette, in 1883, a quarto volume of 240 pages [1] [2]. Reproductions of Grasset's watercolours adorned each page, surrounding and sometimes under- lying the text. The paintings were produced by Charles Gillot using 'chromotypography', a new colour litho- graphic process, making it a technological advance in printing and allowing text and graphics to blend in ways never before possible. The text was based on the twelfth- century chanson de geste of Renaut de Montauban, a medieval tale of four brothers at the court of Charlemagne. Charles Marcilly wrote the introduction and notes. Like many books of the time, it was issued in a limited livre de luxe edition and a larger commercial edition. It was a huge undertaking, a technical challenge for Gillot, a long-term commitment for Grasset, and a financial gamble for the publisher. At the outset, the buying public ignored the book but, according to Beraldi, Marius-Michel volunteered to execute fifteen bindings and his former pupil, Charles Meunier, then bound almost forty more. Given Marius Michel's eminence, the public quickly took note and the book became a bestseller. The covers were created with inlaid and painted leathers, evoking a world of medieval warfare and heraldry. Marius-Michel used symbols and stylized ¡mages in a limited space allowing the rich colour of the unadorned leather to predominate. Meunier placed a large harp in the foreground, drawing the viewer through it into symbols of the medieval tale beyond. Neither binder illustrated the material but sought to evoke the spirit of the period. These French and English leather-bound books exemplified the handcrafted objects that provoked one of Thorstein Veblen's mordant diatribes. Veblen derided luxury volumes for their cost and unwieldiness, their barely legible type, exaggerated margins, use of archaic spelling and often uncut pages. In their nostalgic appeal to a pre-industrial, pre-machine aesthetics of limited luxury editions, he wrote that 'the law of conspicuous waste' is fulfilled. That is to say, while the decadent book may be beautiful, the limits within which the designer may work are fixed by requirements of a non-aesthetic kind. The product, if it is beautiful, must also at the same time be costly and ill adapted to its ostensible use'.24 Certainly, the socialist sympathies of the Arts and Crafts proponents were irrecon- cilable with such finely bound books. Cobden-Sanderson loftily dismissed this by saying that no one needed to own many books, 'One or two beautiful things should be enough to live with, and if we limit ourselves to one or two we can gen- erally afford to pay for them'. Yet Ellen Gates Starr's oft quoted statement, 'If I had thought it through, I would have realized that I would be using my hands to create Ellen Mazur Thomson 233</page><page sequence="6">books that only the rich could buy', is at variance with what she herself had written in earlier essays. Starr ac- knowledged what all hand binders took for granted, that her bindery could not produce books for the masses. Handcrafted books, she admitted, 'were very expensive, and the people who most deserve to have choice books, choicely bound, cannot always, or usually have them. That is to be regretted, but it is not the main question in doing any piece of work. The chief question is where [sic] the piece of work itself is worth doing'.25 The relationship between designer, book and owner was potentially closest when the book was hand bound to or- der, but the proliferation of books made this less likely; and even hand binders sold their work through book sellers rather than directly to individuals. Materials and craftsmanship Ideas about craftsmanship in bookbinding took divergent paths during this period, when cloth-bound books domi- nated commercial production and handcrafted books were produced by individuals. Arts and Crafts propon- ents championed high standards of workmanship and the superiority of hand-bound books but they did not wish to give bookbinding the aura of a fine art. They remained committed to the ideal of the artisan-binder working in what Morris called 'the lesser arts'. By con- trast, Marius Michel, Charles Meunier and other binders associated with Art Nouveau asserted the creative and personal contribution of the individual designer while their admirers extolled the less-than-machine-perfection of their art. Traditionally, Moroccan or Niger goatskin had been considered the sine qua non of binding materials and American binders had, perforce, to import their mater- ials from Europe. These leathers were prized for suppleness, durability and the beauty of individual colours and texture. The bibliophile Brander Matthews noted, however, that Americans were more adventurous in the variety of leathers they used for bindings. He deplored this practice for both technical reasons- the tendency of many types of skins to become brittle and tear- and for their lack of suitability: Books bound in alligator, and in sealskin, for example, are to be found in many of the leading bookstores, not always appropriately clad, I regret to remark. There is a hideous incongruity, for instance, in sheathing the wisdom of Emerson in alligator-hide, fit as this scaly substance might be for the weird tales of Poe. Equally horrible is a prayer-book covered with snakeskin; and both of these bibliopegic freaks have been offered to me by tradesmen more enterprising than artistic. But he went on rather jocularly to show he understood the idea of appropriately used material, by endorsing a bearskin cover for a biography of Daniel Boone or a porcupine cover for one of John Ruskin.26 Members of the French avant-garde were certainly not committed to traditional materials and techniques. Octave Uzanne approved, for example, of Charles Meunier's unorthodox practice in refusing to polish the leather, resulting in an Fig 3. Occult Japan; or The Way of the Gods by Percival Lowell.

Author's copy unfinished, handmade look: 'Let's not tolerate only what is well made'. Instead, Uzanne urged the use of non- traditional binding materials to accompany modern designs: metal, ivory, fabrics, enamels and all manner of materials that could be embedded in the cover. Like John Ruskin, Uzanne disparaged mere technical perfection, yet he lauded Marius Michel and Charles Meunier for creating 'binder's bindings', that is, bindings of superb crafts- manship. Uzanne wrote that Marius Michel combined extraordinary craftsmanship with a beautiful new form of decoration but he also praised Meunier, the more radical of the two, for maintaining a middle course between trad- itional craft standards and new forms of design.27 By using all manner of materials, including a large variety of fabrics, while retaining a certain lack of refinement, bookbinding could leave the realm of handicraft and enter the world of fine arts. Pène du Bois wrote: The com- position of the covers of a book may engage the plastic arts, all the fine arts, all the arts of decoration. It had not that liberty ten years ago': The qualities of the expression in the art of book- binding are musical. The art is to create impressions and evoke ¡mages, but by means more complicated and mysterious than the mere representation in conventional or realistic figures in them. It is not by the color of the leather or by a lyre copied at the music-shop that a book of poems may be made expressive in its covers. It is not by copying all the leaves of a tree that the idea of a tree may be communicated to anybody. The covers of a book well bound are decorated in conformity with the subject of the book, the tone adopted, the effect de- sired, richly or gracefully, gaily or with tragic severity. Formerly a book was well bound in leather morocco in a Grolieresque or Le Gasconesque pat- tern. It was as if an edict decreed that a woman shall be well dressed in blue or green velvet. She is well dressed in silk, velvet, damask, stuffs with pompadour flowers, or lily-white lawn, according to the scene wherein she appears, drawing-room, opera, park or library-room. Thus is a book'.28 Relating cover and content with illustration English Arts and Crafts proponents and the progressive leaders of French Art nou- veau shared the ideal of a book in which paper, type, printing, illustration and cover formed a cohesive statement. How to arrive at this unity was problematic. Writers of the period distinguished three approaches to book cover design: pictor- ial, that is, illustrating the subject of the work; symbolic or allusive, 'suggesting the spirit' of the writing; or ornamental, 'pure decoration'. These distinct categories, although widely recognized in formal terms, are not clear in practice. Pure illustration in which a scene from the novel is shown in detail on the coyer is easily identified. But symbolic or allusive designs were often combined with individually illustrated objects or figure. And what appeared to be 'pure' ornament sometimes contained hidden or personal allusions. Furthermore, individual binders necessarily varied their style de- pending on the particular book and on the prospective buyer.29 Publishers, who viewed the cover as an advertising tool, were advocates of illustra- tion that they believed promoted sales. The practice of gluing chromolithographie 235 Ellen M azur Thomson</page><page sequence="8">images onto cloth bindings encouraged this style. Intellectuals of the period shared a fierce antipathy to il- lustration, seeing its use as a challenge to literature and the superiority of the written word. Sarah Whitman despised illustration. She argued that the contents need not be re- flected on the cover- only that the exterior not misrepre- sent the contents. Illustration was for many a symbol of low taste, reducing the art of the cover to a bold commercial, appealing to the uneducated taste of the masses. Cover de- signs were, therefore, carriers of class significance: You are constantly told that the design ought to have some relation to the inside. That is true in a large sense. That is, on a serious book you would not put anything with a merry significance; but do not be led away by the people who want you to put the whole contents on the cover. It is not good art and besides that it is not possible; it cannot be done The pub- lisher is always anxious that it shall be attempted It is almost a wonder that they do not just furnish pictures instead of the printed page. And she concluded, The perpetual illustration of things in a cheap way hopelessly vulgarizes the thing it illustrates'.30 Rather than illustration, Whitman prescribed 'conven- tional art', stylized and abstract forms. She also sug- gested using traditional forms associated with bindings and, as an example, gave the image of a clasp based on the metal ones used in old books- 'not an imitation of the clasp but an allusion to it'. She might have been refer- ring to her own design for Occult Japan (1894) in which a abstract form of a metal clasp is suggested by a highly stylized water lily pad and metal corner reinforcements by simple fan shapes [3]. The images are printed in silver gilt on grey cloth, furthering the tone of restrained elegance, her ideal of a well-designed book. The emphatic two-dimensionality of the design and its asymmetry are in keeping with its Japanese subject. Binding, she said, 'de- mands recognition of the literary significance of books, that a book is to be looked upon as a book, and not like anything else, and that it is to be looked at in such a way that its meanings, its bearings, and its relations to us and our lives shall be deeply understood'.31 Marius Michel also opposed designs that strayed into illustration and, more es- pecially, into the grotesque. He conceded that decoration might be allegorical but not to the point of illustrating the text- no scenes, individual portraits or even human figures, which he asserted would come across as puerile and ridiculous. Only a limited number of objects, those with known allegorical meanings were admissible: lyres, musical instruments, swords and anchors. But these should be used with restraint. He also warned against including objects that appear in the book title. He violated these strictures on occasion, as in his Les oeillets de Kerlaz (The carnations of Kerlaz) [4].32 This cover, however, shows Michel's virtuosity, incising the leather with fluid, natural lines that conjure the flower out of the leather background. Within plain lineal borders, without additional adornment, it is a radically simple statement. The cover comes close to, if it does not achieve, illustration. In her design for Sappho, Starr avoided overt reference to the poet in her use of ornamentation, although on occasion she apparently chose to stylize specific Fig 5.

New York: Macmillan, 1895, p. 136. Author's copy plants she believed to be in keeping with the text [5]. These plant ornaments were created in the Cobden- Sanderson tradition, employing simple stamp forms to build up intricate patterns. Starr did, however, use phrases taken from the author's work as part of her dec- orative scheme, a device that allowed her to attach the cover to the text without resorting to either illustration or symbolism.33 Although she admired the technical virtu- osity of French binders, particularly in their tooling and mastery of leather inlays, Starr denounced the effect of many of their feats: The French binders, though the greatest technicians, especially in tooling, often make the great mistake in taste of attempting representations and illustrations on the covers of books, which is bizarre. An inlaid lady with an inlaid parasol, the dress and parasol of different coloured leathers, tho perfect in technical accu- racy, borders on the outré'. Relating cover and content through colour and symbol The idea that the cover design should express, or in some manner be related to the content of the book, was not new but exactly how this was to be accomplished was a difficult issue for most binders of the day. As early as 1848, the English publisher, Joseph Cundall, had criticized the lack of continuity between the contents of books and their covers. He wrote: 'One of the principles which I would seek to establish in Ornamental Art in Bookbinding is, that every book should be decorated as far as possible in accordance with its contents'. Cundall advised decorators to emphasize a central motif using symbols or emblems fitting the genre of individual books, for example: harps on songbooks, stag's head on hunting stories, religious iconogra- phy on religious tracts, classical motifs for Greek or Roman history or architecture. Following contemporary practice, he praised the use of colour coding to identify the category to which a particular book belonged: 'poetry books should be red or light green, or blue'. 'In the British Museum', he noted, 'Books of Divinity are bound in blue, History in red, Poetry in yellow, and Biography in olive coloured leather. This is an excellent plan in a large library'.34 Marius Michel challenged the generalization inherent in Cundall's scheme. The idea that the book cover must express its content, that it should evoke the partic- ular sensibility of the author and his work, was the central theme of his L'ornementation des reliures modernes and of his life's work. He set out to show how binding design could conjure the spirit of the individual text and could only do so by abandoning stock symbols and broad categories. The binder's first decision, he wrote, was to choose the background colour. Michel dismissed the idea that the association of particular colours with genres of work was in any sense meaningful. In France, blue bindings had been used for poetry, red for the classics and lemon yellow for erotica. But such gross categories cannot be expressive because poetic expression is intensely individual. Colour choice depends on the particular poet and the particular shade of blue. 'Lamartine', he maintained, 'is not Baudelaire'. For Balzac's Eugénie Grandet, Marius Michel thought thai intense, vibrant colours were out of place. Instead, he suggested using brown leather and simple incised lines, with little or no gilding. On the other hand, Victor Hugo's Orientales called for strong blues, intense oranges, pure green inlays and gold gilding to evoke this poet's vision. He warned that allusions to historical styles had to be used with care. The story of Victor Hugo's novel, Notre Dame de Paris, could be suggested using Ellen Mazur Thomson 237</page><page sequence="10">Gothic ornamentation but for books on modern subjects such allusions were not appropriate.35 The American critic Ernest North castigated French bind- ings for what he claimed to be 'symbolism run mad'. It seems', he wrote, 'as though the artists were trying to give the entire contents and story of the book on the cover, without the necessity of obliging one to purchase the book at all'.36 It was a conundrum. Will Bradley, the American graphic artist and himself a successful cover designer, wrote, There is one characteristic of book cover decoration that sets it apart in degree, if not in kind, from most other departments of decorative design, and that is the extent to which it tends to assume symbolic significance'.37 Beyond its protective function, if the cover must acknowledge the contents of the writer's work and if it were not to do so pictorially, the designer must resort to symbolism. Cobden-Sanderson's 'allusive symbolism' The anonymous writer who contributed an essay for the Grolier Club's 1894 exhibition attempted to describe the ideal cover. He believed the colour of the cloth must in some degree relate to the 'general character of the book', that gold-leaf was universally appropriate and the designer might borrow from older designs and combine them with modern ones but he must avoid sym- bolism. 'Pure ornament', he concluded, is best.38 Cobden-Sanderson bindings- some dense and elaborate, others understated and restrained and almost austere- were stunningly elegant and luxurious and many were purely ornamental. He was quite clear that the designer had to be familiar with the books he chose to bind and that the binding decoration would in some measure reflect its content. Rejecting both illustration and traditional symbol systems, Cobden-Sanderson wrote of 'allusive symbolism' as the most desirable kind of decoration, although neither he nor his pupils were consistent in practice. In an interview published in The Studio in 1893, he was asked if individual books should be given 'symbolic designs' and he replied: Certainly not- if, indeed you mean that a design for a book-cover must always be a sort of allegorical epitome of the aims of the book. Some subtle relation there may be, and, I think, should be, between the inside and the outside of a book, between its contents and its ornamentation, and, in my opinion no one can produce a right design for a book who knows nothing about the book. The book must itself, in some sort of co- operation with the designer, dictate its own decoration. Still the relation is not a definite one, not should it make itself too plainly felt in the design. It should not be intrusive or too visible. In a word, it should not be allegor- ical or emblematical.39 Cobden-Sanderson's decoration of Karl Marx's Le Capital shows how far he was willing to go in ignoring the subject or tone of the text. Here he created an elegant dense floral pattern that forms a brilliant, rich surface with absolutely no hint of the subject. He was criticized for this work by his contemporaries, not for the stylistic discontinuity between cover and text but for 'the want of fitness in giving such a binding to such a vulgar, double-columned piece of printing'.40 Fig 7.

Courtesy of the Pierpont Morgan Library PML 7242, New York At the other extreme, Cobden-Sanderson used simplified maritime images on several bindings. The Life and Death of Jason is covered in dark blue morocco leather, with gilded images of ships, birds and waves in an informal but generally symmetrical format [6]. Diverging from his usual practice, he draw rather than stamped these images, and unlike the symmetrical, highly stylized ornaments that decorate of most of his work, the imagery here is more personal and direct. Marianne Tidcombe, a modern spe- cialist on the designer's career, insists the imagery was symbolic ratherthan illustrative, representing a Voyage through life', rather than a scene from the text.41 On a few occasions Cobden-Sanderson described how he arrived at his design for a particular book. His state- ments show that he thought of 'allusive' design as a kind of personal symbolism created for a particular text [7]. In his journal entry for 29 July 1888 he wrote: I should like here to commemorate that in de- signing the pattern for Atalanta in Calydon I had from the first, from long ago, the desire to express the ideas of a brand burning, and of swiftness, and with these I afterwards, by accident, mixed up the ideas of the green of the open country of Calydon, and the stability of hearts combined with a flick- ering, flame-like movement. On the inside I shall seek by the stars to express the supervening still- ness, the immensity which abides when passion is spent, and even when passion is at its height. He told designer Herbert Home that a dream led him to create: the pattern of the cover, and came out, as will be seen, in the decoration. For the flame I used a seed-pod, which I had ready at hand and for the leaves a quivering heart, and I blent them together in the form of a brand that burst on fire, as a branch bursts into flower, and I set them torch-wise around the margins of the green cover, green for the young life burning away.42 He surrounded these forms with a dense golden net of floral motifs. Similarly, in his binding for Poems by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Cobden-Sanderson used lines taken from one poem in the collection, The Blessed Damozel': 'She had three lilies in her hand, And the stars in her hair were seven' [8]. He tooled and gilded three images of lilies and of seven stars as well as repeating the initial 'R' (for Rossetti) on the four sides in the centre of his composition.43 In using this ap- proach, he was adhering to the principle that decoration should suggest the meaning of the object it enclosed and avoid 'illustration' or trite symbolism. Allusive design allowed the binder to create graphics that referred to the literary contents in an understated manner, even at the risk of obscurity. Plant motifs and the language of flowers In general, ornamental book cover designs were not identifiable with one country or one era. Interlacing ribbon patterns dating from eighth-century Egypt, for ex- ample, or mandorla (almond-shaped forms) from Turkish and Iranian rug designs could be found on covers from Venice, France and England during the Renaissance.44 239 Ellen Mazur Thomson</page><page sequence="12">These patterns continued to be used in Europe and America throughout the nineteenth cen- tury. In England, A. W. N. Pugin, John Ruskin, Owen Jones and Christopher Dresser focused on ornament as a separate and significant as- pect of the arts. Ornament was more than an addition to form; it was a statement about the natural world. They argued that whereas those who created naturalistic images merely copied nature without intellectual effort, those who designed ornament had to use their knowledge and imagination to reveal basic underlying structures.45 Jones and Dresser explored pos- sible morphologies of ornament, formulating general principles or rules governing their use. 'Principles' of plant growth, gleaned from the nineteenth-century's understanding of botany, held that the conventionalized plant forms re- vealed structures of organic life. From this idea developed systems of stylization, geometry and flatness. Owen Jones' famous Proposition 13 in Grammar of Ornament (1856) proclaimed: 'Flowers or other natural objects should not be used as ornaments, but conventional represen- tations founded upon them sufficiently sugges- tive to convey the intended ¡mage to the mind, without destroying the unity of the object they are employed to decorate. Universally obeyed in the best periods of art, equally violated when Art declines'.*6 Jones was interested in the formal quality of plants and their use in 'decorative schemes', not their literary symbolism. An alternative system of use of ornament, the 'language of flowers', arrived in Europe from Turkey early in the nineteenth century. Although it had origi- nally been a system of memorization, by the latter part of the century it was trans- formed. 'Language of flower' books were extremely popular. Slim volumes containing poems, illustrations and long lists of plant and flower names with their symbolic meanings were best sellers in Europe and America. There was no universally ac- cepted set of meanings- individual flowers might signify an idea or emotion based on specific characteristics of the plant or its historical or literary associations.47 Designers, most notably Emile Gallé, embraced the idea of flowers as physical sym- bols that evoked human emotions. The moral expression of plants is thus solely symbolic', he wrote, but the artist can use plant forms with their symbolic meaning to create great suggestive power. He gave as an example, the thistle, heraldic sym- bol of his own region of Lorraine, whose form also expressed uprightness and bravery. The plant form, he wrote, can be used to create 'what Baudelaire called "the language of flowers and mute things'". ('Le langage des fleurs et des choses muettes')48 Marius Michel was the premier advocate of 'la flore dite ornementale' that is the use of flower forms, neither conventionalized nor realistic but incised in flowing, organic lines. Like his English counterparts, he warned that in the applied arts, the designer must avoid illustration and instead select flower and leaf forms with clear contours and silhouettes, simplifying and exaggerating to give the motif character, instructed by the logic of its construction so that it looks as if it might Fig 9.

The illustration here is typical of Michel's work in this style, made up of large sinuous curves, elegant and complex, showing off a technical mastery of coloured inlays [9]. These compositions earned Michel acclaim as a master of modern yet classical bindings. Marius Michel wrote of the need to create an ideal type and keep the colours as they appear in nature. (Substituting a blood red periwinkle for a blue one will trouble the viewer.) Although he quoted Owen Jones in other contexts, he recommended using plants as they are found in nature even when they function as symbols. He wrote about the appropriate use of oak leaves and laurels for poetry, history and novels expressing patriotism and military ideals, and the use of ivy, grape leaves and roses for stories, songs, and poetry about love and conviviality. But he denied that this was 'the language of flowers', asserting instead that the designer could evoke the text by following the natural plant forms.49 Charles Meunier designed with a very different temperament and was more closely reflective of the subversive impulse seen elsewhere during the period in the work of Aubrey Beardsley and Gustave Moreau. As noted above, some binders of the Ellen Mazur Thomson 241</page><page sequence="14">Fig 11. 'Some eccentricities by Meunier'. Books bound by Charles Meunier. Reproduced in Sarah Prideaux. Bookbinders and Their Craft. New York: Charles Scribner's, 1903, p. 147. Author's copy period used the symbolic power assigned to particular flowers to impart meaning to their covers, but Mercier combined emblems, common symbols and illustra- tions of common objects, animals and insects, in a single cover to convey the meaning of the text. He used specific flowers to illustrate literary ideas: the tulip symbolized pride; the poppy: dreams; marguerites: chastity; lily: splendor; orchid: vice; blue flax: innocence; and the black lily: poisonous dreams. The flower has been the taproot of the modern imagination', Meunier proclaimed [10]. 'Consciously or unconsciously, the symbol describes, gives life to the work, it is its soul'. In one of his many covers for Baudelaire's Fleurs de mal, Meunier used the iris, a flower associated with death (because Iris, the Greek goddess, was said to have trans- ported women's souls to the underworld), and he used poppies on the spine, sym- bols of dreams and perhaps opium-induced visions. Another of Meunier's cover for Fleurs de mal featured a skeleton in a garden with leaves growing out of its finger bones. Yet even when he limited himself to floral decoration his twisting, restless lines endowed them with a sense of perverse energy. Meunier was a con- troversial figure: some historians and bibliophiles criticized him for his conflation of disparate imagery, for his love of the grotesque, in short, for bad taste [11]. Like the Symbolists, he tried to redefine visual language, aiming to communicate the macabre through suggestion, allusion and association. Like Baudelaire he may have believed that 'beauty is always bizarre'.50 Despite the intensity with which the use of plant ornament was debated at the turn of the century its dominance faded soon after. By 1909, Will Bradley sug- gested that floral motifs had been overused and dismissed the idea that book ornament must find inspiration in the natural world or in conventional ideas of beauty. He proposed designs based on mundane objects used in a rhythmic manner. Even 'trolley cars and golf balls' could be reformed, refashioned or in some manner conventionalized into inventive and interesting decoration [12]. 51 More significantly, modernist critics criticized floral decoration as superficial or as a means to camouflage the poor quality of the form or the structure it covered. Christopher Dresser had believed ornament to be emblematic of a culture or 242 Aesthetic Issues in Book Cover Design</page><page sequence="15">¿^"""""""""T Tä TT7t_T^'f lf^ir'- period, that it communicated social and cultural values. /il wjm jj/Yt/l^ rjj^Mj^^N^r^^r But as industrialization increased over the course of i gj ^^0^f¿yy/¡XH AKQLDJJl^fcffff e t'ie n'neteentn century, the meaning of floral decora- K^^^rf™¥(^'T^r*T?rTfo ^HM^yi e t'on was rec'ucec' to concerns about economics, specifi- W*^T^V íf^(^il-JM^ r ' f^jiLy cally about marketing.

The binding might pay homage to the author or introduce the reader to the author's words, in some manner enhancing the language of the text. Or it could, and sometimes did, overpower the text entirely, and become an object of very great beauty quite apart from its contents. Owners of these books, whether hand or machine bound, might find pleasure in their decoration and display them as a measure of their own tastes and values. Although a limited number of traditional compositions with their emphatic symmetry and symbolic heraldry were no longer the only signs of good taste and value, the aesthetics of binding at the fin-de-siècle never coalesced into a rigid set of precepts. Bookbinders experimented with a variety of materials and all manner of composition made possible by the new relationship that mass production cre- ated between objects and their possessors. They strove to create a new aesthetic vocabulary that would allow them to redefine the relationship of the book to con- sumers, to make it more personal and to give pleasure and delight. Mass produc- tion meant many more objects were affordable for a larger part of the population, but it also raised questions about the degradation of popular taste, now easily ma- nipulated by advertising. Like other machine-made objects, the flood of books pro- voked questions about consumer culture and an aesthetic vocabulary better suited to mass production. From that point on, the book cover became another com- modity, seen primarily as a form of advertisement, which it shortly became.

After an intense period of apprenticeship and practice, he opened the Doves Bindery in 1893 in Hammersmith, London and in 1900 the Doves Press. Following Arts and Craft ¡deals, Cobden-Sanderson worked on each binding from beginning- or almost (his wife did the initial sewing) to the final decoration. After completing 200 volumes, he relinquished most of the process to his four em- ployees and apprentices, and focused on the final decoration. Cobden-Sanderson was closely associated with William Morris and his workshops were organized and driven by Morris's polit- ical and moral beliefs. 11 Marius Michel was the name used both by Jean Michel (1821- 1890) and by his son, Henri François (1846-1925), distinguished Parisian bookbinders. The elder was considered to be a master craftsman but it was Henri François who revolutionized modern bookbinding both by the example of his work and by his writings, particularly L'ornementation des reliures moderne.

Cundall, who wrote and lectured on the history of bindings, especially cloth binding, was also con- cerned that nineteenth-century binding decorators were still in thrall to their fifteenth-century predecessors. Although he praised many examples of their work, Cundall was not happy that binders continued to use 'revival patterns' for works on totally different subjects. He advocated a renewal of binding that would give the present day its own unique style. It is noteworthy that Cobden- Sanderson, when he began his apprenticeship, read Cundall's Art of bookbindings.
