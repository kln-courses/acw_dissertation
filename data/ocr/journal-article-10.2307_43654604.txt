It identifies three main sources for this concept: the Western category of 'art', the idea of evolution and the notion of primitive. This article shows how the traditional conception of 'Palaeolithic art' is a particular case of the wider idea of 'primitive art', a category that was bom as an attempt to harmonise the notion of 'primitive society' and the nineteenth-century bourgeois concept of 'art'. Additionally, I discuss this traditional conception as the source of a number of ideas that have persisted in our way of interpreting Palaeolithic images until recently, including the understand- ing of prehistoric images through the lens of the modem notion of 'art', their interpretation in symbolic-religious terms and their formal definition based on the idea of naturalism. Keywords Art • Evolution • History of archaeology • Palaeolithic art • Primitive Introduction Palaeolithic representations arouse great interest among both archaeologists and the general public. We traditionally refer to these graphic depictions as 'Palaeolithic art', a term used amongst prehistorians and which was traditionally considered as a neutral category. However, in the last years, an increasing number of authors have put into question this neutrality (e.g. Conkey 1987, p. 413; Layton 1991, p. 23; Moro and González Morales 2007; Nowell 2006; Soffer and Conkey 1997, pp. 2-3; Tomášková 1997, pp. 268-269; White 2003, p. 20).

This cultural projection onto Palaeolithic images is also evident in the constant application of Western aesthetic ideas (such as beauty, proportion, perspective and so on) to their description, in their formal characterisation based on the idea of naturalism, the tendency to unify them according to the notion of style and the ambiguity generated between their exclusively aesthetic appreciation and their apparent symbolic-religious dimension. In fact, many of these traits (formal naturalism, symbolic-religious meaning...) have persisted, re- interpreted to a greater or lesser extent, as elements delimiting Palaeolithic representa- tions (e.g. Breuil 1907, pp. 372-378, 1935, pp. 115-118, 1952, pp. 21-41; Cartailhac and Breuil 1906, pp. 145-225; Delporte 1990, pp. 61-74 and pp. 225-247; Graziosi 1956, pp. 22-111; Laming-Emperaire 1962, pp. 147-294; Leroi Gourhan 1964, pp. 79-144, 1965, pp, 75-128 and pp. 145-159; Lorblanchet 1999, pp. 251-272, 2010, pp. 431-439; Reinach 1903; Vialou 1984, pp. 479-483, 1991, pp. 344-379). In this paper, I seek to examine the origins and theoretical roots of the concept of 'Palaeolithic art' in the context of late nineteenth and early twentieth century archae- ology. In particular, I identify three main roots of this concept: the Western category of 'art', the idea of 'evolution' and the notion of 'primitive'. Additionally, I evaluate the extrapolation of values and ideas belonging to our Western aesthetic tradition to the understanding of Palaeolithic images. I focus on two main points. In the first place, I examine in depth the scientific context in which the concept of 'Palaeolithic art' emerged. This concept originated in intellectual circles, which inherited the great controversies of the mid-nineteenth century, such as the debate on the antiquity of humankind, the condition of 'savage' people, the dispute between evolutionist and degenerationist and the conflict between science and religion. These debates were articulated around different ideas and theories, which formed a complex ideological and scientific background, as they included opposing explanations about the origin and condition of human beings and varied speculation about cultural evolution. It was, therefore, a heterogeneous reality in two senses. On the one hand, diachronical- ly, because in the second half of the nineteenth century, the ideas held about the life of Palaeolithic humans changed, and on the other hand, synchronically, because at the same time, different theoretical conceptions and scientific explanations co-existed. In the second place, I discuss the creation of the concept of 'Palaeolithic art' in the light of the idea of 'primitive art', another term that has played a central role in the history of anthropology (Claerhout 1965; Haselberger 1961; Price 2001). The concept of 'primitive art' was consolidated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (1890-1906) as a result of the fructiferous dialogue among archaeologists, anthro- pologists, historians and art critics, in which the idea of 'primitive society' (Hsu 1964; Kuper 1988) and the nineteenth century notion of 'art' (Kristeller 1952; Shiner 2004, pp. 119-302; Tatarkiewicz 1971) were confronted and synthesised in a forced amalgam. Indeed, in intellectual circles marked by Fin de Siècle decadence and anxiety, the subjectivity of symbolism and primitivist mysticism (Berman 1982, pp. 15-36; Dagen 1998; Denvir 2001, pp. 73-108; Everdell 1997, pp. 1-12; Mosse 1988, pp. 219-236; Weber 1986, pp. 142-158), prehistorians and anthropologists held on to a slightly qualified version of the positive mid-nineteenth century message: Reason and science were able to explain and order the world. Hence, it attempted to submit Ô Springer</page><page sequence="3">684 Palacio-Pérez the variety and complexity of the 'non-civilised' world to its overarching and logically ordered system. Out of this unifying thought was born the concept of 'primitive art'. This term sought to include all the formal and symbolic diversity of the representations made by the so-called 'savages', as well as the essence and origins of art. The study of Palaeolithic depictions was finally swallowed up by this general category of 'primitive art'. In this way, the concept of 'Palaeolithic art' was born as a branch of the trunk-idea of 'primitive art'. In short, I examine the concept of 'Palaeolithic Art' as a mental representation that researchers constructed out of an ensemble of material remains they discovered and studied. I examine how certain archaeological evidence was apprehended according to the conceptual, methodological, cultural and ideological structures at the time (Schlanger and Nordbladh 2008, p. 1), attempting to fill 'the gap between empirical finding and meaningful discovery ' (Schlanger 2002, p. 127). However, in order to go beyond an intellectual history of archaeology (Trigger 2001, p. 631), I have aimed to situate this small fragment of it in its socio-political context (Shanks and Tilley 1992). Concepts with a universalistic and profoundly ethnocentric vocation such as 'art', 'evolution' and 'primitive' have been understood as part of a scientific-ideological symbiosis which accompanied and fed back upon Western domination over the rest of the world (Hall 2001; Shepherd 2002; Schlanger 2003), supported by imperialist expansion (Diaz-Andreu 2007, pp. 278-316; Trigger 1980, 1984) and the interests and taste of the upper-middle classes (Kehoe 1992). Perception of Prehistoric Humans Between 1870 and First Years of Twentieth Century: A Heterogeneous Context Prehistory developed in Europe during the second half of the nineteenth century. It was a complex process in which the discipline had to define its object of study and furnish itself with its own institutional framework. On the intellectual level, Prehistory was bom with the recognition of the antiquity of humankind (Grayson 1983; Pautrat 2011; Richard 2008, pp. 45-78; Trigger 2006, pp.138-146; Van Riper 1993, pp. 44-183). Once this fact was admitted, two questions were fundamental: the debate on the origin of humans and the explanation of our biological and cultural evolution (Coye 1997, pp. 78-180; Daniel 1988, pp. 22-59; O'Connor 2007, pp. 73-130; Richard 2008, pp. 165-195; Trigger 2006, pp. 147-156). However, this development in the realm of ideas was accompanied by the creation of institutions that would allow the discipline to develop and guarantee its ideological legitimacy in the socio-political context of the time. Scientific societies, specialist sections in science academies and museums, international conferences and journals appeared to discuss and disseminate the ideas and evidence available about prehistoric humans (Goodrum 2009; Murray 2008; Richard 1992, 2008, pp. 93-1 10). Similarly, another point that is clear from the time of the first Congrès internationaux d'archeologie et d'anthropologie préhistor- ique in 1866 is the international nature of these debates. They often involved the participation of leading figures from different countries who maintained very close contacts, such as Gabriel de Mortillet (France), Édouard Desor (Switzerland), Karl Vogt (Germany) or John Evans (Great Britain) (Kaeser 2001, 2002; Richard 2008, pp. 97-102). However, from 1860 onwards France played a leading role, as it acted as a Ô Springer</page><page sequence="4">Origins of the Concept of 'Palaeolithic Art' 685 model of institutional development and the main centre for the discussion of ideas about Palaeolithic archaeology (Richard 2008, pp. 102-106). In this context, scientific disputes were sustained between different ways of seeing human nature and biological and cultural evolution, which was transcendent in the conceptualisation of Palaeolithic graphic expression. These discussions were not isolated from the clash between religion and science, nor from different political alternatives or the power games played out within the institutions devoted to prehis- toric research. Fixists and Evolutionists: Two Ways of Understanding Human Nature In the last years of the nineteenth century, the scientific community debated the origins and nature of humans intensely. I focus now on the situation in France for two main reasons. First, French Prehistory set the pace both in debates on Palaeolithic archaeology and in the creation of institutions where they took place (Richard 2008, pp. 97-110; Trigger 2006, pp. 147-156). Second, it was in France where the first reactions and interpretations of Palaeolithic art arose as a consequence of the first evidence found in the Dordogne, not only portable art (Lartet and Christy 1864) but also parietal representations (Capitan and Breuil 1901a, b). The controversies about the origin and evolution of human beings did not only have a scientific dimension but also an ideological and political aspect, as they involved a confrontation with the problem of 'human nature'. The main clash occurred between traditionalist Christian ideology and the 'free-thinkers' favouring evolutionism or transformisme (a term that often used in France to refer to the theories supporting the biological evolution of the species). However, the reality was much more complex. Between the poles of the most radical Christian authors who did not accept the antiquity of humankind and the most belligerent anti-clerical evolutionists, there were many intermediate attitudes. Similarly, among Christian authors, it is necessary to differentiate between Catholics and Protestants, or between clergy and laymen (Defiance- Jublot 2011; Richard 2008, pp. 137-139). In first place, there was a fixist tendency that support creationist proposals and defend a single origin and nature of the human species. This position was supported by authors like E. Lartet, A. de Quatrefages, M. Sanson and the first prehistorian clerics, like L. Bourgeois and J. Delaunay. Fixist theories aimed to explain the origin of the different species through divine, unique and simultaneous creation, as Henri de Blainville (1816) proposed, or by successive creations and extinctions, taking place after great catastrophes, as maintained above all by Georges Cuvier (1812). These explanations stated that species would conserve the same forms as when they were created. This fixism, whose roots were in the Bible, was not opposed to organic progression, but to any transformation of one species into another, and therefore, the creation of each type implied its extinction when conditions became unfavourable (Blanckaert 1999; Pelayo 1991, pp. 39^46). In second place, there were a number of authors in favour of evolutionism. These followed the ideas formulated by Lamarck (1809) and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1830) in the first half of the nineteenth century, or later theories published in On the Origin of Species by C. Darwin (1859), and Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature by T.H. Huxley (1863). Despite their differences, all the evolutionist theories proposed the Ô Springer</page><page sequence="5">686 Palacio-Pérez idea of a continual transformation of living creatures, based on the change of some species into others. After 1860, two trends began to split off amongst the supporters of evolutionism in French anthropology (Wartelle 2004, p. 131). A first group was formed around the doctor and anthropologist Paul Broca (Blankaert 1989), the founder of La Société d'Anthropologie de Paris (1858) and promoter of the institutional complex that was founded around it, with Le Laboratoire d'Anthropologie (1868), L'École d'Anthropologie (1872) and Le Musée d'Anthropo- logie (1872). Authors like P. Topinard, T. Hamy and M. Boule sided with Broca. This group was moved by the positivist ideal and characterised by the search for precise evidence in the fossil record showing the transformation of animal species, rather than the drafting of great explanatory theories about the causes for it. They main- tained a skeptical, but moderate, posture towards fixist proposals. The main channels for the dissemination of their ideas were the Bulletins et Mémoires de La Société d'Anthropologie de Paris and the Revue d'Anthropologie founded in 1872. A second group consisted of the supporters of 'scientific materialism'. 'Scientific materialists' were committed to the proposal of eliminating all ideas of divine plans about the development of life and the appearance of human beings. They included such outstanding personalities as G. de Mortillet, L. A. Bertillon, A. Hovelacque and C. Letourneau. They were the firmest supporters of evolutionism, both Darwinist and neo-Lamarckian theories. They were all strongly committed politically to French Republican ideals and, naturally, were fervent fighters against Catholicism and any force they considered reactionary (Richard 1989, pp. 234-237). 'Scientific materialists' gained support in various scientific institutions, especially after the Republican success in October 1877, and after the death of Paul Broca in 1880, they achieved hegemony in French anthropo- logical and prehistoric science (Wartelle 2004, pp. 140-155). This line of thought was mainly based on a materialist conception of the universe, defined experimental science as the only way to access knowledge and accused metaphysics of being the main enemy of the truth. Any explanation of the world that resorted to immaterial beings was violently contested. Their anti-religious and anti-clerical position radi- calised the opposition between scientific knowledge and religion and widened the gap between fixists and evolutionists. These researchers used as the main vehicles for the transmission of their ideas two journals launched by G. de Mortillet: Les Matériaux pour l'Histoire positive et philosophique de l'Homme , founded in 1 864, and later the journal L'Homme , active between 1884 and 1887 (Richard 1989). Also important in the dissemination of their ideas were Dictionnaire des sciences anthropologiques , published in parts from 1881 to 1889 (Hecht 2003, pp. 97-102), and the collection Bibliothèque des sciences contemporaines edited by C. Reinwald, which included Le Préhistorique by G. de Mortillet (1883). Clearly, the antagonist approaches of fixists and evolutionists fed very different conceptions about human nature. The fixists imagined primitive humans created with all their intellectual and moral capacities: ' Man is not an animal He is widely distinguished from animals by numerous and important characters. I shall here only refer to his intellectual superiority ; to which belongs articulate speech [...] the fine arts, by the aid of which he conveys, and, in some sort, materializes the conceptions of his imagination. But he is distinguished from all animals by two fundamental characters which pertain only to him. Man is the only one among organized and â Springer</page><page sequence="6">Origins of the Concept of 'Palaeolithic Art' 687 living beings who has the abstract sentiment of good and evil ; in him alone, consequently, exist moral sense. He is also alone in the belief that there will be something after this life, and in the recognition of a Supreme Being, who can influence his life for good or for evil' (Quatrefages 1875, p. 9). This evidently clashed with the transformist idea of a primitive human as an intermediate stage between the great apes and Homo sapiens , solely acquiring physical and mental attributes that would lead it to become the ideal of civilised man. In this respect, biological and cultural evolution would often be confused in the discourse and ideas that developed about the cultural and social life of Palaeolithic people, which fluctuate between the two extremes separating animal life from what was regarded as human. Thus, supporters of the fixist doctrine believed that the aspects that differentiated humans from the other animals were certain intellectual abilities that were regarded as superior: religion and morality (e.g. Quatrefages 1877, 1896, p. 12), whereas the 'scientific materialists' (e.g. De Mortillet 1883, p. 476; Hovelacque 1877, p. 39; Royer 1870, pp. 205-256) and some of the positivists (e.g. Broca 1866, p. 53) maintained that intellectual complexity, religious feelings and a moral sense were not part of humanity from its beginnings, but were secondary and later traits in their historical evolution. Artistic ability was obviously one of those intellectual traits that evolutionists thought were 'superior', and it was therefore very doubtful that it could have existed among the earliest humans or at least it could not have appeared with the same level of complexity as in modern humans. On the contrary, according to flxists, Palaeolithic art was the proof that demonstrated the unvarying nature of human beings as a result of a single act of divine creation. However, in the last decade of the nineteenth century, the conflict between science and religion abated, and a more tolerant and less radical state of opinion gradually developed. Three key aspects influenced the creation of this new situation: 1. The Catholic Church, with the encyclical Providentissimus Deus by Leo XIII (1893), considered that a new relationship between science and the Holy Scrip- tures was needed. This produced a more participative attitude in scientific studies in order to adapt them to Catholic dogma. As a resuit, liberal Christians became interested in prehistoric research and the tempered dissemination of evolutionist ideas. Thus, it was frequent for Catholic archaeologists, like Marqués de Nadail- lac, Ernest d'Arcy and Adrien Arcellin, to contribute to the journal L'Anthropo- logie (Defrance-Jublot 2005, pp. 76-78). In tum, Father Jean Guibert, director of the Department of Natural Sciences at the Seminar of Saint-Sulpice, published Les Origines , questions d'apologétique the first handbook on Prehistory for seminarians in France. This first generation of Catholic prehistorians, who died in 1904-1905, would be followed by a new group formed by Henri Breuil, Jean Bouyssonie and the German Hugo Obermaier, whose contribution to the under- standing of Prehistory would be decisive in the first half of the twentieth century. 2. 'Scientific materialism' would be severely criticised by postivists. 'Scientific materialism' would enter a period of decline in the 1890s, to a large extent a victim of its own contradictions. The main traits, often attributed to Catholics (intransigence, dogmatism and intolerance) were re-aimed against the scientific Ô Springer</page><page sequence="7">688 Palacio-Pérez materialists (Defřance-Jublot 2005, p. 79). The death of the leading proponents, like A. Hovelacque (1896), G. de Mortillet (1898) and C. Letourneau (1902) was equally decisive (Wartelle 2004, p. 146). 3. The positivist group, headed by P. Topinard, M. Boule, L. Capitan and E. Cartailhac, succeeded in creating a different framework of relationships, thanks to the redefinition of a new scientific orthodoxy for prehistory based on the principle of neutrality (Defrance-Jublot 2005, p. 81). In short, this group believed that anthropologists and prehistorians should be satisfied with discussing the evidence they were studying and its most immediate causes, without being concerned with the original or more remote causes, which they thought belonged to the realm of the unprovable and speculation: ''Many true scientists are content with researching the secondary causes of the phenomena they are studying. They consider that concerning themselves with the primary causes and reaching the ultimate questions is not their business. Thus they take refuge voluntarily in prudent agnosticism. Others resort to the hypothesis provided by the different philosophical and religious systems ' (Boule 1896: 330). In this way, the great religious, philosophical and political questions were left on the fringe of scien- tific reasoning. The idea of neutrality relaxed the confrontation between Christian and scientific materialists, as long as they left their beliefs and ideologies on the side of scientific debate, at least in appearance. This allowed a new generation of Catholic authors (as H. Breuil, H. Obermaier and J. Bouyssonie) to be recognised without the suspicion of other prehistorians. The climate of consented tolerance and neutrality allowed the debates on the spiritual life of primitive humans, based on funerary remains and art, to be undertaken in a relaxed atmosphere with fewer ideological antagonisms. This was importance for the acceptance of the antiquity of rock paintings and engravings in the first years of the twentieth centuiy and the redefinition of Palaeolithic graphics in symbolic-religious terms. Palaeolithic Human: 'Savage' or 'the Good Savage' There were different opinions not only about the biological nature of human beings but also about their social and cultural life. Indeed, the cultural reality of prehistoric people was considered in accordance with different sensibilities. These swung be- tween socio-cultural evolutionism and primitivist fantasy. Cultural Evolutionist and the Discovery of the Palaeolithic Mind Since the eighteenth century, European evolutionist thought had been constructing a concept-type of 'primitive society', founded on the idea of progress and the opposi- tion between civilised and uncivilised humans. In the last third of the nineteenth century, two main lines appeared in evolutionist anthropological theory. One of these was social, with a clear materialist character, which emphasised the knowledge of kinship, technology and ways of subsistence. The other was cultural or intellectual, which was concerned with the study of beliefs and the evolution of religions. Thus, whereas for social evolutionists, the 'savage' was a hunter dominated by instinct, promiscuous and nomadic, for cultural evolutionists, the 'savage' was a kind of â Springer</page><page sequence="8">Origins of the Concept of 'Palaeolithic Art' 689 speculator who sought explanations for the mysteries of nature and existence through religion and magic (Stocking 1987, pp. 208-228). This idea of 'primitive society' was transferred to Prehistory through ethnographic analogy. This kind of analogy has its roots on the supposition that prehistoric life could be illustrated by the present through the descriptions of contemporary 'savages'. For this resource to be understood as a legitimate procedure, it was necessary to accept certain principles (Bowler 1992; Murray 1992, 2001, pp. 32-37; Pautrat 2000, pp. 149-151): 1. In accordance with the idea of a constant progress in the 'human spirit', it was understood that populations that were more remote, geographically and cultural- ly, from Europeans reflected older stages of society, closer to the origins. 2. This implied accepting a 'psychic unity' amongst all human groups, equally capable of producing similar responses to the same needs. 3. The analogical method also found justification in the uniformitarianism professed by geologists. The idea that the evolution of the Earth and life could be explained by similar processes to the ones existing now created the mirage that everything past, included the human past, could be illustrated by the present. 4. In the same way, Archaeology was inspired by the fossil concept developed by Geology and Palaeontology. If we could understand extinct species thanks to contemporary animals, the tools of 'savages' equally explained the prehistoric remains found in Europe. The ethnographic analogy therefore produced a mutual reflection between the past and the present. The 'savage' illustrated the life of prehistoric humans, but in the same way, the evidence of the existence of Prehistory converted the 'savage' in a survivor of the past, a living fossil. This way of reasoning marked the evolutionist perception that late-nineteenth century prehistorians held of Palaeolithic hunters (e.g. Dupont 1872, pp. 10-11; Evans 1870, p. 9; Hamy 1870, pp. 22-23; Lubbock 1870, p. 1) and persisted in the first decades of the twentieth century, with authors like E. Solías (1911), who drew elaborate parallels between four contemporary hunting societies and their prehistoric forebears: Tasma- nians were equalled to Acheuleans, Australians to Mousterians, Bushmen to Aurig- nacians and Eskimos to Magdalenians. In a first stage, which could be dated around 1860 and 1885, authors like G. de Mortillet and J. Lubbock draw a rather rough picture of Palaeolithic humans. The hunter 'is neither free nor noble; he is a slave to his own wants , his own passions; imperfectly protected from the weather, he suffers from the cold by night and the heat of the sun by day; ignorant of agriculture , living by the chase, and improvident in success, hunger always stares him in the face, and often drives him to the dreadful alternative of cannibalism or death ' (Lubbock 1865, p. 484). Gabriel de Mortillet described the Magdalenian people as starving nomads in constant pursuit of the herds of animals (De Mortillet 1883, pp. 476-478). However, if need was seen as the main trait of the material existence of the hunter, slowness and simpleness were the unmistakeable attributes of his intellectual life: ' that our earliest ancestors could have counted to ten is very improbable, considering that so many races now in existence cannot get beyond four ' (Lubbock 1865, p. 475). As well as slow and simple, the 'savage' was described as ingenuous and with no sense of the transcen- dent. Thus, different researchers (e.g. Broca 1866, p. 75; Lubbock 1870, p. 142) Ô Springer</page><page sequence="9">690 Palacio-Pérez deduced it was impossible for any true religious thought to exist within primitive societies. Naturally, prehistoric hunter-gatherers had no religion, as Gabriel de Mor- tillet maintained vehemently all his life: ' It happens that as soon as religious ideas appear, funerary practices are introduced. However, there is no evidence of funerary practices in the Quaternary. Quaternary man was, therefore, wholly devoid of any feeling of religiousness ' (De Mortillet 1883, p. 476). In the case of Gabriel de Mortillet, his strict evolutionism combined with personal and political reasons that caused him to maintain a radical anti-clericalism. All of this contributed to his desire to prove that religion was not intrinsic to human nature (Bahn 1992, pp. 341-345; Reinach 1899a, pp. 89-90). In parallel with and in accordance with this way of perceiving the hunter, the same authors defined the Palaeolithic depictions on antler and bone objects as a lesser art for purposes of amusement or decoration (Moro and González Morales 2004). However, this prejudiced and simplistic view of intellectual life in the Palaeolithic would steadily start to change, at least after 1885. Without doubt, the impact of E. B. Tylor's theories of cultural-mentalist evolutionism played a significant role. Indeed, in 1866, this author first formulated his theory of animism to explain the most primitive and basic expression of religion (Tylor 1866), and he did not hesitate to attribute this type of beliefs to all 'primitive humans': ' We also know that one of the coarsest forms of religious feelings consists of believing and worshiping the imma- terial things that exist in the winds, the trees, the waters, that ripen fruits and make the rain fall, that cause the illnesses and misfortunes of the savage hunter [...] The worship of spirits of this kind are to be found, it may be said, amongst the savage populations all over the world ' (Tylor 1867, p. 707). A few years later, in the wake of the idea of animism created by Tylor, a new topic of debate appeared: totemism. The general notion of totemism was introduced in anthropology by McLennan (1869, 1870). In The Worship of Animals and Plants , McLennan defined totemism as the oldest animisi belief whilst granting it universal validity. These ideas were developed further by anthropologists and religious scholars. Thus, in 1890, Frazer's work The Golden Bough appeared. In this, he pursued an evolutionary organisation of the different belief systems, following Tylor's proposal that modern religion is simply the development of more ancient ways of thought. Frazer defined the mentality of primitive populations as basically magic. In fact, this author, in collaboration with the ethnographers Spencer and Gillen (1899, pp. 112-127) reduced Australian totemism to a simple set of magic practices seeking to ensure the fecundity of the totem species and therefore of the 'clan' that identified itself with it. In this way, sympathetic hunting magic and totemism became the generic interpretative framework for prim- itive religion. Together with the rise of an anthropology increasingly concerned with the mental production of human beings (language, religion, mythology, literature...), we must refer to the development of comparative religious studies, with the influential works of authors such as Max Müller, Ernest Renan, Maurice Vernes, Gabriel Monod, Leon Marillier and Salomon Reinach (Laplanche 1999). Some widely distributed philosophical works also were important like La Creation, by Edgar Quinet, some extracts of which were published ( Mort d'une race humaine , Idée de l'immortalité dans l'homme fossile) in the journal Matériaux pour l'histoire primitive et naturelle de l'homme (Quinet 1870a,b). ô Springer</page><page sequence="10">Origins of the Concept of 'Palaeolithic Art' 691 Obviously, these theories of the nature of primitive mind inspired prehistorians' ideas in many ways. They appeared in two decisive debates: one arising about the acceptance of the Palaeolithic date of certain burials and, some years later, in the issue of the existence of cave art (Richard 1993). I shall begin by examining the former of these, as it involved a clear break with all rigid evolutionist ideas that had denied any kind of transcendent thought of a religious type among Palaeolithic humans. Lartet and Christy were the first to suggest the existence of a funerary cult during the 'Age of Reindeer' based on the remains found at Aurignac (Lartet and Christy 1864, p. 24). A few years later, Louis Lartet (1869) described a ritual burial in the Palaeolithic at Cro-Magnon. Émile Rivière (1872) was to discover the remains of possible burials among abundant Palaeolithic material in the caves near Menton (France). However, many archaeologists refused to accept this evidence and alluded to stratigraphie reasons that negated the Palaeolithic date of the skeletons (De Mortillet 1883, pp. 471-472) or interpreted them as the results of accidents caused by the collapse of boulders (De Mortillet 1883, pp. 469-470; Massenat, Lalande and Cartailhac 1872, pp. 1063-1064). In the case of Gabriel de Mortillet, it is important to add to the above arguments his strict evolutionism combined with a radical anti- clericalism. All of this must have coincided in his desire to prove that religion was not intrinsic to human nature and, consequently, the absence of burials in Palaeolithic times (Bahn 1992, pp. 341-345 Reinach 1899 a, pp. 89-90) It was Emil Cartailhac who, in 1886, concluded the debate by attributing well-defined burials to the Palaeolithic, after studying the human remains found at several sites: 'The skeleton thus prepared had been the object of the mysterious attention of the living, dressed with adornments, covered with red dust and probably hidden beneath a thin layer of earth and ashes [...] In France we have seen sites that reveal the same funerary rite [...] The observations made in the Pyrenees and the centre of France show that this custom was generalised ' (Cartailhac 1886, pp. 460- 470). In this way, the idea grew that the 'primitive' people in the Palaeolithic possessed some form of religiousness and a supposed belief in the other life. However, the ideas developed by Tylor and McLennan about primitive religion and the acceptance of funerary rituals in the Palaeolithic did not produce, at least directly and immediately, any change in the way of interpreting the art of the 'Age of Reindeer'. Most authors continued to maintain an 'art for art's sake' interpretation of the artwork produced on antlers and bones. In order for the union between Palae- olithic art and 'primitive religion' to take place, an intellectual change that would generate a redefinition in the way of understanding the origins and the nature of art was necessary (Palacio-Pérez 2010a). Primitivist Temptations: Edouard Piette Evolutionists conceived history as an open road towards progress. However, some authors looked on this journey with more sorrow than joy, since for them the primitive state of humankind was a Golden Age. History was the process of the steady deterioration of the natural condition of human beings, under the philosophical supposition that they had originally been good and pure. This is essentially the foundation of a doctrine that is usually called primitivism (Bell 1972). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="11">692 Palacio-Pérez However, the primitivist perception of the most remote past initially developed during the Antiquity (Lovejoy and Boas 1935) was redefined in the Enlightenment and by Romanticism (Fairchild 1928; Withney 1934). This conception of history was expressed in the myth of the 'noble savage'. The noble savage symbolises the communion of the best of human beings from physical, mental and spiritual points of view. Physically they were tough, brave and skilful. Mentally, they had great aesthetic sensitivity, intuition and love of nature. Morally, they were benevolent and generous (Whitney 1934, pp. 82-136). It is interesting to examine how in the last years of the nineteenth century, many intellectuals were aware of the problems arising from the Industrial Revolution and sought in the idea of 'noble savage' a form of criticism and escape from bourgeois reality. Writers like Rimbaud and artists like Gauguin found in primitivism the possi- bility, more fictitious than real, of escaping from civilisation, of 'becoming savages' (Dagen 1998, pp. 6-8; Micheli 2002, pp. 47-53). About 1893, in Noa-Noa, Paul Gauguin wrote: 7 have escaped everything that is artificial, conventional, customary. Iam entering into the truth, into nature [...] I develop normally and no longer occupy myself with vanities' (Gauguin 1893, p. 82). In other cases, the enlightened myth of 'noble savage' was simply an option for historical speculation and philosophical reflection. This is, for instance, the case of the lawyer and prehistorian Édouard Piette, who was especially influenced by Rousseau's writings1 (Groenen 1994, p. 314), and devoted much of his life to the study of Palaeolithic art. His view of Palaeolithic life was characterised by cultural evolutionism (evolutionist trend focused on the study of intellectual aspects of human societies, as languages, beliefs or religions), which was occasionally tinged with primitivism. Contrary to the Mortillet's and Lubbock's views of prehistoric hunters, Piette offered a poetical panorama of Palaeolithic society: ' Exercise and open-air life disseminated among the savages, whom we regard as miserable, a touch of morality, of strength and calm that labourers and office clerks will never know ' (Piette 1873, p. 412). However, he was not evoking the simple 'state of nature' but the moment when humans had progressed further: ' Ingenious man, dedicated to the art of drawing and sculpture [...] was, in his time, a pioneer of civilization; he left his mark in a stage of humankind on the road to progress. He was not a savage enclosed in the narrow circle of his forefathers ideas, he was a man of progress and he might still be so ' (Piette 1873, p. 400). Why then did his culture disappear with the arrival of the 'Neolithics'? To explain this question, he resorted to the comparison with the myth of the Tost American Indians' (Trigger 1980). The indigenous Americans had been noble and brave, but their time had passed; they had had to bow before the inevitable arrival of Europeans and civilisation. Similarly, Palaeolithic man had to submit to the force of the Neolithic 1 Jean Jacques Rousseau (1755) express some primitivist ideas in Discourse sur l'inégalité and Émile ou de l'éducation (1762). However, Rousseau never used the term 'noble savage' and was not a pure primitivist. His idealized vision of primitive society was not the simple 'state of nature' but a society that had progressed far enough to live in families and groups. As differences in wealth and status among families were minimal the first coming together in groups was a golden age of humankind. The development of agriculture, metallurgy, private property, the division of labour and economic inequality broke this era of progress and led to the degeneration of society. â Springer</page><page sequence="12">Origins of the Concept of 'Palaeolithic Art' 693 invaders (Piette 1873, pp. 398-400). Even so, he did not fail to suggest, recalling Rousseau, that with the appearance of agriculture something had gone wrong on the road of evolution and that the later achievements of humankind had some pernicious effects, which led him to say of the Palaeolithic people: ' They were the twilight and, in a certain sense, the dawn of civilisation ' (Piette 1873, p. 414). The parameters with which Piette judged prehistoric people are clear. In short, he supposed that progress was innate to human beings and it could be mainly measured in intellectual terms: ' They were the first in most of the great and noble ideas of humankind [...] they invented plastic arts and took them at a stroke to a remarkable level of perfection. Their glory is that of progressing towards an ideal before developing the material improvements that make life easier and gentler ' (Piette 1873, p. 414). The case of Édouard Piette is certainly an exception at the end of the nineteenth century. In general, few archaeologists were seduced by primitivist feelings. However, the studies that Piette developed about the Palaeolithic images were very influential in the last third of the nineteenth century and the first years in the twentieth century. The Construction of the Concept of 'Palaeolithic Art' The process that led to the birth of a relatively uniform concept of 'Palaeolithic art' was a long one. Two phases can be differentiated. A first period between 1864 and 1895, defined by the publication of the first engraved and sculpted objects discovered at the Palaeolithic sites in the Dordogne (Lartet and Christy 1864). These remains were judged differently depending on the theoretical orientation of each scholar, but regarding them as the product of a primitive 'aesthetic impulse' was a common thread in all the interpretations. A second period began about 1895 and developed over the first half of the twentieth century. It was characterised by the steady acceptance of the Palaeolithic age of rock paintings and engravings and by a redefinition of the concept of 'Palaeolithic art' in symbolic-religious terms. Rather than breaking with previous ideas, this redefinition tempered and enlarged them. It added a functional aspect of a religious nature to the acknowledgement of an incipient 'aesthetic impulse' latent in Palaeolithic graphics. This double conception, aesthetic and functional, of Palae- olithic visual expression was established by 1906. This redefinition of 'Palaeolithic art' was the result of a process of assimilation by osmosis of a more general category, that of 'primitive art'. The First Ideas About Palaeolithic Depictions. The Paradigm of Ingenuity: Simplicity or Purity? The publication of the images on antler and bone objects found at sites in the Vézère valley (Fig. 1) meant that the existence of a form of 'art' in the Palaeolithic was accepted by part of the scientific community (Lartet and Christy 1864). We have already seen that there were very different ideas about prehistoric people in the last third of the nineteenth century. This variety also generated disparate discourses and interpretations in connection with their forms of graphic expression. As a result, it was difficult to agree upon a uniform concept of 'Palaeolithic art' before 1900, when Ô Springer</page><page sequence="13">694 Palacio-Pérez Fig. 1 Antler artefacts (' bâtons de commandement ') with engraved zoomorphic motifs from the site of La Madeleine (France) (Lartet and Christy 1875, B.PL XXX &amp; XXXI) the idea of 'primitive art' began to take hold. However, there is one unifying element in this diversity of opinions: the nineteenth-century and Western concept of art. Thus, Palaeolithic images were conceptualised in accordance with the idea of art that existed in European bourgeois society at that time (Moro and González Morales 2003). In contrast with essentialist conceptions that treat 'the modern idea of art' as a universal (Carroll 2004; Dessanayake 1992; Dutton 2009), the notion of 'art' wide- spread at the turn of twentieth century may best be understood as a contingent conception related to modernity. The concept of art that is normally held in the West today is barely 200 years old and possesses a discernible origin that can be traced (Kristeller 1952; Shiner 2004, pp. 119-302; Tatarkiewicz 1971). In the 1860s the idea, inherited from the philosophers of the Enlightenment, which understood art as an independent realm governed by its own internal rules, was well-established in European society (Shiner 2004, pp. 259-265). Art was a field dominated by intellec- tualised pleasure, disinterested contemplation and the self-conscious 'work of art', thought as creation. Thus, the universe of art was defined by creativity remote from the pragmatism of everyday life, centred in the search for aesthetic values alluding to beauty, the capture of the 'sublime', 'picturesque' or the 'novelesque'. These ideas favoured a classification system for the arts that distinguished between 'lesser arts' with a craftwork or decorative character, and 'fine arts', associated with the search for the aesthetic ideal. In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the positivist spirit of the new sciences made it necessary for new empirical methods to be introduced in the study of the 'aesthetic experience'. In this way, Physiology and Psychology provided new materials and approaches that were used to re-think the issues that existed about art. The new science of experimental psychology tackled the problem by trying to define and understand the psycho-physiological aspects £) Springer</page><page sequence="14">Origins of the Concept of 'Palaeolithic Art' 695 implicated in the aesthetic experience (Fechner 1871, 1876). A large number of researchers reduced the aesthetic experience to mere pleasure, and this, in tum, was interpreted as a physiological phenomenon (Allen 1877; Groos 1892; Lange 1895, 1901; Marshall 1895; Spencer 1855). They all saw aesthetic pleasure as a mechanism aimed at satisfying impulses and emotions through a conscious illusion that took place in a world of appearances and imagination. Another group of authors, in particular the Germans (Lipps 1891, 1897; Vischer 1873, 1874; Volkelt 1876, 1895), fixed their attention on the concept of empathy ( Einfiihlung ). This concept gave shape to the theory that explained aesthetics as the projection of the self on objects, as an imaginary transfer of emotions and subjective states of mind on an object (a work of art), in the same way that later the object is able to suggest them to the person who observes it. This idea had some relevant followers in France (Bäsch 1896) and England (Sully 1892). Therefore, psychological proposals focused on studying the ability that art had to produce pleasure and transmit emotions, while attempting to discover what kind of physiological reactions were shown by individ- uals in the course of the 'aesthetic experience'. In this way, psychology shared and reinforced the idea that art was an independent realm in human experience, remote from other social realities. The assessment of Palaeolithic images according to the nineteenth-century concept of art stressed a fundamental continuity between the past and the present. However, this continuity was interpreted differently depending on what each author or theoretical orientation wished to emphasise. In this respect, we can note significant differences between the approaches of fixists, evolutionists and primitivists. The fixists considered a direct continuity. For them, Palaeolithic art was the evidence of the existence of an invariable human nature that separated our species from other animals. In other words, art was a faculty common to all human beings, including our prehistoric ancestors (Defrance-Jublot 2004). These depictions might be simple, but in essence, they belonged to the category of art: ' Their objects [...] reflect their instinct of comfort and a certain degree of develop - ment in the culture of the arts ' (Lartet and Christy 1864, p. 53). The first explanation they gave to these images fitted in with the idea that understood art as an autonomous activity whose sole objective is the disinterested contemplation that produces the aesthetic experience: 'the enjoyment of an easy life engenders the arts ' (Lartet and Christy 1864, p. 34). In reality, this interpretation is no more than a transcription of how the aesthetic experience was defined in those years: as a game of the imagina- tion. In addition, the naturalism of the zoomorphic representations was assessed in the light of an idea that plays a vital role in Western philosophical tradition: art under- stood as an imitation or representation of nature (Tatarkiewicz 1980, p. 227-289). This original naturalism showed that Palaeolithic humans had also felt this impulse, this need to recreate what they saw: ' Their drawings and sculptures give us a more elevated demonstration by the way in which they succeeded in reproducing the form of their contemporary animals' (Lartet and Christy 1864, p. 53). In this way, those supporting fixist positions insisted on the definition of a human essence in which art was a vital ingredient: ' There is a gulf between the quadruped anthropomorph who only knows how to obtain his food and the human who has an idea of Aesthetics ' (Bourgeois and Delaunay 1865, p. 94). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="15">696 Palacio-Pérez Evolutionists also sought historical continuity, but this would not be a synonym of permanence but of change. Their goal was not to define the essence of human nature, but to show the gradual change in its formation and to prove this as the product of a long period of evolution from the animal to the human, from the simple to the complex and, finally, from the savage to the civilised. They transferred the nineteenth-century idea of art to the Palaeolithic past, but they did it by applying a gradualist logic. Thus, evolutionist authors defined the art of the 'primitives' as the opposite of their own (Moro and González Morales 2003). If bourgeois art in the great European cities was characterised by sensitivity, creative originality, freedom of execution and intellectual complexity, the art of Palaeolithic 'savages' must have been based on technical skill, imitation, conventions and mental ingenuity. It was an unfinished art. Its naturalism was a reflection of thoughtlessness, a mechanical copy of nature (De Mortillet 1883, pp. 415-421; Dreyfus 1888, 1893, pp. 224-225). The art of 'primitive' humans was synonymous with intellectual simplicity, and within that line of thought Palaeolithic art was conceptualised as craftsmanship for decora- tive purposes. The primitivist perception was also present in the archaeologists' discourse, although it was mixed with ideas related to E. B. Tylor's cultural evolutionism. This is the case, for example, of E. Piette. For this scholar, Palaeolithic art was the reflection of the most outstanding qualities of the 'good savage': his intuition, aesthetic sensibility and love of nature (Piette 1873, pp. 412-414). All of them qualities forgotten by civilised man. Paradoxically, this was not only a sign of break, but also of continuity, as it symbolises one of humankind's first steps on the road to progress (Piette 1873, p. 400). Some popular science writers were also seduced by the myth of the 'natural man': ' We should not doubt that our Solutrean people enjoyed satisfactions similar to those of our poets , with a freshness unknown to us, an ingenuity to which our souls aspire in vain ' (Rosny 1895, p. 68). These authors also emphasized the naturalism of Palaeolithic art, which for them was an example of sincerity and innocence (Piette 1873, p. 417; Rosny 1895, p. 65). Unlike materialist evolutionists, they saw this art as the product of creative imagination rather than a sign of simpleness or backwardness: ' Their love of art [...] can only be the fruit of their imagination, meditation and leisure ' (Piette 1873, p. 413). It was probably J. H. Rosny who, in his book Vamirhe, illustrated the projection of the modern idea of aesthetics, as a play on emotions captured in the imaginary recreation of nature, to the analysis of Palaeolithic art: '* Surveying the surroundings, wandering around the island, he tried to find a model, a tree, bird or fish [...]An intelligent gentleness, subtlety from being in mental contact with nature, an artist's day-dreaming, wrinkled his forehead and eyelids' (Rosny 1892, p. 49). This conflict between approaches on Palaeolithic art acquired both scientific and ideological dimensions. This can be seen in the long process of the acceptance of the age of Palaeolithic rock art, well illustrated by the case of Altamira Cave (Fig. 2) (Bahn 1992; González Morales and Moro 2002; Moro and Pelayo 2010). The antiquity of the paintings and engravings was not recognised for over 20 years because it was thought that such refined art could not correspond to humans who had just awoken from their animality: 'It is hard to believe that cave-dwellers in the Age of Reindeer were advanced enough to do such paintings, or even that they might propose doing such a thing ' (Quiroga and Torres Campos 1880, p. 162). However, â Springer</page><page sequence="16">Origins of the Concept of "Palaeolithic Art' 697 Fig. 2 The ceiling of Altamira Cave (Spain) with polychrome zoomorphic motifs, discovered by Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola in 1879 (Sanz de Sautuola 1880). Photo VR-Database (González Sáinz, Cacho, Fukazawa 2003) the delay in the acceptance of their antiquity was also the result of mistrust and ideological confrontation between fixists and evolutionists, as E. Cartailhac acknowl- edged in 1902: ' There is no point insisting on my impressions on seeing M. Sautuola's drawings. This was something absolutely new and strange from all points of view. I asked for advice. An influence, who was generally more enlightened, quickly induced my scepticism: 4 Beware ! They are trying to play a dirty trick on French prehistor- ians ,' he wrote ' Mistrust Spanish clergymen.* And I mistrusted!' (Cartailhac 1902, p. 350). In this sense, it seems logical that Édouard Piette from his primitivist perception quickly accepted the antiquity of the Altamira paintings and engravings: 'D. Marce- lino de Sautuola sent me a brochure on prehistoric objects from the province of Santander, and especially on the cave paintings of Santillana del Mar [...] I had no doubt whatsoever that these paintings were of the Magdalenian period '2 In conclusion, the definition of Palaeolithic art proposed at that time was simply a rough attempt, a multiple and indeterminate concept which, however, showed some points in common. In the first place, the interpretation of Palaeolithic images was made in the light of the nineteenth-century conception of 'art'. It was conceived as an autonomous world, independent from the rest of social reality. Therefore, the prehistorians at the time interpreted prehistoric evidence within the closed category of 'aesthetic experience', understood as a pleasurable and disinterested game or as the representation of emotions and feelings on certain objects. This autotelic conception of Palaeolithic depictions, traditionally expressed as 'art for art's sake' (Moro and González Morales 2006), would not last beyond the 1900s, when a redefinition of the origins and nature of art would become widespread (Palacio-Pérez 2010a). 2 Letter sent by E. Piette to E. Cartailhac the February 18, 1887 (Madariaga de la Campa 2000, pp. 59-61). ô Springer</page><page sequence="17">698 Palacio-Pérez In the second place, researchers defined Palaeolithic depictions through the lens of 'naturalistic' art. This fact is of great significance, as the idea relating art and nature occupies a central position in the Western conception of art. For the European artistic tradition beginning in the Renaissance, art is synonymous with the imitation of nature, although this principle was qualified in the eighteenth-century Enlightenment when art was considered a recreation and reflection of nature rather than a mere imitation (Tatarkiewicz 1980, pp. 227-289). The extrapolation of this tradition to Palaeolithic sculptures and engravings expressed continuity between the past and the present that gave unity to the whole category of art throughout time. Thus, for fixists, the naturalism of Palaeolithic figures was evidence for the existence of a sentiment of the imitation of nature since the earliest times, which reinforced their fixist and essentialist conception of human nature. For evolutionists, this naturalism was the proof of a primitive artistic sentiment that only imitated nature in a simple and thoughtless way, in contrast with the conscious and intellectualised art of contempo- rary bourgeois society. Finally, the authors seduced by primitivist ideas saw this naturalism as a synthesis of the finest characteristics of the 'good savage': his artistic sensitivity and intuition combined with an exalted feeling of love of nature. Therefore, the conceptualisation of Palaeolithic images, in accordance with the Western essentialist idea of art classified them under the heading of 'ingenuity'. For some, this ingenuity was a reflection of backwardness and intellectual simpleness on the path towards a dark and simian past, while for others it was a sign of innocence and the original purity that marked humankind's first steps on the road towards progress. Primitive Art and Palaeolithic Art: The Paradigm of Utility New interest was aroused in the origins of art in the last decade of the nineteenth century. Together with psychologists' efforts to discover the causes and determinant traits of the aesthetic experience, an ethnological and sociological approach appeared which analysed the evolution and nature of the artistic phenomenon by studying examples of ancient cultures, other than the Greco-Latin tradition, (like Egypt, Mesopotamia or Central America) and the production of the so-called 'primitive' people. As a consequence of this approach, in which sociologists, theoretical anthro- pologists and art historians participated, the concept of 'primitive art' took shape (Price 2001, pp. 1-6). This term was used to group the formal and symbolic diversity of the artwork produced by people regarded as 'savage', together with the essence of the origin of art, in a single category. Parallel with this change in theoretical perspective, parietal art was accepted as being Palaeolithic in age, as the conclusion of the debate caused by the discovery of engravings and paintings in several French caves (Pair-non-Pair, La Mouthe, Font-de-Gaume, Les Combarelles and Chabot). All this engendered a new definition of the concept of Palaeolithic art. The Origins of Art and the Creation of the Concept of Primitive Art I have examined how psychologists doubted previous philosophical speculations, branded as metaphysical, and focused the debate on the physiological and emotional reactions that individuals felt during the aesthetic experience. However, the ethno- logical approach began to understand that the aesthetic experience was also a social Ô Springer</page><page sequence="18">Origins of the Concept of 'Palaeolithic Art' 699 sentiment. This helped to overcome the idea that art was an independent and autonomous realm separate from the rest of social life. Art began to be regarded as a utilitarian production dependent on social needs. The intensity of the ethnological approach was reflected both in an increase in the number of ethnographical descriptions about the artistic practices of different pop- ulations, and in the proliferation of monographs explaining the origins and nature of art based on the study of 'primitive' societies. In fact, at this time, the idea of 'primitive art' took form as a synthesis of the graphic expression of the 'savages' in the colonies and the prehistoric inhabitants of Europe (Moro and González Morales 2005), to which the formative phases of some artistic styles in Antiquity were often added. Abundant ethnographic literature dealt with and informed about these topics. In the case of South Africa, the most important works were by Gustav Fritsch (1872, 1880), Emil Holub (1881) and Frédéric Christol (1897). Some of the most outstanding works on Australian aborígenes were the publications of R. H. Mathews (1893, 1895a, b, 1896a, b, 1897, 1898), W. E. Roth (1897), J. Mathew (1894) and the first edition of the report by Badwin Spencer and Frank Gillen (1899). In the case of North America, many important publications were derived from the activity of the Bureau of American Ethnology and the National Museum dependent on the Smithso- nian Institution ; we may highlight the works of F. Hamilton (1883), G. Mallery (1884), Franz Boas (1888, 1897a, b), W. J. Hoffman (1897). In connection with Arctic populations, the work of Johan Adrian Jacobsen (1884, 1977) was widely circulated. All these works not only influenced the development of ethnology and anthropology but also became food for thought for Art History and Aesthetics. Thus, in the 1890s, a series of general works began to appear, tackling the problems of the origins of art from what I might call an ethnological viewpoint. This work would develop a series of ideas that would finally define a new conception of 'primitive' arts and, by extension, the origins and nature of the artistic phenomenon. First, they would all assume that artistic activity was universal: ' Aesthetics is the study and practice of art for arts sake, that is, for the pleasurable sensations which are induced by certain combinations of form, line, and colour [...] All men have this sense, varying from a rudimentary to an exalted extenť (Haddon 1895, p. 200). They considered that all human societies, including groups of hunter-gatherers, practiced some form of art. This was understood as a reality that transcended the individual to acquire a social dimension (Him 1900, pp. 74-85; Haddon 1895, pp. 7-10; Conway 1891, pp. 5-12; Grosse 1894, 1897, pp. 12-31). The aesthetic values and symbolic contents would be shared by the whole of the society: ' We shall see, however, that the art of a people depends on its civilization, and that certain forms of culture forbid certain forms of art and favour others' (Grosse 1894, 1897, p. 16). Second, they maintained the essentialist conception of 'art', which associated it with a disinterested aesthetic motivation, but in the case of 'primitive' populations, this remained in the background as the artwork was subject to utilitarian aims, including the transmission of information, amusement, the exhibition of power and wealth, religious symbology and magic (Balfour 1893, pp. 31-64; Conway 1891, pp. 30-39; Grosse 1894, 1897, pp. 149-297; â Springer</page><page sequence="19">700 Palacio-Pérez Haddon 1895, pp. 200-305; Hirn 1900, pp. 149-297). It would even acquire an evolutionary meaning, reflecting the cultural backwardness of 'savage' populations: ' It gives us a right to regard all the forms and developments of art as witnesses to an activity which tends to become more and more independent of the immediate activ- ities of life ' (Hirn 1900, p. 15). For these authors, the arts were at first utilitarian productions related to various social needs, and they only took on an individual function later, by expressing emotions and responding to each person's needs. Third, religious symbology and magic would be seen as the main motivation of the art of 'savage' populations (Balfour 1893, pp. 31-64; Haddon 1895, pp. 235-305; Hirn 1900, pp. 278-297), and this explanation would occasionally be applied directly to the images on Palaeolithic objects (Conway 1891, pp. 30-39; Popoff 1890, pp. 400-403). The concepts of animism, totemism and sympathetic magic developed by British anthropologists were thus adopted by art historians and typically used to explain artwork created by 'primitive' people. Fourth, research continued to investigate the idea that art was intimately connected with the imitation and reproduction of nature. This line of study followed an evolutionist perspective: ' Especially do we see the truth of the time- honoured saying, 4 Natura Artis Magistra ; and it may be said with truth that the alphabet of every art has been learnt in the school of Nature, while the grammar, too, is modeled upon her teaching. Appreciation, adaptation, and, lastly, creation, are stages in the development of an art from Natures models, which follow one another in a natural sequence ' (Balfour 1893, p. 128). Therefore, all forms passed through different stages, beginning with a copy or imitation of nature and, by means of variations, finishing with schematic or abstract models (Balfour 1893, p. 77; Haddon 1895, pp. 6-7). Thus, it was deduced that what might be expected from an art in its beginnings was the representation of more or less simple naturalistic motifs. In the same way, this initial impulse to imitate was related with the idea of sympathetic magic developed by J. Frazer (Balfour 1893, pp. 31-64; Conway 1891, pp. 30-39; Haddon 1895, pp. 235-305; Hirn 1900, pp. 278-297; Popoff 1890, pp. 400-403), and thus, naturalism and magic became two theories supporting one another: ' the sorcerer who works by similarities is compelled to create a representation of things and beings in order to acquire an influence over them. Thus magical purposes call forth imitations of nature and life which, although essentially non-aesthetic in their intention, may nevertheless be of importance for the historical evolution of arť (Him 1900, p. 283). To sum up, during the 1890s, a re-definition of the origin and nature of art developed. It was explained as a universal impulse, present in all human societies, including those whom nineteenth-century progressivist mentality looked upon as backwards. This impulse was double-sided. On the one hand, it included the aesthet- ic, non-utilitarian dimension, connected with the realm of the expression of emotions. On the other hand, it was associated with the satisfaction of a series of practical needs such as the transmission of useful information within the group, amusement, exhibi- tion of power or religious symbology and magic. This last question was used to qualify the autotelic conception of art, which saw it as an independent reality, and integrate it within the rest of social life. This was vital in the abandonment of a decorative explanation of 'primitive art' in favour of a magic-religious utilitarian conception (Barasch 2000, pp. 220-228; Palacio-Pérez 2010a, b). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="20">Origins of the Concept of 'Palaeolithic Art' 701 This twofold artistic impulse corresponds to a double representation of the 'primitive' (Price 2001, p. 37). Primitive people are our 'brothers' because we share with them a pristine sense of aesthetics, but they are 'others' because they subject this sense to mere utilitarianism and superstition. The Attainment of the Concept of Palaeolithic Art After 1895, two key phenomena were to generate a re-definition of the concept of 'Palaeolithic art'. First, a debate arose about the existence of parietal art inside caves, caused by a series of discoveries in France (La Mouthe, Pair-non-Pair, Les Combar- elles, Font-de-Gaume and Chabot) that revived the almost-forgotten issue of Altamira Cave in Spain. Second, the new ideas developed in the 1890s by ethnology and art history were applied to Palaeolithic depictions, which were placed under the general heading of 'primitive art'. The debate concerning the existence of Paleolithic cave art emerged in 1895, when Emile Rivière announced to L'Association Française pour l'Avancement des Scien- ces his discovery of engravings in La Mouthe (Rivière 1897). A year later, Paul Raymond presented his conclusions about Chabot Cave (Raymond 1896). Also in 1896, François Daleau showed the results of his research in the Cave of Pair-non-Pair to the Société Archéologique de Bordeaux (Daleau 1897). All these discoveries were debated by the main French prehistoric societies. The discussions about La Mouthe were especially significant, as they concluded by generalising the issue and adding other cases already known, like Altamira, or the new discoveries at Pair-non-Pair, Chabot and Marsoulas. Indeed, after E. Rivière's first presentation to L'Association Française pour l'Avancement des Sciences in 1895, Édouard Piette noted the possible connection between the art in La Mouthe and the almost-forgotten case of Altamira: ' we know of nothing similar in France, but the paintings in Santander (Spain) appear to have some analogy with these engravings' (Piette 1895, p. 314). These claims provoked an intense controversy involving some opponents and others who were silent because of reservations or scepticism (Richard 1 993, pp. 64-65). G. de Mortillet, in his last paper to be published, would only accept as ancient the engrav- ings at Pair-non-Pair because they suited his 'amusement-decoration' conception of Palaeolithic art. They were the creation of 'a person with ingenuous sentiment, but more or less realistic in the forms' (De Mortillet 1898, p. 22). However, despite the existence of scholars who were not at all enthusiastic about the new discoveries, some renowned prehistorians soon acknowledged their antiqui- ty: ' several experts (prestigious geologists and anthropologists) whom I invited to study with me, in situ, the engravings at La Mouthe, have not hesitated in acknowl- edging them as prehistoric. I can cite especially: MM. Capitan, Cartailhac, Durand and Féaux ' (Rivière 1897, p. 677). The presentations made by L. Capitan and H. Breuil in September 1901 at L Academie des Sciences , about the discovery of parietal engravings and paintings in the caves of Les Combarelles and Font-de-Gaume, accepted the Magdalenian age of the depictions and extended this attribution to all the evidence of a similar nature that was known at the time (Capitan and Breuil 1901a, b). The cases of Les Combarelles and Font-de-Gaume were doubtlessly definitive in the process of accepting the existence of parietal art in Palaeolithic times. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="21">702 Palacio-Pérez At the same time, Palaeolithic representations were re-defined in accordance with the general idea of 'primitive art', based on ethnological analogies that created a primitive type-mind defined by religious thought (animism, totemism, sympathetic magic...). This renewed discourse took two directions. On one hand, Palaeolithic art was conceptualised from a utilitarian magic-religious perspective. On the other, researchers attempted to approach the problem of the 'form' of Palaeolithic repre- sentations by following the evolutionist theories developed by ethnologists and art historians. The magic-religious exegesis of Palaeolithic art was not new, and before the 1890s, a series of isolated, even timid, mentions were made, which had no continuity in time (Bernardin 1876, p. 12; Bourgeois and Delaunay 1865, p. 92; Piette 1873, pp. 414-416; Reinach 1889, p. 234). However, after 1890, a series of interpretative proposals were made in symbolic-religious terms; these were not in isolation but integrated in the general theory of the interpretation of 'primitive art' (Cartailhac and Breuil 1906, pp. 144-225; Chauvet 1903, p. 6; Conway 1891, pp. 30-39; Girod and Massénat 1900, p. 80; Hamy 1903; Popoff 1890, pp. 400-403; Reinach 1899b, pp. 478, 1903). This new conception of Palaeolithic images was the result of the changes in art theory and the development of a different discourse about the origin and nature of art. Indeed, some of the leading researchers in the re-definition of the meaning of Palaeolithic art, such as S. Reinach or H. Breuil, acknowledge their debt to the scholars who introduced the anthropological approach into the study of art, in the final decade of the nineteenth century. It was Salomon Reinach who promoted and explained in most detail the magic- religious view of Palaeolithic art (Palacio-Pérez 2010b). Thus, in 1899, he stated in reference to the portable objects: 7 have often insisted on the religious character of the bâtons de commandement and I believe that it is most legitimate, in contrast with Mortillet, to attribute cavemen with a well-developed religiousness . Perhaps, the animal figures, so frequent in their art, are evidence for some kind of totemism ' (Reinach 1899b, p. 478) (Fig. 1). A few years later, he published his seminal paper L'Art et la Magie (Reinach 1903) where he detailed the utilitarian character of Palaeolithic artistic forms, and their direct relationship with sympathetic magic. In this text, he does not hide his debt to authors such as J. Frazer (1890) or Spencer and Gillen (1 899), and neither with E. Grosse 's work Die Anfänge der Kunst (1 894) or Y. Him's (1900) The Origins of Art, which are frequently cited and even paraphrased. Grosse and Him's writings were the basis of the ethnographic analogies referred to by Reinach (1903, pp. 259-261). In addition, they were also the main inspirational source for his application of the idea of 'homeopathic' or 'sympathetic' magic to the interpretation of prehistoric art (Reinach 1903, pp. 260 and 263). In tum, H. Breuil quotes Emst Grosse's work (Cartailhac and Breuil 1906, p. 236) and refers to the influence of H. Balfour and H. Haddon's writings (Breuil 1958, pp. 154 and 192) in the composition of his qualification thesis for the University of Fribourg, as they made him aware of the importance of ethnographic analogies as an approach to the interpretation of the art of the 'Age of Reindeer' (Breuil 1958, p. 192 and p. 212). He applied this idea systematically in the first monograph on the paintings and engravings at Altamira Cave (Cartailhac and Breuil 1906, pp. 144- 225) and used it as the interpretative paradigm for Palaeolithic art during the whole first half of the twentieth century (e.g. Bégouën 1929; Breuil 1952, pp. 23-24; â Springer</page><page sequence="22">Origins of the Concept of 4 Palaeolithic Art' 703 Cartailhac and Breuil 1906, pp. 145-225; Luquet 1924, pp. 109-129; Reinach 1903). Therefore, by means of the ethnographic analogy, the arts of contemporary hunter- gatherers and of the Palaeolithic 'primitives' were linked in an eternal present defined by a certain form of mentality: a primitive stage of the development of human thought dominated by a magic-religious element, described by ethnographers and prehistorians in terms of animism, sympathetic magic or totemism (Fig. 3) (Ucko and Rosenfeld 1967). It was in this initial discourse that ideas like 'Palaeolithic shrine', 'initiation art', 'totemic images' and 'shamanic symbols' appeared. The interesting point is that, in a way or another, they have conditioned the interpretation of Palaeolithic art until recently. Indeed, despite the critique of ethnographic analogies made by structuralist authors (Laming-Emperaire 1962, pp. 136-144), they still interpreted Palaeolithic art in religious terms (Laming-Emperaire 1962, pp. 147-294, Leroi-Gourhan 1964, pp. 79-144, 1965, pp. 75-128). The case of the new edition of the debate on the possible connection between art and shamanism is somewhat similar (Clottes 2008, pp. 24- 25; Clottes and Lewis-Williams 1996, pp. 82-114; Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988). The description of Palaeolithic paintings and engravings in terms of 'form' is also indebted to the ethnological approach and the expansion of the general idea of 'primitive art'. Prehistorians interiorised the evolutionist model of change in artistic Fig. 3 H. Breuil's tracing of the figure in Trois Frères Cave (France) known as the 'Sorcier', which was described by H. Bégouën and H. Breuil as a sorcerer or a deity 4 garbed with the same symbols of magic power (a mask) as his human ministers ' (Bégouën and Breuil 1958, p. 54, PL. XX) £) Springer</page><page sequence="23">704 Palacio-Pérez forms developed by anthropologists. This was based on an organic or lifecycle idea, which differentiated for all art a formative phase (imitative naturalism), maturity (creative naturalism) and decline (schematism and abstraction) (Balfour 1893, p. 77; Haddon 1895, pp. 6-7). It was H. Breuil who took on the systematic definition and classification of Palaeolithic art in phases or styles. In his autobiography, he acknowl- edges that H. Balfour and C. Haddon's works were essential to make him understand how most of the schematic and abstract motifs derived, by stylisation, from previous naturalistic forms (Breuil 1958, pp. 154 and 192). He expressed this idea with clarity in 1905: ' ornamentation is the result of the increasingly profound alteration of figurative arť (Breuil 1905, p. 120). Equally influential for Breuil were the stylistic classifications made by some ethnologists for the works of certain populations. For example, the case of the organisation in four phases that E. Holub made of the rock art engravings made by Bushmen, which went from simple figurative outlines, to well-proportioned figures full of details, to end in 'decadent and very conventional' forms (Cartailhac and Breuil 1906, p. 177). Something he tried to check years later when he travelled to South Africa (Breuil 1955, 1965). This formal definition, beginning with an initial very simple naturalism into which variations would be introduced with time to gain exactness and precision, and becoming schematised in the decline, was present in the first systématisation in five phases that H. Breuil made of Palaeolithic images (Fig. 4) (Cartailhac and Breuil 1906, p. 113), which he later developed to differentiate two successive cycles (Breuil 1935, pp. 115-118). This original idea, which stated progress in the achievement of the naturalistic form, would even be inherited in the organisation in five styles developed by Leroi-Gourhan (1964, pp. 87-90, 1965, pp.145-179) in the 1960s (Moro 2007) and which only began to be harshly criticized in the 1990s (e.g. Clottes 1995; Franklin 1993; Lorblanchet 1990, p. 20, 1994, p. 180; Rosenfeld and Smith 1997, p. 409; Valladas et al 2001, pp. 985-986; Valladas et al 2005). The idea of formal progress in art, based on a model of flowering (naturalism) and decadence (geometrism and abstraction), and an interpretation swinging between pure aesthetics (beauty, ornamentation. . .) and a functional view (symbolic-religious), became the key ideas in the way of conceptualising Palaeolithic graphic expression in the first half of the twentieth century. In this way, the progressive distinction made between 'parietal' and 'mobi- liáry' art in the first decades of the century is therefore revealing (Capitan 1931, p. 96; De Morgan 1909, p. 132; Déchelette 1908, p. 239). This division would have become common usage by the 1950s and 1960s (Breuil 1952; Laming- Emperaire 1962; Leroi-Gourhan 1965; Ucko and Rosenfeld 1967). The category 'portable art' included a varying assemblage of engraved and sculpted artefacts, which shared the fact they were made from a transportable objects. However, their conceptualisation included two main notions. First, the more naturalistic engravings and sculptures were assessed from an aesthetic point of view as masterpieces, and they were assumed to have a profound meaning connected with religious beliefs (Breuil 1905, p. 105; Cartailhac and Breuil 1906, p. 135). Second, groups of non- figurative engravings were looked on as simple decorative motifs (Breuil 1905, p. 29; Capitan and Boyssonie 1924, p. 30; Peyrony 1914, p. 55), derived from a process of degradation of the more naturalistic representations (Breuil 1905: 120). Similarly, so- called 'parietal' art was seen as evidence of a higher level of technical and intellectual Ô Springer</page><page sequence="24">Origins of the Concept of 'Palaeolithic Art' 705 Fig. 4 Technical and stylistic evolution of zoomorphic parietal paintings according to Cartailhac and Breuil (1906: 113)./ First phase (outlined figures in profile). 2 Second phase (figures in profile with some anatomical details and small areas filled with colour). 3 Third phase (representations with more anatomical details and large areas filled with colour to give an impression of volume). 4 Fourth phase (representations in perspective, polychrome and with many anatomical details) development (e.g. Capitan 1931, p. 705; De Morgan 1909, p. 133), as E.

In short, the inclusion of Palaeolithic graphic representations in the wider category of 'primitive art' implied a dualist conception, founded on religious feeling and naturalism aesthetic impulse, became the way of interpreting this visual symbols. Conclusions Understanding how the concept of 'Palaeolithic art' was bom within the context of modem nineteenth century thought allows us to comprehend the main ideas that have influenced our knowledge of the symbolic images of this period of Prehistory. Some of the main notion that researchers have maintained about Palaeolithic graphic expression for over a century, despite some critical voices, was profoundly influenced by a dualist conception inherited from nineteenth century thought. This duality was based on the opposition of two pairs of terms: one was 'art' and 'function' and the other was 'art' and 'primitive society'. The first established the conception of Palaeolithic images within the essentialist and autotelic notion of 'art', in which art is understood as a disinterested activity, autonomous and independent from the rest of social life, governed by its own mies and aimed at the satisfaction of the aesthetic experience. Thus, Palaeolithic images were submitted to the chain of universal continuities and categories (beauty, proportion, expressiveness...), which were deemed to belong to a history of art understood as the manifestation of that aesthetic experience in time. However, the second opposition, between 'art' and 'primitive society' distorted this aesthetic conception of Palaeolithic images. At the turn of the twentieth century, scholars stressed the differences between Western art and that of people who were regarded as primitive. Paradoxically, they continued to maintain an autotelic idea of art, as all depictions that were considered art were a response to an aesthetic need, but this proposition took on an evolutionary value. Thus, they believed that only modem Western civilisation has succeeded in making 'art' independent of the practical aspects of life and that in earlier stages of human history, the aesthetic experience had taken shape through images with utilitarian purposes. Among these purposes, the one that was thought to be dominant among so-called 'savages' was the symbolic- religious function. Primitive art needed its dark side: 'superstitious beliefs' related to animism, totemism and magic. This idea of 'primitive art', developed by anthropol- ogists and art theoreticians, quickly spread amongst prehistorians, who soon began to apply it to Palaeolithic representations. Out of this set of oppositions was bom the dualist conception of Palaeolithic images. They were included within the universal 3 Quote directly copied from the Bégüen family's 'Livre D'Or', in which Emile Solías penned his initial reaction upon visiting Le Tue ď Aubert in 19 August 1922.

In fact, this duality reflected a more general disassociation, established by nineteenth-century art theoreticians, between form and meaning. Form was situated in the realm of aesthetic impulse, whereas meaning was included in the sphere of religiousness. In the same way, this dichotomy fed the two sides of the idea of Primitive (Price 2001, p. 37), as an ancient relative or a distant foreigner. The existence of a 'universal aesthetic impulse' was used to connect the civilized European with their Palaeolithic relative. However, the 'dark religious ideas and superstitions' of savages were used to stress the distance between civilized European and Palaeolithic primitive. The projection of the categories of modern Western thought onto Palaeolithic artwork can also be seen in the characterisation of its forms based on the notion of 'naturalism'. In the late nineteenth century, anthropologists and art historians gave an evolutionary value to the Western idea of art as an imitation of nature. Inspired by an organic or lifecycle model they thought that all artistic form must go through a formative phase (imitative naturalism), maturity (creative naturalism) and decline (schematic and abstraction). Prehistorians took this approach and began to apply it to the study of Palaeolithic figures, developing different proposals of phases and styles, which were not questioned in any general way until the late twentieth century. I have attempted to show how the inclusion of Palaeolithic graphic expres- sion within the category of 'art', its interpretation in symbolic-religious terms, and the definition of its forms based on the idea of naturalism are the product of an inherited conception. These generic elements, which have remained stable in our assessment of Palaeolithic images, are the result of the superimposition of the concepts of art and primitive society developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by anthropologists and art theoreticians, and which were soon transferred by archaeologists to the study of prehistoric paintings and engravings. Archaeological research has been projecting terms, categories and concepts on Palaeolithic images for over a century; if we aim to limit the distortions of any approach and interpretation we make of this fragment of the human past, it is vital to know the roots and theoretical coordinates of these ideas.
