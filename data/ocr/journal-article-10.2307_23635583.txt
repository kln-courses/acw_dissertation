PARENTAL DEPRIVATION: A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN T. Grygier (Ottawa),* Joan Chesley t and Elizabeth Wilson Tuters (Toronto) J Parental deprivation is as old as mankind, but it is only in recent years that men—in any practical sense—have cared. Children wandering alone, children begging, diseased, abandoned, deprived of food, shelter and medical attention, subjected to child labour, were until recent times an accepted part of social conditions throughout the world. Indeed, most of the world still pays little positive attention to its children. Even in the affluent societies of the West, where extreme forms of child neglect are rare, welfare legislation reminds us that children need protection in law to ensure that they are protected in fact.1 * Dip.Pol.Sc., LL.M., Ph.D., F.B.Ps.S.; Director, University of Ottawa Centre of Criminology; consultant.

Canada enjoys a standard of living second only to that of the United States; Ontario is her wealthiest province. 209</page><page sequence="2">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS The mental health movement, as distinct from reformers and legislators, feeds on the current growth of social and psychological studies, and on the new concept of society as a network of inter personal relations. Even before World War I we were concerned with poverty, but only now are we beginning to realise how much it is self-perpetuating, through the effect it has on the minds of the poor. Child neglect and child labour were regarded first as natural evils; then as social evils in themselves to be dealt with by law and by social action; now they seem to be feared mainly because of their psychological consequences. The new approach to parental depriva tion and child neglect emphasises not so much the suffering of children as the malformations of character due to this suffering; not only the impact of modern society, in which small children may feel lost and adolescents may feel alienated, but also the danger presented by alienated and delinquent youth to the very fabric of society—to its social order. In this context parental deprivation means more than the suffering of the neglected children; it also means a lack of parental authority, which coincides with the general decline of authority in the modern world. Nowhere has this decline been more pronounced than in the authority of the father over his children. The wife, previously treated as her husband's property, has become his partner, and in many families the head of the household. Children, instead of being sub jected to autocratic discipline, often take part in family decisions. No longer must they obey their parents absolutely; they have their responsibilities, and most of all they have rights. The new concern with traumatic experiences in childhood, with family counselling and the effects of parental deprivation, is the result of the new outlook, of the recognition that children are entitled not only to food, comfort, education and recreation, but most of all to love. He who has no rights cannot be deprived; and children have rights. The problems of parental deprivation have frequently been over simplified. The main emphasis has been on the intimate, loving, emotionally satisfying relationship between the child and his mother. This emphasis has been criticised as unjustified: both parents are needed and the father may be even more important than the mother. It has also been said that the harm for a child of a broken family lies in the fact that the remaining parent tends to cast the child in the role of the absent parent; the child is challenged too early and too deeply. But the question is not just whether the father is the most 2IO</page><page sequence="3">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN important person in the child's life; nor which of the parents the child feels to be more loving, understanding or missed. Fathers and mothers are not only people of different sexes; they represent different roles and different aspects of the child's environment. If the mother is so important that the father is reduced to insignificance, it may be true that what the child mainly needs is simple, unconditional affection and care, which the mother symbolises, if not necessarily actually presents; most children would subscribe to this theory. But if the father is all-important for the child's character development, the child's actual need (as opposed to the need felt) may be not so much for affection and care as for kind but firm authority, for a model of a successful social role for the boy or of an ideal husband for the girl. The problem of paternal versus maternal deprivation is thus not simply the question of the main characters in a child's life, but of the aspects of human environment that they represent. The family, like a solar system, is only deceptively a grouping of isolated bodies; truth, in families as amongst planets, lies in the relationship. The philosophy of science has undergone a revolution since Newton, when the objects of scientific inquiry had a solidity that the con temporary scientist's picture of the world lacks. Since Einstein even the co-ordinates of time and space have lost their absolute character, and causes can be seen not as relations between things or events, but as purely mental connections with practical implications (Grygier, 1965a., p. 160). Whether human beings or physical objects are under scrutiny, scientific hypotheses are fictional versions of aspects of the real world; they are set up as predictive structures, and they are fictional because they do not deal with reality and are neither fully accurate nor complete. They are abstractions whose success is deter mined by their workability. The scientist perceives but a single aspect of the complex reality around him and treats it as if it were the ultimate knowledge; but it merely represents a knowledge that works for him, within his individual and historical perspective (Grygier, 1965b.). Newton's physics are workable in their proper place : they are not true. Nor are hypotheses in the social sciences. Parental deprivation has been described as one of the main causes or possibly the prime cause of delinquent behaviour. In order to clarify the etiological aspect of the problem, this report examines the existing literature as well as the case histories of 288 delinquent children of both sexes to see whether their condition can in any way be ascribed to an early history of parental deprivation. But any causal explanation 211</page><page sequence="4">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS must be viewed with caution; scientists are becoming increasingly aware that causal theories are over-simplifications. To determine the effects of parental deprivation, a workable scientific model must be used; and at the present stage of scientific development this would be an experimental model. Assumed causes must be manipulated experimentally to see how often they produce the hypothesised effects; otherwise the preconceived cause may be merely an association. An experimental model is most suitable for a study of treatment effects; but any study of socially undesirable causes of equally undesirable effects breaks down in practice because in such circumstances experimental manipulation of human beings is unacceptable. Thus the scientific model that can best settle the issue within reasonable limits of statistical error is unworkable. Experi ments with animals, such as Harlow and Harlow's work (1966) with monkeys (the attributes of artificially manufactured mothers being manipulated at will), can give some insight into the mental processes of deprived children, but no such insight can amount to scientific laws as we understand them. The obstacles to the use of the experimental model on human beings weaken the predictive power of hypotheses in the social sciences, which, when compared with those of the physical sciences, rank less as laws than as educated guesses. A further hindrance to prediction in social science lies in the peculiar effects its subject-matter has on the criterion of workability. By their very existence, hypotheses affect the humans whose behaviour they are supposed to predict and describe. As John Seeley (1951, 1958) maintains, all our scientific activity causes the data to change not merely while but because we investigate and report; and as the tempo of communication increases, the interval over which any scientific statement is true becomes smaller and the prediction based on it less accurate. Social scientists, when predicting how their subjects will act and hypothesising why they will do so, must bear in mind how subtly and thoroughly their statements may work to bring about the very future they predict. It is in this sense that social scientists play with fire in the deep forests of social interaction. Their hypotheses, once com municated, act as a form of persuasion; an hypothesis may be workable in part because its self-conscious subjects " magnetise " themselves in line with its predictions. As a theory of the effect of communication or feedback, " social progression " emphasises that self-consciousness is contagious (Grygier, 1965a.). In arguing that members of divergent 212</page><page sequence="5">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN groups tend to the extreme of those groups, and not to the median of society as a whole, this theory derives force from the human tendency to become what one acts. It hints at the danger of applying con venient hypotheses too readily. An hypothesis may be confirmed because it has been stated, not because it is true. Review of the Literature A study of the literature on parental deprivation illustrates some of the dangers of such feedback in scientific communication. Parental deprivation in children can be defined in various ways, but however defined it is recognised as a prime cause of delinquency and other personality disorders. This theory has mesmerised psychiatrists, but only in one of its aspects, that of maternal deprivation. The literature on parental deprivation treats the mother as all-powerful and therefore the culprit; as in the insect world, the function of the male seems almost purely physiological and devoid of any social and psychological consequences. Theoretically, parental deprivation can—and should—be abstracted into maternal, paternal and dual parental deprivation. However, in the development of the theory and research on this triangle the study has become one-sided. The responsibility for this bias belongs to John Bowlby, a leading authority on the results of maternal separation or deprivation, who has had a powerful influence on both lay and professional people. Other, less articulate, therapists and researchers were also exploring the mother-child relationship during the early 1940s when Bowlby (1947) was carrying out his investigations into the backgrounds of forty-four young thieves, and as early as 1935 Kanner claimed that autism, a symptom of childhood schizophrenia, was closely connected with an early relationship with an intelligent but emotionally cold mother. Nevertheless, the world-wide attention accorded Bowlby's publications has subsequently made him the target of criticism that he treated the triangle of parental deprivation as three completely separate sides, two of which he discarded, almost without consideration. He claimed that maternal deprivation is a prime root, if not the prime root, of persistent delinquent behaviour in both male and female children. Not only is physical separation of the mother from the child automatically harmful to the child, but if it is extended beyond the age of two-and-a-half years its effects are virtually irreparable. The father was recognised as necessary to the economic and emotional support of the mother but his role was treated as 2I3</page><page sequence="6">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS secondary. The third side of the triangle—dual separation—received scant attention. Following the publication of the study of forty-four thieves in 1947 Bowlby and his followers amplified and solidified this thesis. Bowlby expounded his theory that separation of the child from his mother or mother substitute for more than six months during his first five years accounted for perhaps half of the most intractable cases of persistent delinquency. He suggested that unstable and unhappy parents who do not want their child provide the factors necessary to instil delinquency (Bowlby, 1950). But at no time does he expend energy other than in the case against the mother figure. The exposition and probably the acceptance of the Bowlby thesis reached a peak in 1952 (it has received considerable criticism since) after the publication of his monograph for the World Health Organisation (Bowlby, 1951). Mannheim, in his introduction to Andry's study (i960, p. xi) of the parental deprivation problem, suggests that the triad can be seen as an historical dialectic; but this image is rather smudged by the wholly admirable tendency of those who oppose Bowlby's extreme statements to incorporate in their publications both antithesis and synthesis. And it is natural enough that a researcher who quarrels with Bowlby's hypothesis will try to avoid the same error on his own part. Andry, for instance, emphasises paternal deprivation, but does not treat it in isolation. He feels that Bowlby's hypothesis " undermines the develop ment of a theory based on interacting multi-causation " (Andry, i960, p. 7), and does not himself intend to rest at the other extreme. He is determined to keep his research design as realistic as possible and his findings are never exclusive of " interacting multi-causation." So in broad outlines the history of recent ideas in the field of parental deprivation moves from Bowlby's emphasis on maternal deprivation to the less rigid sort of hypotheses advanced by researchers such as Andry. It will be of value to examine the literature in greater detail at this point. Bowlby's theory oí maternal deprivation The particular parent-child disturbance Bowlby chose to study was that of early and prolonged separation of the child from the mother. Among his forty-four thieves he found an association between early separation and delinquency, especially among those of his thieves whom he classified as having " affectionless characters." Backing up his findings with studies of previous literature, he came to the conclusion that " on the basis of this varied evidence it appears that there is a 214</page><page sequence="7">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN very strong case indeed for believing that prolonged separation of a child from his mother (or mother-substitute) during the ñrst five years of life stands foremost among the causes of delinquent character development and persistent misbehaviour " (Bowlby, 1947, p. 41). Although the literature offers conflicting evidence about the effects of early maternal separation on subsequent delinquency, the prevailing opinion is that, in general, maternal deprivation has a detrimental effect on character development. Bowlby maintained this opinion so strongly that five years later he repeated it in his WHO monograph, and added what Wootton (1959, p. 138) calls the "classic statement of his hypothesis," his expression of the principle that it is essential for the mental health of an infant or young child to experience " a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother (or per manent mother-substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment " (Bowlby, 1951, p. 361). Since the publication of his monograph, Bowlby seems to have developed a growing interest in the area of inheritance, but he asserted in The Lancet (1958) that, contrary to what various medical and non-medical professional workers were implying, his position remained materially unchanged. Still to the forefront is the Bowlby who maintains : " there is abundant evidence that maternal deprivation can have adverse effects on the development of children (a) during the period of separation, (b) during the period immediately after restoration to maternal care, and (c) permanently " (Bowlby, 1951, p. 397). Pre mature separation from the mother is seen as evoking pathological forms of mourning similar to those described in Freud's (1924-25) classic Mourning and Melancholia. The importance of Bowlby's contributions is unquestioned—he provided a feasible starting point for research into the interacting mother-child relationship; but, since various other factors have been shown to play as great or perhaps a greater part in instituting and furthering delinquency, Bowlby's theory must of necessity retire to a place of lesser prominence and the task of modification be left to later researchers. The psychoanalytic theory of psychosexual development The Bowlby theory is based on well-known psychoanalytic con cepts regarding personality organisation, in which the child's initial social experiences govern his later ability to make healthy social 215</page><page sequence="8">T, GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS adjustments in adolescence and adulthood, and to establish stable and meaningful relationships with other people. During the development of personality the individual learns to control his impulses and instinctive drives; he develops mental processes adapted to post-infant reality. In Freudian terms this is the progressive furthering of the id, and the structuring of the ego and the superego. And by Freudians the die is cast at an early age—when the influence of the mother is prime. This is particularly true of the Kleinian school of psychoanalysis, which appears to have exerted a powerful influence on Bowlby's thinking.2 The infant is initially dependent upon his mother to satisfy his needs and direct his behaviour. She arbitrates between the infant and the world and is, in effect, the infant's world. She is the infant's " psychic organiser," his ego and superego. Gradually the emerging child begins to differentiate himself from his mother, to recognise her as someone who provides the various tangible and intangible benefits he will learn to think of as love, and he begins to want to reciprocate that love. As his " object love " develops the child incorporates within himself, through the processes of identification and introjection, the values and teachings of the love-object. Parental ideals become his ego-ideal; parental prohibitions become his conscience. In this way he begins to develop his own ego and superego. As psychic maturation proceeds, the child can tolerate longer and longer periods of physical separation from his mother, because his general level of tolerance increases. The final development of the superego comes through the resolution of the Oedipus complex, when the child learns to play the role appropriate for his sex. According to Bowlby and to common sense, maternal deprivation must have some adverse effect during these crucial years. He states the case clearly enough : " Clinically, it is observed that the egos and super-egos of severely deprived children are not developed—their be haviour is impulsive and uncontrolled. . . . Their capacity for inhibition is absent or impaired... . They are ineffective personalities, unable to learn from experience and consequently their own worst 2 Neither Freud nor his more orthodox followers—including his daughter, Anna—would go so far as Melanie Klein did. In Great Britain the disagreement between the psycho analysts led to a split in the movement, Edward Glover leading the more conservative— or more balanced—faction. Glover (1945) regards the concept of a love trauma of the three-month-old infant as a " variant of the doctrine of Original Sin " and he does not believe that a baby has a neurological and psychological apparatus capable of experiencing traumas and developing complexes described by the Kleinian school of psychoanalysis. Schaffer's (1958) carefully controlled observations support Glover's views. 2i6</page><page sequence="9">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN enemies " (Bowlby, 1951, p. 404). This is Bowlby's " affectionless character," and was descriptive of many of his juvenile thieves. More recently Kaufman (i960) has explained the behaviour of delinquents in terms of fear of separation. The delinquent is fixated at the stage of development of the child who can feed himself, is partly toilet-trained, knows his parent is present and yet wanders back to make sure he is not alone. In common with other children of this age, such a delinquent has strong instinctual energy, yet lacks sufficient ego or superego strength to pursue long-term goals. In theoretically fixing the route from deprivation to delinquent behaviour Bowlby (1947), too, determined to his satisfaction that impairment of early object relationships would result in lack of a properly developed superego to regulate libidinal and aggressive impulses. The lack of a suitably developed superego is generally disastrous and specifically causative of delinquent behaviour. Other studies of maternal deprivation Many other researchers explained the effects of maternal depriva tion. The Gluecks (1952) studied 500 persistently delinquent boys and a matched control group. What they found seemed to back up Bowlby's hypothesis: they report that early loss of a parent (before the age of five) through separation, divorce, death or prolonged absence occurred twice as frequently in the delinquent as in the non-delinquent group. But the Gluecks did not indicate whether the deprivation was maternal, paternal or dual (mixed). Ribble (1946), a New York psychoanalyst who has worked exten sively with infants, maintains that the child's relationship with his mother is crucial for his social and sexual development. She contends that many aspects of the child's maturation such as orientation and awareness are related to a need for contact with the mother. The present hospital care of newborns that separates baby and mother soon after birth is criticised as detrimental to the infant's development. Lack of adequate mothering may result in permanent organic and psychic damage characterised by such reactions as negativism and regression. The unmothered infant may seek solace in such rhythmic body move ments as head banging and excessive rocking. This may be so; but Ribble presents no objective data to support her views. Goldfarb (1943) compared children who had been brought up in institutions until the age of three and then placed in foster homes with children from similar hereditary backgrounds who had been placed in 217</page><page sequence="10">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS foster homes at birth; the only significant difference in upbringing seemed therefore to be the conditions during the first three years of life. The children were between the ages of six and fifteen when tested, and in each case the " institution " group showed a high incidence of under-development in certain defined areas. They seemed intellectually inferior as compared with the other group; were unable to think conceptually or to develop logical constructs; could not direct their own behaviour towards a personal goal; were emotionally immature, with a tendency to display overt anxiety and aggression, inability to concentrate, impudence, destructiveness, and fits of temper. From these observations, Goldfarb concluded that parental deprivation in infancy produced conditions which could not be remedied by a subsequent change in environment; but what he measured, if anything, was the difference between children placed in institutions and children in foster homes. He did not investigate the effect of either maternal or paternal deprivation at all. As shown in another study under the direction of the senior author (Grygier, 1966), characteristics of children in institutions are one thing, the effect of institutionalisation is another. Bender (1945) agreed with Goldfarb's conclusions, with one reserva tion. From her observations of children whose infancy was spent in foster homes she adduced that each young child must have at least one permanent parent-relationship for the first three years of life if his mental and emotional development were to be normal. As with Ribble, she presented no objective data, only clinical observations. Although Spitz (1945) did not follow his subjects' development past infancy, his conclusions, based on observations of comparative groups of children in two institutions for babies, may still be interesting to our study. Physical care received by the children in both institutions was comparable; both were clean, warm, and staffed by competent, well-trained personnel. The children were well fed and clothed. Yet, although one group thrived, the members of the other group showed poor physical development, did not learn to walk, talk, or care for themselves, and had a very low resistance to disease and infection. Spitz attributed the difference in the groups to the fact that, while the children's mothers were present in one group to care for them, play with them and urge them to learn, the other group lacked this kind of personal attention. This again was clinical judgment; also Spitz's data do not cover a sufficient time span to be regarded as evidence that maternal deprivation permanently affects the character development of children. 218</page><page sequence="11">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN Ear le and Earle (1961) studied a sample of 100 psychiatric patients who had been separated from their mothers before the age of six. They concluded that the early loss of the mother related significantly to childhood behaviour disorder and the later development of socio pathic personality. Earle and Earle found no connection between early maternal deprivation and the relative incidence of other diagnostic categories. Ainsworth (WHO, 1962, p. 116) refers to Wardle's conclusion— from cases in a child guidance clinic—that conduct disorders, including stealing, were significantly more frequent among children from broken homes and among those in intact homes who had been separated from their mothers. Bennett (i960) based her comparative study of delinquent and neu rotic children on 100 case studies. She found that physical parent-child separations " occurred more frequently in delinquents than in neurotics, especially in the early years." " This finding," she adds, " supports Bowlby's observations " (p. 215). Bennett's research is noteworthy in that it referred to father-child as well as mother-child relationships, and to psychologically as well as physically broken relationships. She concluded, in consonance with Ainsworth, that " interruptions " in the emotional relationship between mother and child occurred more fre quently in delinquent than in neurotic children. She added that the same was true, in even greater frequency, for the father-child relationship. Bourne's work (1955), although published five years after Bowlby's monograph, shows the same single-mindedness of thought. He examined 154 consecutive admissions to a mental deficiency hospital. Of those, 138 showed apparent organic disease, so that conclusions could only be based on the remaining sixteen. Twelve of these suffered from maternal deprivation, and from studying this small num ber Bourne concluded that the defective child will present " a history of perverted mothering in infancy. In his first two years he will either have been reared by an extremely disordered person, commonly a psychopath, or else deprived for long and repeated periods of the mother or her substitute; usually he will have suffered both mis fortunes." Wootton (1959, p. 140), reviewing Bourne's work, comments : "the alternative possibility that a child may have inherited the mental abnormalities of his mother is very light-heartedly dis missed." It is clear that treatment of a child whose mental deficiency is at least in part hereditary should differ considerably from the 219</page><page sequence="12">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS treatment of one whose deficiency is environmental. Separation might actually help the former. The doctrinaire rigidity of Bourne's post-WHO investigation is also clear. From those sixteen children classified as feeble-minded, of whom twelve were deprived of their mothers or of adequate mothering, Bourne surmised that maternal deprivation in one form or another may be the cause of occupancy of thousands of beds in mental deficiency hospitals. It would seem extremely difficult to adduce such wide spread effects of maternal deprivation from the evidence presented, unless one were previously convinced of the potent effects of this particular childhood difficulty. The findings of Bowlby and his followers were challenged even before the publication of his monograph. Orlansky (1949), who sur veyed the literature in this field up to 1948, presented findings that are inconclusive and his own conclusion is appropriate: "Analysis of the neonate state has been too much colored by a naive reading-in of adult emotions into the infant which is comparable to the anthro pomorphizing views of insect behavior once current among an earlier generation of biologists." Anthropomorphism in scientific investiga tions is pre-judgment; neither the insect nor the infant are given a chance to demonstrate their own configurations. The theory of maternal deprivation, although elegant in its clarity and simplicity, seems to exhibit the same unfortunate tendency. Taternal deprivation Although there has been a general move away from Bowlby's hypothesis, most researchers have not rejected it completely. Andry (i960), for instance, criticises the maternal-deprivation theorists most strongly for the secondary role they accord to fathers. From his inquiry into aspects of parent-child emotional relationships he con cluded that " it was the inadequacies in their fathers' roles rather more than in their mothers' roles that served to differentiate delinquents from non-delinquents" (p. 126). Andry's starting point—in his examination of parental pathology in a sample of eighty delinquent and eighty non-delinquent boys—was the Bowlbian hypothesis that " delinquents suffered mbre from maternal separations than non-delinquents." This was not confirmed, and the findings regarding paternal and dual-parental separations were also negative. It should be noted, however, that Andry confined his study to 220</page><page sequence="13">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN separations due to illness, evacuation, or the work of the parents. He excluded absences due to death, divorce and separation, thus ruling out much of the very sort of deprivation that clearly contributed to Bowlby's original findings. Andry's investigations do not, therefore, invalidate the maternal-deprivation theory per se; he admits this him self. Perhaps the main contribution of his work lies in its new emphasis on paternal pathology in delinquency, and his contingent conviction that it is necessary to study the roles of both parents rather than the role of one parent alone. It is to his credit that he tried to deepen his questionnaire data by personal interviews, which covered not only thirty delinquent boys and thirty controls but also both parents of each member of this sub-group. He also recognised the distinction between physical and psychological separation, an obvious one it would seem but missed by many investigators and practitioners both before and after the publication of his monograph. But his data do not cover many of the variables that were readily available in Ontario files and are relevant to the problem under present investigation. Although the work of Andry and others of his general persuasion is receiving increasing attention, still the literature as a whole emphasises the mother-child relationship. This is surprising in view of the important part the father-child relationship is considered to play in the resolution of the Oedipal conflict and in subsequent superego development. The maternal-deprivation theorists' interest in the psychoanalytical story of the child stops at about the age of five years. It is after this point that the superego goes through its critical phase of development. The child, particularly the boy, develops his earliest and most decisive ideas abou masculinity from the father, naturally enough. The findings of the study undertaken by the present authors corroborate this common sense notion, as will be shown in due course. The growing boy needs an adequate father-figure with whom to identify and from whom to learn an acceptable pattern of social and sexual behaviour. Through identification with an adult male the boy learns how to temper and exercise his feelings of aggression and love. When a healthy father image is lacking, the child finds it hard to define for himself a proper social and sexual role. Deviant behaviour of the order of aggressive antisocial acts or homosexuality may result. From a theoretical standpoint Janes (1958) discusses the effect of the weak or absent father on personality development. Substantiating research evidence is still scanty, but the following studies may be mentioned. 221</page><page sequence="14">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS Seashore (1961) investigated delinquent and non-delinquent boys and their parents, seeking to relate " conscience strength " in the boys to parent-child relationships and to deviant behaviour. His findings suggested that it was difficult for a boy to develop internal standards strong enough to control delinquent behaviour if the relationship with his father was disturbed. Gregory (1965) suggests that the lack of identification and control normally supplied by the parent of the same sex would have a greater bearing on subsequent delinquency than would any disruption in the relationship with the parent of the opposite sex. Bandura and Walters (1958) studied dependency conflicts in aggres sive delinquents, concentrating on a group of adolescent boys and their parents. They found that in most cases a severe break had occurred in the father-son relationship. This made identification with the father difficult, they noted, and consequently parental values were not com pletely internalised. An extension of the maternal deprivation theory undertaken by Walters, Callagan and Newman (1963) to study the effect of solitary confinement on prisoners was unsuccessful. Elsewhere Walters and Henning (1961) concentrated on sensory rather than either paternal or generalised social deprivation; but several studies by Walters et al. (e.g., 1963) suggest that the influence of the model of the same sex (generally a brother, not a father) can be experimentally demonstrated. In their report Warren and Palmer (1963) show that of a total of 316 delinquents, 98 per cent, were without a father or father-substitute and only 17 per cent, were without a mother or mother-substitute. This high percentage adds credence to other findings (Bandura and Walters, 1958; Janes, 1958; Seashore, 1961) and is further substantiated by Little (1965) in his study of 500 adolescent offenders. Little was unable to demonstrate a clear connection between parental separation in childhood and the variations of the offenders' delinquent careers; however, only 20 per cent, of the group had not been separated at all. Here again paternal separation accounted for two-thirds of the total separations. This study, in contrast to Bowlby, found a concentration of maternal separation after the age of seven. Wilkins (i960) presents a study in factor-analytic rather than psychoanalytic terms; on purely statistical grounds he concludes that perhaps the fourth and fifth years of a child's life are particularly significant, and not, as has been thought in Bowlbian circles, the first three years of life; he suggests that maternal deprivation is an important 222</page><page sequence="15">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN factor in very early life and paternal deprivation important between four and five years of age. A further study, by McCord, McCord and Thurber (1962), started with paternal and ended with mixed—or dual—deprivation. Exploring some effects of absent fathers on boys, they found that the relationship between criminality and paternal absence was mainly a result of the general instability of broken homes, rather than a result of paternal absence in itself. Paternal deprivation can no more be seen in isolation than the maternal variety. The father can deprive the child indirectly through his functioning as a husband. Bartemeier (1953) discusses this, stressing the import ance of the husband meeting his wife's needs so that she can function well in her maternal role (the reverse holds). Bartemeier charges that all too frequently the father's contribution to dissatisfaction in the mother-child relationship has been overlooked. This charge does not discount the importance of the mother's role, but does point to the need for putting the concept of maternal deprivation into a broader perspective. Conclusions It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that all parental deprivation is mixed and probably affected by the interaction between the parents. Mixed deprivation is intellectually untidy and will probably make itself little clearer on more intensive investigation. The beauty of the Bowlby hypothesis of maternal deprivation was its simplicity, for in its extreme forms only one factor was necessary for the diagnosis or prognosis of a delinquent child : the prolonged physical absence of the mother before the child reached a certain age. The substitution of mixed for maternal deprivation would, therefore, seem to cloud the issue. In addition, in its first stages it comes perilously close to the abandonment of all hypotheses whatsoever. For it is a short step from mixed deprivation, from " interacting multi-causation," to the notion that no hypothesis can work because no two broken homes are alike in the misery they create : each must be investigated separately and treated differently. As Tolstoy once said, all happy families are alike; but each unhappy family suffers in its own way. However, it is not that simple. Beneath the surface of the Bowlby hypothesis lurk all sorts of ambiguous definitions. Wootton (1959), to whose thorough critique the reader is referred, expresses it in this way: "The maternal deprivation theory is, moreover, 223</page><page sequence="16">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS generally so loosely expressed as to embrace a number of quite different hypotheses, many of which point to mutually contradictory practical conclusions. The concepts involved are indeed both vague and various; and occasionally also, it must be said, the devices employed to establish their validity are clearly questionable " (p. 147). The permutations which she ably describes at this point are essentially procrustean; sooner or later, the bed does not fit—ultimate failure is inevitable. The concept of mixed deprivation centralises the action of " inter acting multi-causation." The untidiness in which this results is a better approximation of situations in the real world. The dynamics of maternal deprivation tend to adjust case studies to their needs. The dynamics of mixed deprivation are adjustable to the needs and realities of the case studies. Hypotheses, unless they lead to careful experi ments, are merely forms of persuasion, and there is always the danger that they may have deleterious effects on the subject-matter—children, for instance, allocated to the wrong specialised institution, or treated for symptoms whose presumed causes appear clearly only upon aware ness of the presumption. The following study explores the triangularity that exists between a child and his parents. It assumes that both parents must be studied at one and the same time; isolation of any one cause will surely result in opinions that must be regarded as purely speculative. General Methodology The two research problems with which this paper is concerned form part of a larger group study of delinquent children in training schools in Ontario, designed by the senior author and carried out at the University of Toronto in collaboration with the Department of Reform Institutions of the Government of Ontario. The purpose of the pro ject was to establish the extent of parental deprivation in a group of delinquent children, to determine whether paternal deprivation may not be of equal significance with maternal deprivation in the etiology of delinquency, and to examine possible findings that would have sig nificance for the training school treatment programme. The term deprivation, as it is used throughout this article, refers to deficiency in parenting, in the form of permanent or temporary physical absence of a parent from his child or the presence in a relation ship of an inadequate or faulty parent figure. Apart from separations, the research was confined to evidence of a faulty parental image, with or without actual separation; it was not designed to assess or interpret 224</page><page sequence="17">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN the quality of parent-child relationships. The reported fact or con dition of deprivation rather than the degree was studied. Sample The total number of children studied was 288. Of these, 183 were boys, 105 were girls. The population under study was that of the training schools in Ontario; thus, for the purposes of this research, the subjects were defined as " delinquent " by reason of committal to these schools. All training schools in Ontario are operated under provincial legislation known as " The Training Schools Act," which at the time of this study3 specified that any person may bring before a judge any juvenile who is found (a) begging; (b) wandering; (c) destitute; (d) an habitual truant; (e) exposed to an idle and dissolute life by reason of parental neglect or drunkenness; (f) accused or guilty of petty crime; or (g) unmanageable. If the judge, upon inquiry, deemed it advisable to deal with the child under this legislation, he could direct him to be sent to a training school. Furthermore, if a juvenile was found to be a delinquent in accordance with the Juvenile Delinquents Act (Canada), or was convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment under any other law in force in Ontario, he could be committed to a training school. A direct application to the Minister of the Depart ment of Reform Institutions by an agency dealing with a child who was felt to be functioning inadequately in society could also result in committal to a training school. In fact, the majority of the boys were sent to training schools because they persistently committed acts that would be recognised as criminal offences if committed by adults; most girls were sent because of sexually promiscuous or other undesirable behaviour which their parents were unable to control. Thus the definition of a delinquent was primarily behaviour oriented; no regard was given to the motivation underlying the delin quent behaviour. The training schools' administrative staff have no control over admissions; all children committed must be accepted. In practical terms, this means that the schools must serve many children with many different problems. These children display a variety of maladies and malfunctions, running the gamut from chronic disease, physical handicap and psychological illness to immature, irresponsible and The Act was subsequently completely rewritten by a committee of which the senior author was a member. As stated by the Minister of Reform Institutions, the Hon. Allan Grossman (1965), the new Act is based on the empirical evidence furnished by the research project of which this paper describes a part. 225</page><page sequence="18">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS undisciplined behaviour. The children at the training schools covered by the present research were representative of these extremes, and provided a broad base for testing.4 There is, however, one proviso : less serious forms of delinquency may be disposed of by the courts through fines, probation and the like. Our operational definition of juvenile delinquency is, then, that be haviour which resulted in the girls and boys being confined to the training schools under study, namely one school for girls and three for boys. Exclusions All children in the four training schools were included in the research group with the exception of those in the following categories : (a) at the school for less than one month prior to the date of testing; (b) awaiting placement; (c) returned from placement or escape within the last two weeks; (d) subnormal intelligence (I.Q. below 80); (e) poor reading or writing ability (reading level below grade six); (f) marked inability to concentrate; (g) less than age twelve for sociometric ques tionnaire and less than age fourteen for personality test. These children were excluded in order to preserve the validity of the per sonality and sociometric tests used. There were also several accidental exclusions on the day of testing due to illness, etc. Method The techniques used included : (a) examination of case records (by eight graduate students of social work); (b) a behaviour rating scale (by training school staff); (c) a sociometric questionnaire, slightly modified from a previous study by Croft and Grygier (1956), which provided measures of popularity (being frequently chosen as friend), rejection (being frequently disliked), acceptance (being liked more often than rejected), and emotional involvement (a sum of pre ferences and rejections); (d) a personality test (Grygier, 1956) which includes thirty mea sures of tendencies, sublimations, reaction formations and 4 In a survey undertaken in i960 by the Training Schools Advisory Board the following were to be found in Ontario Training Schools : epileptic children, diabetic children, psychotic children awaiting transfer, retarded children awaiting transfer, emotionally disturbed children, psychopathic adolescents, potential schizophrenics, pregnant girls, and a deaf-mute, in addition to the more " normal " cases of delinquency. 226</page><page sequence="19">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN defence mechanisms associated with various patterns of per sonality development, masculine and feminine identifications, some patterns of mature interests, and two aspects of ego strength; all measures are reflected in standard scores (stens), which together provide a personality profile. To organise the collecting and recording of information from the various tests and from the case histories, a special Sheet of Variables (33 in all) to be used for each child was compiled. Since the variables did not cover adoptive or foster parents, or kinds of parental behaviour, a Sheet of Comments was appended to allow a more accurate recording of data. The 19 variables relevant to this monograph are listed below : General—8 1. Name of the training school. 2. Sub-group (name of the house in school divided into such). 5-9. Sociometric scores and behaviour ratings. 33. Identification mark. Note ; In subsequent analysis the personality and sociometric test data were utilised for the girls but not for the boys; they failed to yield significant results and are therefore not included in this present list. Variables concerning father—4 22. Father separated from the child by death; age of child at the time of father's death was noted, or stated as " un known," i.e., indicated by a question mark. Note : In a few cases, where death of father was known to have occurred before the child was five, the age was noted as &lt;5. 24. Father permanently separated from the child by divorce, separation order or desertion; age of child at the time of such separation was noted. Note : If the child was illegitimate or if for any other reason the father was never with the child, age was given as o. If permanent separation was known to have occurred, but there was no record as to the child's age at the time, the age was indicated as unknown (by a question mark). In subsequent scoring, these cases were entered in both the under-five and the over-five age categories but allotted only half frequency, thereby reducing error. 22 7</page><page sequence="20">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS 27. Father's temporary absence from home, if either prolonged or frequent; again the age range of the child at the time of father's absence was noted if known. Note: If the child's precise age at the time of separation was not known, an age range was indicated either by hyphenated numbers or, less specifically, by a number followed by a plus sign. In the latter instance, if the figure showed the separation to have begun at an early age, it was taken to mean that temporary absence of the father con tinued as a recurrent event throughout the child's life. In the analysis of Master Sheet data, repeated temporary absences were counted as permanent separations on the assumption that the former could be as harmful as the latter. Bennett's finding that delinquent children " have suffered from repeated separations rather than from one single, traumatic separation " (i960, p. 215) lends support to such an assumption. If an entry was noted for a child on the Master Sheet under both variables 24 and 27, only that pertaining to permanent separation was utilised in later calculations. 29. Indication of lack of father image without actual physical separation. Note : All evidence for this was noted on the Sheet of Comments. Each questionable interpretation was re-examined in consultation with the senior author and, on the basis of the evidence, either discarded or used. As in court, evidence was accepted as sufficient only if it was strong enough to leave no " reasonable doubt " in the minds of the judges. Variables concerning mother—4 Note : Where appropriate, all explanatory remarks made above in relation to the father are also applicable to the variables concerning the mother. 23. Mother separated from the child by death; age of child at the time of mother's death was noted, categorised as &lt;5 or &gt;£, or stated as " unknown." 25. Mother permanently separated from the child by divorce, separation order or desertion; age of child at the time of such separation was noted. 228</page><page sequence="21">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN Note: If the mother was never with the child because it was illegitimate or for any other reason the age was given as o. 28. Mother's temporary absence from home, if either prolonged or frequent; age range of child at the time of mother's absence was noted. Note: A temporary absence that extended over an exceedingly long period in the child's life was later interpreted in the same way as the recurrent temporary absences, explained above under 27. It was considered to be of the same import as permanent separation and counted as such in the next stage of data analysis. When the time span of a temporary absence extended on either side of age five, the case was subsequently scored in both the under-five and over-five age categories, but weighted only half frequency in order to reduce error. A case with an entry under both variables 25 and 28 on the Master Sheet was later scored only for permanent separation, as previously explained; when the recorded figures were both over and under age five, the final scoring was only for the lower age. 30. Indication of lack of mother image without actual physical separation. Again all evidence for this was noted on the Sheet of Comments, and scoring was subject to consultation with the senior author. Note: Inability of the mother to manage the household was included here. Variables concerning both parents—3 26. Child temporarily absent from home for a long period; age range of the child at the time of absence from home was noted. By home we meant here the full natural family or a part of it. Note: Generally, the explanations of these entries are similar to those already given for other variables. When an entry concerning separation appeared only under this variable, it referred to a break from both parents, but when separation of a parent was recorded under another variable as well, 26 then referred only to the remaining parent. Permanent separation of the child from home was noted in variables 22 to 25 as separations of the father and the mother from the child. 229</page><page sequence="22">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS 31. Indication of mother dominance in terms of power, respon sibility, income, etc. Included in such indications were the power of making main decisions about the family, exer cising discipline in major as well as in minor matters, or sole responsibility for providing income from which the family is maintained, even if this is only an allowance and the father makes a substantial income but does not con tribute to the maintenance of the family. Note: In fact, information pertinent to this variable was not reliable. It was noted in only ten cases for the boys and, with one exception, there was always more fully documented information, recorded under variable 29, regarding the inadequacy of the father. For this reason, variable 31 was not utilised in the analysis of the data or included in the reproduction of the Master Sheets. 32. Indication in the record that one or both parents have or had a strong wish for the child to be of the other sex. Note : It was expected that this variable might produce some evidence concerning an attitude of rejection on the part of a parent. In fact, such information was so rarely available from the files that this variable also was omitted in the analysis of the data. Grouping of variables for analysis. The information recorded within the scheme of the above variables was grouped into the following cate gories, equal weight being given to the mother and the father : (a) Death : The only deaths significant for this research were those that deprived the child of the parental figure. If a divorced or separated parent died, this death was presumed to have less direct significance and was not recorded on the Sheet of Vari ables, but it was mentioned on the Sheet of Comments. (b) Termanent separation from the child other than death : The parent's permanent separation from the child by divorce, separation order or desertion; or a constantly recurring or extremely prolonged temporary separation of the parent from the child. (c) Temporary separation from the child : The parent's temporary but not constantly recurring or extremely prolonged separation from the child. (d) Faulty image of the parent : See the comment to variables 29 230</page><page sequence="23">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN and 30 for a description of the means used to determine what was considered to be a faulty image. The first three categories above (a), (b) and (c), which describe events, were further subdivided according to the age of the child at the time of separation. As so much of the recent literature has emphasised the importance of separation taking place before the age of five, the division was made along that age line. The fourth cate gory, faulty parental image, is not an event, and could not be so subdivided. A distinction was made between permanent separation resulting from death, as opposed to that resulting from any other cause, because of the probable differences in family situations preceding the two types of separation : death was not necessarily preceded by family frictions and disruptions, as would probably be the case with divorce, desertion, etc. In this report symptomatic behaviour on the part of a parent is defined as pathology of the parent or parent-child relationship but it must be realised that this view represents an over-simplification. If a father leaves the family and his separation from the child is recorded it appears that, in the absence of any other evidence, all pathology is on his side. In fact he may be driven out of his home by his wife and denied the custody of his children by a judge. Similarly, if the mother's mental health breaks down and is recorded as her inadequacy or absence through hospitalisation, the cause may lie in part with the father or with economic distress. The research design aimed at minimising such distortions of statistical representation—only gross pathology in the form of mental illness, criminality, alcoholism, chronic unemployment or abnormal degree of failure in taking care of the children was recorded—but intrinsic complications of interaction processes are far beyond the scope of this study. Effects of Parental Deprivation on Girls As we have seen, most of the literature on parental deprivation deals with the maternal variety. Our concern in these two research projects was with the effect of parental deprivation in general. We tried to measure the effects of both the maternal and the paternal varieties and to assess their relative importance. We are concerned here with the first project (Wilson, 1962), which dealt with the effect of parental deprivation on delinquent girls; the 231</page><page sequence="24">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS second project (Chesley, 1964), which dealt with delinquent boys, will be discussed later. Preliminaries The Ontario Training School for girls that we studied held approxi mately 200 children in 1962, most of them twelve years of age or older. They resided in four " houses." They shared one common factor; they were judged to be in a state of delinquency or to be in need of the sort of training juvenile delinquents receive. The operational definition of juvenile delinquency was stated as that behaviour which resulted in girls being confined to the training school. In most cases this meant sexually promiscuous or other undesirable behaviour that neither the girls' parents nor social agencies were able to control. The working hypotheses were as follows: parental pathology is measurable; it may contribute to juvenile delinquency; maternal depri vation is usually accompanied by pathology in the child's relationship with her father, and vice versa. In this study 105 girls were tested, their behaviour rated and their files examined. Results Table 1 may serve as an introduction to this section. In the Table " pure " means pathology noted only in the child's relationship with the parent indicated, " mixed " means pathology noted in the child's relationship with both parents (though not necessarily of the same type). Table i Incidence of Parental Deprivation of Training School Girls Paternal Deprivation Maternal Deprivation Pure Mixed Total Pure Mixed Death 2 9 11 1 12 Permanent separation 9 38 47 1 25 Temporary separation 8 1 90 7 Faulty image 19 12 31 4 24 When analysing the above table one must remember that it reports incidence and not cases of deprivation. This is particularly important 232</page><page sequence="25">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN if one compares figures on mixed deprivation. The total number of children suffering from mixed paternal deprivation must, logically, equal the number suffering from mixed maternal deprivation—indeed the children themselves must be the same in the two groups. But in this table the incidence of mixed maternal deprivation is higher: maternal deprivation, whenever it occurred, tended to be accompanied by other types of deprivation, both paternal and maternal—such cases were scored twice for the one child suffering from mixed maternal deprivation but only once for the same child for mixed paternal deprivation. All cases of overlap between different types of deprivation involved faulty parental image and either tem porary or permanent separation. Since the overlap was more in maternal deprivation, it follows—and the examination of the actual data confirms this inference—that maternal separation in our popula tion was frequently accompanied by faulty maternal care: mothers who were permanently separated from their children had been poor mothers before separation; mothers temporarily separated tended to give pathologically inadequate mothering when they were with their children. In addition, they had husbands who were poor or non existent fathers. In this context maternal separation alone, whether permanent or temporary, loses its significance even further. If it does occur, it presumably does not lead to delinquency, at least of the type that results in placement in one of the training schools in Ontario. As will be shown, there is no substantial difference in this respect between our data on boys and those on girls. (a) Death Death of the father, no maternal pathology: one father died in the pre-five group and one died in the post-five group. This is of no statistical significance. In the mixed pathology category no fathers died in the pre-five group, but nine did so in the post-five group. So if the father's death is to have any significance at all, it is likely to occur later in the child's life and to be associated with the mother-child pathology. Death of the mother, no paternal pathology; no mothers died in the pre-five group, and one died in the post-five group. This is of no statistical significance. In the mixed pathology category eight mothers died in the pre-five group, and four in the post-five group. The situation, then, is similar to that of the father's death : the mother's death will almost invariably 233</page><page sequence="26">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS have significance only if it occurs along with father-child pathology; but, in contrast with the death of the father, it may have more import if it occurs before the child is five. So death per se is not significant. On its own it occurs too rarely to have a statistically significant effect on making these training school girls delinquent. It may only have an effect if it is accompanied by a faulty relationship with the surviving parent. (b) Permanent separation from the child other than death Paternal separation: eight fathers were permanently separated in the pre-five group without accompanying maternal pathology, and one in the post-five group. This again is a low frequency. Isolated father separation is relatively insignificant. Twenty-seven fathers were permanently separated in the pre-five group and eleven in the post-five group with accompanying maternal pathology. This considerably larger frequency points to the conclu sion that permanent separation may be an important factor in the etiology of juvenile delinquency. The fact that this frequency falls under the heading of mixed pathology is also significant. The sig nificance of this sort of separation taken in isolation, without accompanying complications in the mother-child relationship, is comparatively minor. Maternal separation: there was only one case of a mother's per manent separation from her child without accompanying paternal pathology. This was in the pre-five group and is of no statistical significance. Fourteen mothers in the pre-five group and eleven in the post-five group were permanently separated from their children with accompanying paternal pathology. This is of sufficient frequency to warrant attention. As mentioned before, the separating parent had usually been in adequate before the physical break. There was also evidence of prior personal inadequacy and/or other pathology in both parents—not just in the one leaving the home. Permanent separation almost never occurs in isolation. It occurs frequently enough with accompanying pathology both in the separated and in the remaining parent to be con sidered a significant influence, and it occurs predominantly in the earlier years of a child's life. (c) Temporary separation from the child Paternal deprivation : only one case occurred in the pre-five group and it was accompanied by maternal deprivation. All eight cases in 234</page><page sequence="27">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN the post-five group were " pure," but six of the eight fathers involved were inadequate. The significant factor here is the faulty father image. It can be hazarded at this point that it is not so much separation that influences the behaviour of the training school girls : it is the continued presence of the father as an inadequate male image. Maternal deprivation: temporary separation of the mother was equally rare. All seven cases were accompanied by paternal pathology and affected girls after the age of five. In none of these cases was the mother image noted as being previously faulty or inadequate. For this group of girls temporary mother separation always occurs along with paternal pathology. It is possible that temporary separation of the mother alone does not lead to the variety of juvenile delinquency that results in confinement in a training school. In neither group studied was temporary separation from a parent a factor of major significance. Almost invariably it occurred along with a factor of major significance, or at least some other pathology. (d) Faulty parental image Paternal : there were nineteen cases of faulty father image without and twelve cases with accompanying maternal pathology. In seventeen cases out of this total of thirty-one the mother was noted as being domineering, and in all but three this was clearly linked with the father's inadequacy. Maternal : there were four cases of faulty mother image without and twenty-four cases with accompanying paternal pathology. According to our files inadequate fathers tended to have domineering wives, but inadequate mothers tended either to remain married to inadequate husbands or to be deserted by their husbands. Out of forty-three inadequate mothers, natural and adoptive, thirty-five were married to inadequate fathers or were deserted by them. Of the remaining eight husbands two were dead. So the inadequate father image seems to be of considerable sig nificance. Inadequate mother image seems of less importance unless accompanied by divorce, desertion, etc., or faulty father image. Summary Death on its own is rare and non-significant. It is usually accom panied by pathology in the remaining parent. Permanent separation is rarely unmixed. Of seventy-three cases only ten could be considered 23 S</page><page sequence="28">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS relatively pure (of which nine were of the father). The total of per manent-separation cases was tested for significance to determine the relative frequency of separation from the father and the mother; it proved to be significant at the i per cent, level of confidence. Thus permanent separation from the father is more frequent than permanent separation from the mother, but the frequency is high for both. Tem porary separation is not significant. The data on faulty parental image provide the second significant set of findings. An inadequate father image seems more likely to con tribute to delinquency (which we have defined narrowly) than a faulty mother image, since it was noted much more frequently in the records (x2 = 11-803, P &lt;0-001; correction for continuity was applied); but a significantly high frequency does not necessarily indicate the cause. Application of sociometric, behaviour and personality test data Since the group with evidence of pure paternal pathology was the only pure one of sufficient size (27 cases) to allow statistical analysis, it was compared with the group showing no evidence of paternal pathology, either pure or mixed. The latter group consisted of the following : the only four cases of relatively pure maternal pathology; four cases where no obvious lack of the father was noted except for short absences; and the ten cases showing no evidence of pathology on either side. The sociometric scores and behaviour ratings of these two broad groups were compared. Except for a few omissions due to invalid tests, the two groupings could also be compared in terms of the Likes and Interests Test. All the mean scores of the first group were statis tically analysed and compared with the mean scores of the second group. No differences between these two sets were statistically significant. In terms of the sociometric score, the behaviour rating, and the likes and interests test, therefore, there were no differences between girls showing evidence of pure paternal pathology and those showing no evidence of paternal pathology of any kind. Preliminary Conclusions This first research project performed a generally negative task. It showed that the parental deprivations it studied were nearly always mixed, and unless mixed were statistically unimportant. The parental pathology of these delinquent girls was almost invariably 236</page><page sequence="29">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN complex. Although a history of paternal pathology was particularly frequent among them it was usually accompanied by maternal pathology; paternal pathology as such could not be differentiated by tests from the other varieties, mixed and pure, with which it was com pared. Paternal pathology in these girls was, therefore, measurable only in the sense that it could be classified and its frequency determined. Pure maternal pathology hardly ever occurred in our data, and the nature and complexity of family background and social history make the purity of the paternal pathology discovered here quite dubious. The files of the Ontario Training Schools are necessarily incomplete, and apparent non-existence of pathology is not proof of actual non existence. This supposition is strengthened by the further supposition that it is unlikely for severe pathology in one parent not to have social and psychological effects on the other parent. Lack of file proof is thus by no means conclusive, and we incline to the alternative assump tion : purity is a wild goose chase. Effects of Parental Deprivation in Boys This research project followed and complemented the first, though on a larger scale, and was completed in 1964. As psychoanalytic theory places far more importance on the boy's relations with the father than on the girl's, it was hoped that this project would produce more defini tive conclusions. This hope was not in vain. Our concern again was with both maternal and paternal deprivation. Preliminaries The working hypothesis was essentially the same : parental pathology is measurable and may contribute to juvenile delinquency; maternal deprivation is generally accompanied by pathology in the child's relationship with his father and vice versa. The working definition of delinquency was also the same. Delin quents were so defined by reason of their having been sent to a training school. This project, however, was able to examine a wider range of presumed delinquents, as it was possible to test 183 boys housed in three separate Ontario Training Schools (contrasted with 105 girls in only one school), and the range of behaviour that resulted in a court order was also wider. The first school serves boys under the age of fourteen at the time of admission. Two of the seven cottages or " houses " were used in the study. The second school serves boys over fourteen years of age. 237 B.J.C.—10</page><page sequence="30">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS Five out of six houses were used from this school, in which the boys were grouped according to their age and maturity. (The sixth house was a reception centre, with a transient population.) The third school is a maximum security school for all boys in the Province who cannot adjust to the open settings of the other training schools or who are placed there directly because their delinquency is particularly serious. The forty-eight boys in this school are housed in single rooms under one roof. The previous research study amply demonstrated by its results the fact that full and pertinent information may not always be contained in the records, which were not written with research projects specifi cally in mind. In addition, the reliability of information is dependent upon the identity of the informant—this unreliability is most apparent and most dangerous in establishing clear instances of faulty parental image. All possible precautions were taken, however, including consultations and extended discussions of individual borderline cases before the final decisions were made. Results Table 2 may serve as an introduction to this section.

In the mixed pathology group five fathers died in the pre-five group and six in the post-five group. The distribution between pure and mixed categories was about equal, and together made up only n per cent, of all children. Death of the mother, no paternal pathology : one mother died in the pre-five group, one died in the post-five group. In the mixed pathology group two mothers died in the post-five group. Only 2 per cent, of all cases are accounted for here. Maternal death is not statistically significant. Paternal deaths occurred five times more often than maternal, so the higher proportion of deaths occurred among parents of the same sex as the sample of children. Whether or not this is significant is open to speculation. Although more mothers than fathers died among the sample of girls described in the previous section, the proportion is nothing like so high as in the present study. The distribution of deaths between the pre- and post-five groups was fairly equal. This is unexpected on purely statistical grounds, if only because of the greater number of years involved in the post-five groups, but its significance could not be determined. (b) Termanent separation from the parent other than death Paternal separation : permanent father-child separation occurred in sixty-seven cases, of which seventeen were pure and fifty showed accompanying maternal pathology. These figures break down as follows : in the pre-five group, 8 y2 pure cases and 34 ]/2 mixed; in the post-five group, 8 y2 pure cases and 15% mixed." Permanent separation from the father per se does not seem signifi cant, representing less than 10 per cent, of the population. It occurs three times more frequently in conjunction with maternal pathology— in other words it is important when mixed. Maternal separation: all forty-eight cases of permanent maternal deprivation showed some sort of accompanying paternal pathology. There was not one pure case. Of the forty-eight cases twenty-nine were in the pre-five group, nineteen in the post-five group. A case in which the date of separation was uncertain was treated as a half pre-five and a half post-five. 239</page><page sequence="32">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS All maternal deprivation belonged to the mixed variety, 47 per cent, of all cases, and would thus seem of etiological import in the delinquent behaviour under study. The total number almost equals the incidence of mixed paternal separation. When there is permanent physical separation of the child from one parent, it is likely there will be some physical and/or psychological deprivation involving the other parent. Although the ratio of isolated paternal separation to the maternal variety is 17:0, there may be (as we noted previously) some bias in the data. Both in permanent paternal separation (twenty-four of sixty-seven cases) and in permanent maternal separation (nineteen of forty-eight cases), over one-third of the separating parents provided inadequate parental images before the physical break. This finding is expanded later in Table 6. If the whole system of parent-child relations breaks down, it seems to do so relatively early in the lives of delinquent boys. The same tendency was noted in the study on girls. Two inferences are possible : a breakdown is less harmful if it occurs later; or breakdowns tend to occur early in all families, not only in those of delinquent children. (c) Temporary separation from the parent Paternal deprivation : of the twenty-two cases of temporary paternal deprivation, the pre-five group had one pure and 1y2 mixed cases, and the post-five group had four pure and 15% mixed cases. Isolated temporary paternal separation, because of its infrequency, has little bearing. It occurred three times as often in conjunction with maternal pathology but is still relatively insignificant, both types together (pure and mixed) representing only 12 per cent, of all cases studied. Maternal deprivation: of the twenty-one cases of temporary maternal separation, the pre-five group had no pure and only 2 y2 cases accompanied by paternal pathology, and the post-five group had one pure and 17 y2 mixed cases. To be significant, temporary maternal separation must be accom panied by paternal pathology. Even when it is thus accompanied it is relatively unimportant, especially in the pre-five group; altogether temporary separation from the mother represented only 11 per cent, of all cases under study. So, most cases of temporary separation from either parent were mixed, as were the cases of permanent separation. Although more 240</page><page sequence="33">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN instances (to a ratio of 5 : i) of pure paternal separation were discovered, the frequencies were very low. In permanent separation, most cases occurred in the pre-five groups. Here the opposite is the case. Most of the temporarily separating parents (fifteen of twenty-two paternal and eleven of twenty-one maternal cases) had provided in adequate parental images before the physical break; they presumably continued to do so after the reunion(s). (d) Faulty parental image Paternal: of the seventy-two cases of this description twenty-six were pure and forty-six showed evidence of accompanying maternal pathology. Faulty paternal image seems to be important. Its frequency in each category is relatively high, and the pure variety occurs far more frequently here than in other types of deprivation. Altogether, an inadequate father image showed in 52 per cent, of all cases of paternal deprivation. Maternal: of the sixty cases of faulty maternal image six were pure and fifty-four mixed, a ratio of 1:9. A faulty mother image occurred in 58 per cent, of all cases of maternal deprivation, but hardly ever in pure form. The conclusion is that while it may have some pathogenic significance it is invariably linked with some sort of paternal deprivation. It may be that without paternal deprivation it hardly ever contributes to juvenile delinquency; but it is also possible that maternal pathology of this type is so power ful that it spills over to the father as well as to the children, that it positively induces total family breakdown. This we may never know. Most cases were mixed. Evidence of either maternal or paternal inadequacy is evidence of the likelihood of pathology in the partner. In pure form the approximate ratio of inadequate fathers to inadequate mothers was 4:1, but the true significance of this ratio remains unknown. Maternal pathology is seldom isolated, at least in this sample; yet isolation of maternal pathology is precisely what the maternal-depriva tion theorists demand. Summary Death is a rare factor in this group. It is usually accompanied by pathology in the remaining parent. This conclusion is identical with 241</page><page sequence="34">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS that on the same subject in the previous section. The remaining con clusions are also either identical or similar. Permanent separation is rarely unmixed and is generally significant; it is more frequent on the part of fathers. Temporary separation is less frequent and less significant. Faulty parental image appears to be at least as important as permanent separation: here, too, more fathers were involved. Maternal, paternal and mixed deprivation Some form of parental deprivation was shown by 79 per cent of the boys tested. Table 3 breaks this down : it deals with the population studied and shows eight cases of pure maternal, forty-two cases of pure paternal and ninety-five cases of mixed deprivation. Altogether 145 out of 183 children were therefore deprived of adequate parental care. The fact that 21 per cent, of the boys seemed free of parental deprivation suggests, however, that such deprivation, although probably important, is not the only pathogenic factor in delinquency. This finding supports the theory of multiple causation.

In the conclusion to the previous section we discussed the dubiousness of even 242</page><page sequence="35">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN these pure cases.

Paternal deprivation occurred five times as often as maternal deprivation. To determine statistically the association between paternal and maternal deprivation, the chi-square test was applied, based on data selected from Table 3 and presented in Table 5.

That is to say, the presence of paternal deprivation tends to be accompanied by maternal deprivation and vice versa. The following findings and tables supplement the previous discussions : i. Frequency of Faulty Parental Image. Table 6 presents a break down of the 132 cases of faulty parental image. These figures suggest a high frequency of co-existence of inadequate parenting and physical separation. This increases even further when the maternal and paternal deprivation are pooled together: only six teen cases of inadequate parental image showed no separation from at least one parent. 243</page><page sequence="36">T.

Within the framework of this study it is not possible to determine which factor may be the more damaging. But this study does point out the danger of focusing on physical separa tion taken in isolation. Other variables intrude and may not be coeval with physical separation but prior to it. 3. Association between paternal separation and maternal depriva tion. The hypothesis that an inadequate father would be married to a depriving mother was not supported. This particular sample showed no statistically significant correlation. It was not expected that a father, though not inadequate, who leaves a child would leave it with a depriving mother. Table 9 was given the chi-square test, but this time the results were highly significant: x3 = 36-265; p &lt;0001.

Preliminary conclusions The findings of this research on boys committed to Ontario Training Schools emphasise the role of the father in the etiology of juvenile delinquency. Although maternal deprivation was present in the majority of the cases (56 per cent.), it seldom occurred without some distortion in the accompanying father-child relationship. Paternal deprivation was represented in more cases (75 per cent, of the sample) than maternal and occurred in pure form five times as frequently. This seems to indicate that paternal deprivation may have significance 245</page><page sequence="38">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS equal to and perhaps even greater than that of maternal deprivation as a possible pathogenic factor in delinquency, but it may merely reflect a greater tendency in the general population for fathers to deprive their families. Conclusions and Implications It is dangerous to generalise about the causes of delinquency; each case is the product of a différent setting. But it is generally accepted that the shaping of behaviour patterns and the emotional experiences provided by the family unit play a major role in a child's later life. If a family is happy the children have the basic requirements for developing to the best of their ability. Whatever the role of socio economic conditions in the etiology of delinquency, most psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers believe unsatisfactory human relation ships in the home to be the prime cause of maladjustment. If the child misses the satisfaction of a complete relationship—especially, it is believed, with his mother—he is discontented and frustrated, and in a desire for fulfilment turns unwittingly in the direction of delinquency. The history of research on the origins of crime shows a high con centration on the role played by the mother and its contribution to the etiology of delinquency. Traditionally the father's role in the early years of childhood is thought of primarily in terms of the eco nomic and emotional support he affords the mother. Investigators have tended to pay little heed to the pre-oedipal relationship between father and child, and have treated the mother-infant relationship as crucial and its breakdown as irremediable. This emphasis or bias has, of course, made an impact on psychiatry, casework, and hospital administration—and this impact has been dangerous. The evidence on which administrators and psychiatrists have been making decisions was not only simplistic with regard to deprivation, but was also col lected almost exclusively from boys and applied, with excessive con fidence, to both sexes. However, with the gradual expansion of therapeutic and theoretical concern to the family as the prime medium of personality development, it has become obvious that fathers as well as mothers affect the child's pattern of maturation—and that the needs of girls are different from those of boys. The findings of the present study come from research which eliminated bias of the sort we have been criticising. The research was conducted with both delinquent boys and delinquent girls, and the results were similar for both sexes. Permanent separation from both 246</page><page sequence="39">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN parents is more frequent—and presumably more important—be fore the age of five. Permanent separation from the father is more frequent whether it appears earlier or later in life. In other words, if frequency of occurrence is the criterion, the first years of life are most important—as expected; and the father is more important than the mother—contrary to usual expectations.

Even a correlation is no proof of causality and in our data any evidence of association between paternal separation and delinquency is entirely lacking and could not possibly, in the framework adopted, be obtained. What we have is the incidence of separation. High as it is, it may merely mean that in the general population fathers are more ready than mothers to abandon their children. In cases of separation or divorce mothers usually get the custody of the children while fathers become separated by law. These may be sufficient reasons for sex differences in our data and they may have nothing to do with delinquency. There is no such marked difference with regard to temporary separation.

In the case of girls all but two cases of maternal separation showed evidence of disruption of the father-daughter relationship. Among the delinquent boys studied, paternal pathology existed in abundance and occurred with even greater frequency than maternal deprivation. It can be seen that both parental roles are important and the significance of one can be understood only in relation to the other. The predominantly mixed character of the parental deprivation data analysed in this research suggests that some well-meant approaches to social problems such as delinquency may have failed because they were based on over-simplified, if convenient, assumptions. By itself, prolonged or permanent separation of a child from his mother cannot be assumed to have the disastrous consequences ascribed to it by some authors. It may be the result rather than the cause of a child's disturbed interpersonal relations. More often than not it is a symptom that the whole family unit is functioning in a pathogenic manner, and therefore the whole unit should be studied and possibly treated. Casework intervention that concentrates on the mother alone and ignores the strength of the family functioning as a unit may increase the already existing disparity between the two parental roles, and the result may be detrimental rather than beneficial. The frequency of an inadequate or absent father in the family back ground of juvenile delinquents suggests that in many instances casework with problem families should depart from the traditional model. Instead of female caseworkers concentrating on the social effectiveness of the mothers, we may need more male workers concentrating on the fathers. Even more pertinent than the sex of the social worker may be his (or her) understanding of the interlocking pathology and of the need either to find and treat the father or to replace him. The frequency of inadequate or absent fathers in the families of girls placed in training schools carries implications for the staffing of training schools and other institutions for female offenders. Modern 248</page><page sequence="41">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN therapy emphasises interpersonal relations; and it was the relationship with an adequate adult male that was found lacking in most girls in training schools. The findings of this research have contributed to the unprecedented appointment of a male social worker as the superin tendent of an Ontario reformatory for women, and another man as the superintendent of a training school for girls. The findings of this study do not prove that the role of the father outweighs that of the mother : our data are based, as are all scientific data, not on facts but merely on observations, and in this case a bias favouring the mothers and blaming the fathers cannot be excluded. Even if we accepted file data as facts, it is probable that the frequency of paternal deprivation exceeds that of maternal deprivation in all social strata of our society and is just as frequent in the families of neurotic and normal children as it is in cases of juvenile delinquency. It may be that authority—symbolised by the father—is even more important for healthy social development than parental love, mainly vested in the mother. But it is inconceivable how a happy and socially adjusted person can develop without both—authority and love—making their lasting imprint from early childhood. Without love it is impossible to accept authority, save in the most rudimentary and superficial manner. Without authority it is impossible to channel and control one's drives. If one of them is needed first, it is probably love—so our data imply—but the blend of love and authority, present in all well functioning united families, is essential very early in the formative years of the child. What is shown in this study is the danger of focusing exclusively on one parent as possibly pathogenic, and of predetermining in this way conclusions for which no objective scientific basis can possibly be found; whenever the focus is on the parent whose pathology is relatively less frequently observed this danger is increased. Both physical separation and faulty parental image occurred so often in the history of the delinquent children, and so often overlapped, that it was impossible to determine whether physical separation alone contributed in any way to a child's unhappiness and emotional starva tion; in many cases physical separation was likely to be the symptom rather than the cause of disturbed relations, and in some cases it might have reduced the emotional deprivation of the child rather than increased it. The frequency of parental deprivation in the life history of delin quent children suggests that, at least at the stage at which the children 249</page><page sequence="42">T. GRYGIER, JOAN CHESLEY and ELIZABETH WILSON TUTERS have been removed from their homes by court order and placed in special institutions, such as training schools in Canada and the United States, or approved schools in England, there is a permanent need to make the institution as good a substitute for a well functioning family as is possible. It is obvious that a small institution would serve such a purpose better than a large one, and indirect statistical evidence confirms this assumption; it has been found (Cossom, 1964; Grygier, 1966) that the therapeutic impact of the institution correlates nega tively with the institution's size; in other words, the smaller the institu tion the greater the beneficial impact upon the children. It is also apparent that the staff of any institution which is to act as a substitute for the whole family should contain personnel of both sexes, and we are pleased to report here that these implications of our study have been reported to the Minister of Reform Institutions, Pro vince of Ontario, and have helped in developing a new treatment centre for young boys of the type that would be classified in England as being " beyond control " of their parents or " in need of care and protection." The new institution is small, is divided into separate cottages in which the number of children does not exceed that of a large family, and is served by personnel in which men and women are about equally represented (the boys need mother figures as well as father figures in their substitute families). Preliminary data suggest that—according to short-term measures—the new institution is more effective than any other in Ontario. Old residential houses appear to be ideal for this type of setting. The data on parental deprivation show with particular clarity the importance of co-ordinated studies which alone can avoid the pitfalls of exclusive interest in one pathogenic factor, one " cause of delin quency," or one element of treatment. Isolated findings may lead to conclusions for which there is no objective scientific basis. The practical implications of this study as listed above may be regarded as going too far : the relative importance of the parents' roles in the etiology of juvenile delinquents has not been proved, either in this or in any other research. But most scientific evidence is of a negative character; statistical checks tend to disprove rather than prove hypo theses. This is also the case with this study : it tends to disprove the relative importance of the mother rather than to prove that the father is more important. Can we act upon evidence of this nature? It is our view that action is possible since, as Karl Popper (1959) said, all scientific hypotheses remain tentative for ever. If hypo 250</page><page sequence="43">PARENTAL DEPRIVATION : A STUDY OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN theses are tentative, so should be social action based on them : research can lead to a change in social policy or legislation, but further research is needed to assess the consequences of such a change.
