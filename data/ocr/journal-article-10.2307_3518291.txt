<plain_text><page sequence="1">NISHAD PATNAIK* The Politics of Essence The words 'origin' (Ursprung) 'beginning' (Anfang), 'nearness to the origin' (nahe dem Ursprung), 'return to the origin' form the leitmotif of Heidegger's texts. At the end of 'The Origin of the Work of Art' the following lines from 'The Journey'1, by Holderin appear, 'reluctantly that which dwells near its origin, abandons its site'. What are we to make of these lines? How is this an 'infallible sign' for 'this either- or decision' that 'still confronts the Germans as a test to be stood'2, and why the Germans? The notion of the origin as the arena of 'fundamental decisions', is inescapably political. Yet it is also what remains the most problematic and unclear. What calls for further thought and which we can only raise as a question here is; does Heidegger, despite his incredible sensitivity and refinement in this regard fall prey to a metaphysics of spirit in the very process of opposing it? In 'Time and Being' Heidegger explicitly denies the understanding of origin in any dialectical sense, as implying the originary unity of Being from which the self-othering of beings in unconcealment occurs. We will try and read the political in Heidegger's thought as a certain privileging of the spirit, which although not amounting to a return to the (unreflected) unity of spirit (which would be an impossible undertaking), is a return to an origin in the sense of an original dignity of spirit, its proper essence as thinking, poetizing etc. that is lost in the technical/metaphysical understanding of nature and man. What is certain is that the political cannot be thought independently of these concerns. I Let us, along with Heidegger, 'attempt to think Being without regard to its being grounded in terms of beings'3. Being is not a thing in being, rather Being is what first lets 'beings be', lets them appear * Research Scholar, New School University, New York. Social Scientist, Vol. 31, Nos. 1-2, Jan.-Feb. 2003</page><page sequence="2">86 SOCIAL SCIENTIST as present. Being presences beings. Therefore Being manifests itself only in and through beings. Yet in making beings present it simultaneously hides itself, since it is nowhere in being; and moreover it also gets interpreted in terms of beings. This double covering over is not simply a forgetfulness of the question of Being but a forgetfulness of that forgetfulness. The question of Being unfolds within the 'transcendental-horizonal' structure of this 'dialectic' (without synthesis) of unconcealment and concealment. Moreover the unconcealment of Being, as the open region where beings show themselves, has time as its transcendental horizon. 'Being is determined as presence by time'4. The relation between 'Being' and 'time' is crucial to our argument and must be clarified as far as possible. Since Being is not 'objective being' that is a thing in being, it is not a thing in time, as that which exists for some time and then passes away. Similarly time is not 'objective time', as that which passes away and can be measured in various ways. For it is in passing away that 'time remains as time'5. Consequently just as Being is determined by time (though it is not a thing and therefore temporal), time is determined by Being (though it is not a thing). If 'Being' and 'time' are understood as transcendent, (here Hiedegger emphasizes the literal formulation of the idiom 'es gibt' as 'it gives' instead of 'it is') they reciprocally determine each other. How does time govern the open region of Being where beings, which include both artifacts (zuhandenheit) and objects (vorhandenheit), show themselves? Being as that which presences, makes present, immediately leads to the conception of time as a succession of 'nows' (jetzt); past and future are excluded from this 'now' as the no longer now and the not yet now. Heidegger again cautions us against such an ontic conception of time. Understood transcendentally, time 'gives' (es gibt) presence, as the unity of the past, present and the future. In other words Presence and presencing must be distinguished from what is immediately present, as the 'now' of ontic time. However such a formulation seems to suggest that the 'now' in which something is present actually exists (like the 'sense- data' of traditional epistemology). While what needs to be emphasized from a phenomenological perspective, is that there is nothing present apart from presence, just as there is no sense-data apart from what is perceived that is phenomena. Presence and presencing, as opposed to what is present in ontic time, cannot be thought independently of human beings. Presence requires that for which it is a presence. That for which something is</page><page sequence="3">THE POLITICS OF ESSENCE a presence can only be man, according to it's unique essence or mode of Being as the ecstatic (literally being out of itself) 'standing within the clearing of Being'6. Such ecstatic standing within is called the ek- sistence of man. Ek-sistence is nothing other than 'the always ahead of itself' (the 'in order to' temporality of care in 'Being and Time') structure of human 'Being' that is its unique ability of transcendence. In other words human 'Being' cannot be reduced to that of an inanimate object, nor even to that of an animal. Yet this transcendence is always a concrete transcendence; a negation of a negation in the Hegelian sense. Although we are conventional/historical beings (appropriated by Being; standing within the clearing of Being) we do not follow conventions blindly taht is we do not exist in the manner of objects completely determined by the laws of nature. This irreducibility, and the contingency inherent in it, is the very condition of meaning or intelligibility, as the presencing of beings in the clearing of Being. It is we who represent our world and therefore 'hold the world at a distance'. Heidegger says in 'The Letter on Humanism', 'Ek-sistence can be said only of the essence of man; that is only of the human way 'to be'.. . only man is admitted to the destiny of ek-istence. Therefore existence can never be thought of as a specific kind of living creature amongst others'.7 A stone does not have a world, while an animal is 'poor in the world'. Although animals 'have' a world, an environment within which they comport themselves, they never have it 'as such'. They cannot extricate themselves from that comportment to represent both the object of their comportment as well as themselves as this comportment. This ability to extricate oneself from the world that is the ecstatic nature of human Being, is the condition for the very possibility of language, understood not as representation (of 'reality' or our 'thoughts'), but as the ideality inherent in all presencing. It is only through his essence 'as ek-sisting, (that) man sustains Da-sein in that he takes the Da, the clearing of Being into care'8. Being needs the ecstatic character of Human Being to presence itself (the Da of the clearing); while simultaneously Being appropriates human Being such that it appears essentially as dasein, as 'thrown' within an always already intelligible world, the Da-sein of clearing/ unconcealment/disclosure in which beings show themselves. Therefore both falleness (as human dasein) and ecstasis (as human possibility/ potentiality) are most proper to human Being. The various lines of thought; ek-sistance, presencing and time that we have been carefully trying to keep apart for the sake of 87</page><page sequence="4">88 SOCIAL SCIENTIST expository clarity, can now be thought together. Da-sein, as the clearing of Being transcends human dasein9. It is this transcendence that is meant by the term presence and presencing, as opposed to what is immediately present (if there is such a distinction to be made). Moreover time is the determinant of this presence. The present as the immediately given is not an isolated 'now' but 'contains' within it what has just gone before, in its absence and what is to come as expectation. Upon reflection, that is when perception becomes thought about perception (and therefore stops being perception) we find that an object is given in a multitude of varied 'appearances'. However, all these 'appearances' are understood as appearances, as manners of appearing of the same object. The source of this unity lies in the fact that the 'appearances' are not generated in a random, unstructured manner, rather they 'flow away' in structured sequence, such that a particular 'appearance' generates the expectation of another of a specific kind. The 'retention' of what passes away and 'protention' as the expectation of what is to come, in the 'now' of the 'present' reciprocally determine each other in the presencing of the object'0. The 'expectation'(protention) of what is not yet, is possible only on the basis of what was retained (as memory) in a prior experience (the not yet as a having been) while what is retained as the 'having been' is possible only on the basis of a protention, 'which is its very form'. This is because what is retained was itself a protention, an earlier expectation, (the having been as a not yet) which itself was retained from an earlier protention and so on ad-infinitum. Heidegger says, 'Approaching, being not yet present, at the same time gives and brings about what is no longer present, the past and conversely what has been offers future to itself"1'. The structure of protention and retention that is the unity of the object in its presence, is time itself. It is not difficult to see that such presencing (of individual objects) can occur only within an 'open region' of presence, since an object is never given in isolation but in relation to other objects that is it is always situated against a background and a foreground etc. Consequently time is the horizon of all presencing that is the open region where particular objects show themselves. With this presencing there opens up what we call time and space. .. Time and space now is the name for the openness which opens up in the mutual self-extending of futural approach past and present... the opening up... is itself pre-spatial; only thus can it make room, that is provide space'12. Moreover since there can be no presencing without</page><page sequence="5">THE POLITICS OF ESSENCE the ecstatic character of human ek-sistance, time is the very structure of ek-sistence. Derrida, with his characteristic directness says, 'spirit is time'13. However time is not transcendental in the Husserlian sense, as a function of the transcendental subject, which determines the presencing of phenomena to the (empirical) subject. For Heidegger 'existence' cannot be bracketed; the way objects presence themselves has an autonomy that belongs to Being itself. Heidegger asks, 'Is man the giver or receiver of time? .. . It has already reached man as such so that he can be man only by standing within the threefold extending.. ,'14. Time is the sending (destining) of Being into presence. Therefore Being as the clearing of presence is essentially historical. (We will have more to say on this in the next section.) This does not mean that time as the 'It gives' (presence to Being) is the determinant of Being. 'For time itself remains a gift of an 'It gives' whose giving preserves the realm in which presence is extended'. I The 'it' of the 'it gives' (both time and Being) remains elusive, and can only be thought in terms of differance or as Heidegger puts it, 'the presence of an absence'.16 II In restricting ourselves to an exposition of Being and time in their transcendental dimension we have allowed the historicity of Being, as the clearing of presence (Da-sein), and therefore of the human Dasein, to remain implicit. The conception of history must now be addressed more directly. History 'begins' with the unconcealment of Being in beings. Heidegger calls this 'beginning' the event of appropriation (Ereignis), whereby Being appropriates human Dasein. Human Being as Dasein that is as appropriated (Ere-ignet) is experienced as 'projective throwness'. 'Throwness' is the concrete ecstatic structure of Dasein that manifests itself as 'care', that is the involved dealings with the world that constitute its various life- projects. We find the following lines in Being and Time; 'Dasein has grown up both into and in a traditional way of interpreting itself: in terms of this it understands itself primarily and within a certain range, constantly'.17 However the historicity of human Dasein as an ongoing life-project (that culminates in Death) occurs only within the larger historicity of Da-sein as the disclosure of Being in beings. History (geschichte) as this disclosure is a destining (geschick), a sending (schicken) of Being on its way that transcends both the 'subject(ive)' and the 'object(ive)'. It is fateful without being 89</page><page sequence="6">90 SOCIAL SCIENTIST deterministic. The beginning (anfang) of history in the unconcealment of beings is at the same time, as we have seen, the covering over of Being. What is covered over is the ontological difference between Being and beings (since Being gets reduced to beings) that is the very inception of metaphysics. Heidegger writes, 'Metaphysics does indeed represent beings in their being, and so it thinks the Being of beings, but it does not think the difference of both'.18 History is always a history of being that is it is a history of metaphysics, understood not as a series of weltanschaaungs, (ontic history) with their individual variations, but as the interpretation of Being in terms of things in being. Therefore in, 'What is Metaphysics? Heidegger writes, 'Every metaphysical question always encompasses the whole range of metaphysical problems'.19 Greek thinking is the site where the question of Being is both raised and covered over. 'The first beginning' (die erste Anfang) which releases beings into their presence also contains 'the other beginning' (die andere Anfang) that is Being as the arche (which is the origin in the double sense of ground as well as guiding principle). Greek thinking experiences the difference between Being and beings, but only as differance, as trace. Being is experienced only in and through beings, as what remains hidden, the 'presence of an absence'. The task of interpretation becomes doubly difficult, for not only is the experience of this difference, covered over in Greek thought, (such that there is nothing straightforwardly given) but the thinking that comes afterwards, after history as the history of beings, that is metaphysics, is well under way, is itself fundamentally historical. It is appropriated (though as we saw never completely) by what has gone before, in the form of the disclosure and foreclosure of certain possibilities. Thus interpretation can only be an encounter, an event where what has been passed down and ossified is heard in a new way. In this event of encounter Greek thought is both revealed as well as reconstituted. Interpretation is the disclosure of a world, the presencing of presence that is again neither subjective nor objective, but arises in a dialogue (auseinandersetzung) between the two. As such thinking itself is praxis, a comportment that is always ethical. However what remains unspoken here is the political. We shall trace the political in this encounter by pointing to a fundamental reconstitution of Aristotle's notion of phronesis, which is the disclosive virtue of praxis, in terms of pure thinking about Being or more accurately, the difference between Being and beings. The distinction between phronesis and sophia that was so crucial for</page><page sequence="7">THE POLITICS OF ESSENCE Aristotle is collapsed through their mutual implication in the existential analytic of Being and Time. For Heidegger phronesis (practical wisdom) as disclosive of the structure of ontic involvements, is itself ontological (the glance of sophia) while sophia as the self- distancing in which the open region where beings show up, is ontic, a mode of Dasein's being. The analysis is what has already been characterized (in the 'transcendental' exposition) in terms of the concrete yet ecstatic nature of human Being, that is essential to all presencing. This disclosure of the open region in sophia is the disclosure of presencing as such, it is the disclosure of the difference between beings and Being. Yet in collapsing the distinction in this way phronesis is assimilated to sophia, such that it has no standing on its own apart from pointing to this presencing (the ontological) as its ground. Thus despite a recognition of the limits of thinking in its historicity and facticity, in denying the autonomy of phronesis, Heidegger, we shall argue, privileges a certain understanding of human essence, as that which is most proper and the highest possibility of human existence (human dunamis), which in the end is a return to a metaphysics of spirit. At first glance it seems that in 'Being and Time' there is no conception at all of praxis and therefore of phronesis as the disclosive virtue guiding it; there is only production that is poiesis and techne, the 'know how' required for poiesis. Production and the relations of production constitute the totality of Dasein's involvements from which she must extract herself in order to properly be an individual that is to exist in her owness (eigentlichkiet). Yet production is not praxis in the Aristotalian sense and it seems unlikely that Heidegger, explicitly claiming Aristotle's 'Metaphysics' and 'Nicomachean Ethics' as precursors to the existential analytic of Dasein, would be guilty of such a careless assimilation. What emerges from 'Being and Time' is not an assimilation but a transformation of the conception of praxis and phronesis. In order to see this transformation we must understand what these terms mean for Aristotle. Poiesis is the manipulation of means in order to achieve desired effects; it reaches its completion in the actuality of the effect, which must necessarily lie outside the agent. Techne is the aletheic virtue of poiesis; it is the know-how that reveals things as means, as well as the method by which the effect is to be produced. Aristotle says that while the arche of production lies in the agent, the telos lies outside her. In contrast praxis does not produce any effect outside itself, its sole purpose is to act well in different 91</page><page sequence="8">92 SOCIAL SCIENTIST situations. Phronesis, as the guiding principle of praxis is the ability (skill) of judging what constitutes appropriate action in particular circumstances. Underlying the conception of phronesis and praxis is the realization that the situations and circumstances that we deal with in our everyday life are complex and ever changing, (as opposed to the eternal order of the cosmos), such that no set of general rules can guide us in every case. Aristotle recognizes a plurality of goods that is ends in themselves, which are ranked in a particular order. Consequently in addition to exercising good judgement and acting according to it in concrete situations (choosing between these goods), the agent must exercise good judgement in combining these goods in the right order and the right proportions, so as to lead a morally good life. These two areas of human judgement are ultimately one, for to be morally good one must act well and to act well one must be morally good. At the political level this takes the form of deliberation with others concerning the just ordering of society as a whole. Underlying the emphasis on the exercise of practical wisdom is the ontological understanding of human beings as 'rational' creatures. Consequently contemplation of the eternal realm (theoria), since it is the fullest realization of human potentiality, becomes the highest end of human existence. Theoria is divided into two hierarchized virtues; episteme and sophia. Episteme is concerned with immutable beings, such as mathematical entities. However as science it cannot found itself, its task is deduction from first principles. Sophia is the perspective which leads one from ones concernful dealings to the larger shared world of nature. Here nature is understood not in an abstract logical sense but as a 'moving sameness', as what goes away only to return, the endless cycle of night and day, seasons, birth and death etc. For Aristotle the glance of sophia is nothing less than a realization of man's situatedness in the cosmos, the order of nature that cannot be reduced to the realm of human concerns, that is it is nothing less than a critique of anthropomorphism. Here Being itself is first glimpsed, as the arche of the movements of physis. This is truly the highest possibility of human praxis, where 'praxis transcends itself, approaches the eternal that is divine, and escapes (as long as theoria lasts) the fragility that affects existence when it is embodied in human affairs'.20 However theoria as a form of rationality does not lie within the subject (as immanence to consciousness) but is a kind of skill that is picked up by being part of the polis. Therefore to realize this potentiality, to be fully human,</page><page sequence="9">THE POLITICS OF ESSENCE one must undergo the proper training/education, such that one develops a spontaneous disposition towards these goods. The relation between training and deliberation is again a circular one, where proper training is essential for deliberating with oneself and others (by participating in political life), while it is only through deliberation that we can determine what constitutes right training. The similarity between Aristotle's analysis and Heidegger's existential analysis is obvious. First, as we pointed out, the notion of poiesis and techne as it's aletheic principle, is fairly parallel to the conception of production and manipulation, where things are encountered as Zuhanden, that constitute Dasein's everyday (inauthentic) mode of existence and the practical circumspection (praktische Umsicht) governing it. Moreover for Aristotle praxis has no end other than it's own realization, similarly for Heidegger, in the mode of existence most proper to Dasein that is authentic existence, she disengages herself from her involved existence (the structure of means and ends) and is able to see both the structure in its totality as well as herself as involved. The ability of self-reflection has no other end apart from its realization; such realization is the highest possibility (dunamis) of human existence, as theoria for Aristotle and authenticity (Eigentlichkiet) for Heidegger. Again the circularity between phronesis and theoria is preserved (though in an entirely transformed sense, where the former is assimilated to the latter) in Heidegger's insistence on human Being as Dasein (as situated) who at the same time 'ek- sistingly sustains Da-sein' (the presencing of Being in the open expanse of intelligibility that is nature). We find that in 'Being and Time' there is a notion of praxis and its phronesis in the form of authentic existence, which is in keeping with Aristotle's understanding of theoria as the highest form of praxis. Yet there is also a discontinuity, where genuine praxis can only be theoretical that is thinking about Being in authentic existence, thereby relegating all other forms of praxis to the realm of production and manipulation that is to inauthenticity, where human existence is not self-aware and therefore not true to human essence. The reduction of every mode of praxis, other than pure contemplation, to production amounts to a rejection of what Hannah Arendt calls the 'basic human condition of plurality'21; of our existence in the midst of others, amidst a diversity of opinions, outlooks and moral valuations such that it is only through dialogue and debate that we can co-exist. This plurality is homogenized in the 'they' world (Das Man) of inauthentic existence. In short there is no middle ground between technical manipulation 93</page><page sequence="10">94 SOCIAL SCIENTIST and production of things as well as opinions, information and knowledge on the one hand and pure contemplation on the other. In contrast Aristotle emphasizes the irreducibility of phronesis and praxis to theoria. With great insight into the sociopolitical conditions of theoretical inquiry he says that the 'chief good' and the 'most authoritative art' to which it belongs, is politics; for 'it is this that ordains which of the sciences should be studied in the state, . . . and we see even the most highly esteemed capacities to fall under this, e.g. strategy, economics, rhetoric . .,22 The mutual dependence and irreducibility of phronesis (and praxis) and theoria is due to the realization that human beings are human only within society (they are enveloped and transcended by society) where plurality and difference are the norm. Thus Aristotle, right at the beginning of 'Nicomachean Ethics', says that every subject can be expected to have 'as much clearness as the subject matter admits, for precision is not to be sought alike in all discussions. . .'; consequently 'it is evidently equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician and to demand from a rhetorician scientific proofs'.23 Now the subject matter of his inquiry which is 'political science in one sense' admits of 'much variety and fluctuation of opinion'24 and one should not expect exactness in this area. What is evident in these remarks is the plurality and differences of opinion, which was at the heart of the city-state. For Aristotle human beings impose and affirm themselves as individuals only within the public realm, by engaging in dialogue and debate, by taking a stand and making their differences manifest. Such a conception seems very far removed from the solitary activity of the thinker or the poet. III We are now in a position to bring out the political consequences of this transformation in a more explicit manner that is with respect to Hiedegger's engagement with Nazism. We have been arguing that the transformation amounts to an assimilation of all praxis to thinking, phronesis to sophia, whereby every other form of praxis is homogenized under the public realm of the 'they', which in the end is the clearing of Being where Being hides itself. Thus the assimilation on the one hand (thinking as ecstatic, in which Being opens itself to Dasein) and homogenization on the other (thinking as appropriated by metaphysics), reflects the very structure of unconcealment and concealment; it is true to the basic logic of Heidegger's thought. Underlying this 'double movement' is a particular conception of</page><page sequence="11">THE POLITICS OF ESSENCE human essence, as self-reflexive or self-aware, such that thought appropriated by metaphysics is no longer true to its essence. The homogenization is particularly evident in an unpublished lecture from 1949, 'Das Gestell' (The Enframing) which was later published as 'Question Concerning Technology', where some of the more controversial comparisons were expunged. We find the following passage in the 1949 lecture; 'Agriculture is the mechanized food industry - in essence the same as the manufacturing of corpses in gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same as the blockading and starving of nations, the same as the manufacture of atom bombs'.25 This as Caputo says is a 'baffling' comment, 'Is something very 'deep' intended here or does it betray a shocking insensitivity to mass murder?'26 How can modern methods of agriculture be compared to the holocaust? In the Question Concerning Technology where the technological is conceived as a mode of revealing that challenges forth (Herausforden), which sets upon nature and man, we find the same idea, though toned down considerably in the manner of its expression, 'Agriculture is now mechanized food industry. Air is now set upon to yield nitrogen, the earth to yield ore, ore to yield uranium, uranium is set upon to yield atomic energy, which can be unleashed either for destructive or for peaceful purposes'.27 The 'profoundly typical gesture', 'the formulaic pattern' of Heidegger's thought begins to emerge; although it might be 'correct' to distinguish between mechanized agriculture and the prospect of mass annihilation contained in the atom bomb, it is not 'true', as the essence of technology. From the perspective of true thinking (which is Dasein's ownmost possibility) all such distinctions vanish; the 'real danger' is not mass destruction or the extermination of Jews but the loss of man's essence, the thinking that is appropriated by technology, and ultimately by metaphysics. 'The essence of technology is nothing technological'28, 'the essence of metaphysics is nothing metaphysical, the essence of truth is nothing true (actual), the essence of Being is nothing in being', such sentences proliferate in Heidegger's thought. In this move, what is actually lost is the awareness of the concrete immediacy and uncertainty of human affairs, an awareness that can only be guided by a phronesis irreducible to sophia. The gesture is repeated, this time through the assimilation of the notion of poiesis and techne to thinking about Being. The essence of technology as 'Gestell' is the 'greatest danger' to man's essence. Yet when techne and poiesis are thought in their essence they also contain the 'saving power', the restoration of man's essence as a thinking 95</page><page sequence="12">96 SOCIAL SCIENTIST which is self-aware, which also means that it is aware of its own limits. To think poetically and therefore the essence of poiesis, is 'to enter into the highest dignity of our essence' which 'lies in keeping watch over the unconcealment'29 of technology as enframing (Gestell). If technology is a destining of a revealing that has its inception in the Greek forgetfulness of Being that is in the inception of metaphysics, then only the revealing of this revealing can restore to man his essence. To return to an origin is to return man to his essence. This return is not simply an overcoming of the 'alienation' that affects technological man, although there are many passages where Heidegger presents a rather bucolic picture, a 'simpler way of life'. For the homelessness (Unhiemelichkiet) of man on earth is itself the very essence of man and must be preserved at all cost. Heidegger's philosophy is an attempt to think the unity of man and nature, without reducing one to the other in order to secure an absolute, originary unity. Being both transcends man (and appropriates man as Dasein) and requires man (as ek-sisting) to the extent that it shows itself. In the 'Letter on Humanism' Heidegger says, 'nature in the face it turns towards human technical mastery, is simply concealing its essence'.30 Yet 'just as little can the essence of man consist in being an animal organism, (and therefore be reducible beings in nature) can this insufficient definition of man be overcome by outfitting man with an immortal soul, the power of reason ... (i.e. a transcendental ego irreducible to nature).'31 However in the politicization of his philosophy do we not detect a 'return of the 'spirit', though it had never left?32 As a consequence can we not say that Heidegger is ultimately claimed by a metaphysics that is in accord with the deepest insights of his own thinking, in accord with the impossibility of his project? As always Heidegger has the last word; 'To think Being without beings means: to think Being without regard to metaphysics. Yet a regard for metaphysics still prevails in the intention of overcoming metaphysics . . The saying of Appropriation in the form of a lecture remains an obstacle of this kind. The lecture has spoken merely in propositional statements.33 REFERENCES 1. Aristotle, 'Nicomachean Ethics', The Basic Works of Aristotle, (ed.)
