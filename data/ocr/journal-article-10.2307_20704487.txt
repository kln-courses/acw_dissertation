<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTHROPOMORPHIC STONE CARVINGS ON UNEA ISLAND INGE RIEBE University of Sydney Unea (lat. 4?55/ S; long. 149?10/ E), a high volcanic island in the Vitu group, lies about 40 miles from the nearest point on the north-west coast of New Britain. The inhabitants call it "Uneapa". It is often known to Europeans as "Bali", the name of the plantation established there during German adminis tration of New Guinea. While staying at Bali plantation in 1966 I was told of stone carvings at Malangai village. On a second visit to Bali, in 1967, I examined and photo 374</page><page sequence="2">INGE RIEBE graphed the stones and obtained the local tradition concerning them which I report below. Although apparently not previously described in publications, the stones have been known to local Europeans since the German administration, prior to World War I. Unea people say that a German official called Beyer removed some of the smaller carved heads; the fact that he allegedly paid only a tin of fish and a pound of rice for each one he took is still keenly resented by the stones' present custodians. I examined seven stones. The six largest ones are in situ at the edge of Malangai village, which is high up on the slopes of Mt. Kumbu (see map). The seventh has been moved to Pelanganikumbu village at the foot of the mountain. The present village at Malangi has only been built since World War II. Previous to that the artefacts stood in deep jungle. These are the only stones of this kind which I saw or heard about, though simple geometric petroglyphs are found on rocks elsewhere in the island, and are apparently associated with initiation ceremonies in most cases. Despite extensive questioning of a large number of well known story tellers on the island, I found only one story about the stones. By Unea standards it is short, colourless, and unsophisticated both in plot and character. Although most stories are about ancestors, or tumbuna, this story is said to be about "man belong bipoa", but NOT their (the story-tellers') ancestors. The people in the villages named in the story all know of the stones and know the story. There are, however, many other people on Unea who say they don't know anything of the story, and I have talked to some who have never seen the stones. The particular version here presented was told by Wagelo of Malangai, aged about 75-80. Long taim bipoa oli laik pait. Orait oli bung wantaim. Na bikpela man bolong lain emi kisim wanpela bikpela siton, na emi paitim dispela siton wantaim gerupim wanpela stori bolong pait.

Orait na oli kam bak long dispela pies bilong siton na i wokim draipela kaikai, na bungim ol pik. Na behain olman i gombak long pies bolong ol. Em tasol. "A long time ago they were preparing to fight. So they gathered together. And the leader of the group took a big stone, and he struck (carved) the stone, and at the same time he made a speech about the fight. It was only the big man who made the stones, he completed the carving of all the stones and at the same time he addressed the gathering, 'All of you want 375</page><page sequence="3">STONE CARVINGS ON UNEA ISLAND to fight. A man from the place up the hill has come and killed a man here. Now you want to avenge him.' The men of Pelanganikumbu, Kumburi No. 1, Kumburi No. 2 and Penabotong came and gathered here, and they wanted to attack this man who had killed one of their young men. Then they got up and made a huge fence in this direction and in that direction, for a long way [points out area], and this fence was concealed in the forest. Well, they sat down and waited for the group from up the hill to come and fight when they had heard the talk of war. The group from up the hill came inside the fence and they saw the fence and were frightened. They wanted to flee, but could not. And the big group killed all those men who stood up. Some were hiding in the bush, and underneath this kind of foliage [indicates leaves], but they searched for them and killed them all: not one survived. Then they came back to this place of the stones, and they prepared a huge feast, and gathered pigs. Afterwards they all returned to their own settlements. That is all." Description of Stones Boulders of igneous rock are liberally distributed on Unea. The Malangai carved stones form part of a cluster of boulders of similar material (see Fig. 1). They are not hard to work. I used a stone adze blade to make a small furrow in one, and had no difficulty in making an impression with only a little pressure. All the worked stones have features which can be interpreted as human or stylised human (?mask) faces. Three stones (I, II, VII) including one of the largest (II), have single faces and represent whole heads. One stone (III) has 376</page><page sequence="4">1A IB 1C ID Plate 1: Malangai Stones, Unea Island.</page><page sequence="5">2A 2B 2C 2D Plate 2: Malangai Stones, Unea Island.</page><page sequence="6">INGE RIEBE two faces; one (IV) has three; one (V) has a single completed but rudimentary or heavily worn face, together with incomplete features of others. One large elongated stone (VI) with a single face apparently represents the whole torso of some creature or zoomorphic being. Eyes, nose and mouth are variously represented in all faces. Each also has one or more additional features (eyebrows, ears, hair or headdress, chin) indicated by grooves or other additional shaping. There is a general similarity of structure in the carved stones, based on there being some flat area on the top and on the use of natural ridges in the stone. The ridges utilised are the straightest, longest and sharpest available on the boulder concerned. Comparing all used and unused stones in the group, the unworked stones seem in general less suitable, although some seem as usable as the poorest of the worked ones. Except on the unfinished carving (VI), natural ridges are in all cases adapted to form the median lines of faces, the middle section forming the nose, the peak forming the lower lip or chin. I. (Plates 1A, IB). This stone stands about 50 yds from the rest of the group. Height 2' 9"; max. circumference 10' 4". The flat top, 3' 3" x 2' 8", is set off by a horizontal groove about two inches below the rim, running around the face and left side only. O 1 2 Fig. II: Stone II, "The Bossboy" II. (Plates 1C, ID; Fig. 2). This remarkable carving is known locally as the "Bossboy", and people say that it is laughing. Height 4' 0"; max. circum ference 12' 5". Each eye is 1" x 8" and length of nose is V 2". Notable features are its prognathous profile and long sweeping brow ridges forming continuous curves down the sides of the head. 377</page><page sequence="7">STONE CARVINGS ON UNEA ISLAND III. (Plates 2A, 2B.) Stone with two adjacent faces. Height V 6"; max. cir cumference 5' 9". The top, as also of IV and V, is heavily pitted (possibly for cracking Canarium nuts, which are very common on Unea). Running down the side of the right face are four parallel double-curved grooves. On the outer side of the left face is an ear-like protrusion. IV. (Plates 2C, 2D.) Stone with three faces. Height 9". V. (Plate 3C.) Stone with unfinished carvings. This has poor ridges. Some attempt has been made to use two of them as medial lines for faces, with a single-line rough eye set to the side of one, and an eye and a single line mouth set on the other. The completed face is on a plane bounded by these two ridges. However, its delineation is rudimentary, or possibly very heavily weathered; nose is hardly worked at all, and eyes are simple double circles. Height 8". 0 1 2 1_I_I FEET Fig. Ill: Stone VI. "The Pig" VI. (Plate 3A, 3B; Fig. 3.) Identified as a pig by local people. Height 2' 6"; length 4' 6". Two parallel grooves run down each side of the face and curve under the chin. There are also parallel grooves along the body side. VII. (Plate 3D.) Stone with single face, of lighter coloured rock than the others and apparently sandier in texture, though still quite hard. Notable features are the protruding lips, comparable to those on VI, and grooves near the top of the head. When I saw and photographed it this stone had been moved to Pelanganikumbu village. It took two men to move it and they had been unable to lift if off the ground. The son of a "big man", who feels he has claim to the stones as they are on his paternal land, offered to "give" this one to me. However, on hearing this other members of the community became furious and hid it; they are still angry about the stones the Germans removed. Although I was able to assure them that I was not intending to acquire stones by deals of this kind, and my relations with the community were cordial, this carving had not been replaced in the open before I left Unea, so I was unable to examine it further and measure it. 378</page><page sequence="8">3A 3B 3C 3D Plate 3: Malangai Stones, Unea Island.</page></plain_text>
