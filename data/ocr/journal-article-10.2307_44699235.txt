Copyright © 2003 SAE International ABSTRACT Structures and Materials Research Center of the National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan (NAL) conducted vertical drop tests of fuselage sections of a NAMC YS-1 1 A-200 transport airplane. This test program is a part of research activities in NAL on the structural crashworthiness of transport aircraft. In addition a cooperative research related to this test program has been carried out by NAL and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.(KHI). The main objectives of this program are to develop optimal numerical models for crash simulation of aircraft fuselage and to obtain background data by drop tests of full-scale fuselage sections under a controlled impact condition. Two sections of the fuselage structure with seats and passenger dummies were tested at different drop velocity to a rigid impact surface(concrete). Finite element models of the test articles for simulation of vertical drop tests were developed using a nonlinear dynamic analysis code, LS-DYNA3D. Correlation between test and analysis was fairly good. A summary of some of the results of full-scale fuselage section drop tests and the numerical simulation is presented in this paper. INTRODUCTION For more than 20 years, the mean occurrence rate of hull-loss accidents of commercial transport aircraft in the world has not been improved, although it is extremely small [1][2]. There is therefore the possibility of a future increase in the absolute number of accidents with the steady increase in worldwide air transportation. Avoiding crashes is the primary issue for aircraft design and operation, and effort has been devoted to preventing accidents. However, as long as the risk of crash is not zero, the survivability of passengers in crashes is a matter of great importance, and many regulations have been amended with respect to aircraft crashworthiness in order to improve the passenger survivability in an accident. Research on cabin safety issues has hitherto been mainly focused on improvement of the impact absorption characteristics of passenger seats and the prevention of fire hazards. Improvement of the impact environment through airframe structure will make a definite contribution to the enhancement of cabin safety. To ensure passenger survival in the event of a crash, the impact environment around the passengers must be less severe than the level of human impact tolerance. A number of crash tests of full scale aircraft structures have been conducted, especially in USA by NASA, FAA and Army, for establishment of background data with respect to airworthiness, human impact tolerance, occupant protection and crash simulation methodology [3]-[7]. With the increase in power of engineering workstations, there have been marked tendencies to perform crash simulation of fuselage structures using the nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis code. The results of crash tests of full-scale fuselage and components are utilized in the study of test/analysis correlation for developing appropriate numerical models of the fuselage structures; for example, in USA, Boeing B737 fuselage sections and fuselage structures of composite materials (FAA and NASA)[8]-[14], and in European Community, a 3m-long fuselage section of Airbus A320,etc. in the European research programs such as "Crashworthiness" and "CRASURV" [1 5]-[1 9]. The main objectives of our test program are to investigate the crash behavior of fuselage structures both by tests and numerical analysis in an aspect of impact energy absorption and to study crashworthy fuselage structures for enhancement of passenger's survivability[20][21]. 531</page><page sequence="2">A domestic transport airplane was selected for drop test and analysis for the reason of its size and the availability of airframe and design information. VERTIACAL DROP TESTS OF TRANSPORT FUSELAGE SECTIONS Two vertical drop tests of the fuselage sections from a YS-11 transport airplane were conducted at NAL Structures and Materials Research Center, Tokyo, Japan. The aft section fuselage structure was subjected to a vertical drop test first on December 2000 for its simplicity of the structure. A description of the first drop test on the aft section was summarized in Ref.[22]. The forward fuselage section had an under-floor cargo compartment and was subjected to a vertical drop test on July 5, 2002. Primary objectives of these tests were, first, to assess the impact environment in the passenger cabin and the resultant dynamic response of passengers, as well as the fuselage, under a controlled crash condition, and second, to develop appropriate numerical models for crash simulation of the transport fuselage section for studying design concepts as an aspect of impact energy absorption. Drop tests were anticipated to provide valuable reference data for these research objectives. Test Articles Two fuselage sections were cut from a NAMC YS-11 A-200 as the test specimens. The YS-1 1 A-200 is one of the series of YS-11 transport category airplanes developed by a Japanese aircraft company, NAMC (Nippon Aircraft Manufacturing Company, Ltd.) about 40 years ago and is subject to Part 25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. It is a short-range aircraft with the maximum passenger of 64. Its main dimensions are: wing span:32.0m, fuselage length:26.3m, fuselage diameter: 2.88m, the maximum take-off weight:24.5 ton. As for this year more than sixty YS-1 1s are in operation. Two test sections with eight fuselage frames each were cut from a fuselage of YS-11 A-200 as shown in Fig. 1 . The basic airframes sizes in both test section were fundamentally common, except the forward section had an under-floor cargo compartment. No luggage was loaded on cargo floor in the drop test. Typical pitch length of the fuselage frame arrangement was 0.48m. Each test section has a capacity of 12 passengers with 6 twin-seats placed in three rows. Fig.1 Fuselage station number of the test sections Forward test section: From -1800 to -5160 Aft test section: From +1080 to +5160 The aft section test article (AFT section) was 3.36 m in length and 1,510 kg in weight including seats, passenger dummies and wirings of the data acquisition system. The cabin of this section was outfitted with 4 twin-seats (three standard 9g rated seats of YS-11 and a "16g- rated" seat) and two weight-dummies (lumped masses equivalent to two seats and four occupants). Three instrumented-Hybrid II Anthropomorphic Test Dummies (ATD) and 5 non-instrumented Hybrid II dummies were mounted to seats. Seats and dummies were utilized for achieving the weight distribution and load transfer in the test article and were not for primary research objective in the drop test. The forward section test article (FWD section) was 3.16 m in length and 1,600 kg in weight. The cabin of this section was outfitted with 6 twin- seats (four standard 9g-rated seats of YS-11, a "16g-rated" seat and a modified seat with shock absorption device). Seven Hybrid II ATDs and five non-instrumented Hybrid II dummies were mounted on passenger seats. Non-structural members under the cabin floor, such as air-conditioner ducts, wire harnesses and attachments were removed from the fuselage for drop test. Most of inner panels or equipments in passenger cabin were left as they were. In both test articles, location of the center of gravity in longitudinal direction coincided almost precisely to the geometrical center of the test article. Fig. 2 Views of the fuselage section. Drop velocity: These tests were structured to simulate a severe, but survivable, crash. The vertical impact velocity for the AFT section drop test was set at 6.1 m/sec (20 ft/sec). This was nearly the same test conditions used in many drop tests by FAA and NASA on McDonnell Douglas DC-10, Boeing 707, etc., with a drop velocity of around 20 ft/sec. It was estimated that the fracture of the YS-1 1 fuselage structure would not be catastrophic under this drop velocity and thus the obtained data would be useful for evaluating the impact environment and survivability in the passenger cabin, and for comparison with other test data under the similar impact conditions. Data would be also beneficial for developing a numerical fuselage model and assessment of its applicability. 532</page><page sequence="3">The test condition for FWD section was determined after the drop test on AFT section and the drop velocity was set at 7.6m/s. Recent vertical drop tests at FAA Technical Center have been conducted at impact velocity of 30 ft/s. But the existence of a cargo compartment in our FWD section test article was thought to increase the vertical acceleration levels by its rigidity increment and it could result in catastrophic failure of seats. Impact data should be reasonable and beneficial for our purpose of developing numerical model. Therefore the adopted velocity condition for FWD section was 7.6 m/s (25 ft/s). Thus the kinetic energy of the FWD section in drop test was 1.67 times larger than that of the AFT section. Open-end effect: A fuselage section test article might show somewhat different impact response compared with the fuselage of whole aircraft configuration. FAA Technical Center usually introduces open-end reinforcements for compensation of the lower end constraints of the test article. However the reinforcement for compensation of the open-end effect of the fuselage section was not taken into consideration in our drop tests because we had none of rational background data for determining quantitative influence of connecting fuselage structures. It was thought that the simplicity or uniformity of the test article would have a benefit in assessment of both the test data and numerical simulation methodology. Data acquisition system: Instrumentation for the drop test included accelerometers, strain gages, load cells and high-speed digital video cameras. The number of instruments associated with the test is shown in Tablel.For avoiding data loss at the most important locations, sensors were dually installed on the same position for backup.

Instruments and the number of data channel For the same reason, trigger signals were also multiply supplied to the data acquisition system by means of automatic and manual operations. Data acquisition system could accept multiple trigger signals simultaneously and the first-come trigger signal had activated the system. As one of the external trigger sources, touch-sensors, so-called "tape switches", were used in order to provide multiple trigger signals to the data acquisition system. Arrays of touch-sensors were placed on the impact surface and activated by contact pressure at the moment of the contact of fuselage bottom to the impact surface. Manual switches were also used as other external triggers. Furthermore, one of the sensor signals was utilized as an automatic internal trigger signal. Signals from the sensors were pre-filtered through 3 kHz analogue low-pass filters and were recorded on digital recorders with a sampling rate of 10kHz. Recorded waveforms were digitally filtered according to the recommendation of SAE J21 1/1 [23] for evaluation of impact environment. For example, a low-pass digital filter of Channel Frequency Class (CFC) 60 was applied to the original waveforms for a general comparison of peak accelerations in the test article. CFC 600 and CFC 1000 were also used for analysis of impact response of airframe and passenger seats. Views of drop test were recorded by high-speed digital video cameras (500 frames /s). Drop Test Facility: Fig. 3 shows the drop test tower at Structures and Materials Research Center of NAL. Two nylon slings were used to lift the test article. Slings were connected to a steel beam that was free to move. Further this beam was connected to a release hook using two steel wires that came from the beam, and finally the release hook was raised up to a required height by winches that were installed on the top of the drop test tower. A safety wire was connected to the test article to prevent unintentional drop of the test article due to erroneous action of the release mechanism.

There was no equipment to measure the reactive force of impact surface during a drop test. Test Results: Views of the test articles after test are shown in Fig.4.

Left: FWD section test article Right:AFT section test article Fig. 5 Schematics of typical fracture modes of the test articles after impact. The results on the FWD section drop test showed that the peak vertical accelerations at the cabin-floor were around 50g. For example, peak acceleration at seat rail at fuselage station-8080 was 41. 6g at the window side and 71 .4g at the aisle side and was 1 .3 times larger than the aft section test article. The peak lumbar loads measured by ATDs were in the range from 4.4kN to 5.7kN and they were slightly higher than that of the aft section test article, and they were also lower than the allowable load level(1500 lb, which is approximately 6.6kN.) in the current airworthiness requirement (FAR Part25 25.562). Pelvic accelerations of ATDs were in the range from 13.1 g to 18.7g. Permanent bending deflections of rear tube assemblies of the YS-11 standard seats were around 5 Fig.6 Views of post-test deformation of the bulkheads of cargo compartment of FWD section test article. Left : Forward bulkhead Right : Rear bulkhead mm but a 16g-rated seat kept structural integrity and any of permanent deformations or damage to the seat structure were not detected. As shown in fig.4, circular fuselage frames under the cabin floor have fractured progressively forming a nearly flat surface contour. The maximum vertical crash-distance of the under-floor structure (measured between the upper surface of the front floor-beam and the concrete surface) was 245mm at the elapsed time of 62.2ms after the initial contact of the fuselage bottom surface to the concrete surface. The post-test crash distance at the center of the front floor- beam to the impact surface was 193mm. The maximum permanent vertical deflection of floor-beams was 12mm. Vertical accelerations at the surface of cargo floor were very high and their peaks were from 120g to 494g. Fig. 7 Close-up view of under-floor structures of AFT section test article after impact The results of the AFT section drop test showed that the peak vertical accelerations at the cabin-floor were around 50g. For example, peak acceleration at fuselage station+1800 was 32. 3g at the window side and 57. 9g at the aisle side, respectively. The peak lumbar loads measured by ATDs were in the range from 3.4kN to 4.9kN and they were lower than the allowable load level. Pelvic accelerations of ATDs were in the range of 16.9g to 21. Og. All seats kept structural integrity and any of permanent deformations or damages to the seat structure were not detected. Fuselage frames under the cabin floor fractured mainly at three portions of under- floor structure in the typical crash mode as expected. The maximum vertical crash distance of the under-floor structure was 220mm at elapsed time of 84ms after initial contact to the impact surface. The maximum permanent deflection of floor beams was 40mm. Examples of peak values of accelerations and loads through CFC60 low-pass filter are shown in Table 2 and Table 3 for general comparison. Values on ATDs by 534</page><page sequence="5">CFC600 were practically in the same levels of the data by CFC60. All data are on the front fuselage frame, floor beam and the ATD in the first row of the test articles. Effect of the difference in the types of seats on the peak accelerations and lumbar loads of installed ATDs was small except the details of their waveforms. The reason for this was that the accelerations in the seat/occupant system were too low for yielding enough deformations of the 16g-rated seat assembly to activate the energy-absorption devices. Measured accelerations showed that initial g peaks of the cabin floor appeared at 10ms-15 ms after fuselage bottom contact to concrete surface, followed by primary peaks at around 50-70ms corresponding to the ATD's dynamic response, and 10-20 ms later, the lumbar loads of ATDs reached their peaks. Examples of the waveforms of the vertical accelerations at the cabib'n floor(seat rail), and the pelvis of a ATD and the load of a ATD lumbar column are presented in Figure 8. Vertical accelerations at aisle-side seat rails showed a tendency to have higher peaks than those at window- side seat rails.

Fig. 10 A comparison of acceleration waveforms between FWD section - and AFT section test article at the corresponding locations of sensors. Upper: Pelvic accelerations of ATDs Lower: Acceleration at seat rails Some of other test results are summarized below: 1) Although the drop height and thus the energy of FWD section was 1.67 times larger than that of AFT section, differences in peak accelerations at floor beams and ATDs on both test articles were relatively small or in the same level. This may be attributed to the difference in the deformation processes of the under-floor structures. As shown in Fig.4-Fig.7, the lower frames and a cargo compartment of FWD section had fractured progressively. On the contrary, the lower frames in the AFT section test article had fractured at the connection points of struts and fuselage frames and at the center splice joints. Typical acceleration waveforms are compared in Fig. 10. This shows that the progressive deformation of lower frames in FWD section had absorbed the impact energy of test article in somewhat delayed action and the peaks of accelerations might be suppressed favorably. In this case it may be said that the cargo compartment has happened to work as an effective shock absorber. 2) Function of a shock-absorbing 16g rated seat and a modified standard seat was not able to be evaluated because the seat system did not deform enough to yield the shock-absorbing device to work during impact. 3) According to the frequency analysis (FFT) of transient acceleration wave-forms, a peak of 9.5Hz at the seat rear-tube was detected and was thought to be the main dynamic response frequency of the ATD/seat system. Numerical simulation of fuselage section drop tests A numerical simulation on the test article was studied in the cooperative research between NAL and KHI using the explicit, nonlinear finite element analysis code, LS- DYNA3D[24]. An analytical model for the AFT section with a cargo compartment has approximately 60,000 elements and 61,000 nodes and it took around 20 hours of CPU time on an engineering workstation for computation of impact phenomena up to 100 ms. Supposing large warping of local structural elements in a full-scale fuselage drop test, Belytschko-Wong-Chiang shell element was selected for outer skin, web panels of fuselage frames, shear-ties, floor-beams and struts. Longitudinal stringers, stiffeners surrounding windows and the flanges of structural elements were modeled by Hughes-Liu beam elements. Many of cutouts, joints and fasteners were ignored in the model to keep the geometry as simple as possible. A numerical model of the baseline airframe of a fuselage section has 38,000 elements and 33,000 nodes. A cargo compartment is composed of Belytschko-Wong-Chiang elements and Hughes-Liu beam elements and it has 3,300 elements and 2,900 nodes (Fig. 12). Materials used were aluminum alloys, 2024-T4 and 7075-T6, and they were assumed to have isotropic piecewise-linear 536</page><page sequence="7">elastic-plastic properties by using *MAT_PIECEWEISE_LINEAR_PLASTICITY. Strain-rate sensitivity was taken into consideration in the material formulation[25]. Failure criterion by plastic strain was introduced to simulate fracture of under-floor fuselage frames in the DYNA3D-model. Fig.1 1 Numerical models of the test articles: Left: FWD section Right: AFT section Fig. 12 Numerical model of the under- floor cargo compartment of the FWD section test article A GEBOD model was tentatively used for numerical model of a Hybrid II ATD because this model was the only one that we could apply to LS-DYNA Ver950 in the initial stage of our crash simulation study. GEBOD is a modified version of GOOD(Generator of Occupant Data) which was developed by the Calspan Corporation in 1970s for car crash simulation. GEBOD data set are introduced to LS-DYNA3D model using *COMPONENT_GEBOD command. A single model of passenger seat assembly has 4,300 elements and 5,000 nodes. Eight ATDs were modeled by GEBDO and mounted on the fuselage model and the remaining four passengers were simply modeled by solid masses of equivalent weights. Seat legs were modeled by linear spring elements and the seat belts were modeled by Belytscheko-Tsay shell element and *ELEMENT_SEATBELT. Seat and passenger models are shown in Fig. 13. Comparisons between numerical simulation and the drop tests are presented in Fig. 14 - Fig.20. Correlation between analyses and tests was fairly good and showed correct trends.

Correlation of fracture mode and deformation process of the airframe between analysis and test was good and showed correct trends. Fig. 16 and Fig. 17 are the result on the AFT section test article. Deformation modes were also in good coincidence with the test results. Responses of the seat/passenger systems were obtained individually by a static load test and dynamic sled tests under different impact conditions. Data from these tests were utilized for determining fundamental characteristics of seat assembly including lap belts. Correlation between dynamic analysis by LS-DYNA3D model and the sled test result was fairly good (Fig. 18). Typical vertical accelerations by computation and tests are compared in Fig. 19 and Fig.20. Considering that the dominant frequency of dynamic response of a ATD/seat system was around 9.5 Hz, data were filtered digitally through CFC20 low-pass filter for evaluation in this frequency domain. Generally the numerical models seem to tend to estimate the structure more rigid than the real airframe of the test articles but the correlations of levels and time histories of the vertical accelerations between test and analysis were thought to be fundamentally acceptable for the first approximation of the impact phenomena in our vertical drop tests. Analytical results on the FWD section with a cargo compartment showed slightly larger discrepancies from the test results than those on the AFT section. Neglected effects of fastener joints of the cargo compartment, insufficient modeling of progressive crushing of fuselage bottom frames and the initial compression of air in cargo space and its resistance of burst from the damaged bulkheads may be possible causes of this tendency. Refinement of the numerical structural models for the vertical drop test of fuselage sections, including replacement of GEBOD models by MADYMO models for ATDs, is under investigation.

First, vertical drop tests of two fuselage sections of a NAMC YS-1 1 A-200 transport airplane were conducted to test the unpredictable process of crash of real fuselage structures under different impact conditions. It was noted that although the kinetic energy of the FWD section test articles was 1.6 times greater than that of the AFT section test article, difference in the peak values of vertical accelerations at the cabin floor beams and ATDs between both tests were relatively small. The difference in fracture modes of the under-floor structures may have influenced the overall response of the test articles. It may be concluded that the cargo compartment in the FWD section test article worked as an effective shock absorber in this case by the progressive deformation of fuselage bottom frames. Second, numerical models of the test articles were developed using an explicit finite element nonlinear dynamic analysis code, LS-DYNA3D. Passenger dummies (GEBOD) and seat models were installed on the structural models of fuselage sections. The analytical models could estimate the impact response of the test articles in fairly good precision. Further refinement in the methodology of modeling of fuselage structures, cargo compartment and seat/passenger system is under investigation for improvement of the precision of estimation.
