<plain_text><page sequence="1">LOLITA: THE SPRINGBOARD OF PARODY Alfred Appel, Jr. I In the decade since its initial publication in 1955 by the Olympia Press, Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita has emerged as a virtual classic of contemporary literature. Although it has received much serious attention, the criticism which Lolita has elicited invariably treats Nabokov's twelfth novel as a special case quite apart from the rest of his fiction, and almost always forces a thesis which does not and in fact cannot accommodate the total design of the novel. Nabokov affords that rare and disarming spectacle of a man who seems to know exactly what he is about; the most incisive criticism of Nabokov is found in his own books and, fortified by these passages, this essay attempts a comprehensive view of Lolita. But before doing so, a few general remarks are in order. A single trope describes the world of Nabokov's fiction and may serve to place Lolita in its rightful context. In "The Assistant Pro- ducer," a story published in 1943, Nabokov writes about the German film companies of the 'twenties who "found cheap labor in hiring those among the Russian 6migr6s whose only hope and profession was their past-that is, a set of totally unreal people-to represent 'real' audiences in pictures. The dovetailing of one phantasm into another produced upon a sensitive person the impression of living in a Hall of Mirrors, or rather a prison of mirrors, and not even know- ing which was the glass and which was yourself."'

"'So that's the dead end' (the mirror you break your nose against)," the overwrought Humbert tells Lolita after catching her in a lie (p. 227), and on their first conjugal night at The Enchanted Hunters hotel, they enter a room which to Hum- bert is a bewildering little prison of mirrors, a metaphor for his solipsism and circumscribing obsession: "There was a double bed, a mirror, a double bed in the mirror, a closet door with mirror, a bathroom door ditto, a blue-dark window, a reflected bed there, the same in the closet mirror, two chairs, a glass-topped table, two bed- tables, a double bed." (p. 121) "In our earthly house, windows are replaced by mirrors," writes Nabokov in The Gift (p. 322). His characters continually confront mirrors where they had hoped to find windows, and the attempt to transcend solipsism is one of Nabokov's major themes. Many readers overlook the deep moral resonance of his work, for characters hopelessly imprisoned within themselves must submit to Nabokov's irony, parody, or, most sig- nificantly, self-parody. As a literal image and overriding metaphor, the mirror is central to the form and content of Nabokov's novels. If one perceives Pale Fire spatially, with John Shade's poem on the "left" and Charles Kinbote's Commentary on the "right," the poem is seen as an object to be perceived, and the Commentary becomes the world seen through the distorting prism of a mind, a monstrous concave mirror held up to an objective "reality."

(p. 31) Nabokov has placed these crooked reflectors everywhere in his fiction: Doubles, parodies and self-parodies (literature trapped in a prison of amuse- ment park mirrors), works within works, mirror-games of chess,3 translations ("a crazy-mirror of terror and art"4), and language games. He manipulates the basic linguistic devices-auditory, morphologi- cal, and alphabetical, most conspicuously the latter. In Pale Fire, Zemblan is "the tongue of the mirror" (p. 242), and the fragmenta- tion or total annihilation of the self reverberates in the verbal distor- tions in Bend Sinister's police state, "where everybody is merely an anagram of everybody else" (p. xv), and in the alphabetical and psychic inversions and reversals in Pale Fire, such as Botkin-Kinbote and the Index references to "Word Golf" and "Sudarg of Bokay, a mirror maker of genius," the anagrammatic reflection and poetic description of omnipresent death, represented in Pale Fire by the Zemblan assassin, J[y]acob Gradus, who throws his shadow across the entire novel. There are many references to James Joyce in Lolita, and not surprisingly, for the pun is its principal mirror-language. Joyce reha- bilitated the pun for modern literature and Nabokov has continued to dignify this much disparaged rhetorical resource. Like Joyce, Nabokov fashions his puns from literary sources, from any of the several languages available to him, from obsolete words, or the roots of arcane words. If the discordant associations are rich enough, Nabo- kov's puns succeed in projecting a theme central to the fiction, in summarizing or commenting on the action. In The Defense (1930), the name of chess grandmaster Luzhin is a portmonteau combination of losing-illusion, as well as the Russian word for puddle and the name of Raskolnikov's stolid brother-in-law in Crime and Punish- ment, the man Mrs. Luzhin would have her husband become. Even the most playful punning will turn out to be invested with this kind of significance, as evidenced by the verbal pratfalls staged in the name of Humbert's mysterious "shadow," ubiquitous Clare Quilty. Lolita gets a letter supposedly from her friend Mona, but written by Quilty, as certain hints suggest when the letter collapses into a See Edmond Bernard, "La th6matique 6chiqu6ene de Lolita," L'Arc, VII (Printemps 1964), 39-47. 4 Nabokov, Introduction to Time Reading Program edition, Bend Sinister (New York, 1964), p. xvi.

[". . . it is necessary that he carry you there"] Lucky beau Qu'il t'y-What a tongue-twister!" (p. 225) The French strives for Qui est-il-and who is he? It is the question that sounds throughout modern litera- ture, the question asked by countless characters engaged in the shadow game that is the search for themselves-to name but one of the shadow games which are in progress in Nabokov's fiction. In both The Gift (1937) and the 1959 Foreword to the transla- tion of Invitation to a Beheading (1935-36), Nabokov mentions Discours sur les ombres, by Pierre Delalande, "the only author whom I must gratefully recognize as an influence upon me at the time of writing this book ... [and] whom I invented." (I, p. 6) Delalande's Discours provided the epigraph for Invitation-"Comme un fou se croit Dieu, nous nous croyons mortels"-and Nabokov's entire corpus might be described as a "Discourse on Shadows or Shades." John Shade is the author of the poem Pale Fire, and since Humbert Hum- bert was brought up on the French Riviera, he would pronounce his name with a French accent: ombre, ombre, a resonant pun which includes the popular seventeenth and eighteenth century card game of ombre and echoes the Spanish hombre. Lolita's given name, Dolores Haze, fittingly juxtaposes the Spanish sorrow with the Ger- man rabbit, and haze is an apt metaphor for her illusory and ephem- eral charms. Humbert's narrative dramatizes a Shade's efforts to capture the essence of a Haze, and in Pale Fire, the poet's homely, suicidal daughter is named Hazel Shade. By "solipsizing" Lolita, Humbert condemns her to the solitary confinement of his obsessional shadowland. "She had entered my world, umber and black Humber- land," says Humbert (p. 168), who, by choosing to chase the figura- tive shadows that play on the walls of his "cave," upends Plato's famous allegory.5 Although Humbert has had the benefit of a journey in the sunny "upper world"-a Riviera boyhood, in fact, and a full- sized wife or two-he nevertheless pursues the illusion that he can recapture what is inexorably lost. As Humbert demonstrates, illusions are realities in their ability to destroy us. "I was the shadow of the waxwing slain/ By the false azure in the windowpane," writes John Shade in the opening lines of Pale Fire, while in Nabokov's poem "An Evening of Russian Poetry" (1945), the speaker says: My back is Argus-eyed. I live in danger. False shadows turn to track me as I pass 5 For Nabokov contre Plato, see the Appel-Nabokov interview.

And in the dark, under my bedroom window, until, with a chill whirr and shiver, day presses its starter, warily they linger or silently approach the door and ring the bell of memory and run away.6 Seventeen years later in Pale Fire the "Shadows" are the Zemblan "regicidal organization" who dispatch Gradus, one of whose aliases is d'Argus, to assassinate the exiled King Charles (Kinbote). But the Shadows' secret agent accidentally kills Shade. Thus the delu- sive nature of identity and perception, the constricting burdens of memory, and a haunting sense of mutability are all capsuled in a reverberating pun. Because Nabokov is not a vapid contriver, his most labyrinthine and involuted artifice is of the greatest significance. Nabokov is well known as a lepidopterist, and in his poem "A Discovery" (1943) and memoir Speak, Memory (1951), he writes evocatively of his entomological forays, of the fleeting moments of ecstasy experienced in catching an exquisite and rare butterfly. It is no accident, as Diana Butler points out, that the object of Humbert's passion, a nymph, should be, according to the dictionary, a pupa or the young of an insect undergoing incomplete metamorphosis. Responding to blatant clues planted by Nabokov himself in his essay, "On a Book Entitled Lolita," Miss Butler demonstrates that the substratum of Lolita con- tains an extensive literary game in which the author's passion for but- terflies, including the congruent joy and horror of the discovery and the necessary kill, has been transferred into Humbert's passion for nymphets, with Lolita as the butterfly.7 That the seemingly inscrutable Nabokov would write this essay and reprint it in several places surely suggests the dismay he must have felt to see how many readers, including some old friends, had taken the book solely on an erotic level. It should be clear that the butterfly motif was crucial to Nabokov's realization of the book-a 6 Vladimir Nabokov, Poems (Garden City, N. Y., 1959), p. 22. 7 Diana Butler, "Lolita Lepidoptera," New World Writing 16 (Philadel- phia, 1960), p. 60. I will not rehearse Miss Butler's findings, which seem incon- testable, but rather confine myself to general remarks on the significance of the butterfly motif. Miss Butler, however, makes many lepidopterological errors. 208 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="6">psychic necessity, reinforcing in his mind the sense that, insofar as it has a definable subject, Lolita is not merely about sexual perversion but rather about love and the search for ineffable beauty, and as such, like Wordsworth's Prelude and Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, it is ultimately "about" its own creation. As Humbert says, rather than describe the details of the seduction, "Anybody can imagine those elements of animality. A greater endeavor lures me on: to fix once for all the perilous magic of nymphets." (p. 136) Later in the book he is more explicit about this "magic": "Indeed, it may well be that the very attraction immaturity has for me lies not so much in the limpidity of pure young forbidden fairy child beauty as in the security of a situation where infinite perfections fill the gap between the little given and the great promised-the great rose-grey never-to-be-had." (p. 266) Humbert's desires are finally closer to those of the poet than of the pervert, and not surprisingly, since they reflect, darkly, in a crooked enough mirror, the artistic desires of his creator. Like Joyce's use of the Odyssey in Ulysses and the Viconian scaf- folding of Finnegans Wake, the butterfly pattern in Lolita is intri- cate, ingenious, and elaborate. Careful readers should be able to identify it, for many of the lepidopteral descriptions of Lolita are explicit, and a familiarity with Nabokov's other books, especially Speak, Memory, should alert one to this possibility. The butterfly game serves as a controlling metaphor that enriches Lolita in a more fundamental and organic manner than the Odyssey's effect on Ulysses. Just as the nymph undergoes a metamorphosis in becoming the but- terfly, so everything in Lolita is constantly in the process of metamor- phosis, including the novel itself-a set of "notes" being compiled by an imprisoned man during a fifty-six day period for possible use at his trial, emerging as a book after his death, and then only after it has passed through yet another stage, the nominal "editorship" of John Ray, Jr. As Lolita turns from a girl into a woman, so Humbert's lust becomes love, his sense of a "safely solipsized" Lolita (p. 62) now replaced by his awareness that she was his "own creation" with "no will, no consciousness-indeed, no life of her own" (p. 64), that he did not know her (p. 286), and that their sexual intimacy only isolated him more completely from the helpless girl. These "metamorphoses" enable Humbert to transform a "crime" into a redeeming work of art, and the reader has watched the chrysalis come to life. As if in anticipation of Lolita, the narrator of The Real Life of Sebastian Knight (1941) mentions the readers who "felt baffled by [The Prismatic Bezel's] habit of metamorphosis" (p. 95), and LOLITA I 209</page><page sequence="7">when Nabokov in his lectures at Cornell discussed "The theme of transformation" in R. L. Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Gogol's The Overcoat, and Kafka's The Metamorphosis, he said that Stevenson's tale is a "thriller and mystery only in respect to artistic creativity. It is a phenomenon of style, a transformation through the art of writing." He likened the Jekyll-Hyde transformation to the metamorphosis of the larva to the pupa to the butterfly, and imag- ined Jekyll's final emergence from the melting and blackened fea- tures of the evil Hyde as "the rush of panic" which must accompany "the feeling of hatching." Once again, as in his book on Gogol, Nabokov has described his own performance by defining the art of another. As a metaphor for the artistic process, the nymph's cycle is a transcendent design. There always will be readers who disapprove of such involuted methods. One can answer them briefly by focusing on their charges that the puns and networks of coincidence in Nabokov are gratuitous fun when, in fact, they are basic and essential-"Not flimsy non- sense," writes John Shade, "but a web of sense." (1. 810) The occurrence of "those dazzling coincidences that logicians loathe and poets love" (p. 33), given the infinitesimal number of possible com- binations, goes beyond frivolity and defines a firmly held notion about "reality" and the probability of the wildly improbable. The insidious Clare Quilty is staying at The Enchanted Hunters when Lolita and Humbert consummate their relationship. Quilty names his play The Enchanted Hunters, adopts an anagram, Ted Hunter, as one of his many pseudonyms, and the married Lolita ends up liv- ing in a house on Hunter Road. These coincidences serve a twofold purpose: they at once point to the authorial consciousness that has plotted them, and they can be imagined as coordinates situated in time and space, marking the labyrinth from which a character can- not escape. An irrevocable destiny-or McFate, to use Humbert's jocular designation-seems confirmed at every turn. The hunter is indeed enchanted. The past merges with the present, and the vocabu- lary of time is only a convenient abstraction. The reverberating significance of a meaningful pun in Nabokov is akin to coincidence: words move into words and words into worlds, to paraphrase John Shade. But what about the shallow playfulness in Lolita, Humbert's "daymares" as opposed to the resonant puns on his and Quilty's names? Not only do the puns afford pleasure, which, hopefully, is still one of the intentions of literature, but they are also thematically appropriate. The puns underline a central problem in 210 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="8">Lolita, for some readers have been more put off by Humbert's use of language than by his abuse of Lolita. Any full sense of Lolita depends on our understanding the function of Humbert's verbal vaudeville, his unique voice and idiom. One should not forget that "Humbert Humbert" is a pseudonym; his name is first presented to us in "editor" John Ray's quotation marks. "Is 'mask' the keyword?" Humbert asks (p. 55), and his rhetoric is a mask: "Imagine me, reader ... masking the frenzy of my grief with a trembling ingratiating smile." (p. 249) After stating that Humbert's "bizarre cognomen is his own invention," John Ray adds, "of course, this mask-through which two hypnotic eyes seem to glow-had to remain unlifted in accordance with its wearer's wish." (p. 5) As usual, Ray is wrong, for although Humbert never reveals his "real" name, he does lift the mask once. As his nar- rative approaches the first conjugal night with Lolita, Humbert is overcome by anguish, and in the bare six lines of chapter twenty-six, the shortest "chapter" in the book, he loses control, and for a moment the mask drops: This daily headache in the opaque air of this tombal jail is disturbing, but I must persevere. Have written more than a hundred pages and not got anywhere yet. My calendar is getting confused. That must have been around August 15, 1947. Don't think I can go on. Heart, head-everything. Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita, Lolita. Repeat till the page is full, printer. (p. 111) Not until the very end of the passage does the voice sound like Hum the Hummer, when the desperation of "Heart, head-everything" suddenly gives way to the resiliently comic command to the printer. In that one instant Humbert's masking has taken place before the reader, who has just had a fleeting look into those "two hypnotic eyes," and has seen the pain in them. Lolita is so deeply moving a novel because of our precise awareness of the great tension sus- tained between Humbert's mute despair and his compensatory jollity. "Crime and Pun" is one of the titles the murderous narrator of Despair considers for his manuscript, and it would serve Humbert just as well. Language is as much a defense to Humbert as chess is to grand- master Luzhin. In order to control his tombal "confession," Hum- bert must create and maintain a totally self-conscious narrative mode. Hardly under way, he nevertheless wonders if the reader "can still stand my style." (p. 12) Only by projecting it in audacious if not brutal humor can Humbert hope to face the horror implicit in his LOLITA 211</page><page sequence="9">memories, and the controlling humor makes possible an act of recol- lection that is anything but tranquil. Even Humbert's worst puns distract him from his anguish and guilt, and help stay the heart trouble and the incipient madness (not the most "reliable" narrator, Humbert has been in several institutions) which would make it impossible to write the narrative now at hand. Humbert's Concep- tion Park, Insomnia Lodge, Lake Climax, and St. Algebra (the girl's school) are thus all admittedly limp jokes, but they are necessary: "let me laugh a little, too, gentlemen," Humbert says, following a harmless pun, as he struggles to create a humorous pattern and ulti- mately an artistic order out of the wild disorder of his life. Humbert is fully aware of the willful capriciousness of his baroque language, and the verbal absurdities of his Double, Clare Quilty, represent his liberating act of self-parody. II Although Humbert offers "mask," parody is the "keyword" in Lolita, and it provides a key to all of Nabokov. Like Joyce, Nabokov has shown how parody may inform a high literary art, and parody figures in the design of each of his novels. The Eye parodies the nineteenth-century Romantic tale, such as V. F. Odoevsky's "The Brigadier," which is narrated by a ghost who has awakened after death to view his old life with new clarity, while Laughter in the Dark is a mercilessly cold mocking of the convention of the love triangle; Despair is cast as the kind of "cheap mystery" story the narrator's banal wife reads, though it evolves into something quite different; and The Gift parodies the major nineteenth-century Rus- sian writers. Invitation to a Beheading and Bend Sinister are cast as mock anti-utopian novels, after the fashion of Zamiatin, while Pnin masquerades as an "academic novel" and turns out to parody the possibility of a novel's having a "reliable" narrator. Pnin's departure at the end mimics Chichikov's orbital exit from Dead Souls, just as the last paragraph of The Gift conceals a parody of a Pushkin stanza. The texture of Nabokov's parody is unique because, in addition to being a master parodist of literary styles, he is able to make brief references to another writer's themes or devices which are so telling in effect that Nabokov need not burlesque that writer's style. He not only parodies narrative clich6s and outworn subject matter, but genres and prototypes of the novel. Because chapter four of The Gift is a mock literary biography, it anticipates the themes of Nabokov's 212 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="10">major achievements, for he is continuously parodying the search for a verifiable truth-the autobiography, the biography, the exegesis, the detective story-and these generic "quests" will coalesce in one work, especially when the entire novel is conceptually a parody, as in Lolita and Pale Fire, Nabokov's masterpieces. In form, Pale Fire is a grotesque scholarly edition, while Lolita is a burlesque of the confessional mode, the literary diary, the Ro- mantic novel that chronicles the effects of a debilitating love, the Doppelgainger tale, and, in parts, a Duncan Hines tour of America conducted by a guide with a black imagination, a parodic case study, and, as the narrator of The Real Life of Sebastian Knight says of his half-brother's first novel, The Prismatic Bezel, "It is also a wicked imitation of many other . . . literary habit [s]." Knight's procedures summarize Nabokov's: As often was the way with Sebastian Knight he used parody as a kind of springboard for leaping into the highest region of serious emotion. J. L. Coleman has called it "a clown developing wings, an angel mimicking a tumbler pigeon," and the metaphor seems to me very apt. Based cun- ningly on a parody of certain tricks of the literary trade, The Prismatic Bezel soars skyward. With something akin to fanatical hate Sebastian Knight was ever hunting out the things which had once been fresh and bright but which were now worn to a thread, dead things among living ones; dead things shamming life, painted and repainted, continuing to be accepted by lazy minds serenely unaware of the fraud. (p. 91) "But all this obscure fun is, I repeat, only the author's springboard" (p. 92), says the narrator, whose tone is justifiably insistent, for although Nabokov is a virtuoso of the minor art of literary burlesque, which is at best a kind of literary criticism, he knows that the novelist who uses parody is under an obligation to engage the reader emo- tionally in a way that Max Beerbohm's A Christmas Garland does not. The description of The Prismatic Bezel and the remainder of chapter ten in The Real Life of Sebastian Knight indicate that Nabokov is fully aware of this necessity, and, like Knight, he has succeeded in making parody a "springboard." There is thus an impor- tant paradox implicit in Nabokov's most audacious parodies: Lolita makes fun of Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground, but Humbert's pages are indeed notes from underground in their own right, and Clare Quilty is both a parody of the Double as a convention of mod- ern fiction, and a Double who formulates the horror in Humbert's life, just as Pale Fire is at once a parody of mad and mindless schol- LOLITA 213</page><page sequence="11">arship-a Tale of the Tub for our time-and, to those who identify the distinctive "voices" in the Botkin-Kinbote-King Charles-authorial voice confluence, a haunting revelation of a tormented mind's efforts to order chaos, and a bracing vision of its success. With the possible exception of Joyce, Nabokov is alone among modern writers in his ability to make parody and pathos converge and sometimes coincide. Joyce comes closest to this in Ulysses, not in the coldly brilliant "Oxen of the Sun" section, but in the "Cyclops" episode in Barney Kiernan's pub, which oscillates between parodic passages and a straightforward rendering of the dialogue and action; in the "Nausicaia" episode on the beach, which first projects Gerty MacDowell's point of view in a style parodying sen- timental ladies' magazine fiction, and midway shifts to Bloom's non-parodic stream-of-consciousness; and in parts of the "Hades" Nighttown section, especially the closing apparition of Bloom's dead son, Rudy. Nabokov has built on Joyce in developing parody as a novelistic form, for in Lolita and Pale Fire, which are totally parodic in form, and may be the finest comic novels since Ulysses, the parody and pathos are always congruent, rather than adjacent to one another -as though the entire "Nausicdia" or "Cyclops" episodes were cast as parody, without in any way diminishing our sense of Bloom's suf- fering, or that Joyce had been able to express something of Bloom's humanity in the "Oxen of the Sun" tour de force. Nabokov has sum- marized in a phrase his triumph in Lolita and Pale Fire. Just before Humbert takes Lolita into their room at The Enchanted Hunters hotel in what is to be the most crucial event in his life, Humbert comments, "Parody of a hotel corridor. Parody of silence and death." (p. 121) To paraphrase Marianne Moore's well-known line that poetry is "imaginary gardens with real toads in them," Nabokov's is a parody of death with real suffering in it. With characteristic self- awareness, Nabokov defines in The Gift the essence of his own art: "The spirit of parody always goes along with genuine poetry." This spirit in Nabokov represents not merely a set of techniques, but an attitude towards experience, a means of discovering the nature of that experience. The Prismatic Bezel is aptly titled; a "bezel" is the sloping edge on a cutting tool or the oblique side of a gem, and the luminous bezel of Nabokov's parody can cut in any direc- tion, often turning in upon itself as self-parody. In The Gift, Fyodor, the young poet who is writing a mock biography of Cherneshevsky, says: I want to keep everything as it were on the very brink of parody. You 214 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="12">know those idiotic 'biographies romanc6es' where Byron is coolly slipped a dream extracted from one of his own poems? And there must be on the other hand an abyss of seriousness, and I must make my way along this narrow ridge between my own truth and a caricature of it. (p. 212) This is an excellent description of the tightrope act Nabokov per- forms along the "narrow ridge" that extends through his fiction. He is constantly slipping into his books "dream[s] extracted," as it were, from one of his or his character's "own poems" in order to create self-parodies that often function in the manner which William Emp- son, in Some Versions of Pastoral, ascribes to the double plot in Shakespeare. According to Empson, the parodic double plot in Shakes- pearean drama releases the audience from the temptation or need to identify with one character. Having responded imaginatively in one way to a situation, the viewer or reader is then free to experience "the chief other response possible" and to focus on something other than the "psychology" of a character. Parody is in Lolita the major means by which Nabokov breaks the circuit of reader-character identification one associates with the conventional novel. In his other novels this is accomplished by a complicated sequence of interacting devices which, by constantly reminding the reader of the novelist's presence in and above his book as a puppeteer in charge of everything, establishes the fiction as total artifice.8 In this sense "mask" is the "keyword" in Nabokov, and one is continually aware of Nabokov's masked participation in his fiction, whether as chess player, actor, ventriloquist, conjurer, or as what Nabokov calls "an anthropomorphic deity impersonated by me"-the intruding authorial consciousness which eventually takes over the novel altogether, involuting it, denying it any reality except that of "book." There is intrusive direct address to the reader in Lolita, and it is important, but it is still in the narrator's voice rather than in the distinctively different voice of the "deity," as in Invita- tion to a Beheading, Bend Sinister, and Pale Fire. Even when Hum- bert momentarily loses control and lets the mask slip, one glimpses his despair, but not the "real" Humbert nor the manipulative author. As Nabokov says in chapter five of Gogol (1944), analogously dis- cussing Akaky Akakyvich and the "holes" and "gaps" in the narrative texture of The Overcoat: "We did not expect that, amid the whirl- ing masks, one mask would turn out to be a real face, or at least the place where that face ought to be" (italics mine). 8 See Part II of my essay, "Nabokov's Puppet Show," op. cit., 26-31. LOLITA I 215</page><page sequence="13">Because Lolita is Nabokov's only uninterrupted narrative since Despair (1934) and Humbert his most "humanized" character since Luzhin (1930)-more so even than Pnin, who is the narrator's re-creation of other people's impersonations of Pnin-readers must consider the esthetic implications of parody, or they are liable to approach Lolita as though it were The Turn of the Screw. By defi- nition, parody and self-parody suspend the possibility of a fully "real- istic" fiction, since their referents are either other literary works or themselves, and not the world of objective reality which the "realist" or "impressionist" tries to reproduce. Only an authorial sensibility, outside the book, can be said to have ordered the texture of parody; the dizzying, multiform perspectives it achieves are beyond the capac- ities of any "point of view" within the book. In the terms of Henry James or Percy Lubbock, Humbert's is finally not a credible point of view. Aubrey McFate, who is following Humbert, turns up in the middle of the neatly alphabetized Ramsdale class list which Humbert incorporates in his narrative, thus undercutting the invio- lable "reality" of much more than that list (p. 54). The "coinci- dences," as has already been suggested, are not simply a matter of McFate's ominous work, since McFate only "exists" insofar as he has been invented. Nabokov has laid into the parodic design of Lolita an elaborate system of involutions which, like the network of coincidences, helps to close the circuits by demonstrating that everything is being manip- ulated, all is a fiction, thus parodying the reader's desire for verisi- militude. Typical of these inlays is Clare Quilty's entry in Who's Who in the Limelight (a mother lode of involutions), where he is listed as the author of The Lady Who Loved Lightning (p. 33). Almost two hundred pages later, during a thunder storm, Lolita comments gratuitously, "I am not a lady and do not love lightning" (p. 222), an involuted cross-reference which reveals a capacity for organization and order that is completely beyond the possibilities of Humbert's alleged unrevised "first draft" manuscript, which has supposedly been composed furiously over a period of less than two months. While he recounts his first night with Lolita he tries not to lose control of the language, but at the same time manages to tell how he was served by Mr. Swine, the room clerk, who is assisted by Mr. Potts, who can't find any cots because Swine has dispatched them to the Swoons (p. 120). Like the presence in the novel of Quilty's anagram- matic mistress, "Vivian Darkbloom" (Vladimir Nabokov), the ver- 216 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="14">bal patterning points beyond his anguish to "Someone else [who] is in the know," to quote an intruding voice in Bend Sinister. Since it is Nabokov and not Humbert who is the expert lepi- dopterist, the most significant authorial patterning in Lolita is the butterfly motif; it enables Nabokov to leave behind on Humbert's pages a trail of his own phosphorescent fingerprints. Nabokov him- self casually underscored its considerable esthetic relevance when I visited him in Switzerland to interview him for this issue and in regard to my study of his work. As an example of the kind of humor- ous but telling detail whose significance critics often miss, I had singled out the moment in the Humbert-Quilty confrontation when Quilty notes that he is known as "the American Maeterlinck," but quickly adds, "Maeterlinck-Schmetterling, says I." (p. 303) Nabokov nodded and with complete seriousness said, "Yes. That's the most important phrase in the chapter." At first this may seem to be an extreme statement, but in the context of the involuted patterning it is perfectly just, for by mentioning the German word for butterfly, Quilty has superimposed the author's watermark on the scene, and it is the sole butterfly reference in the chapter. Nabokov thus appears everywhere in the texture of Lolita but never in the text, although he "com[es] damn close to it" as he lures the reader on. As Humbert says of "Detective Trapp" (Quilty): .b. he succeeded in thoroughly enmeshing me and my thrashing anguish in his demoniacal game. With infinite skill, he swayed and staggered, and regained an impossible balance, always leaving me with the sportive hope -if I may use such a term in speaking of betrayal, fury, desolation, horror and hate-that he might give himself away next time. He never did- though coming damn close to it. We all admire the spangled acrobat with classical grace meticulously walking his tight rope in the talcum light; but how much rarer art there is in the sagging rope expert wearing scare-crow clothes and impersonating a grotesque drunk. I should know. (p. 251) "Trapp"'s balancing act lucidly describes the performance of both the narrator and his creator, whose novels, by virtue of their delusive, parodic form, are in themselves vast and grotesque "impersonations." To take them literally is possibly to suffer feelings of "betrayal, fury, [or] desolation," for the parody-novel fashions a self-contained world in a book; but the reader, in trying to make this kind of novel con- form to his vision, is continually manipulated by the book, trapped by the parodies which reveal the speciousness or superficiality of his LOLITA 217</page><page sequence="15">assumptions, the commonplace qualities of his expectations.9 At the conclusion of his dramatic reunion with Lolita, Humbert says, "Then I pulled out my automatic-I mean, this is the kind of fool thing a reader might suppose I did. It never even occurred to me to do it." (p. 282) By creating a reality which is a fiction, but a fiction that is able to mock the reader, the author has demonstrated the fiction of "reality,"10 and the reader who accepts these implications may even have experienced a change in consciousness. The detachment created by parody and self-parody ultimately defines a way of viewing and judging the self. Characters (and their creators) can never objectively observe their own existence, but self-imitation is one way towards self-reflection and an expanded consciousness. Humbert describes this process and maintains an appropriately Nabokovian equilibrium between the "truth and a caricature of it" when he summarizes the essay he published in the Cantrip Review, "Mimir and Memory" (a "cantrip" is a charm, spell or trick, and describes Lolita's hold on him, while "Mimir" is a giant in Norse mythology who lived by the well at the roof of Yggdrasill, the great tree symbolizing the universe. By drinking its water, he knew the past and future). The essay suggests a "theory of perceptual time based on the circulation of the blood and conceptually depend- ing (to fill up this nutshell) on the mind's being conscious of its own self, thus creating a continuous spanning of two points (the storable future and the stored past)." (p. 262) Although Nabokov has called attention to the elements of par- ody in his work, he has repeatedly denied the relevance of satire. One can understand why he says "I have neither the intent nor the temperament of a moral or social satirist," for he eschews the overtly moral stance of the satirist who offers "to mend the world." Nabokov might not argue, however, if Pale Fire were placed in the tradition of the Menippean satire as it is defined by Northrop Frye, and, Nabokov's denials notwithstanding, Humbert's observations of Amer- ican morals and mores are satirical, the product of his maker's moral sensibility, although this "satire" is over-emphasized by readers who 9 The reader-manipulation effected by the two "false endings" on the last page of the story "Signs and Symbols" (in Nabokov's Dozen) telescopes the methods of the Nabokovian trap-play and thus provides an excellent introduc- tion to the monstrous trap that is Lolita. 10 This involuted process is best described by Jorge Luis Borges in "Par- tial Magic in the Quixote," in Labyrinths (Norfolk, 1962). 218 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="16">fail to recognize the extent of the parody, or its full implications. In the course of showing us our landscape in all its natural beauty and meretricious glory, Humbert satirizes American songs, ads, movies, magazines, products, tourist attractions, summer camps, Dude Ranches, hotels, and motels, as well as the Good Housekeep- ing Syndrome (Your Home is You is one of Charlotte Haze's essen- tial volumes) and the cant of progressive educationists and child guidance pontificators. Nabokov offers us a grotesque parody of a "good relationship," for Humbert and Lo are "pals" with a ven- geance; Know Your Own Daughter is one of the books which Hum- bert consults. Yet Humbert's terrible demands notwithstanding, she is as insensitive as children are to their actual parents; sexuality aside, she demands anxious parental placation in a too typically American way, and affords Nabokov an ideal opportunity to comment on the Teen and Sub-Teen Tyranny. It is poetic justice that Lolita should seduce Humbert at The Enchanted Hunters hotel; the irony is obvi- ous, but telling. Nabokov underscores his point with a resonant pun, characteristic of both himself and Joyce. The seduction takes place in the town of Briceland (note the i rather than y). Anyone over thirty should recall the popular weekly radio program of the 'forties, "Baby Snooks," starring the late Fanny Brice. The show featured only Baby Snooks, a sappy but demanding little girl of indeterminate age, who spoke a patois of baby talk and teen jargon, and her help- less, ineffectual Daddums (twice Humbert calls himself this). Year after year the program celebrated the various ways the tyrannical Baby Snooks could victimize her poor Daddy. The town of Brice- land is well named. Nabokov's book is Baby Snooks and Daddums in apotheosis; Lolita is a Baby Snooks who looms threateningly high above us all. No one would deny that ours is a child-centered culture in deep trouble. "Tristram in Movielove," remarks Humbert, and Nabokov has responded to those various travesties of behavior which too many Americans recognize as tenable examples of significant real- ity. A gloss on this aspect of Lolita is provided by "Ode to a Model," a poem which Nabokov published the same year as Lolita (1955). Yet Nabokov's attitude towards both America and Lolita are similarly ambivalent; "there is a queer, tender charm about that mythical nymphet," he said in an interview, and Humbert's satires are effected with an almost loving care. But there is nothing ambiva- lent about Nabokov's parody of the "Viennese witch doctor." Pro- claiming himself "King Sigmund the Second," Humbert mounts a frontal attack on many orthodox Freudian views, and the parodies LOLITA j 219</page><page sequence="17">are easily discerned. Nabokov burlesques the case study by purposely providing the childhood "trauma" which supposedly accounts for Humbert's nympholepsy: the incomplete coitus which the thirteen- year old Humbert experienced on the French Riviera with Annabel, who died four months later (p. 15). The incident seems to be a sly fictive transmutation of Nabokov's own considerably more innocent childhood infatuation with Colette (chapter six, Speak, Memory). When earnest readers, nurtured on the "standardized symbols of the psychoanalytic racket" (p. 287), leap to make the association between the two episodes-as several have done-and immediately deduce that Lolita is surely autobiographical, then the trap has been sprung: their wantonly reductive gesture justifies the need for just such a parody as Nabokov's. With a cold literary perversity, Nabokov has demonstrated the falseness of their "truth"; the implications are considerable. Even the exegetic act of searching for the "meaning" of Lolita by trying to unfold the butterfly pattern becomes a parody of the expectations of the most sophisticated reader, who finds he is chasing a mocking inversion of the "normal" Freudian direction of symbols which, once identified, may still remain mysterious, or explain very little. The reader who has been unhappily deceived by the autobio- graphical trap or the butterfly motif may justifiably feel that he has been checkmated, for by reading Lolita carefully he is involved in a game, in the fullest and most serious sense. "Darling, this is only a game!" says Humbert at the outset (p. 22), and the pun on his name includes the game of ombre." The readers who say they admire Nabokov in spite of his games are only demonstrating the failure of their responses. A hard distinction between play and seriousness would vitiate the effect of Lolita,'2 and the central importance of the game-element in Nabokov is expressed in Speak, Memory when the description of his composition of chess problems turns out to serve as well for his fiction: "Themes in chess, it may be explained, are such devices as forelaying, withdrawing, pinning, unpinning and so forth .... Deceit, to the point of diabolism, and originality, grad- 11 Ombre is played in Canto III of The Rape of the Lock. For a summary of the "game" in Lolita, so uncannily accurate that Nabokov must have had them in mind, see lines 87-100. 12 Apologies for the game-element in Nabokov should not have to be made. Those who find the play-concept antithetical to "seriousness" would do well to read J. Huizinga's Homo Ludens. 220 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="18">ing into the grotesque, were my notions of strategy." (p. 219) He explains that "competition in chess problems is not really between White and Black but between the composer and the hypothetical solver," just as in first-rate fiction "the real clash" is between the author and the reader, rather than between the characters (p. 220). The "delusive opening moves, false scents, [and] specious lines of play" which characterize the chess problem are effected by parody in Lolita. The subject matter of Lolita is in itself a bravura and "delusive opening move"-a withdrawn promise of pornography. The first one hundred or so pages of Lolita are often erotic-Lolita on Humbert's lap, for instance-but starting with the seduction scene, Nabokov withholds explicit sexual descriptions, at which point Humbert, try- ing to draw the reader into the vortex of the parody, exhorts us to "Imagine me: I shall not exist if you do not imagine me." (p. 131) "I am not concerned with so-called 'sex' at all," Humbert says (p. 136); on the contrary, Nabokov is very much concerned with it, but with the reader's expectations rather than Humbert's machina- tions. "Anybody can imagine those elements of animality," he says, and yet a great many readers wished that he had done it for them, enough to have kept Lolita at the top of the bestseller list for a year, although librarians reported that many readers never finished the novel. The critics and readers who complain that the second half of Lolita is less interesting are not aware of the possible significance of their admission. Their desire for highbrow pornography is doubled in Clare Quilty, whose main hobby is making pornographic films. At the end of the novel, Lolita tells Humbert that Quilty forced her to star in one of his unspeakable "sexcapades," and more than one reader has unconsciously wished that Quilty had been the narrator, his unseen movie the novel. Two of Quilty's pseudonymous hotel guestbook registrations list his home as "Larousse, Ill." and "Hoax- ton, Eng.," but the acute way in which Quilty parodies the reader's voyeurism suggests that the elements of ruse and hoax are deserved and entirely in earnest. Puns thus summarize the function of parody as game: "Lolita was playing a double game," says Humbert, referring to Lolita's tennis and to the Doppelg5inger parody, and Humbert's search for his Double, Quilty, whom he at first believes to be "Detec- tive Gustave Trapp," turns out to be the detective trap. The novel becomes a gameboard on which, through parody, Nabokov assaults the conventions and worst pretentions of his readers. By naming Humbert's lost love "Annabel Lee," Nabokov fuses Freud with Poe. Humbert's extensive "search for a Kingdom by the LOLITA 221</page><page sequence="19">Sea, a Sublimated Riviera, or whatnot" (p. 169), is very funny, but the parody finally reveals the painful consequences of any attempt to relive the past. Poe is everywhere in Lolita,13 and Humbert several times rightly identifies himself with A. Gordon Pym, an earlier first- person narrator whose tale resonates far beyond its initial conception as burlesque and hoax. And "Edgar H. Humbert's" (as he once calls himself) most bravura Poe parodies involve Clare Quilty, whose mouldering mansion, Pavor [Latin for panic] Manor, burlesques Poe's falling House of Usher. In modeling Quilty on the Doppelgainger of the Gothic tale, Nabokov invokes R. L. Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, a favorite of his, Hans Christian Andersen's "The Shadow," and Poe's "William Wilson." The course of Lolita and the Humbert- Quilty relationship are telescoped in "William Wilson," which is a first-person confession by a pseudonymous narrator who "fled in vain" from the Double who pursued him from school to school, a rival in scholarship rather than love. Wilson's "shadow" wears the same clothes as he does (Humbert and Quilty share a purple bathrobe), and when, after traveling to Paris, Rome, Vienna, Berlin, and Moscow, Wilson cannot rid himself of his "brother," he kills him, just as Humbert is "free to destroy my brother." "But all this obscure fun is, I repeat, only the author's springboard." (SK, p. 91) The Doppelginger motif brings to mind Dostoevsky, who has long been one of Nabokov's primary targets. In addition to his "Dostoevskian grin" (p. 72), Humbert experiences several fits, and like many of Nabokov's isolated or incarcerated characters, his gloomy good looks are eventually enhanced by the requisite dark, Dostoevskian beard. One of Dostoevsky's obsessive images, the spider, is parodied by Humbert. In Crime and Punishment, Svidrigailov imagines eternity as a roomful of spiders, while in Notes from Underground and The Brothers Karamazov the spider personifies evil and lust, respectively. Awaiting his "warm-colored prey," Humbert is like an "inflated pale spider" in an old garden (p. 51). He is "Humbert the Wounded Spider" (p. 56), down whose back crawl "cold spiders of panic." (p. 142) These references are but part of a larger parodic scheme. Most Dostoevskian of all is Nabokov's use of the confessional mode. 13 Several of the Poe allusions have also been identified by Elizabeth Phil- lips, "The Hocus-Pocus of Lolita," Literature and Psychology, X, 97-101, and Arthur F. DuBois, "Poe and Lolita," CEA Critic, XXVI, vi, 1, 7; neither has made critical sense of them. Dr. Phillips' attempts are excessive, Mr. DuBois throws up his hands in despair. 222 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="20">"Heart-to-heart talks, confessions in the Dostoevskian manner are also not in my line," he says (SM, p. 215), and Dostoevsky's "sensitive murderers ... are not to be endured for one moment-by this reader anyway," he told an interviewer. But Humbert is the ultimate in sen- sitive murderers, and, as he says, "You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style," especially when he has an urge to confess. "I thought I would use these notes in toto at my trial, to save not my head, of course, but my soul," Humbert says at the end of Lolita (p. 310). The "of course" reveals the play-spirit, and underscores how, by casting Humbert's tale as a mock confession, Nabokov lets Dostoevsky plot the rules of the game and then beats "old Dusty" at his own game. Again, the process is best described when Nabokov compares the composition of a chess problem to "the writing of one of those incredible novels where the author, in a fit of lucid madness, has set himself certain unique rules that he observes, certain nightmare obsta- cles that he surmounts, with the zest of a deity building a live world from the most unlikely ingredients." (SM, p. 220) Lolita's parodic design also includes another convention allied with the confession-the literary journal or diary. Nabokov regards with profound skepticism the possibilities of autobiographical revelation. When Fyodor shaves himself in The Gift, "A pale self-portrait looked out of the mirror with the serious eyes of all self-portraits" (p. 120); Nabokov does not abide such portraits. "Manifold self-awareness" (SM, p. 156) is not to be achieved through solemn introspection, certainly not through the diarist's compulsive egotism, candid but totally self-conscious self-analysis, carefully created "honesty," willful irony, and studied self-deprecation. Nabokov burlesqued the literary diary as far back as 1934. Near the end of Despair, Hermann's first- person narrative "degenerates into a diary"-"the lowest form of litera- ture" (p. 218)--and this early parody is fully realized in Lolita, especially in chapter eleven, Part One, when Humbert incorporates into his narrative a diary "destroyed" five years before. His entire prison "journal" seems to be written before our eyes. "I notice the slip of my pen in the preceding paragraph, but please do not correct it, Clarence" [his lawyer and caretaker of the manuscript], Humbert remarks (p. 34). Several other "mistakes" are left intact, thus creating the illusion that Humbert's manuscript is a first draft, unaltered, written in great haste but with passion, and the hapless literal-minded reader may embrace it as the most "sincere" form of self-portraiture possible. But of course all the worst propensities of the diarist are embodied in Humbert's rhetoric, parodying the First Person Singular's LOLITA 223</page><page sequence="21">almost inevitable solipsism and most tendentious assumptions about Self, and the reader who is late in realizing this has had his own assumptions parodied. Nabokov has rejected a romantic or transcendental notion of self; another of Humbert's jocose but significant appellations is Jean- Jacques Humbert. The unified, definitive self is a joke to Nabokov, for the infinite possibilities of its development are circumscribed by the warped mirror in which we perceive ourselves and the world. Unlike those modern writers who continually bemoan the loss of the self in the modern world, Nabokov accepts the fragmentation, and within the terrifying limitations he coolly acknowledges, Nabokov lets Humbert define himself however he must, and fulfill his human condition, albeit obsessional and aberrant. The reader who can follow the process of involution and calmly play the games effected by par- ody, and realize their implications, will not worry whether Nabokov "approves" or "disapproves" of his characters. What is extraordinary about Lolita is not the presence or absence of the author's "moral position," but the way in which Nabokov enlists us, against our will, on Humbert's side. "Pity is the password," says John Shade, speaking for his creator. Nabokov purposely takes a shocking subject in Lolita, and when we are sympathetic to Hum- bert, Nabokov has successfully expanded our potential for compassion, and has demonstrated that the certainty of our moral feelings is far more tenuous than we ever care to admit. We know exactly what Nabokov means about the contest between the author and the reader when we almost find ourselves wishing Humbert well during his agonizing first night with Lolita at The Enchanted Hunters, or appreciating Humbert's situation when the drugged Lolita occupies an "unfair amount of pillow." (p. 131) "Mesmer Mesmer" is one of the pseudonyms Humbert considered but rejected. It would be a fitting cognomen, given the power and effect of his rhetoric, since Humbert has figuratively made the reader his accomplice in both statutory rape and murder. Needless to say, the rhetoric of morality can be just as manipulative, and what is worse, it may not connect meaningfully with emotion of any kind. Because Lolita seduces Hum- bert she might seem to be the agent of immorality, but the irony is another trap in the game: this is just the kind of easy release from culpability which we are too ready to accept; it does not mitigate the existence of their ensuing two years together, nor the fact that Hum- bert has denied Lolita her youth, whatever its qualities may be. It should be clear that when Nabokov says that there is "No moral in 224 CONTEMPORARY I, ITERATURE</page><page sequence="22">tow" in Lolita, he is not denying it any moral resonance, but simply asserting that his intentions are not didactic (p. 316). Lolita is a moral novel in the fullest sense. Humbert is both victimizer and victim, culprit and judge. Throughout the narrative he is literally and figuratively pursued by his Double, Clare Quilty, who is by turns ludicrous and absurd, sinister and grotesque. Prior to his full-dress appearance in chapter thirty-five, Part Two, when he is killed by Humbert, Quilty is seen or alluded to more than fifty times, not including the several references to Aubrey McFate (as Hum "dub[s] that devil of mine" [p. 58]). Although Quilty is usu- ally not mentioned by name, direct clues are planted through allu- sions to his uncle, Dr. Ivor Quilty, who is the Hazes' neighbor and dentist, and in Humbert's mention of Who's Who in the Limelight, which includes an entry under "Quilty, Clare, American dramatist," where he is listed as the author of Fatherly Love and The Little Nymph (p. 33).~4 For a while Humbert is certain that his "shadow" and nemesis is his Swiss cousin, Detective Trapp, and when Lolita agrees and says, "Perhaps he is Trapp," she is summarizing Quilty's role in the novel (p. 221). So complete is the respective entrapment of both Humbert and the reader that hardly ten or fifteen pages can go by in the course of Part One without Quilty's fleeting presence, and in Part Two he becomes omnipresent, for even after killing him, Humbert still feels "all covered with Quilty." The creator of "private movies" of Sade's Justine is always in the wings, so to speak, because he formulates Humbert's sense of guilt and the reader's prurient curiosity, and his name lends itself to obvious but significant word- play: Clare Quilty is clearly guilty."5 Humbert knows he is clearly guilty, though he goes about say- ing it in oblique and unexpected ways. As his narrative draws to a 14 Since space limitations prevent any full explication of the labyrinth of Quilty references, I will provide page references and invite readers to embark on what Humbert calls "that cryptogrammic paper chase": pp. 6, 33, 34, 45, 65, 66, 71, 80, 91, 115, 123, 128-129, 140, 141; [Part Two] 158, 161, 165, 172, 188, 198, 202, 204, 205, 209-211, 213, 215, 217-225, 229, 230-231, 234, 237, 239-240, 243-245, 248-252, 264, 274-275, 277-278, 292-293, 295-307, 308, and 311. McFate appears on pp. 54, 58, 109, 118, 212-213, 253, and 258. 15 The pun is also pointed out by Page Stegner in Escape into Aesthetics: The Art of Vladimir Nabokov (New York, 1966), p. 104. Since Mr. Stegner has been generous to me in his preface and in a footnote to his Lolita chapter, regarding my influence on his work both in and out of the classroom, let me say that he and I have happily shared some of our insights, which may be cred- ited to spontaneous combustion as well as to formal "influences." LOLITA 225</page><page sequence="23">close, Humbert's stance becomes increasingly "moral," but readers must be wary of the most overtly confessional passages, such as Hum- bert's re-creation of the crucial scene in which, after a three-year search, he confronts a pregnant ex-nymphet and, in a long passage which should not be excised, realizes that as "clearly as I know I am to die, that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth," in spite of her "ruined looks and her adult, rope-veined narrow hands and her goose-flesh white arms." (p. 279)16 It would be an understatement to say that the tone of the entire pas- sage is ambiguous: the baby's dream, the injunction to an imaginary judge and jury, the interpolations in French, the parodic echo of Billy Graham's exhortation ("Make those twenty-five steps. Now"), and the purposeful banality of Humbert's promise ("And we shall live happily ever after") almost annihilate Humbert's declaration of love, but not quite. Miraculously enough, one believes in his love, not because of any confession, but in spite of it. "I had always thought that wringing one's hands was a fictional gesture," Humbert says (p. 85), and the comic turns are a protection against such rhetor- ical gestures and serve to isolate, if only for a moment, the arresting image of a wan and helpless girl. Humbert's fullest expressions of "grief" are qualified, if not undercut completely, and these passages represent a series of traps in which Nabokov again parodies the reader's expectations by having Humbert say what the reader wants to hear. "I was a pentapod monster, but I loved you. I was despicable and brutal, and turpid, and everything" (p. 286); it is easy to confess, but the moral vocabu- lary we employ so readily may go no deeper than Humbert's parody of it. Although Humbert "quote[s] an old poet," "The moral sense in mortals is the duty/ We have to pay on mortal sense of beauty," one may wonder if he does indeed pay any duty (p. 285). The pay- ment is in fact exacted throughout the narrative, and is in part ex- pressed in the grotesque gyrations of Humbert's tone: "Ah, gentle drivers gliding through summer's black nights, what frolics, what twists of lust, you might see from your impeccable highways if Kumfy Kabins were suddenly drained of their pigments and became as transparent as boxes of glass." (p. 119) Gentle readers gliding through Humbert's prose are similarly subjected to jolting twists of tone-a rhetorical trapdoor that opens with absurd suddenness, an 16 The complete passage on which I am commenting runs from the middle of p. 279 to the middle of p. 280. 226 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="24">unexpected downhill slide, a lyrical or humorous lift that momen- tarily relaxes the tension, then, without warning, another trapdoor. Such passages are free of any transitional phrases that might allow a logical and gradual shift in tone; the effect can be chilling. "She was very tall," Humbert says of Jean Farlow, "wore either slacks with sandals or billowing skirts with ballet slippers, drank any strong liquor in any amount, had had two miscarriages, wrote stories about ani- mals, painted, as the reader knows, landscapes, was already nursing the cancer that was to kill her at thirty-three, and was hopelessly unat- tractive to me." (p. 106) The sudden oscillations between the hor- rific and the humorous catch our laughter short, creating a tension that Humbert's jollity can never quite release; what Nabokov has called Humbert's "rhetorical venom"'7 is turned back upon the nar- rator, affording an implicit commentary on his own acts. "We continued our grotesque journey," Humbert says at one point, and the summary adjective is well-chosen, for the ultimate morality of Lolita is expressed through the grotesque. Those who are uneasy with Nabokov the immoraliste may find necessary solace in the carefully manipulated changes on the grotesque which proliferate in Lolita. Humbert's self-disgust and loathing and guilt are projected into almost all the so-called human beings Humbert "sees" or, more accurately, reports having seen: Quilty; Gaston Godin; Miss Opposite, the crippled neighbor; random carhops, bellboys, and parking-lot attendants; the room clerk, Mr. Swine; the old barber in Kasbeam (p. 215); and Dick Schiller, Lolita's almost deaf husband, who is assisted by a one-armed young man named Bill, of whom Humbert comments, "It was then noticed that one of the few thumbs remain- ing to Bill was bleeding (not such a wonder-worker at all)." (p. 275) The grotesque is meaningfully present in the most casual of encoun- ters, as when Frank, a motel attendant, stands in the doorway, his hand on its jamb: At twenty paces Frank used to look a mountain of health; at five, as now, he was a ruddy mosaic of scars-had been blown through a wall over- seas; but despite nameless injuries he was able to man a tremendous truck, fish, hunt, drink, and buoyantly dally with roadside ladies. That day, either because it was such a great holiday, or simply because he wanted to divert a sick man, he had taken off the glove he usually wore on his left hand (the one pressing against the side of the door) and revealed to 17 Foreword to Despair, p. 9. LOLITA 227</page><page sequence="25">the fascinated sufferer not only an entire lack of fourth and fifth fingers, but also a naked girl, with cinnabar nipples and indigo delta, charmingly tattooed on the back of his crippled hand, its index and middle digit making her legs while his wrist bore her flower-crowned head. Oh, delicious . reclining against the woodwork, like some sly fairy. (p. 247) As Humbert quietly says to Lolita when they notice the fragmented and surreal limbs of a department store mannikin, "Look well. Is not that a good symbol of something or other?" (p. 228) But this potential booby trap is only a dud, for it is a good symbol, in a refreshingly direct way, and Humbert is only dissembling, though symbol-mongering critics may accept the warning. The entire physi- cal world of Lolita seems to be maimed, and the animate and inani- mate share each other's properties in startling and unsettling ways. The car which runs over Charlotte Haze has doors "open like wings," and the driver's old father lies on the lawn in a faint, "like a death- size wax figure," an "old man-doll," whom a nurse "watered on the green bank where he lay." (p. 100) Even Humbert's car limps (p. 258). The hunchbacks, the tennis-playing "Boschian cripples" (p. 237), the broken nose of a man wiping down Hum's windshield, Humbert's terrifying dream of Lolita (p. 256), his self-styled animal characteristics of ape, spider, and octopus-the possible parodic allu- sions to Poe, Dostoevsky, and Stevenson notwithstanding-and the numerous other seemingly gratuitous grotesque details are all meta- phoric for the horror implicit in Humbert's life, for his suffering, his sense of shame and guilt and self-hate. "And I have still other smothered memories," says Humbert towards the end of Lolita, "now unfolding themselves into limbless monsters of pain." (p. 286) Thus Nabokov uses the grotesque to express the anguish behind Humbert's rhetoric, the pain at the center of his playfulness, the price he must pay for having loved the way he was fated to love; one should not forget that Humbert dies of a coronary shortly after finishing his "book." Because he knows that he has treated Lolita like a thing, Humbert's world seems to have been reduced to mon- strous "thinghood," and his grotesque projections are by way of his "confession": "'Did you happen to see-' [Lolita] I asked of a hunchback sweeping the floor ... He had, the old lecherer." (p. 225) Although the mask has not been removed, it has been penetrated, for the "slipperyself"'s moral judgments on its "public" acts have been transposed to the scene-inscape as landscape-and Nabokov is sly enough to have Humbert say something almost to that effect: "I am afraid, Clarence . . . I did not keep any notes, and have at 228 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="26">my disposal only an atrociously crippled tour book in three volumes, almost a symbol of my torn and tattered past." (p. 156) Nabokov has parodied all "literary" confessions that would offer a strident and rhetorical experession of egotism as a revelation of the soul, and at the same time has succeeded in suggesting the deepest reaches of that soul. In their own way, Humbert's "tragic notes" are indeed from underground, but only because they embody both the "truth and a caricature of it." This hazardous equipoise is also sustained in the doubling of Quilty and Humbert, for Quilty is at once a projection of Humbert's guilt and a parody of the psychological Double. The Double motif figures prominently throughout Nabokov, from the early 'thirties in Despair and Laughter in the Dark (where the Albinus-Axel Rex pairing rehearses the Humbert-Quilty doubling), to Sebastian Knight and on through Bend Sinister, the story "Scenes from the Life of a Double Monster," Lolita, Pnin, and Pale Fire, which offers a monu- mental doubling (or, more properly, tripling). It is probably the most intricate and profound of all Doppelga~nger novels, written at pre- cisely the time when it seemed that the Double theme had been exhausted in modern literature, and this achievement was very likely made possible by Nabokov's elaborate parody of the theme in Lolita, which renewed his sense of the artistic efficacy of another literary "thing which had once been fresh and bright but which was now worn to a thread." (SK, p. 91)18 By making Quilty too clearly guilty, Nabokov is assaulting the convention of the good and evil "dual selves" found in the traditional Double tale. Humbert would let some of us believe that when he kills Quilty in chapter thirty-five, Part Two, the good poet has exor- cised the bad monster, but the two are finally not to be clearly dis- tinguished: when Humbert and Quilty wrestle, "I rolled over him. We rolled over me. They rolled over him. We rolled over us." 18 The considerable amount of teasing ambiguity as to whether Humbert's pursuer is "real" or an autoscopic hallucination parodies Golyadkin Jr. and the central problem of Dostoevsky's The Double (the narrator of Despair considers "The Double" as a title for his book, "But Russian literature possessed one al- ready," he says). When Humbert perceives Quilty and his Aztec Red Convertible (which also has a Double! [p. 229]) as a "red-beast," "red shadow," or "red fiend," Nabokov is parodying that archetypal Double, the Devil, and, more specifically, its predictable avatars in Thomas Mann's Death in Venice and Doctor Faustus, where the Doubles are inevitably devil-like and red-haired. The parody persists in Pale Fire. LOLITA 229</page><page sequence="27">Although the parody culminates in this "silent, soft, formless tussle on the part of two literati" (p. 301), it is sustained throughout the novel. In the traditional Doppelg5inger fiction the Double representing the reprehensible self is often described as an ape. In The Possessed, Stavrogin tells Verkhovensky, "you're my ape"; in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Hyde plays "apelike tricks," attacks and kills with "apelike fury" and "apelike spite"; and in Poe's "The Murders in the Rue Morgue," the criminal self is literally an ape. But "good" Humbert undermines the doubling by often calling himself an ape, rather than Quilty, and when the two face one another, Quilty also calls Hum- bert an ape."9 This transference is forcefully underscored when Humbert refers to himself as running along like "Mr. Hyde," his "talons still tingling." (p. 208) In Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Kurtz is Marlow's "shadow" and "shade." Although Humbert calls Quilty his "shadow," the pun on Humbert's name suggests that he is as much a shadow as Quilty, and like the shadow self in Andersen's tale, Humbert is dressed all in black. Quilty in fact first regards Hum- bert as possibly being "some familiar and innocuous hallucination" of his own (p. 296), and in the novel's closing moments the masked narrator addresses Lolita and completes this transferral: "And do not pity C.Q. One had to choose between him and H.H., and one wanted H.H. to exist at least a couple of months longer, so as to have him make you live in the minds of later generations." The book might have been told by "C.Q.," the doubling reversed; "H.H." is simply a better artist, more likely to possess the "secret of durable pigments." (p. 311) If the Humbert-Quilty doubling is a conscious parody of "Wil- liam Wilson," it is with good reason, for Poe's story is unusual among Doppelglinger tales in that it presents a reversal of the conventional situation: the weak and evil self is the main character, pursued by the moral self, whom he kills. Nabokov goes further and with one vertiginous sweep stands the convention on its head: in terms of the nineteenth-century Double tale, it should not even be necessary to kill Quilty and what he represents, for Humbert has already declared his love for Lolita before he goes to Quilty's Pavor Manor, and in asking the no longer nymphic Lolita to go away with him, he has 19 Their confrontation also seems to parody the reunion of the professor and his shadow in Andersen's "The Shadow." Quilty's Pavor Manor is appro- priately on "Grimm Rd." Nabokov's brilliant reading of this chapter is not to be missed (Spoken Arts LP 902). 230 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="28">transcended his obsession. As a "symbolic" act, the killing is gratui- tous; the parodic design is complete. Quilty rightly balks at his symbolic role: "I'm not responsible for the rapes of others. Absurd!" he tells Humbert, and his words are well taken, for in this scene Humbert is trying to make him totally responsible, and the poem which he has Quilty read aloud reinforces his effort, and again demonstrates how a Nabokov parody moves beyond the "obscure fun" of stylistic imitation to connect with the most serious region of the book. It begins as a parody of Eliot's "Ash Wednesday" but ends by undercutting all the confessing in which "remorseful" Humbert has just been engaged: "because of all you did/because of all I did not/ you have to die." (p. 302) Since Quilty has been described as "the American Maeterlinck," it goes without saying that his ensuing death scene should be extravagantly "sym- bolic." Because one is not easily rid of an "evil" self, Quilty is almost impossible to kill, but the idea of exorcism is rendered absurd by his comically prolonged death throes, which, in the spirit of Canto V of The Rape of the Lock, burlesque the gore and rhetoric of literary death scenes ranging from the Elizabethan drama to the worst of detective novels. Quilty returns to the scene of the crime-a bed- and it is here that Humbert finally corners him. When Humbert fires his remaining bullets at close range, Quilty "lay back, and a big pink bubble with juvenile connotations formed on his lips, grew to the size of a toy balloon, and vanished." (p. 306) The last details empha- size the mock-symbolic association with Lolita; the monstrous self that has devoured Lolita, bubblegum, childhood and all, is "sym- bolically" dead, but as the bubble explodes, so does the Gothic Dop- pelg5inger convention, with all its own "juvenile connotations" about identity, and we learn shortly that Humbert is still "all covered with Quilty." Guilt is not to be exorcised so readily-McFate is McFate, to coin a Humbertism-and the ambiguities of human experience and identity are not to be reduced to mere "dualities." Instead of the successful integration of a neatly divisible self, we are left with "Clare Obscure" and "quilted Quilty," the patchwork self (p. 308). Quilty refuses to die, just as the recaptured nose, in Gogol's extraor- dinary Double story of that name, would not at first stick to its owner's face. The reader who has expected the solemn moral-ethical absolutes of a Poe, Dostoevsky, Mann, or Conrad Doppelgainger fiction instead discovers himself adrift in a fantastic, comic cosmos more akin to Gogol's. Having hoped that Humbert would master his "secret sharer," we find rather that his quest for his "slippery LOLITA 1 231</page><page sequence="29">self" figuratively resembles Major Kovaliov's frantic chase after his own nose through the spectral streets of St. Petersburg, and that Humbert's "quest" has its mock "ending" in a final confrontation that, like the end of The Overcoat, is not a confrontation at all. The parodic references to R. L. Stevenson suggest that Nabokov had in mind Henry Jekyll's painfully earnest discovery of the "truth" that "man is not only one, but truly two. I say two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines." The "serial selves" of Pale Fire "outstrip" Stevenson and a good many other writers, and rather than undermining Humbert's guilt, the Double parody in Lolita locks Humbert within that prison of mirrors in which the "real self" and its masks blend into one another, the refracted outlines of good and evil becoming terrifyingly confused. Humbert's search for the whereabouts and identity of Detective Trapp (Quilty) invites the reader to wend his way through a laby- rinth of clues in order to solve this mystery, a process which parodies the Poe "tale of ratiocination." When Humbert finds Lolita and presses her for her abductor's name, She said really it was useless, she would never tell, but on the other hand, after all-"Do you really want to know who it was? Well it was--" And softly, confidentially, arching her thin eyebrows and puckering her parched lips, she emitted, a little mockingly, somewhat fastidiously, not untenderly, in a kind of muted whistle, the name that the astute reader has guessed long ago. Waterproof. Why did a flash from Hourglass Lake cross my conscious- ness? I, too, had known it, without knowing it, all along. There was no shock, no surprise. Quietly the fusion took place, and everything fell into order, into the pattern of branches that I have worn throughout this memoir with the express purpose of having the ripe fruit fall at the right moment; yes, with the express and perverse purpose of rendering-she was talking but I sat melting in my golden peace-of rendering that golden and monstrous peace through the satisfaction of logical recognition, which my most inimical reader should experience now. (pp. 273-274) Even here Humbert withholds Quilty's identity, though the "astute reader" may recognize that "Waterproof" is a clue which leads back to an early scene at the lake, in which Charlotte had said that Hum- bert's watch was waterproof and Jean Farlow had alluded to Quilty's Uncle Ivor (by his first name only), and then had almost mentioned Clare Quilty by name: Ivor "told me a completely indecent story 232 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="30">about his nephew. It appears-" but she is interrupted and the chapter ends (p. 91). This teasing exercise in ratiocination-"peace" indeed!-is the detective trap-another parody of the reader's assump- tions and expectations, as though even the most astute reader could ever fully discover the identity of Quilty, Humbert, or of himself. Provided with Quilty's name, Humbert now makes his way to Pavor Manor, that latter-day House of Usher, where the extended and variegated parodies of Poe are laid to rest. All the novel's parodic themes are concluded in this chapter. Its importance is telescoped by Humbert's conclusion that "This, I said to myself, was the end of the ingenious play staged for me by Quilty." (p. 307) In form, of course, this bravura set piece is not a play, but as a summary parodic commentary on the main action, it does function in the manner of an Elizabethan play-within-the-play, and its "staging" underscores once more the game-element central to the book. When indestructible Quilty dies, he fittingly subsides "in a pur- ple heap," the color of his prose and of a good many of Humbert's quilted verbal patterns. Quilty's "genre, his type of humor," says Humbert, "had affinities with my own. He mimed and mocked me." (p. 251) Quilty's penchant for "logadaedaly and logomancy" double Humbert's own excesses, and Quilty's death scene rhetoric and trail of recondite, "insulting pseudonyms" (pp. 250-253), duly commented on by Humbert ("obvious"; "trite poke"; "in horrible taste"; "silly but funny"; "shoddy" [p. 252]) represent Humbert's act of self- criticism, and ultimately Nabokov's, too. "His main trait was his pas- sion for tantalization. Goodness, what a tease the poor fellow was! He challenged my scholarship." (p. 252) Humbert's "cryptogrammic paper chase" after Quilty is Nabokov's self-parody of the involuted butterfly pattern running through the book's substratum and a com- pressed parody of the author-reader conflict sustained over the course of the trap-laden book (Quilty "succeeded in thoroughly enmeshing me . . . in his demoniacal game" [p. 251]; "touch6, reader!" says Humbert, granting us a point in the game while mocking our delight in recognizing one of Quilty's most obvious literary jokes [p. 252]). Nabokov's own proclivities are reflected in Humbert's puns, which are in turn refracted in Quilty's worse puns. A double self-parody spirals in upon Quilty, who seals his own fate in the eyes of both the narrator and the author when he tells Humbert, "you know, as the Bard said, with that cold in his head, to borrow and to borrow and to borrow" (p. 303), and for that, Quilty deserves to die. Nabokov has written thirteen books in Russian and ten in Eng- LOLITA 233</page><page sequence="31">lish (not including his translations). In the Afterword to Lolita, he corrects the critic who thought that Lolita was "the record of my love affair with the romantic novel," and suggests that "The substitu- tion 'English language' for 'romantic novel' would make this elegant formula more correct." (p. 317) But Lolita doesn't chronicle the happiest "love affair," and "the second-rate brand of English" [sic] which Nabokov says he has adopted in place of his "untrammeled" and "rich" Russian idiom is belied by the eloquent and elegant Eng- lish prose of Speak, Memory, the book previous to Lolita. This sug- gests that the language of Lolita-which might be termed colloquial baroque-is both a conscious parody of all efforts to acquire a "fine style" (including Speak, Memory) and a parodic record of the painful struggle to capture in any language the essence of what Albinus, in Laughter in the Dark, calls "a thing quite impossible to capture," whether it be the past, as in Speak, Memory, or the grace and beauty of a nymphet. "What a tale might be told," imagines Albinus, "the tale of an artist's vision, the happy journey of eye and brush" (p. 9), and Nabokov tells it in Lolita, but it is a journey through "black Humberland." By purposely making his narrator a decidedly second- rate man of letters-a "manqu6 talent"-Nabokov can not only show us the struggle more clearly, but may incorporate into Humbert's caprices a network of literary jokes and minor parodies which express concrete and consistent ideas concerning language, literature, and the limitations inherent in just such an effort as Humbert's. Nabokov has said that poetry is the "mystery of the irrational perceived through rational words." Throughout his work he con- fronts the central problem of post-Romantic art and literature and, using parody and self-parody as "springboards," offers a critique of Romanticism. At its very best, Nabokov's verbal slapstick will thus suggest the inner tensions which threaten to break down a character and with him the language, especially when he is trying to commu- nicate that "mystery," to re-create an abyss. Cincinnatus in Invitation to a Beheading tells Millie, his twelve-year old inamorata, "I'm exhausted-I didn't weep a slink last night," just as two decades later, in their "seduction" scene at The Enchanted Hunters, Humbert says to Lolita, "What's the katter with misses?" I muttered (word-control gone) into her hair. "If you must know," she said, "you do it the wrong way." "Show, wight ray." 234 J CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="32">"All in good time," responded the spoonerette. Seva ascendes, pulsata, brulans, kitzelans, dementissima. Elevator clat- terans, pausa, clatterans, populus in corridoro. Hanc nisi mors mihi adimet nemo! Juncea puellula, jo pensavo fondissime, nobserva nihil quidquam ... (p. 122) The language of Horace and Catullus (both of whom are mentioned in Lolita) is appropriate to this modern, if hysterical, elegiast-the rush of "Latin" registering background noises and Humbert's panic and garbled expression of undying love. At moments of extreme crisis, Humbert croaks incomprehensibly, losing more than his expro- priated English, for his attempts "to fix once for all the perilous magic of nymphets" (p. 136) almost resist language altogether, carry- ing him close to the edge of non-language and a figurative silence.20 Thus Humbert significantly announces the scene as a "Parody of silence" (p. 121), and far from being non-sensical, the ensuing non- sense Latin is a parodic stream-of-consciousness, affording a brief critical comment on a technique which Nabokov finds unsatisfactory, even in the novels of Joyce, whom he reveres. "We think not in words but in shadows of words," Nabokov has said. "James Joyce's mistake in those otherwise marvelous mental soliloquies of his consists in that he gives too much verbal body to words." To Nabokov, the unconnected impressions and associations that impinge on the mind are irrational until they are consciously ordered; and to order them in art is to fulfill a virtually moral obligation, for without rational language, man has "grown a very/ landfish, languageless,/ a mon- ster," as Thersites says of Ajax in Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida. Nabokov and his beleaguered first person narrators have looked into the void, but they do not reproduce it; the "private language" of Zemblan in Pale Fire is the nearest Nabokov has come, and its effi- cacy is totally rejected through parody. In contrast to the state of "silence" towards which so much recent art variously evolves or aspires-whether Samuel Beckett, William Burroughs, John Cage, or Ad Reinhardt-Nabokov's deeply humanistic art reaffirms the reality and majesty of language. Even the imprisoned and doomed Cincinnatus is "already thinking of how to set up an alphabet" which might humanize his dystopian world ( I, p. 139). Humbert says of his artistic labors, "The beastly and beautiful So G. D. Josipovici makes a similar point in "Lolita: Parody and the Pur- suit of Beauty," Critical Quarterly, VI, 46. LOLITA 235</page><page sequence="33">merged at one point, and it is that borderline I would like to fix, and I feel I fail to do so utterly. Why?" (p. 137) The rhetorical question is coy enough because he answered it at the beginning of his narrative; he hasn't failed, but neither can he ever be entirely successful, because "Oh, my Lolita, I have only words to play with!" (p. 34)-an admis- sion many post-Romantic writers would not make.2' Nabokov's remark about Joyce giving "too much verbal body to words" succinctly defines the burden the Symbolists placed on the word, as though it were an endlessly resonant object rather than one component in a referential system of signs. As G. D. Josipovici observes, "To try and use them as objects is . . . to repeat the mistake Humbert made with Lolita: to try and possess carnally what can only be pos- sessed imaginatively."22 Nabokov's novels are filled with allusions to other writers, but never more meaningfully than in Lolita, since Humbert's acknowledgment of the limitations of language leaves so many writers open to criticism, especially the Romantic poets. "Are you troubled by Romantic Associations?" Charlotte inquires of her new husband, and Keats, Byron, and Blake are humorously invoked. Humbert calls Lolita a "fair daemon child" (p. 174), which makes her a kind of Belle Dame Sans Merci in bobby sox. But the main recipient of Nabokov's parody of Romanticism is Edgar Poe. Like Poe's first-person narrators who incorporate poems into their tales ("The Assignation," "Ligeia," "The Fall of the House of Usher"), Humbert interpolates liberal amounts of his own verse, and its comically blatant rhymes suggest an overly zealous application of Poe's ideas on rhyme in "The Poetic Principle." Nabokov's choice of both subject matter and narrator parody Poe's designation, in "The Philosophy of Composition," of the "most poetical topic in the world": "the death of a beautiful woman . . . and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover." Both Annabel Lee and Lolita "die," the latter in terms of her fading nymphic qualities and escape from Humbert, who invokes yet another of Poe's lost ladies when he calls Lolita "Lenore" (the subject of "Lenore" and "The Raven"), a reference which also points to "The Philosophy of Composition," since that essay concerns "The Raven." 21 Ibid., 45-48. I had developed this line of analysis before seeing Mr. Josipovici's essay, but since his discussion of the relationship of language and irrationality anticipates my remarks, I wish to acknowledge his contribution. 22 Ibid., 46. 236 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="34">The speaker in Poe's "Lenore" gropes for the right elegiac chord: "How shall the ritual, then, be read?-the requiem how be sung/ By you-by yours, the evil eye,-by yours, the slanderous tongue/ That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?" How shall it be "sung" is also the main question in Lolita, and Nabo- kov found his answer in a parodic style that seems to parody all styles, including its own. This self-parodying tone is well-defined by a writer much admired by Nabokov. Jorge Luis Borges says that "the Baroque is that style which deliberately exhausts (or tries to exhaust) its possibilities and borders on its own caricature."23 "You talk like a book, Dad," Lolita tells Humbert; and in order to protect his own efforts to capture her essence, he tries to exhaust the "fictional ges- tures," such as Edgar Poe's, which would reduce the nymphet's ineffable qualities to a convention of language or literature. "Only in the tritest of terms," says Humbert, "can I describe Lo's features: I might say her hair is auburn, and her lips are red as licked red candy, the lower one prettily plump-oh, that I were a lady writer who could have her pose naked in a naked light!" (p. 46) "Well-read Humbert" will imitate the locution of a famous writer, try it on for size-"We came to know-nous conniimes, to use a Flaubertian into- nation" (p. 147)--toy with it- "Nous connuimes (this is a royal fun)" (p. 148)--and then abandon it for something else. More than fifty writers are treated in this spirit, ranging from Dante and Petrarch to Molnar and Maeterlinck, as though only through parody and carica- ture can Humbert prevent the possibility that his "memoir" might finally be nothing more than what the authorial voice in Invitation to a Beheading asks of its captive creation: "Or is this all but obsolete romantic rot, Cincinnatus?" (p. 139) That Lolita is not in any way "obsolete" results from Nabokov's realization of the ultimate implications of Proust's injunction to writers "to indulge in the cleansing, exorcising pastime of parody."''4 Because Nabokov's use of parody is like Sebastian Knight's-"a clown developing wings, an angel mimicking a tumbler pigeon" (SK, p. 91)-he is able to have it both ways. Humbert's baroque 23 Borges, op. cit., p. xxii. 24 Marcel Proust, "About Flaubert's Style," in Pleasures and Days, ed. F. W. Dupee (Garden City, 1957), p. 233. Proust was not suggesting that paro- dies should be incorporated into the novel, but rather that the practice of par- ody would release the novelist from the "spell" of a great writer and allow him to write his own novels. LOLITA 237</page><page sequence="35">language constitutes a virtuoso balancing or juggling act, for there are intervals when Humbert does capture Lolita's "essential grace," moments when, in the midst of the cascading puns and parodies, one has a glimpse of the "borderline [where] the beastly and beauti- ful merged," as in the scene where she plays tennis (pp. 233-236). It is a crucial necessity to recognize the tonal oscillations between his "beastly" and "beautiful" intonations, and to understand that one enables Humbert to realize the other. At the conclusion of Hum- bert's extended description of Lolita's tennis game, which occurs shortly before she is "kidnapped," the butterfly rises from its con- fines in the hermetic substructure of the novel, and in a single-line paragraph that it has to itself, flutters across the page: "An inquisi- tive butterfly passed, dipping, between us." (p. 236)25 Its appearance foreshadows the transcendent moment of felicity which has carried Humbert beyond the frightening solipsism of his lust and has enabled him to write his narrative. At the end of the novel, after crazily driving on the wrong, "mirror" side of the high- way, Humbert turns off the road and rides up a grassy slope, coming to a "gentle, rocking stop." Immobile, suspended in felicity, he expe- riences "A kind of thoughtful Hegelian synthesis linking up two dead women" (p. 309), a realization of Quilty's play-within-the-novel, The Enchanted Hunters, which featured Lolita as a bewitching "farmer's daughter who imagines herself to be a woodland witch, or Diana" (p. 202), and seven hunters, six of them "red-capped, uniformly attired." A "last-minute kiss was to enforce the play's profound mes- sage, namely, that mirage and reality merge in love." (p. 203) When Humbert asks a pregnant and veiny-armed Lolita to go away with him, he demonstrates that the mirage of the past (the nymphic Lolita as his lost "Annabel") and the reality of the present (the Charlotte-like woman Lolita is becoming) have merged in love, a "synthesis linking up two dead women." The play's "message" also describes the "aesthetic bliss" (p. 318) of artistic creation, and one involuted turn in the "plot" of The Enchanted Hunters almost reveals the hand of an enchanted hunter named Nabokov: "a seventh Hunter (in a green cap, the fool) was a Young Poet, and he insisted, much to Diana's annoyance, that she and the entertainment provided (dancing nymphs, and elves, and monsters) were his, the Poet's invention." (p. 203) Humbert is Nabo- kov's creation just as Lolita is Humbert's, and for a summary com- 25 Miss Butler notes that this scene is the "most complete portrayal . of Lolita's butterfly nature," op. cit., 77-79. 238 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="36">ment, one looks to the narrator of The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, who, in speaking of The Prismatic Bezel, has preempted Nabokov's critics by limpidly presaging the entire parodic design and progression of Lolita: I have tried my best to show the workings of the book, at least some of its workings. Its charm, humour and pathos can only be appreciated by direct reading. But for enlightenment of those who felt baffled by its habit of metamorphosis, or merely disgusted at finding something incom- patible with the idea of a "nice book" in the discovery of a book's being an utterly new one, I should like to point out that The Prismatic Bezel can be thoroughly enjoyed once it is understood that the heroes of the book are what can be loosely called "methods of composition." It is as if a painter said: look, here I'm going to show you not the painting of a landscape, but the painting of different ways of painting a certain land- scape, and I trust their harmonious fusion will disclose the landscape as I intend you to see it. (SK, p. 95) III The lepidopteral game is but one of several reminders that Lolita is to Nabokov a deeply personal book. Like many of his char- acters, Humbert is an 6migre, and Nabokov has been an exile for his entire adult life. It is a fact which characterizes a state of mind and spirit. Since leaving Russia in 1919 he has never owned a house and even today resides in a hotel. But the theme of exile in Nabokov's work is not merely a matter of the special circumstances of his life, for the figure of the Exile embodies the human condition in our time, and no one has written more movingly about this figure than Nabo- kov. But the Exile has his past-like the movie extras in "The Assist- ant Producer," that may well be all that he does have-and in Speak, Memory, Nabokov re-creates the past, making it as vivid as the pres- ent. But the obsessive nostalgia that is so central to Nabokov's vision is ultimately no substitute for a viable life in the present, and among other things, Lolita is a devastating self-criticism of the reflexive attempt to move out of time, a self-parody of the psychological pas- toral, and as such, it is Nabokov's own answer to his previous book, Speak, Memory. As Humbert says, near the end of the novel, "I was weeping again, drunk on the impossible past." (p. 284) Even Lolita tells him that "the past was the past," and his efforts to recap- ture it are made more than ludicrous by the congruent parody of Poe and psychiatry. If we envision Lolita and the brief time span of her nymphic years as a correlative for the past, we see how irrevocably LOLITA 239</page><page sequence="37">self-destructive it is to live in that impossible past. "She had entered my world," says Humbert, "umber and black Humberland" (p. 168) -the shadowland of memory, a punning world where one shadow pursues another, and is destroyed in the process (see above). As an exile, Nabokov of course had to write Lolita in English. "My private tragedy, which cannot, and indeed should not, be any- body's concern," he says, "is that I had to abandon my natural idiom." (p. 318) But his "private tragedy" is our concern, for in vary- ing degrees it involves us all. Nabokov's search for the language ade- quate to Lolita is Humbert's search for the language that will reach Lolita, and it is a representative search, a heightened emblem of all of our attempts to communicate. "A penny for your thoughts, I said, and she stretched out her palm at once." (p. 210) It is the almost insuperable distance between those thoughts and that palm which Nabokov has measured so accurately and so movingly in Lolita: the distance between people, the distance separating love from lovemak- ing, mirage from reality-the desperate extent of all human need and desire. "I have only words to play with," says Humbert, and only words can bridge the gulf suggested by Lolita's palm. Humbert has failed once-"She would mail her vulnerability in trite brashness and boredom, whereas I use[d] for my desperately detached com- ments an artificial tone of voice that set my own teeth on edge" (p. 286)--but it is a necessary act of love to try, and perhaps Nabo- kov succeeds with the reader where Humbert failed with Lolita. Nabokov's account of the book's origin is fitting. "The first little throb of Lolita," he writes, went through me late in 1939 or early in 1940, in Paris, at a time when I was laid up with a severe attack of intercostal neuralgia. As far as I can recall, the initial shiver of inspiration was somehow prompted by a news- paper story about an ape in the Jardin des Plantes who, after months of coaxing by a scientist, produced the first drawing ever charcoaled by an animal: this sketch showed the bars of the poor creature's cage. (p. 313) Humbert, the "aging ape" writing from prison, whose impossible love metaphorically connects him with that imprisoned animal, learns the language, in his fashion, and records his "imprisonment," and his book is the "picture" of the bars of the poor creature's cage.26 Yet 26 See Stegner, op. cit., p. 103, who also reminds us that the Jardin des Plantes eventually housed the captured orangutan in Poe's "The Murders in the Rue Morgue." 240 j CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="38">from behind these bars, Humbert also exults. In Gogol, Nabokov notes how "one likes to recall that the difference between the comic side of things, and their cosmic side, depends upon one sibilant," a juxtaposition implicit in the early title, Laughter in the Dark. The title goes two ways: it records the laughter of the cosmic joker who has made a pawn of Albinus, blinding and tormenting him, but it also summarizes Nabokov's response to life, his course for survival. Towards the end of Lolita, the sick and despairing Humbert has finally tracked down Lolita, who is now the pregnant Mrs. Richard Schiller. He recalls how he rang the door bell, ready to kill Dick. The bell seems to vibrate through his whole exhausted system, but sud- denly Humbert takes his automatic French response to the sound and playfully twists it into verbal nonsense: "Personne. Je resonne. Repersonne. From what depth this re-nonsense?" he wonders (p. 271). It sounds from the depths of Vladimir Nabokov's profoundly humane comic vision; and the gusto of Humbert's narration, his punning language, his abundant delight in digressions, parodies, and games all attest to a comic vision that overrides the circumscribing sadness, absurdity, and terror of everyday life.
