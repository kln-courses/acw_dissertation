SPANOS* The Un-Naming of the Beasts: The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La JVausee " And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air; brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every liv ing creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam gave names to all cattle and to fowl of the air and every beast of the fields Genesis 2: 19-20 Jean-Paul Sartre's novel La Nausee (1938) is one of the most problematic works of contemporary literature. This is not only because of the uncertainties of its meaning, but also—and more important—because of the uncertainties of its place in the chronology of " modernism." The discussion of these matters is so tangled that it is impossible to categorize it without grossly oversimplifying the issues at stake. It can be said, however—and this may be one of the fundamental sources of the uncertainty—that for a long time after the publication of La Nausee, the focus of critical interest fell rather heavily on its " existential" meaning. That is, early " cri ticism," assuming that the novel was radically autobiographical (i. e. that Sartre and Roquentin are virtually identical), disregarded the formal dimension, more specifically the temporal process of the text—to " explain" its philosophical significance and import. And since the primary thematic emphasis is on Roquentin's agonizing discovery of the viscous realm of existence, it was invariably con cluded that Sartre's existentialism at the time of writing La Nausee was limited to a phenomenological description of the contingent realm of existence which is prior to essence, or, more fully, of the alienated, virtually solipsistic, consciousness of the terrible viscosity of the absurd world. This "philosophical" view, which dismisses or neglects as irrelevant Sartre's artistic in favor of his thematic concerns is given its most authoritative and influential expression by Iris Murdoch: 'William V. Spanos, Professor of English at SUNY—Binghamton, is the editor of boundary 2 and the author of a number of articles on modern literature. He is completing a book on hermeneutics. 223 Copyright © 1978 by Wayne State University Press</page><page sequence="2">224 William V. Spanos The interest of La Nausee does not lie in its conclusion, which is merely sketched in; Sartre has not developed it sufficiently for it even to pose as a solution to the problem. Its interest lies in the powerful image which dominates it, and in the descriptions which constitute the argument. These evocations of the viscous, the fluid, the paste-like, sometimes achieve a kind of horrid poetry, calling up in the reader—as do so many passages in the work of Sartre—une espece d'ecoeurement doucedtre, the sweetish sort of disgust which is one form of la nausee itself. Yet the effect is not always unpleasant. Sartre is much concerned with the real nature of perception. He dwells on the interpenetration of sensible quali ties and on the unlikeness of what we " really see " to our dried-up concept of the visible world. We are invited to re-discover our vision. The things which surround us, usually quiet, domesticated and invisible, are seen suddenly as strange, seen as if for the first time.1 In thus failing to develop the hermeneutic lead insisted on by the contrast between the inclusive " Symboliste " novel Roquentin intends to write in the " end "—the novel which will allow him to transcend "the sin of existence "—and the in-conclusive journal he in fact leaves behind, Ms. Murdoch, like most early commentators, concealed for a generation of readers, the fact that La Nausee, despite Sartre's vestigial metaphysical rhetoric, is ultimately a text about the art of fiction that calls previous modes of composition into question in behalf of a new, a post-Modern, novel. More recently, however, a number of critics, probably under the pressure of a growing awareness of the influence of Sartre's novel on " postmodern " writers such as Beckett, Robbe-Grillet, Sarraute, Barth, Heller, Barthelme, Pynchon etc., and—more generally—of the aggres sive insistence by contemporary writers and critics that the work of literary art is a reflection of the "world" they perceive or, as Sartre puts it, that "a fictional technique always relates back to the novelist's metaphysics,"2 have begun to comment on La Nausee as novel and to suggest its place in the tangled landscape of modern literature. Unfortunately, these critics have approached Sartre's art from a broadly Modernist hermeneutic perspective. They assume, 1 Iris Murdoch, Sartre: Romantic Rationalist (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1959), pp. 9-10. See also pp. 12 and 13. !

Conditioned by the traditional expectation of formal unity, these critics pick up Roquentin's " aesthetic solution," which Ms. Murdoch with some justification, but in the end mistakenly, dismisses as " simply a sketch of a solution" that Sartre " is patently uninterested in," 3 and develop its implications to conclude with unwarranted finality that La Nausee is a novel whose form is determined by a metaphysics which is prior to Sartre's " radical conversion" and his analogous theory of litterature engagee. They conclude, more specifically, that the novel belongs to the early Modernist tradition.4 Thus, for example, Michael Edwards rejects the claim that La Nausee "is offered only as the record of a progressive destruction of meaning,"5 and after a provocative but all too brief demonstration of its "Sym bolist techniques " concludes that La Nausee offers not only a discussion of what should be recog nized as a Symbolist aesthetic, but also its embodiment. It seeks to justify, as so many works in the Romantic-Symbolist tradition, the imagination, without naming it. It is a fable reflecting upon 3 Murdoch, Sartre, pp. 12-13. 4 For most of these critics engagement means political activism. Thus they find their primary justification for assigning La Nausee to early Modernist literature in the fact that there is no overt political activism in the novel. They fail to perceive that the call to politics is a secondary extension of a more radical engagement, that which Sartre, borrowing from Heidegger's monistic understanding of Dasein as Being-in-the-world (in-der-Welt-Sein), refers to as homme-dans-le-monde. See, for example, A. James Arnold, "La Nausee Re visited," French Review, 39 (1965), pp. 199-213. Arnold uses recent autobio graphical and biographical sources—" Les Mots, La Force de Page, and those of Sartre's other works which are roughly contemporary with La Nausee [V Imagination (1936) and Ulmaginaire (1940)]—that refer to Sartre's apolitical and/or aesthetic leanings at the time of writing La Nausee to conclude that the novel is a product of an earlier pre-engagee Sartre, who posits the saving " rigor ous necessity of art" (p. 203). "Some critics have treater La Nausee as though it were the work of a later Sartre, the author of Qu'est-ce la litterature} The publication of Simone de Beauvoir's La Force de Page in 1960 [and Les Mots in 1964] preclude the possibility of any further speculation of that nature " (p. 199).

From that perspective, its context is not that in which it is habitually placed. It is closer to Yeats's Byzantium that [sic] to Camus' UEtranger.6 Similarly, though more aware of an ambiguity in Roquentin's final conceptual triumph over existence, Edith Kern says that Sartre's novel emerges from German Romanticism, especially from the tradition of the Kiinstlerroman, the tradition, that is, of the hero as author/poet. In this tradition, which according to Ms. Kern has its fullest philo sophical expression in Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy and its ultimate artistic achievement in Modernist writers such as Gide, Woolf, Joyce, and especially Marcel Proust, Form—the will to power over existence that manifests itself as the reification or, as I prefer to put it, the spatialization of process—becomes a "redemption" of life in its ability to " lift us," as Nietzsche says, " above the whirl of shifting phenomena." 7 As Ms. Kern observes: If we turn our attention ... to Sartre, his indebtedness to his two French predecessors, Gide and Proust, becomes only too obvious. Indeed, when writing Nausea, he may well have been acquainted with some of the great Kiinstlerromane written in other languages, such as Rilke's Make Laurids Brigge, some of Thomas Mann's or Herman Hesse's novels, James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist, or even Virginia Woolf's work—all showing a revival of Romantic notions of the artist infused with Nietzschean concepts. There can be no doubt that the Sartrean author-hero Roquentin [the ul timate equation of Sartre and Roquentin is of crucial importance], shown in the process of becoming an artist, is the poet looking at himself in the act of creation and becoming cognizant of the essence of art.8 "Edwards, "La Nausee" p. 21. Edwards' contrasting of La Nausee with Camus' L'Etranger rather than, say, with Samuel Beckett, Robbe-Grillet, Nathalie Sarraute, Iris Murdoch, or Thomas Pynchon, makes it clear that his historical context is not that centered on the modern/postmodern question.

Y.: Doubleday, Anchor Books, 1956), p. 102. 8 Edith Kern, Existential Thought and Fictional Technique: Kierkegaard, Sartre, Beckett (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1970), pp. 82-83. Miss Kern is quick to observe, however, that Roquentin is also different from Nietz sche's Dionysiac poet and Proust's Marcel: Roquentin's " turning away [' from the lawlessness and absurdity of existence towards the order and abstractness of geometry and music'] is ambiguous because unlike Rilke and Proust, Sartre [the identification of author and protagonist is worthy of note] does not wish</page><page sequence="5">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 227 This retrieval of the " art" of La Nausee from the purely philo sophical speculation which has had a strange hold on the novel constitutes a genuine, if all too belated, breakthrough in the study of Sartre as literary artist. But it is, I think, partial. For the momentum generated by the philosophical autobiographical readings of La Nausee—and enforced by the Modernist aesthetic expectations of formal unity—has been so great, it seems, that Sartre's philosophy continues to determine largely the aesthetic interpretation; that is, these critics still tend to assume all too easily that Roquentin and Sartre are ultimately identical, that the kind of novel Roquentin promises to write is—in one way or another—the kind which Sartre has written as La Nausee. This is clearly suggested by the fact that neither Ms. Kern nor Edwards, despite their acknowledgement of the analogy between metaphysics and fiction, concentrates on de scribing Roquentin's achieved aesthetics. Thus neither gets much beyond commenting about aspects of technique to look closely at the crucial "form," the time-process, of Sartre's fiction, of La Nausee itself. As a result, they have failed to perceive just below its traditional formal and linguistic surface the enormous impor tance—indeed, the " centrality"—of La Nausee in the emergence in our time of a Western literature that exists, in Heidegger's term, to "overcome" the autotelic bias of Modernist form. To appropriate Paul de Man's phrase, they have been blinded by their formalist insight to the post-Modern impulse behind Sartre's ultimate refusal of closure or, more specifically, behind his transformation of closure (the circular narrative of La Nausee and its rhetoric) into dis-closure or openness (what, as we shall see, Heidegger, after Kierkegaard, calls repetition or retrieval: wiederholen). As Heidegger and, after him, Jacques Derrida have made per suasively clear, every " revolutionary" writer, that is, every writer seeking to return " to the things themselves," to begin again without recourse to absolute origins, is inevitably the victim in some degree of the epistemological assumptions informing (concealed in) the to transfigure reality into poetic inwardness. While his author-hero, Roquentin, wants to rid the passing moments of their fat, he also wants to emerge as consciousness-in-the world" (p. 127). Since, as the passage suggests, Miss Kern ultimately sees Roquentin and Sartre as the same person, we must assume that the novel La Nausee is analogously different from Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu. Nevertheless, she minimizes, indeed, virtually dismisses, this difference in her interpretation of the novel in favor of the Dionysiac or Symbolist Sartre-Roquentin.</page><page sequence="6">228 William V. Spanos language he inherits from the past. This is an especially important consideration in the interpretation of contemporary literary texts in which the metaphysical or, in Derrida's term, " Iogocentric" language the "author" receives from the Western Tradition no longer applies to the decentered ontological situation if confronts— the situation, for example, that Sartre describes phenomenologically in the park scene of La Nausee—and thus tends to cover up or close off precisely what it would reveal.9 To dis-cover or dis-close what 8 The term " logocentric " is Derrida's. But it derives fundamentally from Heidegger's " de-struction" (Destruktion) of the Greek word logos as it has been increasingly defined by the Western philosophical tradition (that is, as " ' reason,' ' judgment,' ' concept,' ' definition,' ' ground,' or ' relationship,'" and more inclusively, as " the Word," " the One," the " Unmoved Mover," the " Final Cause," etc. Such a destruction of logos dis-covers that its primordial meaning, as its derivation from legem suggests, is " talk," " discourse " (Rede), that logos, in other words, is "grounded" in the unconcealing/con cealing rhythms of temporal being-in-the-world. According to Heidegger, the hardened Western interpretation of logos as ratio in Aristotle's sentence defining man as Xoyov 'exov, constitutes a reification or centering and thus an immobilizing of the temporality (Nothingness, the circle as absence) of being in-the-world in order to secure Dasein against the Angst of contingency (the dread or anxiety that has no-thing as its object). (Being and Time, tr. John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson, 7th ed. [New York: Harper and Row, 1962], section 7, p. 55; section 5, p. 47. Further references will be incor porated in the text in parentheses). As Derrida puts this impulse to presence/ absence in his influential essay " Structure, Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences," The Structuralist Controversy. The Languages of Criticism and the Languages of Sciences of Man, ed. Richard Macksey and Eugenio Donato (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press 1972): I he concept of centered structure is in fact the concept of a freeplay based on a fundamental ground, a freeplay which is con stituted upon a fundamental immobility and a reassuring certitude, which is itself beyond the reach of freeplay. With this certitude anxiety can be mastered, for anxiety is invariably the result of a certain mode of being implicated in the game, of being caught by the game, of being as it were from the very beginning at stake in the game. From the basis of what we therefore call the center (and which, because it can be either inside or outside, is as readily called the origin as the end, as readily arche as telos), the repetitions, the substitutions, the transfor mations, and the permutations are always taken from a history of meaning [sens]— that is, a history, period—whose origin may always be revealed or whose end may always be anticipated in the form of presence (p. 248). Derrida departs from his source in claiming that Heidegger's dis-covering of speech as origin in his destruction of logos constitutes a reappropriation of meta physics. Despite his explicit disavowal of any such intention (" La double seance,"</page><page sequence="7">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 229 Sartre was actually driving towards but finally left unsaid or, to put it in another way, to retrieve La Nausee for a post-Modern audience from the (Modernist) tradition in which its commentators, by way of acknowledging Sartre's vestigial humanism, have buried La dissemination [Paris: Editions du Seuil 1972], p. 207), Derrida (and even more so his followers) in practice posits writing (ecriture), not speech (parale), as the agency par excellence for ths expression of untethered " freeplay" occasioned by the acknowledgement of a " decentered " universe. In this, Derrida, I think, fails to adequately distinguish between Heidegger's under standing of speech as "grounded" in Dasein's temporality (Nothingness), i. e. as open-ended dialogue, and that Western tradition culminating in Husserl, which sees oral expression as the essential agency of centeredness or presence, as " oracular" discourse. In thus valorizing writing over speech Derrida justifies, if he does not in fact commit himself to, the view, mistaken I believe, taken by Paul de Man that all literary texts (ecriture) are by the very nature of their textuality " fictions" and thus immune to logocentric self-mystification. (See Paul de Man, " The Rhetoric of Blindness" and, especially, " Criticism and Crisis," Blindness and Insight: Essays in the Rhetoric of Contemporary Criticism [New York: Oxford University Press 1971], pp. 3-19). Further, Derrida's equation of writing with the Nietzschean version of repetition and freeplay tends to revalorize adjacencies over against process, wholes over against parts, and thus the spatial (aesthetic) poetry of the Modernist imagi nation, what Kierkegaard would call variously the poetry of "infinite nega tivity " or " unmastered irony." It is early Modernists like Mallarme and Valery that Derrida and his followers admire, poets who, despite Derrida's insistence that they call into question the essential grounds of Western metaphysics, are nevertheless always obsessed by the stabilizing possibilities of spatial models in their agonized encounter with the elusive temporality of words. Ironically, this emphasis on adjacencies (synchronicity) and early Modernists whose texts reflect them tends to obscure the post-Modern impulse of contemporary literary experimentation in dis-closive or destructive (open) forms to retrieve a radically temporal perceptual stance, i. e. to defer presence. I am thinking especially of poets like William Carlos Williams, Charles Olson, and Robert Creeley, whose " projective" or " open" verse is " grounded" in the speech act, not oracular utterance (the utterance of a see-er) but, in Robert Creeley's phrase, as " the measure of its occasion" (from occasus and, ultimately, cadere), meaning, as being-in-the-world does for Heidegger, the dispersed measure of a " fallen " world in what presence is infinitely deferred. In using the term " logocentric," therefore, I am following Heideg ger's understanding of logos rather than Derrida's and the Derridean decon structors', though I wish to acknowledge a substantial debt to the latter, especially to Derrida's essay, " Diffenmce," Speech and Phenomena and Other Essays on Husserl's Theory of Signs, tr.

Spanos the novel, it will be necessary to undertake a " de-struction" of the text.10 By this term I do not, of course, mean " annihilation." I mean, rather, a hermeneutic project grounded in an understanding of truth not as adequaetio intellectus et rei, but as a-letheia— bringing into the open from hiddenness or oblivion (BT, 7, 57)—and assuming the form of a de-struction—a dis-assembling by violence of a spatial figure—such as that which Heidegger undertakes vis-a-vis Kantian metaphysics and beyond that the systematic philosophy of what he has called the Western " onto-theo-logical tradition ": If the question of Being is to have its own history made trans parent, then this hardened tradition must be loosened up, and the concealments which it has brought about must be dissolved. We understand this task as one in which by taking the question of Being [Seinsfrage: better translated as "the question of what it means to be "] as our clue, we are to destroy the traditional con tent of ancient ontology [sich vollziehende Destruktion des iiber lieferten Bestandes de antiken Ontologie] until we arrive at those primordial experiences in which we achieved our first ways of determining the nature of Being—the ways which have guided us ever since. In thus disclosing the origins of our ontological concepts, we do not relativize ontology; nor does this destruction negate the ontological tradition. We must, on the contrary, stake out the positive possibilities of that tradition, and this always means keeping it within its limits-, these in turn are given factically in the way the question is formu lated at the time, and in the way the possible field for investiga tion is thus bounded off. On the negative side, this destruction does not relate itself towards the past; its criticism is aimed at " today" and at the prevalent way of treating the history of ontology. . . . But to bury the past in nullity [Nichtigkeit] is not the purpose of this destruction; its aim is positive, its negative function remains unexpressed and indirect (BT 6, 44). destruction is, of course, hardly adequate. On the other hand, a fuller treatment of the issue would have drawn the focus away from my essential subject, Sartre's La Nausee. Nevertheless this note points to a difference that many Derrideans (though not Derrida himself) do not seem to be aware of and should suggest the direction a more ample discussion might take. 10 The term Destruktion (destruction) which has been appropriated as " de construction" by Jacques Derrida and his followers, is Heidegger's. This crucial fact needs emphasis in the face of the authority that " deconstruction" is beginning to achieve.</page><page sequence="9">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 231 A destruction of La Nausee will not thus constitute a critique of the novel nor of its received interpretations. It will not attempt to bury it in nullity; it will make it authentically our own. " In pro posing our 'definition' of 'truth' [as a-letheia]," Heidegger says elsewhere, "we have not shaken off the tradition, but we have appropriated it primordially" (BT 44, 262). A destruction of Sartre's novel, in other words, will involve a wresting by hermeneutic "violence" of what it and both the philosophical and literary Modernist interpretations of it necessarily leave unsaid—of the " positive possibilities" concerning the being of the text covered up by the hardened Western literary tradition and its received rhetorics in which Sartre and, much more so, his interpreters continue to exist. What these positive possibilities are is suggested by analogy in the concluding paragraph of Heidegger's definition of the destruction: In line with the positive tendencies of this destruction, we must in the first instance raise the question whether and to what extent the Interpretation of Being and. the phenomenon of time have been brought together thematically in the course of the history of ontology, and whether the problematic of Temporality required for this has ever been worked out in prmcipal or even could have been. (BT 5, 45. My emphasis.) More specifically, then, a destruction of La Nausee will require a dis-covering or dis-closing of the be-ing of the novel covered over or closed off from view and thus forgotten by the spatial-izing hermeneutics—the hermeneutics which, like its philosophical counter part, perceives meta-ta-physika: from after or above or beyond things-as-they-are—of the Western literary tradition that culminates in the Modernist (New Critical and Structuralist) poetics of ironic in-clusiveness. In this de-structive re-examination of Sartre's La Nausee, there fore, I want to make the claim that the novel is not, as, say, Edwards and Kern insist, "influenced" by or " indebted" to the anti positivist Symbolist novel. Whatever its original intention, or, more accurately, whatever Sartre's recollection of his original intention, La Nausee, unlike the novel Roquentin visualizes, can now be under stood as a demystification of both formal poles of the binary Western literary tradition. To put it more immediately, it can be understood as constituting a de-struction of the logocentric structure not only of the "well-made piece" which embodies the positivistic/totalitarian metaphysics of the European middle class, but also, if less obviously,</page><page sequence="10">232 William V. Spanos the " spatial form " of the Symboliste tradition (including the Ro mantic/Modernist Kiinstlerroman) which images forth the idealistic or "angelistic" metaphysics of the early Modernists, in order to release or dis-close the " being" in-closed in these forms. I want to show, by way of wresting by hermeneutic violence the essential being of the novel from the hold that the language of the Western literary tradition still has on Sartre's imagination, that La Nausee ultimately aligns itself against the well-made fiction not with the mainstream of Modernism—with the consoling or "angelic" formal perfections, the " infinite negativities," as Kierkegaard would put it, of Proust, of Mallarme, of the early Yeats, of Joyce, of Virginia Woolf—but rather with the dislocating and liberating formal " im perfections" of Kierkegaard's Repetition, of Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan llych, of Kafka's The Trial, of Robert Musil's Man Without Qualities, and, above all, of Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground. I want to show, in other words, that La Nausee does not ultimately look back, from the vantage point of the late 1930's, to an already triumphant—and rigidifying—early species of "Modernism," but for ward, by way of repetition, to that thrust of post-Modern " anti art" which, under the influence, above all, of the existential pheno menology of Husserl, of Merleau-Ponty, and especially of Heidegger, attempts to destroy received forms to return zu den Sachen selbst, "to the things themselves,"11 to dis-cover (on the ontological, if not overtly on the political level) the authentic temporal experience, the historicity (not history), of modern man that the metaphysics of both the Symboliste art object and the piece bien faite has covered over and forgotten. To accomplish this, I will not attempt to confront the tangled commentary head on, a project which, besides being impossibly complicated, would generate a digression from my primary purpose: to show that Sartre's La Nausee exists on the margin, the boundary, between Modernism and Postmodernism and thus to make explicit its importance for our understanding of the crisis of literature and criticism and how it is being confronted. Rather, I will proceed directly to the text—enter the hermeneutic circle "wholly and pri mordially to undertake a destructive interpretation of the relation ship between Roquentin's temporal experience, which traces a "cir 11 The term is Edmund Husserl's and stands as the essential project of the unmethodical phenomenological " method."

What he in fact writes or, rather, leaves behind, after his experience has come full circle, is an intensely introspective and inconclusive journal that, in recording his futile attempt to arrive at conclusions about what at first seemed to be an attractive life of action, also records paradigmatically modern man's futile attempt to arrive at con-clusions about his being-in-the-world. It is an experience at the seashore (which could not " ordinarily be called an event"13) that activates this process of disintegration. In a playful mood, Roquentin picks up a pebble to throw into the sea, but suddenly drops it because he feels " a sort of sweetish sickness," " a sort of nausea," pass "from the stone to his hand" (p. 20). After this, he tries to avert such terrifying occasions by concentrating on the safe external linear geometry of his biography and by seeking out the refuge of cafes which " were full of people and well lighted " (p. 29)—the influence of Ernest Hemingway's great story about the corrosive darkness of Nada is pervasive in La Nausee.14 But the invading element has broken through his defenses and the magical 12 Fedor Dostoevsky, Notes from Underground and The Legend of The Grand Inquisitor, tr.

Spanos efforts to exorcise its existence or, better, to stay its motion, in the interim between visitations by writing "Rien de nouveau" (Nothing new) in his journal (pp. 13, 18) is futile. Indeed, as another reading of the phrase suggests, it is a measure of its menacing and immanent presence. " I must not be afraid " (p. 97), he writes on the Wednes day following his Sunday among the middle class strollers after the encounter between Dr. Roge and M. Achille. And, as if this entry unleashes the dreaded thing, the " invasion" assumes larger pro portions. At first he associates the menace with the miasmic fog enveloping the city, which " filtered in under the door" of the Cafe Mably and threatened " to rise slowly and penetrate everything" (p. 101). But later during the day—after he has sought the refuge of the library, the modern storehouse—or arsenal—of words or, better, of names—he perceives it as an ontological fog that permeates the city: Fog has filled the room [envahi la piece]; not the real fog, that had gone a long time ago—but the other, the one the streets were still full of, which came out of the walls and pavements: the in consistency of inanimate objects!

Roquentin's reluctant encounter with the " unheard of thing, as Tolstoy, one of Sartre's precursors, puts the threat of ontological invasion in The Death of Ivan llych,15 occurs, significantly, in the public park of this methodical city (paradoxically named Bouville: city of mud) shortly after his discovery of the self-deceptive fraudulence of the Self-Taught Man's anthropomorphic humanism.10 By way of what might be called the phenomenological reduction by violence, Roquentin perceives in a blinding revelation—I'm tempted to say " epiphany " to suggest his destruction (however incomplete, as we shall see) of the logocentric language of the ontotheological tra 18 This crucial allusion to Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan llych which recurs several times in the early entries of Roquentin's journals (see pp. 11 and 13 and especially 18, 29, and 97) should not be missed. Just as Ivan's old habits of mind, his impulse to " arrange" novelty into familiarity, cannot domesticate this "unheard-of thing." The Death of Ivan llych and Other Stories, tr. Aylmer Maude, with an " Afterword' by David Magershack (New York: The New American Library, I960), (p. 126), which has intruded into his " pleasant and decorous" life, so Roquentin's earlier objective mental habits cannot habituate this novel phenomenon (the nausea), which has invaded his existence. The new in both cases becomes ontological (i. e., Nothingness) and, like the Furies to which Tolstoy alludes, must be encountered face to face. 18 In taking the form of reading the books in the library in alphabetical order, the Self-Taught man's reductive humanistic educational project reminds us of Mr. Ramsey's futile rationalist quest for total knowledge in To the Lighthouse, which he externalizes in terms of the metaphor of the alphabet. Behind Woolf, of course, is Bergson's critical analysis of the positivistic intelli gence, which, in order to " forecast and measure," " spatializes" duration (duree reelle): "when we turn to our conscious states, [our practical selves] we have everything to gain by keeping up the illusion through which we make them share in the reciprocal externality of outer things, because this distinctness, and at the same time this solidification, enables us to give them fixed names in spite of their instability, and distinct ones in spite of their interpenetration. It enables us to objectify them, to throw them out into the current of social life." Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness, tr. F. L. Pogson (New York: Macmillan, 1910), p. 231. The aesthetic (fictional) analogue of the Self-Taught man's spatialization of knowledge is embodied, as we shall see, in Roquentin's distinction between living and recounting life.

In the Old Testament myth, Adam's archetypal act of naming is a teleo logical or logocentric establishment of a prior hierarchical ontological order that transforms a proliferating and unstable abundance into an ordered and permanent plenitude, a paradisal garden, thus sub duing the threat (and possibilities) of nothingness. By thus naming the beasts, the Old Adam brings to a decisive conclusion the creation of the Garden of Eden and establishes the authorizing paradigm of the language/existent relationship in the ontological tradition. Put in post-lapsarian terms, to include time as well as space, to name is to impose an ideal causal or formal order on the contingencies of temporal existence from the end (meta-ta-physika). To name, in other words, is to com-pose, to dramatize, in the sense of spatializing— and aesthetically distancing—time. In the language of the onto theological tradition, to name is to re-collect (in tranquillity) the dispersed (fallen) and undifferentiated One which is process so that all time—its differences or, to appropriate Derrida, its difference (that temporal defer-al of presence which generates the desire or 1T Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, Sect. 16, pp. 102-107. According to Heidegger's phenomenological hermeneutics, it is when the instrument (whether hammer or epistemological method) breaks down or, more broadly, when " a break occurs in the total referential surface " (Bruch der Verweisungs ausanrmenhange, p. 105), that the primordial being closed off to understanding by the " everyday" perspective of das Man—what John Vernon aptly calls the map consciousness—is made explicit, is dis-closed.</page><page sequence="15">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 237 interest [Kierkegaard] or care [Hiedegger] that "makes a difference ") can be seen simultaneously, as presence (or identity), as it was seen in the " beginning ", i. e. from an aesthetic distance.18 In La Nausee, on the other hand, Roquentin reluctantly becomes precisely the anti-Adam. The Logos as ratio, the privileged instrument of ra tional language, has broken down. In a tram before his arrival in the park, he had thought of the disintegrating object that his word " seat" " refused to go and put itself on": " Les choses se sont delivrees de leurs noms... je suis au milieu de Choses, les innom mables." (Things are divorced from their names... I am in the midst of things, nameless things.") Sitting now on a bench in the bourgeois Eden, the New Adam looks on in fascinated horror, divested (like Lear) of the verbal power to reverse the process, as nature completes her grotesque unnaming. As a cultivated fragment of wild nature, the Jardin public (Sartre capitalizes the French word) is, along with the city (to which I will return), a radical archetype of the power of the Word (logos), divine or human, to establish distancing points of reference in chaos (a map) or, to shift the meta phor slightly, to civil-ize (at-home) and domesticate the " bestial" energies in the world.19 For the New Adam, his language as tool broken, the garden now returns to its "primordial" state—centerless, without origins—of " viscosity", to that dispersed and different Ur-realm that Heidegger calls die Unheimliche (the uncanny or, etymologically, the not-at-home) and that Sartre, borrowing from Heidegger, was to formulate later on as the existence which is ontologically prior to essence: So I was in the park just now. The roots of the chestnut tree were sunk in the ground just under my bench. I couldn't remem ber it was a root anymore. The words had vanished and with them the significance of things, their methods of use, and the feeble points of reference which men have traced on their surface. [Les mots s'etaient evanouis et, avec eux, la signification des 18 Jacques Derrida, " Difference," Speech and Phenomena and Other Essays on HusserVs Theory of Signs, pp. 129-160. 19 Roquentin refers several times to objects in their unnamed state as bestial: " I am afraid of being in contact with them [objects that no longer keep their place] as though they were living beasts" (p. 19); "I am these two beasts struggling at the end of my arms" (p. 139); "I was sitting, stooping forward, head bowed, alone in front of this black, knotty mass, entirely beastly, which frightened me" (p. 171); "I sank down on the bench, stupified stunned by this profusion of being without origin..(pp. 178-179).</page><page sequence="16">238 William V.

Then I had this vision. [Et puis, j'ai eu cette illumination.] It left me breathless. Never, until these last few days, had I understood the meaning of " existenceI was like the others [the Bouvillois], like the ones walking along the seashore, all dressed in their spring finery [leur habits de printemps]. I said, like them, " The Ocean is green; that white speck up there is a seagull," but I didn't feel that it existed or that the seagull was an " existing seagull" ; usually existence hides itself.... Even when I looked at things, I was miles from dreaming that they existed: they looked like scenery to me And then all of a sudden, there it was, clear as day: existence had suddenly unveiled itself ["exis tence s'etait soudain devoilee]: it had lost the harmless look of an abstract category . . . the roots, the park gates, the bench, the sparse grass, all that had vanished: the diversity of things, their individuality, were only an appearance, a veneer. This veneer had melted, leaving soft, monstrous masses, all in disorder—naked, in a frightful, obscene nakedness. . . . But faced with this great wrinkled paw [he is referring to the root of the chestnut tree], neither ignorance nor knowledge was important: the world of explanations and reasons is not the world of existence. A circle is not absurd, it is clearly explained by the rotation of a straight segment around one of its extremities. But neither does a circle exist. This root, on the other hand, existed in such a way that I could not explain it. Knotty, inert, nameless, it fascinated me, filled my eyes, brought me back unceasingly to its own existence. In vain to repeat: " This is a root "—it didn't work any more [ca ne prenait plus] This root, with its col our, shape, its congealed movement, was... below all explanation. Each of its qualities escaped it a little, flowed out of it, half solidi fied, almost became a thing.... (pp. 170-174, my emphasis) With the collapse of his anthropomorphic or " humanistic " frame of reference, his Adamic power to name—and distance—the world, Roquentin's world as map—"the feeble points of reference which men have traced on their [things'] surface "—disintegrates and dis perses. He now discovers that this primordial existence is what he calls at one point " absurdity " (p. 173) and at another, " contingency " (p. 176). In this Ur-realm dis-closed by the rupture of the referential surface all causal relationships between objects and between events</page><page sequence="17">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 239 which make existence One, break down into multiplicity. Roquentin can no longer "count" (compter) the chestnut trees in the park nor " locate " (situer) them in relation to other objects. Each escapes his agonized effort to " enclose " it: " Chacun d'eux s'echappait des relations ou je cherchais a l'enfermer, s'isolait debordait." Prior to his experience he had felt himself " to be the arbitrator " or, to use a metaphor to which I will return, the privileged author, of these unifying relations ("which I insisted on maintaining in order to delay the crumbling of the human world, measure, quantity and direction"). With the loss of the power to name, "they no longer had their teeth into things. In the way [De trop], the chestnut tree there .. .In the way, the Velleda And I... I too, was in In the way. [Et moi ...moi aussi fetais de trop.] " (p. 173). Nothing has necessity or "causal being." Everything becomes superfluous. And thus everything becomes nothing, infinitely deferred or open-ended and infinitely free: The essential thing is contingency. I mean that one cannot define existence as necessity. To exist is simply to be there [Je veux dire que, par definition l'existence n'est pas la necessite. Exister, c'est etre la.] .. . contingency is not a delusion, a probability which can be dissipated; it is the absolute, consequently, the perfect free gift, [c'est l'absolu, par consequent la gratuite parfaite.] All is free, this park this city and myself. When you realize that, it turns your heart upside down and everything begins to float. . . . (p. 176) It is of crucial importance to observe that Roquentin's ontological crisis is paralleled—indeed is precipitated and defined—by his gradual discovery of the ultimate significance of the archetypal bourgeois city, modern man's at-home, as it were. What characterizes its weighty middle class citizens, both individually and collectively (as the City) is precisely their sense of privilege: the self-satisfied and comfortable certainty of divine (and dramatic) justification. Again and again, with an increasing sense of their self-deception, Roquentin discovers the unjustifiable assumption of, or rather faith in, Necessity behind the rhetoric of well-made drama that expresses their values and life-style, from the clothing they wear, the language they speak, and the gestures they make to the view of their role as citizens of the City, indeed, of the Cosmos. This calloused privileged belief in Necessity, in "their rights" (p. 170), for example, is there in the " authority and immense erudition " of " the papers crushed in the</page><page sequence="18">240 William V. Spanos hand" of the statue of the frock-coated school inspector, Gustave Impetraz standing in front of the municipal library (pp. 42, 106); it is in the " hat-raising" ritual of the Sunday morning " crowd" strolling along the "blessed" Rue Tournebridge; it is in Doctor Roge's faith in "experience," and the "direct look [regard direct] which puts everything in place" (p. 92)—i. e., the gaze—that this experience justifies; and it is in the long row of portraits in the municiple museum (which Roquentin visits after the " invasion " has subsided), the portraits of the solidly rational—and totalitarian— mer chants who made Bouville the solid, prosperous, and stable City it is: The men had built Sainte-Cecile-de-la-Mer. In 1882, they founded the Federation of Shipowners and Merchants of Bouville " to group in one powerful entity all men of good will, to co operate in national recovery and to hold in check the parties of disorder. ..." They made Bouville the best equipped port in France for unloading coal and wood. . . . Stopping at no sacrifice to assist the improvement of the best elements in the working class, they created, on their own initiative, various centers for technical and professional study which prospered under their lofty protection. They broke the famous shipping strike in 1898 and gave their sons to their country in 1914. (p. 114) This Necessity is, above all, in the piercing eyes of the portraits, which judge Roquentin's "useless" waywardness, his disorderly life, his eccentric existence, as it were, from the high vantage point of their " right to exist" : But [Pacome] did not let go of me [Roquentin writes with sav age irony]. I read a calm and implacable judgment in his eyes. His judgment went through me like a sword and questioned my very right to exist. And it was true, I had always realized it; I hadn't the right to exist. I had appeared by chance. . . . But for this handsome, faultness man, now dead, for Jean Pacome, son of the Pacome of the Defence Nationale, it had been an entirely different matter: the beating of his heart and the mute rumblings of his organs, in his case, assumed the form of rights to be instantly obeyed. For sixty years, without a halt, he had used his right to live. The slightest doubt had never crossed those mag nificent grey eyes. Pacome had never made a mistake, (pp. 115 116)</page><page sequence="19">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 241 It is precisely Roquentin's culminating discovery of the fraudulence of the Bouvillois' assumption of necessity—the identity of things— that, by contrast, precipitates in the park his understanding of the absurdity—the difference—of existence. And this discovery crystallizes his contempt for their privileged positivistic orientation, the logocen tric perspective which, like that of the scientist or detective, assumes in advance that all objects, including human beings, have a predictable place and role to play in the dramatic scheme of things and thus justifies " naming " : the establishment of public patterns of relation ship by coercive inference from fragmentary and discontinuous evi dence (clues), "...here is Nausea," Roquentin writes in his diary as he tries futilely to articulate the meaning of his experience in the park, " here there is what those bastards—the ones on the Coteau Vert and others—try to hide from themselves with their idea of their rights. But what a poor lie; no one had any rights; they are entirely free, like other men, they cannot succeed in not feeling super fluous [de trop]. And in themselves, secretly, they are superfluous: that is to say, amorphous, vague, and sad" (p. 177). To return to Heidegger's metaphor again, the Sunday strollers on the Coteau Vert, Dr. Roge, Impetraz, Pacome, and all the other "leaders" (chefs)20 who overlook the Salon Bordurin-Renaudas are (in Sartre's existential reading of Being and Time) examples of the inauthentic, i. e. the unredeemably "fallen" das Ma?i (the self-less One or They) whose totalitarian domestication of the world in fact constitutes a flight from the dread of nothingness. Falling as fleeing, writes Heidegger in anticipation of Sartre, " does not flee in the face of entities within the-world; these are precisely what it flees towards—as entities along side which our concern, lost in the ' they,' can dwell in tranquillized familiarity. When in falling we flee into the ' at-home' of publicness, we flee in the face of the ' not-at-home'; that is, we flee in the face of the uncanniness [die Unloehnlichkeit] which lies in Dasein—in Dasein as thrown Being-in-the-World."21 20In French, the word chef, as in Sartre's short story "VEnfance tTun chef" has the connotations of the fascist boss. 21 Being and Time, Sect. 40, p. 234. Heidegger's analysis of fallenness (Verfallensein) is not, as it is for Sartre, intended primarily to define and judge a moral state. Fallenness, for Heidegger, is a characteristic of all Dasein, one that constitutes an essential access to ontological disclosure. As such, the purpose of Heidegger's account is to articulate a phenomenological hermeneutics of understanding and beyond that, of being. Nevertheless, Heidegger's analysis does discover deeper meanings in contexts, such as that which Sartre is depicting, in which the state of fallenness has become habitual.</page><page sequence="20">242 William V. Spanos Thus near the " end " of the novel, after Roquentin has discovered existence as the absence of presence and become free of necessity the ambiguous moral significance of which he expresses when he writes, "there is absolutely no reason for living" (p. 219), Sartre extends the open horizon of naming from the Garden metaphor to include its post-lapsarian analogy, the City. Standing at the summit of a hill overlooking Bouville—a context evoking the " Prospect Poem," i. e. the enlightenment's version of the medieval dream vision, in which the dreamer views existence from God's eye22—the anti-Adam once again experiences the " vision" of unnaming, the always threatening existence encroaching on the precincts of an anthropocentric order or, as Roquentin puts it, on " all its geometries " (p. 14) ,23 In imagery that evokes ironic echoes not only of the cities of Bacon and More, but also of Plethon, of Dante, of Augustine, of Virgil, and of the polis of the Greeks, indeed, of the Western— the ontotheological—tradition at large, he sees Bouville suddenly threatened by the invasion of existence. It is here that the name Bouville achieves its supreme irony. Unlike the protagonist of the prospect poem, who sees from his lofty distance the permanent order (stasis) informing the apparent disorder of immediacy, of the things themselves (process), Roquentin, in Sartre's destruction of this para digmatic literary form of the ontotheological tradition, discovers the Nothingness that the " City " objectifies, i. e. covers over and forgets. The solid citizens " think it is their city, a good, solid, bourgeois city " [ils pensent que c'est lear ville, une "belle cite bourgeoise "]. They have no fears; "they feel at home [my emphasis] in it [ils se sentent chez eux], because "they have proof, a hundred times a day, that everything happens mechanically, that the world obeys fixed un changeable laws," that—and here the metaphor of circularity should not be overlooked—" cities have only one day at their disposal and every morning it comes back exactly the same" (pp. 211-212). But all this time, great, vague nature has slipped into their city, it has infiltrated everywhere, in their house, in their office, in them selves. It doesn't move, it stays quietly... and they don't see it, they imagine it to be outside, twenty miles from the city. I see it, 32 See Aldo Bernardo, "Dante's Divine Comedy: The View from God's Eye," A Dante Symposium, ed. W. DeSica and G. Rizzo (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1965). 23 Later, Roquentin writes, " I'll lean against a wall and when they go by I'll shout. ' What's the matter with your science. What have you done with your humanism?...'" (p. 213).</page><page sequence="21">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 243 I see this nature . . .1 know that its obedience is idleness, I know it has no laws: what they take for constancy is only habit and it can change tomorrow. What if something were to happen? What if something sud denly started throbbing? Then they would notice it was there and they'd think their hearts were going to burst. Then what good would their dykes, bulwarks, power houses, furnaces and pile drivers be to them? It can happen anytime, perhaps right now.... (p. 212) In this culminating passage which brings the " symbol" of the Western City into the orbit of the Garden "symbol," Sartre, it is important to note, focuses on a crucial difference in the parallelism; whereas the vision in the park demystifies Roquentin's logocentric language, the vision from the summit of the hill demystifies the Bouvillois' logocentric city. Sartre's focus, that is, points to a relationship, however tenuous, between Roquentin and the Bouvillois. In this culminating passage, it is also worth observing, Sartre overtly establishes the defining thematic/formal motif of decentered contemporary fiction, indeed, of postmodern literature: what I have referred to as the ontological invasion of structure. It has fictional antecedents, of course, in Dickens (Bleak House), Dostoevsky (Crime and Funishment), Rilke (The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge); Kafka (The Trial)-, Conrad (The Heart of Darkness)-, Hemingway (The Sun Also Rises); Lawrence (The Rainbow), Celine (Voyage au bout de la nuit). It also has its philosophical antecedents in Heidegger's phenomenological account of dread (Angst) and the Uncanny (Unheimlichkeit) in Being and Time and, especially, in " What is Metaphysics? " when he writes: In dread, as we say, "one feels something uncanny [unheim lich]." What is this "something" [ej] and thus "one"? We are unable to say what gives " one " that uncanny feeling. " One " just feels it generally [im Ganzen]. All things, and we with them, sink into a sort of indifference. But not in the sense that everything simply disappears; rather, in the very act of drawing away from us everything turns towards us. This withdrawal of what-is-in totality, which crowds round us in dread, this is what oppresses us. There is nothing [as there is in fear] to hold on to. The only thing that remains and overwhelms us whilst what-is slips away, is this " nothing." 24 24 Martin Heidegger, "What is Metaphysics?," tr. R. F. C. Hull and Alan</page><page sequence="22">244 William V. Spanos But it is Sartre in La Nausee, as I intend to suggest, who makes explicit the formal imperatives of the theme of ontological invasion and thus activates its de-creative or de-structive potential for Beckett, Ionesco, Pinter, Sarraute, Pynchon, Barth, and many other postmodern writers. IV The synchronous unfolding of Roquentin's ontological crisis and his cumulative discovery of the bad faith—the self-deceptive coercion of the logocentric " direct look that puts everything in place "—on which the modern bourgeois/capitalistic City builds itself is of critical importance in interpreting La Nausee. Guided by Simon de Beauvoir's assertion in her autobiography that Sartre was not interested in political matters at the time he was writing the novel25 and/or by the expectation of formal unity in received notions of literary competence, most commentators have either failed to perceive the parallel or to respond to the power of the temporal fictional process. Whatever the reason, the failure has led to an overemphasis of the ontological theme—which amounts to an implicit assumption that the ontology and the " politics" are virtually different categories. Thus, for example, Iris Murdoch concludes in a passage that char acteristically blurs even the syntactical distinction between Sartre and Roquentin: How does Sartre intend us to understand his myth? He is patently uninterested in the aesthetic solution. Nor, although Roquentin indulges in a certain amount of political analysis, does he seriously consider a political solution. He [sic] observes with disgust the ossified rigidity of bourgeois convention—but the pure radiant life with which the little melody is endowed never appears to him capable of assuming the form of a political end. The anti-ration alist, anti-essentialist teachings of the book, though they some times provide negative arguments against capitalism, or, more generally, institutionalism and bureaucracy, never take on a more positive ideological character (p. 13). It is true, of course, that the emphasis of the fictional process of Sartre's novel is on Roquentin's ontological crisis. If, however, the Crick, Existence and Being, with Introduction and Analysis by Werner Brock (Chicago: Henry Regnery, 1949), p. 336. 25 Simone de Beauvoir, The Prime of Life, tr. Peter Green (New York: Lancer Books, 1966), p. 131.</page><page sequence="23">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 245 parallel between his "visions" in the garden and on the hill over looking the " solid, bourgeois city" is acknowledged, we realize that the personal ontological theme is not, as Murdoch and others imply, antithetical and separate from the " political" theme, but rather, that they are different manifestations of the same thing, that, in Heidegger's term, the latter is the " ontic" extension of the former. More specifically, we realize that Roquentin's discovery of the ultimate inauthenticity of " naming," i. e., of justifying existence from the end, is also a political discovery of the fraudulence of the ontotheological polis, the modern allotrope of which is the capitalistic City, which the privileged logocentric consciousness creates by self-righteously coercing existence into a stable, well-made—totali tarian—structure. Our awareness of Roquentin's discovery of the ontological/political continuum, in turn, establishes the grounds for understanding Sartre's ultimate attitude towards his protagonist's " aesthetic solution," which Murdoch quite rightly, if for the wrong reasons, feels uneasy about taking seriously. The political theme, in short, is not articulated explicitly; it is enacted by the formal process of La Nausee. What happens to Roquentin on the ontological level is reflected analogously in the changes wrought on his imagination and on his literary ambitions by his "revelatory" experience in the park-garden. He discovers, that is, that the form of a work of literature mirrors the author's understanding of being, thus adding the category of literary art to the categories of language (naming) and the human City as a third member of the emergent analogy of un-naming. Despite Sartre's unequivocal assertion that "a fictional technique always relates back to the novelist's metaphysics," this category constitutes the most overlooked and, ironically, the most important, dimension of La Nausee—at least from the hermeneutic vantage point of the postmodern context—if, that is, our concern is with La Nausee as a kind of fiction.26 20 To her credit, Edith Kern makes Sartre's assertion the point of departure of her interpretation of La Nausee. But she takes the phrase, " a fictional technique," too literally, thus failing to perceive that Sartre, on the analogy with metaphysics, is referring essentially to fictional process (form). Though her insights into aspects of Sartre's art are often illuminating, in thus focussing her discussion on Sartre's fictional techniques rather than the " form" of the novel, she over-looks his destruction of the triple analogy between logocentric (spatial) words/city/literary art, and thus precludes the possibility of perceiving explicitly the crucial distinction between Modernist and post-Modernist fic tional forms that Sartre is laboring to bring forth in La Nausee.</page><page sequence="24">246 William V. Spanos Having borne witness to the absurdity, the superfluity, the de centeredness, of existence, Roquentin finds himself confronting a present devoid of a significant past and future, a present, that is, characterized by the absence of presence. Unlike the scientist—or the investigator in the classical detective story—he no longer has any justification for perceiving meta-ta-physika (from after or beyond or above things-as-they-are), for seeing events (time) spatially, i. e. as moving towards some preestablished end (telos) that gives human beings in a particular present the necessary "right to exist" that is, a significant history. Returning to the metaphor of naming, we might say that Roquentin can no longer encounter the world as a liber naturae: a logocentric text to be read from the end. Thus to imitate life in historiography or fiction re-collectively within the framework of an " Aristotelian" beginning, middle, and end, as Roquentin has tried to do with the Marquis de Rollebon, is to be guilty of precisely the kind of bad faith that gives the Bouville merchants, les Salauds, the complacent and self-satisfied sense of playing purposeful roles in a pre-ordained, a " well-made," positivistic universe. It is no accident, for example, that his detective-like efforts to find causal connections between the bewildering contradictions of Rollebon's life terminate in his discovery of the anthropomorphic will to power over existence that lies behind " causality " : In the first place, starting from 1801, I understand nothing more about his conduct. It is not the lack of documents: letters, frag ments of memoirs, secret reports, police records. On the contrary I have almost too many of them. What is lacking in all this tes timony is firmness and consistency. [Ce qui manque dans tous ces temoignages, c'est la fermete, la consistance].27 They do not contradict each other, neither do they agree with each other; they do not seem to be about the same person. ... I am beginning to believe that nothing can ever be proved. These are honest hypotheses which take the facts into account: but I sense so definitely that they came from me, and that they are simply a way of unifying my own knowledge. Not a glimmer comes from Rollebon's side. Slow, lazy, sulky, the facts adapt themselves to the rigour of the order I wish to give them; but it remains outside of them. I have the feeling of doing a work of 27 Though Lloyd Alexander correctly translates " fermete " as " firmness," it loses in translation the crucial connotations of " closure."</page><page sequence="25">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 247 pure imagination. [J'ai 1'impression de faire un travail de pure imagination.] (pp. 22-23) But the basis of the fully articulated analogy is established early in the process of Roquentin's " education " into the realities of existence when, under the influence of the Nausea, he begins to worry the distinction between Vaventtcre and la vie. And though he never completely and consciously accepts the distinction, it nevertheless helps precipitate the un-naming in the garden. When "one tells about life" (on raconte la vie), Roquentin ob serves, he is in fact transforming life into adventure, the superfluous into a logocentric, a predictable and thus reassuring, well-made world, in which all the parts are integral and rigorously justified. That is, they fit like pieces in a picture puzzle or, as writers influenced by La Nausee such as Ionesco, Beckett, Robbe-Grillet, and Sarraute would imply later in their works, like clues in a detective story.28 In other words, to "tell about life" is, like the Self-Taught man's humanistic educational project, to reify life. Or more accurately, it is to perceive the contingency of existence spatially rather than temporally and to re-count process from the distancing—and safe vantage point of the end in what Roland Barthes, no doubt thinking of Sartre's distinction, has called the " preterite mode."29 The 18 As I have suggested in my article, " The Detective and the Boundary: Some Notes on the Postmodern Literary Imagination," boundary 2, 1 (Fall 1972), 147-168; reprinted in revised form in William V. Spanos, ed. Existentialism 2: A Casebook (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1976), pp. 163-189, the anti-detective story, which refuses to fulfill the causal expectations of a positivistic audience, is one of the essential forms of the postmodern fictional imagination. It is interesting to observe that it was Sartre in his essays on Nathalie Sarraute who first equated the new " anti-novel" with anti detective fiction: Sarraute's Portrait of a Man Unknown, Sartre writes, "is an anti-novel that reads like a detective story. In fact it is a parody on the novel of ' quest' into which the author has introduced a sort of impassioned amateur detective.. . who ... doesn't find anything, or hardly anything, and he gives up his investigation as a result of a metamorphosis; just as though Agatha Christie's detective on the verge of unmasking the villain, had himself suddenly turned criminal."

Spanos quantitative etymology, which Roquentin stresses by underscoring " raconter," it is important to note, reminds us not only of Bergson's critique of the postivists' spatialization of duration, but also of Kierke gaard's and Heidegger's critique of Platonic and Hegelian Re-col lection—and, by extension, that mode of poetry of the Romantic tradition which is defined in Wordsworth's phrase as "emotion recollected in tranquillity" and reaches it fullest expression in the Modernist text par excellence, Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu.30 things happen one way and we tell about them in opposite sense [les evenements se produisent dans un sens et nous les racontons en sense inverse]. You seem to start at the beginning: "It was a fine autumn evening in 1922.1 was a notary's clerk in Marommes." And in reality you have started at the end. [Et en realite c'est par la fin qu'on a commence.] It was there, invisible and present, it is the one which gives to words the pomp and value of a begin ning. " I was out walking, I had left the town without realizing it, I was thinking about my money troubles." The sentence, taken simply for what it is, means that the man was absorbed, morose, a hundred leagues from an adventure, exactly in the mood to let things happen without noticing them. But the end is there, trans forming everything. For us, the man is already the hero of the story. His moroseness, his money troubles are much more precious than ours, they are all gilded by the light of future pas sions. And the story goes on in the reverse: instants have stopped piling themselves in a light-hearted way one on top of the other, they are snapped up by the end of the story which draws them and each one of them, in turn, draws out the preceding instant: "It was night, the street was deserted." The phrase is cast out neg lurks a demiurge, a God or a reciter. The world is not unexplained since it is told like a story; each one of its accidents is but a circumstance, and the preterite is precisely this operative sign whereby the narrator reduces the exploded reality to a slim and pure logos, without density, without volume, without spread, and whose sole function is to unite as rapidly as possible a cause and an end.... So that finally the preterite is the expression of an order, and consequently of an euphoria.

And we feel that the hero has lived all the details of the night like annunciations, promises, or even that he lived only those that were promises, blind and deaf to all that did not herald adventure. We forget that the future was not yet there; the man was walking in a night without forethought, a night which offered him a choice of dull rich prizes, and he did not make his choice, (p. 57, my emphasis) True to the inexorable demands of the analogy between a logocentric ontology and the well-made literary form (his destruction of the providential rhetoric of the ontotheological tradition—the rhetoric that grounds " telling-about" in the Word—should not be missed), Roquentin comes eventually to realize not only the spatial, but also the temporal dimension of contingency: that the historical past is an in-closing fiction, that only the " superfluous" present exists. Or rather, he comes to see that primordial existence is characterized by difference, that it is in a profound way radically temporal, i. e. open ended: I looked anxiously around me; the present, nothing but the present The true nature of the present revealed itself [devoil ait]: it is what exists, and all that was not present, did not exist. Not at all. Not in things, not even in my thoughts, (p. 130) Thus along with his belief in the validity of naming and of at-homing existence as the City, he abandons, at least for the time being, whatever faith he had in the past (and future) as a valid guide to the present, i. e. as a way of grounding a "temporal" structure which could enclose the present in either a linear or dialectical order. In short, he abandons his faith in the validity of naming time. Thus also he gives up his investigation for a final cause that would " ex plain " or " justify " Rollebon's life, or, put in another way, for an appropriate solution to the " riddle" of his protagonist's existence that would draw its dispersed parts into a distancing con-clusion, into a bounded picture as it were. At the beginning of his reflections on the difference between life and adventure, Roquentin had thrown off vaguely (though the sentence was to assume scriptural authority for the postmodern literary imagination): "Beware of literature" (p. 19). After his visit to the Bouville museum, where the portraits of the bourgeois saints are enshrined and where he rejects the past, the " experience," that</page><page sequence="28">250 William V. Spanos justifies the bourgeois version of the world, he writes in his journals. " I could shape his [Rollebon's] features at will Only it was nothing more than an image in me, a fiction," (p. 132) and a few sentences later, "the great Rollebon affair was over, like a great passion" (p. 133). It is important to observe that what Roquentin rejects here under the pressure of primordial temporality is a " shape," an " image of existence," i. e. a spatial form. V It is at this point, after, that is, Roquentin has experienced (and understood) the de-centering, the unnaming, in all three of its manifestations—ontological, social, and literary—that the question of Sartre's relationship to his protagonist becomes a crucial one. As I have already suggested, most interpreters simply take for granted that Roquentin is a strictly autobiographical portrait of the early Sartre and, therefore, that he is little more than a mouthpiece for the author's philosophy at the time of writing La Nausee. What I want to suggest is that, however at one with his protagonist in the destructive phase, Sartre, in fact, dissociates himself from his "con structive " efforts that, more specifically, the " form" of Sartre's novel constitutes a de-struction, an ironic revelation of at least the ambiguity, if not the bad faith, of Roquentin's aesthetic resolution of his ontological crisis. Despite Roquentin's " vision," he cannot completely acknowledge the unnamed world he has borne witness to in the garden—nor accept the " burden of freedom" (asSartre, borrowing from Dostoev sky and Heidegger, was to put it later) that he understands to be the essential condition of the anti-Adam in the de-centered world. As we have seen, he despises the bourgeois merchants of Bouville for trying to "arrest" the movement of this superfluous temporal realm by imposing fraudulent names—a providential rhetoric—upon it. He is especially contemptuous of their arrogant devotion, on the grounds of divine justification, to technological process, which is, he knows, a self-deceptive effort to build dikes against the primordial slime (Bouville) or, to use Heidegger's metaphor again, to chart and domesticate die unheimliche Welt, the uncanny not-at-home. But Roquentin, too, finds this same existence not only dreadful but obscenely repellent, indeed, too terrible to be endured. As entry after entry throughout his journals suggest, his disgust for the things of the external world, including human beings is (and has been)</page><page sequence="29">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 251 virtually total. There is very little in the realms of concrete existence, of " the things themselves," capable of arousing joy or even sympathy in him. Indeed, his disgust—and the rhetoric which embodies it is remarkably and significantly reminiscent of the ascetic contemptus mundi that a segment of the medieval world practiced to raise their souls above the loathsome corruption of the earth—except, perhaps, that it borders more closely on the pathological: Smiles. His teeth are rotten. The red hand does not belong to him, it is his neighbor's, a fellow with a black moustache. This fellow with the moustache has enormous nostrils that would pump air for a whole family and that eat up half his face, but in spite of that, he breathes through his mouth, gasping a little. With them is also a young man with a face like a dog. (p. 32) Thus Roquentin will work out a mode of evasion that is more subtle—so much more that most critics have failed or refused to understand it as an evasion—but hardly more honest than that of the Bouville merchants. To anticipate, he will become, as his remarkably similar English-speaking counterpart, Stephen Dedalus, puts it (I will return to this relationship and the analogous rhetoric that ex presses it), a soaring "priest of eternal imagination, transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everliving life." 31 From the beginning, Roquentin notices that the Nausea subsides, or more precisely, that he transcends the nausea-provoking situation whenever he hears a certain American ragtime jazz tune. The first significant, if only tentative, intimation of the song's " mysterious" power to subdue the Nausea occurs early in the novel. Sitting in his favorite "well-lighted place," the Rendezvous des Cheminots, Roquentin is suddenly seized by the Nausea, the " new thing." As the bartender's purple suspenders begin to disintegrate before his eyes, he pleads, somewhat like a penitent to an intercessor, with the waitress, Madeleine, to play the jazz tune, "Some of These Days," on the phonograph. Though he is not fully conscious of his feeling, Roquentin knows that the "inflexible order" or, synony mously, the " hardness" of the song is somehow a viable barrier against the invading viscosity of existence which brings on the Nausea. As the music progresses inexorably toward the vocal he anticipates, Roquentin's sense of the jazz tune, not as melody, but 31 James Joyce, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, ed. by Chester G. Anderson (New York: The Viking Press, 1968), p. 221.</page><page sequence="30">Hi William V. Spanos " only notes [that] ... an in flexible order gives birth to ... and des troys .. .without even giving them time to recuperate and exist for themselves" (my emphasis), begins to make him feel happy. And this happiness "spreads at the bottom of the viscous puddle [flaque visqueuse], at the bottom of our time—the time of purple suspenders and broken chair seats." Once he equates existence and what he calls "our time," that is, the "fallen," the finite existential, the occasional, time that disintegrates, that corrupts—that disperses and differentiates the One as it were—he takes, at least tentatively, the final step in the process of neutralizing the Nausea when he intuits the equation between this song, this " band of steel" as he repeatedly calls it, and timelessness, i. e. eternity. The passage, which I take to be at the thematic and rhetorical " heart" of Sartre's novel, needs to be quoted at length: There is another happiness: outside there is this band of steel, '!e narrow duration of the music which traverses our time through and through [qui traverse notre temps de part en part], rejecting it; tearing as it with its dry little points; there is another time. " Monsieur Randu plays hearts . . . and you place the shackle." The voice [of one of the card players in the cafe, i.e., of exist ence] dies away and disappears. Nothing bites on the ribbon of steel, neither the opening door, nor the breath of cold air flowing over my knees, nor the arrival of the veterinary surgeon and his little girl: the music transpierces these vague figures and passes through them A few seconds more and the negress will sing. It seems inevit able, so strong is the necessity of this music-, nothing can interrupt it, nothing which comes from this time in which the world has fallen; it will stop of itself, as if by order. If I love this beautiful voice it is especially because of that: it is neither for its fullness nor its sadness, rather because it is the event for which so many notes have been preparing, from so far away, dying that it might be born The last chord has died away. In the brief silence which follows I feel strongly that there it is, that something has happened. Silence. Some of these days You'll miss vie honey What has just happened is that the Nausea has disappeared. When the voice was heard [s'est elevee] in the silence, I felt my</page><page sequence="31">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 253 body harden and the Nausea vanish. Suddenly: it was almost un bearable to become so hard, so brilliant [ainsi tout dur, tout ruti lant]. At the same time the music was drawn out, dilated, swelled like a waterspout. It filled the room with its metallic transpar ency, crushing our miserable time against the walls. I am in the music, (pp. 33-35, my emphasis, except for that in the fifth and seventh paragraphs.) In this moment of silence, " after the last chord has died away," it is Roquentin's perception of the whole song simultaneously, that is, as an anticipated necessity, which makes him " hard" and " dry " and " brilliant" as the steel-like music. The moment of silence, as his theological rhetoric here and elsewhere makes clear, is a transcendent moment, an epiphany as it were, that transports him into a timeless realm above this miserable and, as the reference to time as a cock roach suggests, verminous existence "in which the world has fallen." A little later, Roquentin, recalling this moment in which "something has happened," identifies it with " adventure " : Something is beginning in order to end: adventure does not let itself be drawn out; it only makes sense when dead. . . . Each instant appears only as part of a sequence. [Chaque instant ne parait que pour amener ceux qui suivent.] (p. 54) And he concludes again, " I am so happy when a negress sings: what summits [summets] would I not reach if my own life made the subject of the melody" (p. 55). In so doing he brings the jazz tune (a certain kind of art), adventure, and the rhetoric of religious transcendence (of going beyond or, rather, of rising above existence) — the very rhetoric, it is important to observe, that he destroys in his entries describing the un-naming in the park-garden—into relationship. This equation is, in the early stages of Roquentin's education, uncertain and tentative, but he persistently reiterates it throughout the rest of the journals. And at the " end "—after he has undergone the " revelation " of the un-naming and the narrative has come " full circle "—it suddenly occurs to him, as he listens to the negress's song in the Rendezvous des Cheminots for the last time before leaving Bouville for Paris, that these intimations have been leading inexor ably—necessarily—to one conclusion: that he write a novel which would be the equivalent of the jazz tune. The precise form of the novel Roquentin will write is never made explicit. It is obvious, however, that it will not be written in the linear or " preterite mode " of, say, Balzac's Eugenie Grandet (which, significantly, like the</page><page sequence="32">254 William V. Spanos biography of Rollebon he cannot finish writing, Roquentin cannot finish reading). For he has made it convincingly clear that the strategy of writing from a preconceived event-causing end has as its motive the impulse to reify anxiety (dread), which has no-thing or nothing for its object, in order to make contingency (freedom) "necessary" or, to use Heidegger's metaphor, to make Nothing »M?z-ageable.32 He has made it clear, in other words, that the pre terite mode of the "well made" novel, which re-counts in order to stay ontological invasion, is the inauthentic logocentric mode of the positivistic consciousness, the consciousness, more specifically, of the bourgeois Salauds. It is, I think, the persuasiveness of this inference that has led most commentators, both philosophers and literary critics for whom teleological form is ontologically prior to temporality in the hermeneutic process, to assume that the species of novel Roquentin intends to write is capable of achieving for its author an unequivocably authentic "salvation" from existence. But the temporal process of the " narrative" of La Nausee simply will not support this too easy identification. On the contrary, a tem poral reading of Sartre's text suggests, rather, that Roquentin's decision to write such a novel constitutes an act of bad faith, which is equally as questionable as that which establishes the well-made universe of les Salauds. Having come face to face with the de centered world, with the un-named existence which is prior to essence—whether the essence of the providential world of the Second Adam or the positivistic City of the Third Adam—he flees from the demands this world ("this time") makes on his humanity and his art, that is, from the imperatives of freedom, by seeking the well lighted (radiant) refuge of an ultimately similar, if more subtly conceived, form of essentialism or logocentric meta-physics than that of the solid citizens of Bouville. The nature of this metaphysics can be suggested by inferring the form of the novel Roquentin intends to write—it is not the journal form of La Nausee, as we shall see—from certain recurrent, though unexamined, images, to which I have already referred but held in abeyance, that inform the rhetoric expressing his developing understanding of why the jazz song has the power of neutralizing the Nausea. Initially, as in the preceding passage, Roquentin associates his model, the benign jazz tune, with hard metallic images. Later, immediately after he has experienced the un-naming in the garden, where the 32 Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, Sect. 40, 228 ff.</page><page sequence="33">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 255 destruction of his ontological frame of reference dis-covers exis tence to him, he associates the jazz tune with geometric images, especially with the circle, and pits these over against the obscene viscosity of existence. "If you existed," he writes in his journals, "you had to exist all the way, as far as mouldiness, bloatedness, obscenity were concerned. In another world, circles, bars of music, keep their pure and rigid lines. But existence is a deflection" (p. 172). And then, after equating existence with absurdity, he observes, "A circle is not absurd, it is clearly explained by the rotation of a straight segment around one of its extremities. But neither does a circle exist. This root, on the other hand, existed in such a way that I could not explain it. Knotty, inert, nameless, it fascinated me, filled my eyes, brought me back unceasingly to its own existence. In vain to repeat: 'This is a root'—it didn't work anymore [5a ne prenait plus] (p. 174, my emphasis).33 Up until this point, as we see from the above passages, Roquentin invokes the other-worldliness of the song, the bar of steel, and the circle primarily to define by contrast the un-named world of con tingent existence and to emphasize its " obscene" corruptions. But in the "end," after the intimations of immortality have coalesced, he tips the balance. As he is listening to the jazz tune for the last time, he realizes fully that, in being like a circle, the song provides him with a means of escaping existence, or in the crucial religious rhetoric which, like so many Modernists, he is prone to use, with a means of being "saved" (p. 236), of being "'washed' of the sin of existing [du peche d'exister] " (p. 232). Sitting at his table Roquentin rehearses once again the ontological characteristics of the song: "It does not exist [I]f I were to break it [the record] in two, I wouldn't reach it. It is beyond— always beyond something, a voice, a violin note. Through layers and layers of existence, it veils itself, thin and firm It is behind [existants]: I don't even hear it, I hear sounds, vibrations in the air which unveil it. It does not exist because it has nothing superfluous: it is all the rest which in relation to it is superfluous. It is" (p. 233, Sartre's emphasis.). Suddenly he realizes, in something like an epiphany, that this is precisely what he too has been yearning for: "And I too wanted to be. That is all I wanted; this is the last word. [Voila le fin mot de ma vie.] At the bottom of all these attempts 33 See also p. 175: "Black? The root was not black black, like the circle, did not exist."</page><page sequence="34">256 William V. Spanos which seemed without bonds, I find the same desire again: to drive existence out of me, to rid [vider] the passing moments of their fat, to twist them, dry them, purify myself, harden myself, to give back, at last the sharp, precise sound of a saxophone note " (p. 234, Sartre's emphasis.). In thus perceiving the absolute necessity of the art object, the Being of its being, he also perceives that through the novel, justification of his existence was possible. But Roquentin's hopeful question, " Can you justify your existence then? " inevitably recalls his contemptuous judgment against the Bouvillois' presumptuous necessity, their "right to exist," which, as he knows, is a way of escaping existence. Despite the antithetical ontological sources of the novel he envisions (Husserlian idealism), his too easily achieved belief in the justifying potential of a novel that is, that substantiates be-ing, i. e. reduces it to " matter" as a final ground, thus signals the ultimate identity of his text and the logocentric prevarications—01 better, fictions—that les Salauds call their lives.34 This may, on the surface, sound like an outrageous coercion of Sartre's distinction between Roquentin and the Bouvillois into an identity, but when we remember the conclusion of "The Childhood of a Leader" (written simultaneously with La Nausee), the powerful novella about the making of the type of bourgeois fascist whose portraits adorn the municipal museum of Bouville, we begin to understand how valid it is: S1 In this equation, Sartre is at one with Martin Heidegger's critique of the Western onto-theo-logical tradition, according to which both positivism and idealism, despite his preference for the latter, e. g. Kant, are at bottom meta physical strategies in the sense of interpreting temporal reality spatially, i. e., meta-ta-physika, from beyond or above things-as-they-are. It is worth pointing out, in this respect, that it is no accident that Joseph Frank uses the term " spatial form" as a sympathetic definition of the modernity of Symbolist/ Imagist poetics without indicating awareness of the fact that Henri Bergson (and T. E. Hulme) used the same term earlier to define and criticize the reality perceived by the postivistic consciousness, the reality, that is, deplored by the Symbolist/Imagist imagination. See Joseph Frank, "Spatial Form in Modem Literature," Seivanee Review, 53 (Spring, Summer, Autumn, 1945), 221-40, 433-45, 643-65 (reprinted in The Widening Gyre: Crisis and Mastery in Modern Literature [New Brunswick, N.

[Lucien thinks] Something like triangles and circles: it was so perfect that it didn't exist. You could trace thousands of circles with a compass in vain, you could never make a single circle. Generations of workers could even scrupulously obey the commands of Lucien; they would never exhaust his right to command; rights were beyond existence, like mathematical objects and religious dogma. And now Lucien was just that; an enormous bouquet of responsibilities and rights. He had believed that he had existed by chance for a long time, but it was due to a lack of sufficient thought. His place in the sun was marked in Ferolles long before his birth. They were waiting for him long before his father's marriage: if he had come into the world it was to occupy that place: "I exist," he thought, " because I have the right to exist." And, perhaps for the first time, he had a flashing, glorious vision of his destiny (my emphasis).35 The difference between Roquentin's and the Bouville merchants' notions of justification is that one is characterized by internal simultaneity and the other by external causal progress, transcendent timelessness as opposed to well-made linear temporality. Like Hei degger, Sartre, of course, perceives the latter to be the more immediate enemy. But he also perceives that behind the difference lies a spatializing or objectifying metaphysics, that, in other words, they both belong to the logocentric ontological tradition. The first moment of transcendent illumination, we recall, is described at the beginning of the journal when Roquentin, prepared by the preceding suggestion of "the inflexible order," the "necessity of this music," experiences the -whole song at once in the silence between the dying out of the last chord and the emergence of the negress's voice. And the final and definitive moment of illumination comes in the last entry of the journal, when Roquentin discovers in the moment of epiphanic "liberation" that just as the song "is," so 35 Jean Paul Sartre, "The Childhood of a Leader," Intimacy, tr. Lloyd Alexander (New York: New Directions, 1948), p. 1J8. This story, the French title of which is " L'Enfance d'un chef," first appeared in the collection Le Mur (Paris: Gallimard, 1939). It had not been previously published. Lucien, it is worth observing to suggest the analogy with Roquentin, listens to the "voice of Sophie Tucker" on a gramophone record. As Eugenia Zimmerman has persuasively shown in "' Some of These Days' : Sartre's Petite PhraseContemporary Literature, 11 (Summer 1970), 375-381, Sartre in La Nausee, is alluding to Sophie Tucker's recording of " Some of These Days," mistaking her for a black.</page><page sequence="36">258 William V. Spanos too, he wants to " be" a substantial essence, free from the ravages of historical time. Like all metaphysicians from Plato through Descartes, Kant,36 and Hegel, Roquentin is compelled by a nos talgia for lost origins. He wants, that is, like them, to perceive existence spatially, to annihilate the temporality which, as Heidegger insists in Sein und Zeit, defines human being (Dasein)— and its counterpart, the difference or change (the motion of becoming) that generates desire and loathing—to become something like an angel, capable, that is, of the immediate and undifferentiated know ledge, the " allatonceness," of pure intelligence.37 This explains Roquentin's contradictory yearning for the " higher" world beyond, which pervades his journals. It also explains his idealization of evanescence, of weightlessness which, in contrast to the weighty solidity of the middle class, Sartre, under the influence of Kierke gaard's critique of the " hovering "—the infinitely negative—ironic or aesthetic consciousness, will henceforth use in his fiction and drama to characterize the hellish "freedom towards nothing" of the disengaged man, i. e., the aesthete: Erostratus, Orestes, Matthieu Delarue and others.38 The form of the novel Roquentin envisages is thus clearer in his mind than he in fact claims. It will of course, be "modern." But it will be modern, not in opposition to the fiction of the 1930's, but to the positivistic well-made fiction of the bourgeois nineteenth century, in which the assured detective/ psychologist (whether protagonist or reader) reigns supreme. Ro quentin, that is, will not employ the melodramatic linear sense of " adventure " to work out a " realistic " form that mirrors a positivistic metaphysics and ethos. He will not, for example, model his fic tion on Balzac's Eugenie Grandet. He will begin, rather, with the privileged, i. e. teleological, moment, the concept of " adventure" as transcendental aesthetic epiphany, and seek to achieve something like geometric or, at any rate, pure form, in which "the passing moments are rid of their fat" by being coerced into a spatial mould. 80 Heidegger qualifies Kant's spatializing impulse in his " dialogue" with The Critique in Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, tr. James S. Churchhill, (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1962), where he says that his predecessor wanted to articulate a temporal interpretation of Being but was inhibited by the metaphysical rhetoric of the tradition. 37 The term, of course, is H. Marshall McLuhan's.

I wonder if you understand. Things like that, I maintain, are beautiful not, like things in a relative sense; they are always beautiful in their very nature, and they carry pleasures peculiar to themselves which are quite unlike the pleasure of scratching.39 More immediately, however, it will align itself with that literary tradition which has become increasingly disillusioned in the possibility of achieving dialogue with the terrible earth and, therefore, has abandoned it in the futile solipsistic pursuit of a compensatory timeless eternity of one sort or another. I am referring, of course, to the " Modernism "—that is no longer very modern by the time Sartre is writing La Nctusee—which, in reaction against scientific positivism and its literary counterpart (the "realistic" or well-made work), emerged out of the " natural supernaturalism"40 of the Romantic movement in the consolatory aetheticism of fin de siecle literature and culminated in the ego-centric " religion " of " infinite negativity " of the Symbolist/Imagist movement—in Mallarme, Verlaine, Proust, T. E. Hulme, W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, et. al—which Sartre however simplistically, was to inveigh against in 39 Plato, Philebus. Like Roquentin, Socrates goes on virtually to identify the pleasure derived from geometrical forms with " that of audible sounds which are smooth and clear, and deliver a single series of pure notes, are beautiful not relatively to something else, but in themselves, and they are attended by pleasures implicit in themselves" (51c). That Sartre knew Plato's Philebus is evident from the fact that he gives Orestes (another "hoverer") in Les Mouches the alias "Philebus." See Robert Champigny, Stages on Sartre's Way (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1959), p. 86. &lt;0 The phrase, of course, is derived from M. H.

Spanos What is Literature?41 Roquentin's novel, in other words, will have its origins in the neo-Platonic Modernism or, as Jacques Maritain calls its extreme form, the " angelic imagination," which tries on the analogy of the pure intelligence of divine perception " to disintegrate or to circumvent the image in the illusory pursuit of essence " and "professes to know nature as essence at the same time that it has become alienated from nature in the rejection of its material forms."42 (In interpreting Modernism in terms of what Kierkegaard calls interchangeably irony or "infinite negativity," I am, of course, deny ing the freedom of the " free play " attributed to the writing of several of its central figures—Mallarme, Proust, and Valery, for example—by Jacques Derrida and the deconstructive critics he has influenced.) There is ultimately no other way of understanding the natural super natural rhetoric of Roquentin's last entry: . . . They [the Jewish songwriter and the black singer] have washed themselves of the sin of existence. ... I feel something " This definition of Modernism is an oversimplification, of course, but it does express a governing impulse of this literature and especially the criticism it has given rise to. For an amplified version of this definition, see my essay " Modern Literary Criticism and The Spatialization of Time: An Existential Critique," JAAC, 29 (Fall 1970), 87-104. See also Frank Kermode, Roman tic Image (New York: Vintage Books, 1964); and Joseph Frank, "Spatial Form in Modern Literature," Sewanee Review, 53 (Spring, Summer, Au tumn, 1945): 221-40, 433-45, 643-65. This impulse has been nicely epitomized recently in M. H. Abrams in Natural Supernaturalism: "Such features [the "circular shape"] of Wordsworth's Prelude brings to mind the subject matter, aim, and structural experiments in the chief enterprise of some of our best modern writers. This is the ' creative autobiography '—the more-or-less fictional work of art about the development of the artist himself, which is preoccupied with memory, time, and the relations of what is passing to what is eternal; is punctuated by illuminated moments, or ' epiphanies'; turns on a crisis which involves the question of the meaning of the author's life and the purpose of his sufferings; is resolved by the author's discovery of his literary identity and vocation and the attendant need to give up worldly involvement for artistic detachment; and includes its own poetic, and sometimes the circumstances of its own genesis " (p. 80). It is clear that Edith Kern's analysis of La Nausee as a Kiinstlerroman places Sartre's novel in this Romantic/Modernist tradition. "See Jacques Maritain, The Dream of Descartes, tr. Mabelle L. Andison (New York: Philosophical Library, 1944), pp. 179-86. The quotation is from Allen Tate, "The Symbolic Imagination," The Forlorn Demon-.

It is thus that Roquentin, like his Modernist fathers, will become the privileged maker (author) of a mystified text, and, in so doing, a perpetuater of the logocentric ontotheological tradition. It could be argued, as Frank Kermode does in The Sense of an Ending that, as novelist, Sartre is here acknowledging the ultimate authorial necessity to impose fictions or concordances on contingency, and, indeed, this is consistent with his thesis that man chooses him self.43 But as both the content (the emphasis on "the freedom" Roquentin discovers after the reduction by violence in the garden) and, as we shall see, the " dis-closive," if not precisely " open," form of La Nausee itself makes clear, Sartre as phenomenologist ultimately insists against Sartre as metaphysician on respect for—perhaps even a generosity towards—the contingent and analogously, therefore, an artfulness, if not an artlessness, that valorizes such respect.44 And Roquentin's final entry about the novel he intends to write contains nothing of this. His reference to justifying his existence through art should recall ironically his contemptuous attitude towards the Bouvillois' presumptuous and evasive necessity, their privileged " right 13 Frank Kermode, The Sense of an Ending-.

And if it doesn't, surely Roquentin's familiar Modernist Will to Power over existence, his disdain, that is, for the ugliness, the squalor, of temporality and his proud Gnostic impulse to "rise" into that " other world" " above existence " by way of spatializing, of coer cively in-closing, the temporality of language (which, as discourse, according to Heidegger, is equiprimordial with Dasein as Being-in-the world),45 reveals Sartre's ultimately ironic attitude towards his "hero" behind his perhaps ambiguous intention. Indeed, the parallel between Roquentin's " Platonic " aesthetics and that of the Symbolist/Imagist movement is remarkable. This can be seen most explicitly by comparing it, both motive (Kunstwollen) and envisaged form, with that of Wilhelm Worringer, whose Ab straktion und Einfiihlung (Abstraction and Empathy, 1908) not only epitomized the early Modernist impulse but was, by way of T. E. Hulme, a very influential agent in the shaping of the Sym bolist/Imagist poetic. Reacting against the unshakeable optimism of post-Renaissance Western art in the face of cultural disintegration in the modern world, Worringer points out that the predominant form of art in human history has not been the empathetic time/ motion art of Western humanism, which assumes " a happy pantheistic relationship of confidence between man and the phenomena of the external world,"46 but, rather, the geometric or " spatial" art of stasis, the " religious" art of primitive cultures (especially African and Egyptian), Byzantium, and, more generally, the Orient,47 that finds its urge in the need for the repose that an absolute source or origin provides in the face of " the immense dread of space ": Tormented by the entangled inter-relationship and flux of the phenomena of the outer world, such peoples were dominated by an immense need for tranquillity. The happiness they sought from art did not consist as it does in the Western humanistic tradtion in the possibilty of projecting themselves into the things of the outer world, of enjoying themselves in them, but in the possibility of taking the individual thing of the external world out of its arbitrari 46 Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, Section 34, p. 203.

E. Hulme was to idealize in his famous metaphor of the architect's curve49) it becomes vividly clear to us that Roquentin is thus a late descendent of the first generation of Modernists. Like them, he too is in search of illo tempore, that Golden Age at the beginning when the many was One; difference, Identity, words, the Word. We perceive, for example, that he is the heir of Marcel Proust, whose being, which will become the novel, is able in the " celestial" moment " to seize, isolate, im mobilize for the duration of a lightning flash what it never apprehends, namely, a fragment of time in its pure state" and thus to achieve "the only environment in which he could live and enjoy the essence of things, that is to say, entirely outside time;"60 of 18 Worringer, Abstraction and Empathy, pp. 16-17. This art, of course, goes hand in hand with myths of the recollection of origins studied by Mircea Eliade in Cosmos and History: The Myth of the Eternal Return, tr. Willard R.

As Eugenia Zimmermann suggests in pointing to the parallel between the use to which Roquentin puts " Some of These Days" and the use to which Marcel puts the "Vinteuil Sonata," ("'Some of These Days': Sartre's Petite Phrase, 3), the Modernist tradition, from Pater to Prouse, often uses music as the model for literature. But it is to be noted that in this tradition, as in Plato (and Roquentin), music is seen plastically. The source again is Plato's Philebus, where Socrates equates geometric forms with pure, abstract musical sounds.

There it was—her picture. Yes, with all its greens and blues, its line running up and across, its attempt at something. . . . With a sudden intensity—as if she saw it clear for a second, she drew a line there, in the centre. It was done; it was finished. Yes, she thought, laying down her brush in extreme fatigue, I have had my vision, (p. 310)52 But it is primarily the parallel between Roquentin's vision of the novel he hopes to write and the aesthetics or rather the poetics of iconic stasis—of epiphany—of Joyce's Stephen Dedalus that reveals most clearly his kinship with the Symbolists and their Platonic, or, better, neo-Gnostic, logocentric metaphysics. Given the impact of the anti-Adamic experience of un-naming, the parallel also sug gests Sartre's negative judgment against Roquentin's " aesthetic" resolution. For the parallel between Sartre's portrait of the historian "turned" novelist and Joyce's portrait of the artist as a young man is so close that it may well represent a parody or an incipient parody of Joyce's angelistic artist and a de-struction of what the French existential phenomenologist takes to be the received epiphanic structure of Joyce's text. Like Roquentin, Stephen too undergoes a terrible un-naming or, more accurately, an un-homing process that begins, in the Christmas dinner scene, with the dis-integration of his " Ptolemaic " or logo centric macrocosm, in which he is the center of the universe, and culminates in his sense of metaphysical homelessness incumbent on the loss of faith in his priestly calling. And like Roquentin, Stephen, too, compensates for his shattered metaphysics and transcends the " squalor "—the " shame of existence "—by " becoming," like so many Modernists, " a priest of eternal imagination." Thus near cs The final allusion to the culminating moment—the epiphany of Christ's great creative labor, which brings the gestating Judeo-Christian cosmic drama of presence to fruition (completion)—is not, of course, accidental. As in the case of most Modernist literature, the "natural supernatural" symbol is meant to define by compensatory contrast the revelation of presence (and its saving potential) of Symbolist art in a world in which God is dead, in a world, that is, which, having undergone un-naming, is no longer readable as a cosmic drama of presence. Compare Roquentin's aesthetics with Virginia Woolfs in her journal entry on The Waves: "The idea has come to me that what I want now to do is to saturate every atom. I mean to eliminate all waste, deadness, superfluity: to give the moment whole; whatever it includes."

Spanos the end of Portrait, after Stephen has experienced his climactic " Icarian" epiphany—an adventure as privileged moment—the too pontifical would-be artist explains to his earthy Protarchan friend Lynch (who listens to Stephen only because the latter provides him with cigarettes) in the best exegetical style: You see I use the word arrest. I mean the tragic emotion is static. Or rather the dramatic emotion is. The feelings excited by im proper art are kinetic, desire and loathing. Desire urges us to possess, to go to something; loathing urges us to abandon, to go from something. These are kinetic emtions. The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are therefore improper arts. The aesthetic emotion (I use the general term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing.53 Whatever Joyce's intentions, this pasage about the privileged in clusive perspective of iconic poetics—with its clear reminiscences of Gautier, Baudelaire, Proust, Worringer, Hulme, Pound, Wyndham Lewis, Yeats, Eliot, Woolf, et. al.—has often been referred to as a remarkable account of what Joseph Frank has called the "spatial form" of early Modernist poetic and novelistic practice. It has also been invoked by Modernist literary theoreticians with something like scriptural authority as a justification for a logocentric her meneutics and critical theory—a theory that militantly rejects the existential or " interested " nature of literary texts, in favor of the principle of autonomy: that " A poem should not mean/but be."54 As this formulation suggests, it is also, more than all the other examples to which I have referred, similar to the poetic theory that Roquentin evolves from the jazz tune and points to fundamentally similar psychological motives: in Worringer's terms, " the urge to abstraction," which, unlike the " urge to empathy" (that " finds " James Joyce, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, ed. by Chester B.

The Modernist poetics of autonomy informing Archibald MacLeish's formula from " Ars Poetica " derives, as Cleanth Brooks makes clear in Modern Poetry and the Tradition (New York: Oxford University Press, 1965), from I. A. Richards: "For him, a poem is not a more or less true statement... and it is in terms of what may be called its psychological structure— ' The resolution, inter-animation, and balancing of impulses—that all the more valuable effects of poetry must be described.'

E. Hulme's Speculations and Wyndham Lewis's Time and Western Man are especially important here) is precisely the equivalent of Roquentin's effort to annihilate time, to rid it of its fat (which is to say, to transcend existence). Both conceive the novel as a spatial or teleological rather than a temporal form, as a form that, like the jazz tune and the circle, can be seen at once, meta-ta-physika, in other words, as a form that simply is. Further, in Stephen's exegesis of the word visa in St. Thomas Aquinas's aesthetic doctrine, Fulcra sunt quae visa placent (that is beautiful the apprehension of which pleases), which he invokes to amplify his poetics of stasis, Joyce's " her," like Roquentin and so many of the early Modernists, perceives the transcendent static image in terms of the lifeless—and unadulterated—geometry of Platonic or Gnostic forms. "The word," he says to his rather reluctant listener, thus echoing Socrates' comment to Protarchus, "though it is vague, is clear enough to keep away good and evil which excite desire and loathing. It means certainly a stasis and not a kinesis. How about the true? It produces a stasis of the mind. You would not write your name in pencil across the hypothenuse of a right-angled tri angle" as his earthy and kinetically oriented friend Lynch had " improperly " done " on the backside of the Venus of Praxiteles."66 But the parallelism is even more particular. For the culminating metaphor of rising heavenward, out of the " sordid squalor" of the 65 Worringer, Abstraction and Empathy, p. 4. 53 Joyce, Portrait, p. 205. Socrates', Stephen's, and Roquentin's preference for the pure pleasure of aesthetic form as opposed to adulterated pleasures like scratching or sexual excitement is echoed by T. E. Hulme in Speculations: " There is nothing vital in Byzantine art; the emotion you get from it is not a pleasure in the reproduction of natural or human life. The disgust with the trivial and accidental characteristics of living shapes, the searching after an austerity, a perfection and rigidity which vital things can never have, lead here to the use of forms which can almost be called geometrical" p. 53.

Spanos fallen modern City in Stephen's definition of the aesthetic emotion (a metaphor which repeats his Icarian vision and his angelic yearning for " seraphic" embraces)57 finds it's equivalent, as I have tried to suggest, in Roquentin's obsessive yearning, despite what he has " seen " from such vantage points, for heights which are " in another world" beyond " our time." His religious rhetoric further reveals the same ontological dualism that idealizes a form of aesthetic eter nity, i.e. necessity at the expense of the historical life, a dualism, in other words, that has its ultimate source in the dread of being adulterated by the obscene generative energies of finite existence or, more broadly, of being overwhelmed by no-thingness, by the contingencies, the ungraspable or unnameable and thus uncertain motion, of historical time. Indeed, Roquentin's priestly revulsion from the obscenity of matter and history—" the shame of existence is, as we have seen, so great that he must share with Stephen Dedalus the onus of epitomizing a modern contempt for the world (contemptus mundi) as great and dehumanizing as any medieval version of it.58 If, therefore, Stephen represents the solipsistic and mystifying Symbolist imagination, it is difficult to conclude otherwise than that Roquentin's religion of art, his aesthetic urge to "wash himself of the sin of existing " by writing a novel which will be the equivalent of a band of steel or, more definitively, a Platonic circle, is a betrayal of Sartre's existential—by which I mean anti-metaphysical— phenomenology. Like Stephen, Roquentin as artist, in other words, has no capacity for the being-in-the-world that his experiences in the public park and on the hill overlooking Bouville demand from him, no capacity, that is, for what Keats called Negative Capability and Hedeigger, Gelassenheit, an ability to let the dreadful sublimity of Nothing (or Being) be. Instead, like so many Modernists before him, he is driven by the dread of and the consequent Will to Power over existence to spatialize time, to coerce temporality into 57 Joyce, Portrait, p. 217. See La Nausee, p. 232, where Roquentin refers to himself as " Swimming in beatitudes." 58 Yeats, too, often refers to finite existence in similar negative religious terms, though always with a redemptive ambiguity. See, for example, " The Dolls." Only when the instrument of Yeats's body began to break down did this great Modernist begin to perceive the postmodern possibilities of celebrating the unnameable—and open—nothingness of temporality. But even at this stage, the aesthetic imagination's ability to " scorn the earth" and " Deliver us from the crime of death and birth" (" A Dialogue of Self and Soul") continues to have a powerful inhibiting hold on Yeats' consciousness.</page><page sequence="47">269 The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" artistic shape, that is, to reify Nothingness in order to be able to take hold of it, to man-age or mara-ipulate it.59 VI The critics who identify Roquentin and Sartre from beginning to end and go on to say that Sartre has not yet arrived at an existential philosophy of engagement conclude that La Nausee itself is the work that Roquentin was to write. Hazel Barnes, for example, says: It concludes with Roquentin's reflection on the type of book he will write in order that he may, in part, justify his existence by inserting in the midst of its flux a little bit of gem-like Being. It must not be history or biography again ... It will probably be a novel. Actually, of course, it will be and has been—Nausea.60 Michael Edwards brings La Nausee a little more up to date—from fin de Steele aestheticism to Modernist Symbolism—but his more sophisti cated argument is virtually the same: ... La Nausee is the fiction which it discusses—not the book that Roquentin thinks of composing, since he postulates that no ' exist ant' can be its subject, but quite simply, Sartre's book, of the type described by its "hero" in its final pages. For Sartre, " Roquentin " is not an existence but a fiction; though partly autobiographical, he is only a projection of his creator's experience and suffering in the way that " Some of These Days " projects into the essentiality of art the " ennui" of its composer; his story is one which " would not happen " since it constitutes an " adventure," articulated by the " recit prefabrique " of La Nausee itself—rigorously constructed, capable of infinite repetition—whereas, any similar experience which occurred to Sartre in the real world occurred (according to the tenets of the novel) amorphously and meaninglessly 69 The deconstructive critics following Jacques Derrida would object here to the " moralistic," i. e. " metaphysical" or " humanistic," evaluation of literary activity. In response, I would point to the fact that this " moral" impulse, however hidden, constitutes the ultimate foundation of Derrida's critique of logocentrism. I refer the reader to the central passage of " Structure, Sign and Play," quoted above in footnote 9, where the inhibiting of free play by a logocentric ground immobilizes motion and generates " a reassuring certitude " with which " anxiety can be mastered." See also Paul de Man, " Criticism and Crisis " : " The Human mind will go through amazing feats of distortion to avoid facing ' the nothingness of human matters,'" p. 18. 60 Hazel Barnes, Humanistic Existentialism-.

Fictive surrogate of the real Sartre, Roquentin suffers, throughout La Nausee, like the " little melody " of the jazz song, "en mesure."61 What these critics are telling us, it is important to emphasize, is that Sartre's novel posits the ontological priority of form (Being) over temporality: that it is the literary equivalent of a Platonic Circle, a Byzantine mosaic, or a Symbolist novel, which means—as Barnes's allusion to Pater's aesthetic inadvertently suggests—that Sartre's Kunstwollen, to use Worringer's language, is seen to be an equivalent desire "to wrest the object of the external world out of its natural context; out of the unending flux of being, to purify it of all its dependence upon life, a. e. of everything about it that was arbitrary, to render it necessary and irrefragable to approximate it to its absolute value." As Edwards' effort to find the "spatial" technique of The Waste Land in La Nausee suggests, this interpretation of the form of Sartre's novel, I submit, has its source in a hermeneutic method modelled on the Symbolist novel. That is, just as the Symbolist novel is or, rather, is intended to be, i.e. an object that is seen simultaneously as spatial form, so this method insists on the suspension of the temporal process until the end when the mind's eye can see all the juxtaposed and self-reflexive images—the whole picture—laid out in space, as it were. As Joseph Frank put this Modernist her meneutic methodology (without prejudice): Aesthetic form in modern poetry, then, is based on a space logic that demands a complete re-orientation in the reader's attitudes towards language. Since the primary reference of any word-group is to something inside the poem itself, language in modern poetry is really reflexive: the meaning-relationship is completed only by the simultaneous perception in space of word-groups which, when read consecutively in time, have no comprehensive relation to each other. Instead of the instinctive and immediate [read " primordial "] reference of words and word-groups to the objects or events they symbolize, and the construction of meaning from the sequence of their references, modern poetry asks its readers to suspend the process of individual reference temporarily until the entire pattern of internal references can be apprehended in a unity.62 01 Michael Edwards, "La Nausee—A Symbolist Novel," p. 19. 92 " Spatial Form in Modern Literature," pp. 229-30, my emphasis.</page><page sequence="49">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 271 Thus, to appropriate from Heidegger's postmodern project to "sur pass metaphysics," this " objective " or " disinterested " interpretive methodology becomes in fact an idealistic version of " re-counting " : a mystified logocentric hermeneutics of time as sheer presence. It becomes, that is, like all interpretive methodologies modelled on metaphysics (the perception of being meta-ta-physika), a privileged " awaiting which makes present and forgets," a " deliberative" or " calculating" awaiting, which, grounded as it is on the certain expectation of formal " unity "—that the " whole picture " will reveal itself—tends to coerce a temporal medium into an in-clusive object. In thus re-collecting time (a dispersed eternity) into closed circle (icon), this interpretive method closes off, becomes "blind" to the possibility of a more original—a phenomenological—understanding of the text. That is, this mnemonic method which we can now call a hermeneutics of Recollection (the term adopted by Kierkegaard to expose the aestheticism, the infinite negativity, of Hegel's ontology,63 forgets that temporality (difference) is ontologically prior to Being (Identity) and thus precludes an understanding in which meaning is infinitely open to re-interpretation.64 To be specific, it over-looks (forgets), as I have tried to show, Roquentin's progressive re-appro priation of the traditional logocentric rhetoric of a distancing religious vision in behalf of art that his experience, especially in the park and on the heights overlooking Bouville, has deconstructed. It becomes, that is, blind in its insight to Sartre's ultimate calling into question of Roquentin's "aesthetic solution." A Symbolist novel, despite the conservative appearance of its experimentation, is precisely what Sartre has not written. On the contrary, read temporally, or, in Heidegger's terms, with " anti cipatory resoluteness"65 as Sartre appears to insist in his famous 63 The term " Recollection" (Er-Innerrung) plays a crucial role in Hegel's Phenomenology of the Spirit.

Spanos essay, "Francois Mauriac and Freedom,"66 written in February 1939, i.e. at about the time of the publication of the novel, the form of La Nausee is understood to be the antithesis of " gemlike Being." And it exists ultimately, as I have been suggesting, not only as an obvious destruction of the linear nineteenth-century "realistic" novel, but also, and in a way more fundamentally, of the novel Roquentin envisages—whether formulated as a Modernist novel of spatial form or, as in the case of Edith Kern, a Kiinstlerroman, in which the circuitous journey of the hero/author precipitates Poetry as salvation from existence. What I am suggesting is that the source is neither, say, Schlegel's Lucinde nor Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu nor Gide's The Counterfeiters nor Joyce's Portrait, but rather a proto-antinovel (which also destroys the Kiinstlerroman as well) like Notes from Underground. It is true that, like the Proustian novel, the " form" of Sartre's work refuses to fulfill the obsessive expectations of the bourgeois structure of consciousness for comforting, useful and rational " solutions" to the "problems" of existence. It refuses to assume the preterite structure of Eugenie Grandet, the bourgeois well-made work, in which discords are resolved in the " Aristotelian " sense of adventure, that is, by imposing a necessary plot, a causal beginning, middle, and end on the contingent. But, on the other hand, and despite the appearance of circular structure, Sartre's novel also refuses to fulfill the formal imperatives of symbolism, which, however preferable an in an opening, a freedom, tethered to actuality that "repeats" that which is being interpreted, i. e., makes it new. Repetition, which " recollects forward," is, of course, Kierkegaard's (and Heidegger's) phenomenological/existential alternative to the spatializing of the Platonic/Hegelian Recollection. 80 "The thick substance I brew as I read The Possessed is my own expectancy, my own time. For a book is either a mere stack of dry leaves or else a great form in motion, in other words, the act of reading.... In order for the duration of my impatience and ignorance to be caught and then moulded and finally presented to me as the flesh of these creatures of my invention, the novelist must know how... to hollow out in his book, by means of the signs at his disposal, a time resembling my own, one in which the future does not exist. If I suspect the hero's future actions are determined in advance... my own time ebbs back into me; there remains only myself, reading and persisting, confronted by a static book. Do you want your characters to live? See to it that they are free." Literary and Philosophical Essays, tr. Annette Michelson (New York: Collier Books, 1962), p. 7. Sartre is, of course, pri marily speaking of novelistic technique. But his point against teleology or spatialization clearly applies to hermeneutics as such.</page><page sequence="51">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 273 alternative for Sartre to positivism, remained mystified (in the Tra dition) because the Symbolist imagination failed to understand the spatial origins of the positivistic consciousness and, thus, its relation to Symbolist form. La Nausee, that is, also refuses to fulfill the Symbolist version of the urge to objectify existence: the urge to solipsistic abstraction in which the discords of contingency are transcended in the " Platonic" sense of " adventure," when the privileged moment is expanded infinitely to " totalize " or encompass existence within the circular and substantial All. For in both cases, as we have seen, the will to power, the imposition of necessity on contingency, of objectness on nothing, negates the openendedness of existence and the " humanizing" burden of freedom. Looked at superficially, i. e. read re-colleotively, of course, La Nausee appears, like Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu or Eliot's Four Quartets, to articulate a circular structure—" beginning " and " ending" in The Rendezvous des Cheminots with Roquentin contemplating the jazz tune—that spatializes the time of the novel and, in re-collecting the difference into identity, thus releases Roquentin (and its reader) from its terrors. Experienced temporally, however—ctfre-fully, as it were—it discloses to the reader, rather, that La Nausee takes the form, not of a "finished" story, a recit prefabrique (i.e. a teleologically or spatially conceived artifact), but, like Notes from Underground, which "ends" ambiguously with an " editor's" arbitrary termination of " the ' notes' of this paradoxicalist" despite the fact that " he could not resist and con tinued them,"67 of some " notebooks... found among the papers " that Antoine Roquentin has left behind after his disappearance. That is, the circularity does not precipitate Roquentin's liberation from time in the radiant moment of closure when beginning and end meet, are transformed into space, as it does in the epiphanic recur rences of Proust or Yeats or Woolf. On the contrary, as his disappearance and the abandoned notebooks suggest, Roquentin, like his offspring Estragon and Vladimir in Waiting For Godot, is hurled into rather than released from existence, an existence in which closure is infinitely deferred. In other words, the structural circularity " of La Nausee and the style of dis-covering it open up and call into question the logocentric circularity of Roquentin's autotelic novel (and the Romantic/Modernist Kiinstlerromane it appears to resemble)—and the providential rhetoric it generates. It discloses "Fedor Dostoevsky, Notes from Underground, p. 115.</page><page sequence="52">274 William V. Spanos that in La Nausee, temporality is ontologically prior to Form, be-ing to Being. To return to Kierkegaard's and Heidegger's de structive language, it might be claimed that, unlike the Modernist novel, which, in the objectifying or aestheticizing manner of Plato and Hegel, "recollects [the essential] backwards," Sartre's La Nausee "recollects [the existential] forwards." The circuitous move ment, that is, constitutes the achievement of an authentically new beginning, a " repetition," which " is the interest upon which meta physics [read the perception of being meta-ta-physika] founders."68 La Nausee, in other words, as Roquentin might have said had he chosen to repeat his distinction between la vie and I'aventure, is an anti-novel. Or, at any rate, it is on the verge of becoming one. Seen in the light of its temporally dis-covered as opposed to spatially ordered form, the ambiguous, i. e. open-ended or anti-novel, form of La Nausee serves not only the negative function of demysti fying Roquentin's logocentric fictional strategy, but also the positive function of demystifying the reader's logocentric expectations of formal unity and thus, as in the pseudonymous works of Kierkegaard, of "assigning him to himself," i.e. to his freedom in the context of contingency, of the not-at-home.69 On the one hand, by re jecting a telos in favor of repetition—the ontological priority of time over Being—Sartre's decentered open form undermines, reduces by violence, as it were, the reader's privileged conventional, that is, "Aristotelian," expectation of a cathartic or comforting end, an end that makes the experience of anguish safe and even pleasurable from the beginning. In the language of existential phenomenology it reduces the inauthentic impulse to objectify (or spatialize), to find an object for, dread or anxiety (Angst), which has no thing as its " object." It thus inhibits the positivistic impulse to grasp the nameless, to transform the mystery of existence into a distanced and satisfying utilitarian ontology of necessity or, to use Sartre's metaphor (which may be adapted from Heidegger), to " domesticate " the contingency of nature by way of the creation of the modern bourgeois City.

In showing Roquentin caught ambiguously between his radical tempor ality (difference) and his impulse to escape its imperatives for freedom in symbolic flight, Sartre undermines the teleological reader's privileged status, engages him in rather than distances him from the text and his own experience. He generates, that is, an anxious consciousness of its namelessness and of the need to confront its uncertainty responsibly. Put in another way, the emergent anti-novel form of La Naiisee refuses, on the one hand, to provide answers or so lutions (as the Aristotelian well-made work or, what is ultimately the same thing, the detective story, does),71 to the riddle of human suffering in the face of the incomprehensibility of Nothingness. On the other hand, neither does it act as a stimulant that transports us instantaneously, like Hegel's synthesis, into the totalized paradisal " other world" of circles, where questions and answers are irrelevant because contra dictions have been reconciled into equilibrium, the existential either/or into the aesthetic or ironic neither/nor; in short, where difference has been recollected into identity. Rather, as the uncertain history of the interpretation of La Naiisee clearly suggests, it generates the radical questions, the Seinsfragen, which, like those being questions Job is driven by existence to ask from the dung heap, "humanizes" the reader, i. e. transforms him into a dialogic partner in the hermeneutic process.72 The "form" of Sartre's La Nausee, in other words, is the fic tional counterpart of the demystified " metaphysics" and " epis temology" Roquentin discovers in the public park and on the 70 M. H. Abrams observes of the "circuitous journey" of Hegel's Phenomen ology of Spirit: .. for consciousness to ' recollect' its own past stages not as the mere succession of events in time, but as ' comprehended history history which has been incorporated by consciousness, and so understood in all its necessary dialectic organization—it must have reached the Wissenschaft at the end of its educational journey before it can set out upon that journey from its beginning" (Natural Supernaturalism, p. 235). 71 See my essay, "The Detective and the Boundary," pp. 150, 154. 72 See Paul Bove, " Cleanth Brooks and Modern Irony: A Kierkegaardian Critique," boundary 2, 4 (Spring 1976), 727-59. I am indebted to Professor Bove for a number of important suggestions he made on reading this essay in draft form.</page><page sequence="54">276 William V. Spanos hill overlooking Bouville. I have tried to suggest that the causal or linear time-shape of the well-made work, of Eugenie Grandet, for example, is the linear microcosm of the bourgeois metaphysics of positivistic necessity, which in objectifying the objectless dread of nothing ("absurdity") transforms the terrible de trop in the end into something understandable, predictable, controllable, and useful, thus providing its disciples with a comfortable and arrogant sense of the right to exist, of their certain " at-homeness" in the world. I have also tried to suggest that the geometric form of the Symbolist novel is the microcosm of the idealistic metaphysics of transcendental necessity, which in spatializing temporality achieves an aesthetic distance from its dislocating potential, thus providing its disciples with an equivalent "right to exist," however different its ambience. In contradistinction to both of these versions of meta-physical fiction, the open-ended "shape" of La Nausee is a figure of the "anti-meta physics " of existential phenomenology, which, in acknowledging in its infinite differal of closure the de-centered nature of existence, also acknowledges and enacts the dread of nothing that generates the projective stance of Dasein, the interrogative mood of under standing, in the context of the temporal awareness of its not-at homeness-in-the-world. It will not allow the reader the comfort of an absolute interpretation—of naming, of "taking hold of," the awful nothingness of the existence which is the subject of Sartre's novel. It is in this sense that the form of La Nausee is seen to verge on becoming the formal equivalent of the myth of the anti Adam who suffers the un-naming in the park, the metamorphosis of the anthropomorphized energies in the world into their original presence-less state as threatening " beasts," when he loses faith in the logos as ratio and its linguistic analogy, the word. As fiction, Sartre's novel, of course, like all fiction, is a naming that lies. What is different about La Nausee, however, is not simply that it is aware of the fact that it is a lie. More important, as I have tried to show, it utilizes artifice to activate the reader's awareness of existence as an absence of presence. Unlike both the traditional (" Aristotelian ") and Modern (Symbolist) novel, which exist to cover up difference (fill in the gaps) in the act of naming it, La Nausee make differences explicit. It is, then, a naming that un-names. What Sartre achieves by way of his artifice, in short, is an example of Kierkagaard's " mastered irony," which, unlike the concealing irony of Modernist literature (especially of the New Critical view of it), dis-covers to</page><page sequence="55">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 277 the reader his being as being-in-the-world and thus engages him in the infinitely open-ended ambiguities of actuality. Sartre, as I have implied throughout, is perhaps too close to the "metaphysical" Western literary tradition to perceive clearly what he is in fact doing to the fictional forms he inherits from it, too close to perceive the "Copernican revolution" that La Nausee achieves in literature.73 Thus, I have had, in the manner of Heidegger vis-a-vis Kant, to " destroy " the novel—to wrest by hermeneutic violence the question that perhaps, as Heidegger says of Kant's project, Sartre's vestigial " metaphysical" language and formal assumptions inhibited his asking explicitly. However, once it is seen that La Nausee is essentially neither an " Aristotelian" nor a " Symbolist" novel in form and content, that, in fact, it constitutes a destruction of these, then it becomes theoretically and critically what it has been in fact for virtually every serious novelist and dramatist since its publication: the turn from Modernism to Postmodernism. With the un-naming in the park and in the fictional form of La Nausee, there is signalled the end of the privileged status not only of the beginning/middle/end of realistic works, but also of the formal closure of Symbolist works in the Western literary tradition (including the Romantic Kiinstler roman with which Edith Kern identifies the novel). Henceforth, as in Beckett, Ionesco, Sarraute, Robbe-Grillet, Barth, Pynchon, Olson, Ammons and even critics such as Jacques Derrida and Paul de Man bear witness, literature and the discussion of it will be characterized, above all, by the problematic—but also liberating—relationship be tween the word and things dis-closed by Sartre: Not that Watt desired information, for he did not. But he desired words to be applied to his situation, to Mr. Knott, to the house, to the grounds, to his duties, to the stairs, to the bedroom, to the kitchen, and in a general way to the conditions of being in which he found himself. For Watt now found himself in the midst of things which, if they consented to be named, did so as it were with reluctance. And the state in which Watt found himself resis ed formulation in a way no state had ever done, in which Watt had ever found himself, and Watt had found himself in a great many states in his day. Looking at a pot, for example, in thinking of a pot, at one of Mr. Knott's pots, of one of Mr. Knott's pots, it 73 See Robbe-Grillet's critique of the vestigial metaphysics of La Nausee in " Nature, Humanism, Tragedy," For a New Novel: Essays on Fiction, tr. Richard Howard (New York: Grove Press, 1965).</page><page sequence="56">278 William V. Spanos was in vain that Watt said, Pot, pot. Well, perhaps not quite in vain, but very nearly. For it was not a pot, the more he looked the more he reflected, the more he felt sure of that, that it was not a pot at all. It resembled a pot, it was almost a pot, but it was not a pot of which one could say, Pot, pot, and be comforted.74 The self-reflecting mirror-effect by which a work of fiction asserts, by its existence, its separation from empirical reality, its divergence, as a sign, from a meaning that depends for its existence on the constitutive activity of this sign, characterizes the work of literature in its essence.75 From the point of view of the literary tradition, this turn, as I have hinted at in my own critical rhetoric, is a moment in the emergent postmodern effort to repeat or retrieve (iviederholen)76 in all its original force mid for our time the tradition of the sublime, the tradition that invokes that being which is dreadful (and en nobling) precisely because the imagination cannot com-prehend (take hold of) it. It is, of course, the tradition that has its " origins" in the pre-Socratics and which ever since Longinus' effort to metho dologize (name) it, has been increasingly forgotten by the Western literary imagination, which, from the beginning, even in the effort of the Romantics to retrieve it, has more or less preferred the beautiful instead, that is, as Keats put it, without Negative Capability, has preferred to " reach irritability after fact or reason"77 at the "Samuel Beckett, Watt (New York: Grove Press, 1959), p. 81. 75 Paul de Man, Blindness and Insight: Essays on the Rhetoric of Contem porary Criticism (New York: Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 17. T0 Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, Section 67, p. 388; Sect. 74, pp. 386-86. Heidegger summarizes the retrieve achieved by a destructive hermeneutics as follows in Introduction to Metaphysics (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1959): "To ask How does it stand with being? means nothing less than to recapture, to repeat (wieder-holen), the beginning of our historical-spiritual existence, in order to transform it into a new beginning. This is possible. It is indeed the crucial form of history, because it begins in the fundamental event. But we do not repeat a beginning by reducing it to something past and now known, which need merely be imitated; no, the beginning must be begun again, more radically, with all the strangeness, darkness, insecurity that attends a true beginning. Repetition as we understand it is anything but an improved continuation with the old methods of what has been up to now" (p. 32).

This without saying it directly, is what Iris Murdoch implies in her important postmodern essay " The Sublime and the</page><page sequence="57">The Postmodernity of Sartre's "La Nausee" 279 expense of the dreadful uncertainties of existence. Seen in this light, the literary moment Sartre activates becomes, in turn, of course, part of the larger moment that Heidegger has referred to as the most important of postmodern projects: the " surpassing" (Vberwindung) of the coercive, the objectifying, the in-closing metaphysical perspective of the Western ontotheological tradition for the sake of retrieving the mystery of being. As Heidegger sum marizes his project: Calculative thought [of Western ontotheology] places itself under compulsion to master everything in the logical terms of its pro cedure. It has no notion that in calculation everything calculable is already a whole before it starts working out its sums and prod ucts [this is the coercive spatialization of time], a whole whose unity naturally belongs to the incalculable which, with its mystery, ever eludes the clutches of calculation. That which, however, is always and everywhere closed at the outset to the demands of calculation and, despite that, is always closer to man in its enigmatic unknowableness than anything that "is," than anything he may arrange and plan, this can sometimes put the essential man in touch with a thinking whose truth no " logic " can grasp. This thinking whose thoughts not only do not calculate but are absolutely deter mined by what is " other " than what-is, might be called essential thinking.78 When the form of Sartre's novel is experienced as something akin to an enactment in language of the dreadful un-naming in the park rather than a geometric shape that radiates gem-like flame, the broad parallel with Heidegger becomes evident. There are, of course, important differences based on Sartre's essentially anthropo logical (as opposed to ontological) project, which must not be overlooked. But these have been rehearsed over and over again ever since Heidegger called Sartre's project "metaphysical"79 and are by this time familiar. What needs to be said now, at this late Beautiful Revisited," Yale Review, 49 (December 1959), 247-71. Ms. Mur doch's conclusions about Sartre, based on what she calls his Hegelian "totalitarianism," are quite different from mine. In the end she places him among the Symbolists.
