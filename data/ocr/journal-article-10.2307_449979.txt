<plain_text><page sequence="1">Regeneration and Typology: Samson Agonistes and Its Relation to De Doctrina Christiana, Paradise Lost, and Paradise Regained LYNN VEACH SADLER Typological approaches to Samson Agonistes have tended to obscure Milton's emphasis on the historical and the experiential. Miltonic types do not merely await fulfillment in Christ, the antitype, but demonstrate the continuity of God's ways through all historical dispensations. In Paradise Lost and the De Doctrina, the Son establishes the pattern of recta ratio by choosing to ransom man. In Paradise Regained, he searches the Law and the Prophets to learn about his mission and exemplifies thereby the process of right use of the faculties. His response to God's accommodation in Paradise Lost, III, becomes a pattern for man's response to God's "signs." He teaches that warring faculties, political tyranny, or perverted serpents are not alone signs of Justice and of Mercy simultaneously. Samson, located in Judges between the Law and the Prophets, reflects more than the legalism of the Law; and Milton shows Samson going over his experiences until his false choices (primarily, legalistic ones) become evident. Samson acquires his regener- ative consolation under the Old Testament dispensation, but is exemplary, after Christ's own role of Exemplar, for those who adjust his experi- ence to that of their own historical circumstances. Samson gains "pro- phetic liberty" (comparable to the Christian liberty of Christian dispen- sations) through Milton's replacement of the traditional "Law versus the Gospel" by the "Law versus the Prophets" or "Law versus the 'Law and the Prophets.' He is a type of regenerative religious experi- ence responsive to God's ways as put to pattern in Christ. PROFESSOR WILLIAM G. MADSEN has established conclusively the universality of the practice of typology among Protestants and Catholics in Milton's period and has made the significant distinction that Miltonic types are not "Platonic absolutes," that they look forward in time, not upward through the scale of being. He does enlist a kind of Platonized future, however, when the types will reach perfection and so sees Milton opposing the "literalism and carnality" of the Old Testament to the "spirituality" of the New. While insisting that the type is a historical person or event, he points out that the meaning of the type cannot be known until fulfilled in its antitype. Thus Milton was not trying to suggest parallels between Christ and Samson: Milton, far from trying to Christianize Samson Agonis- tes, was at some pains to maintain the integrity of</page><page sequence="2">142 SAMSON AGONISTES his Old Testament materials. Instead of collapsing Samson and Christ, he is concerned with measuring the distance between the various levels of awareness (represented by Manoa, the Chorus, and Samson) pos- sible to those living under the old dispensation and the level of awareness revealed by Christ in Paradise Regained.' Samson's value for the audience lies primarily in what he negates, "in his inability to measure up to the heroic norm delineated in Paradise Regained." Yet Milton in the De Doctrina (I, xx) has expressed a view which seems quite different from that of Madsen. Milton coalesces belief in Christ and belief in God. Those who lived before Christ are saved by belief in God, a reading which is more forceful and meaningful than Madsen's use of "shadow" to describe Sam- son's relation to Christ. Milton's emphasis falls on the conti- nuity of dispensations in the process of regeneration common, through Christ, to all types. Samson, in the terms of his dis- pensation, incorporates Christ's sacrificial and exemplary role through his faith in God. In anticipating the ultimate revelation with Christ's "mystical body," Professor Madsen has reduced the Miltonic focus on the historical and experien- tial, whereas Adam learns from Raphael in Paradise Lost that the "prime Wisdom" is to know "That which before us lies in daily life . . ." (VIII, 193-194).2 As Arthur Barker has said, "Milton never lost his conviction that the fulfillment of the particular is the end of the experiential process, not its being swallowed up in some vaguely indefinable over-soul of meaning."3 For all of the efforts to retain historicity, the tendency for the Middle Ages and for later typologists influenced by medieval typology is to make the New Testament typical of the "spiritual" and "eternal" and to detach it from the experi- ential. On the other hand, Milton, following the Pauline Epistles, sees it as exemplary in a special way-as providing 'William G.

He avoids a dichotomy between Old and New Testaments by making the prophets a kind of old dispensation equivalent of Gospel typology; they become the "Revelation" of the Old Testament. Miltonic typology gives us, we might say, in place of the traditional "Law versus the Gospel," the "Law versus the Prophets" or the "Law versus the 'Law and the Prophets.'" Each dispensation will contain its corresponding pair of revelations in terms of the divine justice and mercy; justice is no longer the quality of the Old Testament; mercy, of the New. By envisioning the prophets as the intermediate link between the Law and the Gospel, Milton avoids a simple evangelical and chronological view of Christianity. He emphasizes the continuity between a "prophetic Old Testament meaning" and the "meaning of the Epistle to the Hebrews." He re-illuminates the prophetic versus the Calvinistic or mystical reading of the Epistle to the Hebrews, in which Samson is cited as a "hero of faith," by contrasting the prophetic reading of Samson's story in Judges with its legalistic meaning. The structure of Samson's experience in Samson Agonistes is, accordingly, the typological sequence of Laws-Prophets-Gospel. This is why we get an increased dedication of Samson to his Law as the moment of his suicide, in direct violation of the Law, draws near. Legalis- tic prescriptions are being played off against the prophetic call to acts beyond the Law. Miltonic types are not merely forward-looking and one- directional. They signify, rather, the process of God's ways illustrated in dispensations and in individual experience under various dispensations. Even Christ in the Gospels illustrates the process of revelation: his ministry provides exemplifica- tion for our imitation, and his act of redemption makes imita- tion possible in the first place. The Middle Ages emphasized Christ's Incarnation, seeing in the Old Testament a prefigur- ing of him, and in the New, his fulfillment of his role as Re- deemer. Christ's importance lay in his putting of himself in time in order that man, through him, might have his spiritual center not in the temporal, but in the infinite. Even when the Middle Ages seeks to avoid the diminution of the historical, the suspension of experience between the poles of redemption (in the Incarnation) and Judgment, and the reading of the Church as the penultimate dispensation, keep the medieval view dis-</page><page sequence="4">144 SAMSON AGONISTES tinct from the dynamic Miltonic view of history in which each dispensation progressively unfolds God's Providence and the way by which each man may be regenerated in his own day. For Milton, types and their antitypes belong to the unity of the divine plan and simultaneously image its unity so that in the historical movement, by careful response to the condi- tions of his dispensation, the individual has the signs neces- sary for his regeneration without waiting, as the medieval (and Dantesque) mode of figurality implies, until the full plan is revealed in the Day of Judgment. Protestant tradition has been influenced by the medieval suspension between static points: the Crucifixion, entombment, Resurrection as "abso- lutes." Milton reacts against the static view of history. For him, it is Christ's faith which sets the pattern for all historical dispensations. A Miltonic type is an exemplar-not the symbol of a spiri- tual absolute but the pattern of an action. The type provides, in his circumstances, the pattern we are to reproduce in our circumstances; we have to understand Samson in his dispensa- tory conditions and then apply our understanding to our conditions on the basis of the pattern established. The pattern is meaningful, thereby, to the type and to his own time, as well as to responsive viewers of subsequent dispensations. A poem like Samson Agonistes affords consolation to its readers when they respond to its typology and adapt it adequately to themselves. At the same time, Samson's developing response and that of the reader, and Samson's consolation and that of the reader, must be kept distinct. Samson acquires his solace under the Old Testament dispensation; the reader, under the Christian. The respective consolations do not neces- sarily differ in kind, but more is demanded in terms of the Christian response because more is given (De Doctrina, I, xxvii). The correct Christian response results in "Christian liberty," the power to read "signs" of God's ways in their full significance. Samson gains "prophetic liberty," the Old Testa- ment equipollent of Christian liberty, through learning to read "signs" percipiently and through coming to understand what his visitors are throwing into relief with their verbal parodies. Christian liberty extends and confirms Old Testament pro- phetic liberty; and Milton's later poems show us the kind of</page><page sequence="5">LYNN VEACH SADLER 145 consolatory regeneration, through this special liberty, which was available even under pre-Christian conditions. Milton rejects the Calvinistic doctrine of particular election and sees Christ's redemption as applicable to all men; but only those are renovated who respond, whose "wills be consent- ing." Under the first mode of renovation, a general call is made to all men; and divine impulses partially renew the mind and the will. The second and supernatural mode of re- novation is regeneration, in the process of which the under- standing and will progessively regain the liberty which they exercised before the Fall. The steps are conviction of sin, contrition, confession, departure from evil, and conversion to good. With the accomplishment of this process, the regenerate is justified, absolved of his sin through the gratuitous satis- faction of Christ and so saved through Christ's faith. After justification comes adoption whereby God takes as His chil- dren those who are justified through faith. The result is liberty, even for those under the Law: "From adoption is derived, first, liberty; a privilege which was not unknown to the posterity of Abraham, in virtue of their title as children of God . . . even under the law of bondage. In the spirit of this liberty, they did not scruple even to infringe the cere- monies of religion, when their observance would have been inconsistent with the law of love."4 This liberty is the fulcrum for Samson's actions: his consolation is not regeneration alone but the "prophetic liberty" consonant with regeneration, ac- cording to which liberty he disobeys the Law and takes his own life, as David ate the shewbread. In Book III of Paradise Lost, God sees Satan fly in the direction of earth and tells the Son about the impending Fall; the offer of redemption is volunteered before the Fall actually takes place and its results effected prior to the Passion. Re- generation is made available to those who live before the Crucifixion, with faith as the catalyst through all dispensa- tions. At the beginning of the De Doctrina, Milton says that "it is only to the individual faith of each that the Deity has opened the way of eternal salvation. . . ." The first book of that work is on faith, the knowledge of God. Christian doctrine itself is "that divine revelation disclosed in various ages by 'De Doctrina Christiana (hereafter DD), I, xxiii, The Columbia Milton, XVI, 53.</page><page sequence="6">146 SAMSON AGONISTES Christ (though he was not known under that name in the beginning. . . ." The name Christ, we learn, includes Moses, the Prophets, and the Apostles: Scripture offers salvation to all, under the condition of obedience in the Old Testament and of faith in the New. But obedience is also faith, expressed in legalistic terms. The provision that Adam and Eve not eat of the tree is a "test of fidelity," a "pledge" and "memorial of obedience."6 Moreover, "obedience and love are always the best guides to knowledge, and often lead the way from small beginnings, to a greater and more flourishing degree of pro- ficiency."6 For those who do not know Christ, the ultimate object of faith is God: it ought not to appear wonderful if many, both Jews and others, who lived before Christ, and many also who have lived since his time, but to whom he has never been revealed, should be saved by faith in God alone: still however through the sole merits of Christ, inasmuch as he was given and slain from the begin- ning of the world, even for those to whom he was not known, provided they believed in God the Father. Hence honorable testimony is borne to the faith of the illustrious patriarchs who lived under the law, Abel, Enoch, Noah, &amp;c. though it is expressly stated that they believed only in God. . . . Further, though the Law does not specifically promise the eternal life which is the final consolation of regeneration, it does imply that consolation in the Prophets (DD, I, xxvi). Samson, located in the Book of Judges between the Law and the Prophets, would, for Milton, responsively have to reflect more than the rigid legalism of the Law by virtue of his place in the process of revelation, as well as in accordance with the gift of Christ and the predestination of the regenerate to election even before the Fall. The God of Wrath and Justice appears in Paradise Lost, Book III, when God tells the Son that the resultant alternatives of the Fall are the death of Justice or the death of man. But the commonplace view of Milton's God has been adjusted by Irene Samuel8; and we now recognize that God is accommodat- 'DD, I, x, The Columbia Milton, XV, 115. eDD, I, i, The Columbia Milton, XIV, 25. 7DD, I, xx, The Columbia Milton, XV, 403, 405.

Through the process of accommodation, God allows man to see enough of His ways to gain requisite knowl- edge for his salvation. He accommodates Himself as the God of Wrath when His children have to be recalled to His ways; He presents Himself as the God of Mercy when fear of wrath would drive them to despair. For Milton, God is always both attributes at once-wrath is a merciful instrument of recalling the sinner. Three biblical passages provide the basis for Mil- ton's presentation of God's accommodating ways in Paradise Lost.9 In Genesis 18, Abraham in a "mock debate" with God tries to persuade Him (for the few good men who may dwell there) not to destroy Sodom. This episode is the perfect example of the legalistic Old Testament view of the God of Wrath and offers its corresponding antithetical episode in the Gospel parable of the lost sheep. There is no such distinction for Milton. The "justification" for Abraham's rebuttal is not that he changes the mind of God, but that Abraham's own ideas of justice are clarified, according to God's intention, in the course of the exchange. So also does Moses learn about God's justice in the two remaining episodes. After the making of the golden calf, Moses "persuades" God not to destroy His people; he does so again when all but Caleb and Joshua are against the entry of the Israelites into Canaan. The great dialogue between God and the Son works a similar clarifica- tion, as the emphasis in Books V-VIII and XI-XII of Paradise Lost falls on the response which Adam will make to the accom- modation of God's ways in Raphael's narration and Michael's historical prophecies. "Right reason" is the key by which one responds to such accommodations. The very act of God's accommodating indi- cates that regeneration is not dependent upon a full knowl- edge of God, but upon a correct interpreting of the "signs" and "figures" which He provides. Regeneration is ultimately achieved through the performance of deeds answerable to one's right understanding and right reason: "only add / Deeds to thy knowledge answerable . . . ," Michael tells Adam (XII, 581-582). Adam's loss of Paradise really meant his loss of 9See John E. Parish, "Milton and an Anthropomorphic God," Studies in Philology, LVI (1959), 619-625.</page><page sequence="8">148 SAMSON AGONISTES right reason and, consequently, of his ability to reorient his faculties according to his knowledge of God's ways. He reacts to Michael's account of the tower of Babel as to an example of usurpation and evokes, in turn, a lesson in liberty (XII, 83- 101). Right reason is virtue and right reason gives liberty. Once man loses his right reason, and thence his control over his faculties, God rescues him through the loss of outward liberty-tyranny-so that man may find in that sign his inner sterility. Thus we find Samson and the Israelites under subjection to the Philistines. Tyranny is not merely, then, a manifestation of God's judgment against a nation, nor is the warring of one's faculties a sign of God's casting off of the individual: both are to bring their victims to a realization of their fallings away so that they may try to help themselves and find God's help. Adam and Eve in Paradise were being prepared to go out and people the world. Their faculties were being increased as each day brought choices and the exercise of reason. With the Fall, this progression was shattered. In the De Doctrina, sin is punishable by "four degrees of death." The last two are the death of the body and the eternal punishment of the damned, but the first ones affect the faculties. The first is guiltiness: it "is accompanied or followed by terrors of con- science. . It is attended likewise with the sensible forfei- ture of the divine protection and favor; whence results a diminution of the majesty of the countenance, and a conscious degradation of mind. . . . Hence the whole man becomes polluted . . . whence arises shame." This is the condition of Samson at the beginning of Samson Agonistes, even to the change in physical appearance noticed by the Chorus and Manoa. The second degree of death is called "spiritual death": This death consists, first, in the loss, or at least in the obscuration to a great extent of that right reason which enabled man to discern the chief good, and in which consisted as it were the life of the understand- ing. It consists, secondly, in that deprivation of right- eousness and liberty to do good, and in that slavish subjection to sin and the devil, which constitutes, as it were, the death of the will. All have committed sin in Adam; therefore all are born servants of sin. Lastly, sin is its own punishment, and produces, in its natural</page><page sequence="9">LYNN VEACH SADLER 149 consequences, the death of the spiritual life: more especially gross and habitual sin.'0 At the same time, God includes mercy; some remnants of the divine image are left in man and are not entirely extinguished even in spiritual death. And in the mode of natural renovation, as we have seen, God, through His purpose in Christ, calls all men and renews their minds and wills so that they are led to seek knowledge of God. Before the progressive steps of regeneration can restore man, however, he is dosed with a ration of despair under which his faculties perversely refuse to work together. We see in Paradise Lost and Samson Agonistes the effects of the first two degrees of death brought on by sin. Without regeneration, the last two degrees will follow. Samson Agonistes elaborates, in dramatic terms, a situation compar- able to that of Adam in Book X. Samson's pattern is, in general, the same as Adam's; the Chorus and the other charac- ters function for Samson as Eve for Adam. The pattern is the distortion of experience by the effects of sin and the overcoming of that distortion by regeneration. Before the Fall, man's faculties presented a right, coordinated, and har- monious operation equivalent to recta ratio. After the Fall and with Samson's sin, each of the faculties is distorted and perverted; and so they are in conflict with one another. Adam's soliloquy is ratiocinative-actually an exercise of the abstract- ed and abstracting intellect which has rebelled against imagi- nation and emotion because of the situation into which his responsiveness to Eve has led him." Thus Adam rejects her in an effort on the part of the intellect to force itself from an imagination distorted by willful perversity, fear, and de- spair. The distortions of imagination, along with the perversi- ties of will, have to be corrected in order that the imagination, intellect, and will can cooperate in what is for Milton a truly rational operation of the faculties. The desire to accomplish this return to the initial liberty of man and the rational func- tioning of his faculties is an indication of his responsiveness to God's calling.

In Paradise Regained, the Son undergoes an experi- ence like that of Adam and Samson had their faculties not been distorted by the effects of sin. His offer of redemption is a choice itself; it represents a voluntary act out of love for the Father and for man and an act of obedience to the divine command in its fulfillment of the conditional relationship violated by the Fall. The Son searches the Law and the Prophets in order to learn about his mission (I, 259 ff.). In this way, Milton reemphasizes the relevance of Christ to the Old as well as the New Testament and delineates God's process of Scriptural revelation. He contrasts his interpretation of obedience, its root meaning being "right hearing," with that of his contemporaries (and Milton's Satan) who read it as "submission" to the will of God. The swarming thoughts of the Son (I, 196-200) recall those of Adam and Samson. The Son's "reasonings, though through Mazes," however, do not plunge him into despair. Satan serves in the capacity of Samson's visitors and as Eve functions for Adam: these figures present parodic interpretations (even when well- meaning) of the norm to which "right hearing" is responsive. The Son, unlike Adam and Samson, can learn good by good and does not need Satan's parodic evil to see God's normative ways more plainly. Thus in reply to Satan's "temptation" of power, he can point out that it would do no good to free the Israelites from Rome-who could "of inward slaves make out- ward free?" Samson, too, is confronted with the question of Israel's freedom, but reacts only as the injured champion who has not been instantaneously followed (11. 242 ff.). The Son has considered himself national champion of Israel but has gone beyond that Jewish nationalistic concept of the Messiah to his role in the spiritual liberty of all believers. Man's disobedience-his sin-represents a response which is a caricature or parody of the Son's response in love and obedi- ence. For Adam and Eve, sin was a transgression of the rule of conscience; God had promised that if they persisted, "Light after light well us'd" they would attain and so arrive safely. With the act of disobedience, came evil into the world, where before they had known only good, and were being led pro- gressively by it to a full and right use of their faculties. Milton says that man's answer to God's calling under natural</page><page sequence="11">LYNN VEACH SADLER 151 renovation is referred to by the metaphor of "hearing or hearkening" (hence obedience as "right hearing") and some- times of "tasting." The tasting of the apple becomes the symbolic parody of the response to God's calling. All evil is parodic, polluting the good upon which it works. But God, according to Milton, is always turning evil to good ends such that evil at once suggests both God's mercy and His wrath. Nature is vitiated or polluted with man's Fall to make him aware of his need for grace, not simply to punish him. Fallen nature, without grace, becomes a parody of prelapsarian na- ture. Without the prophets, the Law is only a parody of the Gospel. In Samson Agotistes, Manoa and the Chorus, because they speak under the Law alone, and Dalila, because she speaks under the corrupt law of nature and of nations, give inadequate and parodic consolations, as Samson's stance of Greek hero who will expiate his crime through suffering is parodic because it responds to God's justice alone. Satan undergoes the same process of introspection as Adam, Samson, and the Son of Paradise Regained. Like the first two, he assumes the posture of a romantic, victimized hero. In Book IV, 11. 32 ff. of Paradise Lost, he examines his own free will and speaks against Destiny, which has made him superior to other angels and so subject to ambition. He imaginatively recreates his fall by recognizing that had he been inferior, he would have leagued himself with another aspirant. He hy- pothesizes about the possibilities of available grace and goes through the motions of chastizing himself for not affording God praise, simple enough return for his creation "in that bright eminence." Unable to accept the picture of himself as disobeying just commands and as failing to acknowledge due gratitude, Satan images God as a tyrant and becomes the Promethean hero rebelling against an unjust ruler, as many critics have noted. Thus he excuses his own action with necessity, the "tyrants plea," and the same label which the Chorus ascribes to Samson's death (11. 1665-66). For a re- sponsive audience, moreover, the tyranny which Satan thrusts upon God is a parody of the tyranny which God sends to men as a "sign" that they must recall themselves to Him. And even Satan is provided with "signs": he is attracted by light and the sun (III, 572-573; IV, 29, 33-34). Before he enters Paradise, he is met by "purer air" which inspires in his heart</page><page sequence="12">152 SAMSON AGONISTES "Vernal delight and joy able to drive/ All sadness but despair" (IV, 155-156), signs offering comparison with Samson's "choice of Sun or shade" and with his contrasting of prison and "heaven-born" air. He is provided with the same instru- ment, conscience, which is given man (IV, 23); and he has, from Abdiel, a reminder that God will pardon the sinner (V, 845-848) as well as an alternative action from one in a similar situation. Still, he ironically sits in the form of a cormorant on the Tree of Life, using it for prospect and failing to "value right" the "good" before him (IV, 198-204). Milton uses Satan's response to God's ways as a parodic method of negative clarification for men trying to discern their own right responses; Satan's is a caricature of the Son's response. He is the type of "hardness of heart," the inability to think rationally (in Milton's sense of the word, with all the faculties functioning together), to see beyond the surface of experience where things seem to signify either God's wrath or His mercy. It is the failure or the unwillingness or the refusal to understand the ways of God through the signs which He provides for us. Satan sees evil and good as absolutes, not evil as the parody of good. He opposes his own reality, illusion, to God's reality.12 It is he who insists that the only way to know good is through knowing evil (IV, 895-896, 930-934; IX, 690 ff.). He has no conception of the consoling truth of God's ways in the fallen world, with evil now being turned to good use as God in mercy allows it to display itself before men, so that they can use their faculties and respond to it as it reflects the pattern of good it seeks to offset. In Paradise Regained, Satan pretends that he serves God through the testing of God's chosen and through hardening the hearts of those whom God would cast off (I, 368-377), while he is literally serving God through his parody of the way by which God turns evil to good ends, as the Son tells Satan (I, 442-453). Consistently in Paradise Regained, Satan does not deliberately distort but actually misreads the same signs which lead the Son to inter- pret his mission correctly. In Paradise Lost, he does not under- stand the judgment placed on him when the Son pronounces the Covenant of Grace but returns to his crew with a "See John M. Steadman, "Image and Idol: Satan and the Element of Illusion in Paradise Lost," Journal of English and Germanic Philology, LIX (1960), 640-654.</page><page sequence="13">LYNN VEACH SADLER 153 literal rendering of what he has heard: "A World who would not purchase with a bruise,/ Or much more grievous pain?" (X, 500-501). The passage is like Samson's "And for a life who will not change his purpose?" (1. 1406). Samson for the first time does not desire death, but neither does he as yet realize that God has called him to life through death; Satan thinks that he has gained a world when his doom has just been pronounced. The stupidity of Satan in confronting God's signs and the efficaciousness of God's signs are shown in the serpent form to which Satan and his devils are changed, the image of the creature he has polluted from the end of its creation. Their insatiable appetites send them climbing the forbidden tree, imaginatively multiplied and thus itself a reinforcement of Satan's Adam-like perversion of imagination. They taste only "bitter ashes," at once a symbolic reversal of the metaphor of calling as tasting and an ironic counterpart to ashes as the traditional emblem of contrition and to the "fierie vertue rouz'd/ From under ashes into sudden flame" in Samson Agonistes. In a poem justifying the ways of God to men, the serpent poses a problem: it is an innocent creature vitiated by Satan, yet it suffers in the judgment. But the serpent is not simply cursed, as Samson's visitors are not simply sent to debase him-both readings are applicable to the God of Justice only. The gloss for the serpent symbolism is biblical. In Ex- odus 4, the rod of Moses, when cast on the ground becomes a serpent; but, taken up in faith, it becomes the rod of God. In Numbers 21, God sends fiery serpents to chastize the chil- dren of Israel. When they repent, He has Moses make a fiery serpent and put it on a pole so that any man bitten can look upon it and get well. Milton himself speaks of the brazen serpent as a "type of Christ" (DD, II, v), and this view is shared by others of his period, though with no offering, like Milton's, of the serpent as "sign" in its capacity for educating man in God's ways of recalling and renewal.13 Similarly, "E.g., William Guild, Moses Unveiled; Or, Those Figures Which Served Unto the pattern and shadow of heavenly things, pointing out the Messiah Christ Jesus . . .

Even that highly critically suspect image of Samson as an "ev'ning dragon" assumes appropriateness alongside another biblical text: "I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee" (Revelation 3:3). Regeneration is dependent upon the ability to perceive God as the God of Justice and of Mercy simultaneously, as right reason responds to the dual symbolism of the serpent symbol. Until Samson and Adam begin to see intimations of God's mercy operative and to believe that He does not cast off forever, they are paralyzed in their efforts to change their situations. We tend to take the same view as Samson and Adam: in order to offset a harsh description of God's ways, as He seems only the God of Wrath, we sometimes read Adam and Eve as "spotted" before the Fall.14 As has often been pointed out, Eve's awakening contains allusions to the Narcis- sus, Apollo, and Daphne myths; Adam tells Raphael of Eve's power over him; Eve is induced to dream by Satan. But both Adam and Eve are quickly corrected in direction. Their re- sponses are intuitive, natural; Eve at first prefers the image in the pool but is gently swayed by Adam, as the man is to direct the woman. Adam and Eve must have free choice in order to assure emotional and intellectual maturity. Thus both are responsible for initiatory acts leading to the Fall: Adam in his impercipient handling of Eve's request to work alone; Eve, in her responding to Adam's treatment. Each has accepted the immediate alternative of action without considering the atti- A Pisgah-Sight of Palestine . . .

But, for Milton, each has at this point made enough progress to decide correctly. They are not "flawed"; rather, they misuse the right reason God has provided. A similar failure of right reason causes Samson's misinterpretation and, indeed, misuse of his role as savior of his people. The "tongue batteries" to which he is subsequently made liable, he learns, are not casually-related punishments but parodic identifications of the "seal of silence" which he has wrong-headedly broken. Samson Agonistes, then, is an exemplary mimetic represen- tation of the regenerative pattern of religious experience as the later Milton understood it. From this standpoint, it is more relevant than has been indicated to two of the most current approaches of Milton studies: regenerative and typological interpretations. Recent criticism has been concerned with the basic question of Samson's regeneration and with the sense (often a mystical Christian sense) in which Samson is a type of Christ. Too limited in these assessments is an acknowl- edgement of the particular value of Samson Agonistes as a study in Milton's perceptions of the dispensatory revelation of God's ways and of the psychology of religious experience. In addition to the poem's revealing Samson's way back to God, the protagonist as an Old Testament figure reveals Milton's views of the continuity of religious experience. Samson Agonistes mimetically reproduces in its own terms the Christian liberty which Milton saw as the consolation, the "Paradise within," of the regenerate. It turns to the process of regeneration for the individual from the doctrinal basis established in De Doctrina Christiana and from the mimetic representation of that process in Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained. Decorum prohibits speaking of "Christian" liberty in reference to an Old Testament figure. Instead, Sam- son wins his way to individual or prophetic liberty or "regen- erative consolation" through the discipline of despair and through his active and gradual responsiveness to the visitors who confront him with traditional consolatory alternatives. The question of what Samson's renewal of a right relationship with God has in common with that of all men, under the Mosaic or under any other kind of dispensation, calls forth the problem of what Milton sees linking historical dispensa- tions and permitting them to serve continuously as consoling</page><page sequence="16">156 SAMSON AGONISTES revelations of God's ways. This problem is focused in Samson Agonistes in terms of the sense in which Samson is a type, not alone a "shadow" or an "adumbration" of Christ but a type of regenerative religious experience responsive to God's ways as put to pattern in Christ.
