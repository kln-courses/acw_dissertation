<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AXIOLOGICAL THEISM OF A. E. TAYLOR PROIFSSOR CHARLES F. SAWHILL VIRTUE I TAYLOR'S AXIOLOGICAL THEISM IF a rational argument is to be advanced for the existence of God, it must be some form of the cosmological, depending on the concept of causation, or the ontological, an elaboration of the concept of being. The metaphysical fertility of the axiological approach to theism consists in its reformulation of the ontological argument-viz., that the nature of existent reality itself is indicative of supranatural being. While the Platonic studies of the late Professor A. E. Taylor have been more warmly received than his axiological speculations, it may yet be that his analysis of the nature of value experience and its implications for metaphysics will prove of equal worth. If logical positivism or a blank existentialism are not to have the last word, then a realistic theory of value must be established. It is the thesis of this paper that Professor Taylor's objectivistic axiology is such a defensible theory. In an essay entitled "The Vindication of Religion," Taylor argues that no naturalistic explanation of the universe can ever get beyond collocations; that the duality of "law" (causal connections) and "facts" (collocations) is such that either nature is not explicable at all or must be explained by something "outside" on which nature depends. Thus we reach the conclusion that either the very principles which inspire and guide science itself are an illusion, or nature itself must be dependent upon some reality which is self-explanatory, and therefore not nature, but in the strictest sense of the words, "supernatural" or "transcendent"-trans- cendent, that is, in the sense that in it there is overcome that duality of "law" and "fact" which is characteristic of every part of nature. It is not "brute" fact, and yet it is not an abstract universal law or a complex of such laws, but a really existent self-luminous Being, such that you could see, if you only apprehended its true character, that to have that character and to be are the same thing. This statement of the problem of theism is in the Anselmian ontological, rather than the Aristotelian cosmological, tradition. It is concerned with the intelligible nature of a Being combining causal efficacy and a determinate character-i.e., standards of value. 1 Essays Catholic and Critical, edited by Gordon Selwyn, London, Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1926, p. 55. IIO</page><page sequence="2">THE AXIOLOGICAL THEISM OF A. E. TAYLOR While it need not be assumed that value as such can give rise to existence, yet if value judgments are not completely relativistic, then "in the last resort . . . the raison d'etre of any fact must be a value," and the reason for the totality of being must be absolute value., Taylor's whole argument may be summarized as follows: In an organic, hierarchized universe, the explanation of any individual, or any realm of being,or any level of reality is to be found in its dominant features, viz., its values. Value, though it transcends the temporal, is not its own complete explanation; nor is it, though it may account for the direction of the becoming of any actual process, the only sufficient explanation of being. Being and value together constitute the "sufficient reason," the "intelligible explanation," the raison d'etre, of all that is. Temporal-spatial actuality is not its own explanation, since it is informed by moral (and other) values not derivative from simply temporal process; it is dependent on a higher, more real, more ultimate reality, which is the ground of becoming and is also the end toward which it, as an increasingly valuable "organism" (or complex individual process) tends. This reality cannot be purely conceptual, abstract, or ideal. Nor can it be the universe as a perfect whole, for then becoming-i.e., actual history- would be only a sham. It must be,, therefore, a real being, distinct from the rest of reality, and that which determines all other being. The existence of such a being is, while not demonstrable, an intel- ligible explanation of the actual becoming that constitutes the historical reality of the universe. Ultimate reality, being utterly good, must be out-going, expansive. It must, in fact, be creative, appreciative, loving mind, intelligently bringing into actuality that which is worthy to be.3 As Timaeus says in Plato, the very reason why there is a world of creatures at all is that the All-good is wholly free from O0dvos, the "dog-in-the-manger" spirit which seeks to engross felicity to itself, and therefore makes the creatures for His goodness to flow out upon. He cannot be wholly blessed, except in blessing. 3 Taylor's axiological argument for theism is thus a re-statement of the Platonic-Aristotelian-Scholastic doctrine that value is objectively real and that the sufficient reason for a value-charged universe must combine in itself goodness and being. It is consciously and intention- ally pre-Kantian in orientation, and is maintained with full aware- ness of the nature of positivistic criticism of the objectivity of value-experience.

III</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY II THE DEVELOPMENT OF TAYLOR'S THOUGHT Taylor's two early books, The Problem of Conduct (I9oI) and The Elements of Metaphysics (I903), present a type of voluntaristic personalistic idealism not unlike that of Josiah Royce. Value is considered as wholly subjective and relative. In The Problem of Conduct Taylor says: In order to guard against any possible misconceptions, it is well to insist in the plainest terms at our disposal upon the purely "relative" character of all worth or value whatsoever. "Absolute" worth is, if you take the term at all strictly, no better than a flat contradiction. To say that a thing has "worth" or "value" means no more than that there exists beings to whom the posses- sion and ultimately the enjoyment of the thing in question affords pleasure.' Even more specifically, Taylor asserts: Things have worth for us because they meet our wants.2 It is for empirical psychology to say what qualities are and what are not of "absolute" worth for human beings.3 This empirical view, later expressly repudiated by Taylor,4 is, of course, very similar to Perry's satisfaction-of-interest theory,5 and is practically identical with D. H. Parker's dictum: What I ought to do is what such a system (of desires) wants to do.6 The ethical implications of this view, as worked out in The Problem of Conduct, are most instructive as showing the circularity and inner contradictions of such an axiology. Not only does it fail to provide practical moral guidance, it is involved in unsolvable dilemmas.7 Taylor falls back on Bradley's formula, "my station and its duties"8 as giving "the nearest approach that morality possesses to a coherent ideal,"9 realizing all the while that it is as theoretically indefensible as it is practically necessary. This empirical theory of value is at the opposite pole to that of The Faith of A Moralist, whose author could write: Our geometrical knowledge may be very much clearer and more articulate than our knowledge of life and sentience, and this again much clearer and I Loc. cit., p.

E. TAYLOR better articulated than our knowledge of our own moral being, which is, as Shelley said, "a mystery even to ourselves." And yet it may well be that, for all its dimness, it is just this knowledge which brings us most directly into contact with the very heart of reality.' Taylor surely had his own intellectual and spiritual development in mind when he commented on Fichte's saying, "The kind of philosopher one is depends upon the kind of man one is," that, while the saying is true, it is even more true that we do not know clearly and surely, but only discover gradually what our true natures are. Taylor's philosophic pilgrimage led from his early rationalistic agnosticism, through the gradual analysis of rationality, to the acceptance of an a priori element in experience, and through a steadily deepening insight into the nature and implications of pur- posiveness, to his final Christian-Platonic philosophy, in which human purposiveness is held to be a phase of the value-reality of a temporal order having its roots in an eternal order which is deter- mined by an eternal being. III KNOWLEDGE OF VALUE The Gifford Lectures, I926-27 and I927-28, gave Professor Taylor the stimulus and the opportunity to work out a "natural theology" for the Christian faith he so devoutly held. He spoke as a moralist, "who took morality seriously" and generalized his moral theory into an objective axiology with metaphysical implications. The acuteness of his axiological analysis seems to have been somewhat obscured, perhaps by objection to other parts of the Lectures, such as his special doctrine of the Church. His theory of value, however, can stand on its own feet quite apart from the details of the traditional Christian dogmas with which Taylor associated it. It is, in fact, one of the most cogent statements of a realistic theory yet made. It is objectivistic, what John Laird2 termed "timocratic," W. M. Urban3 "axiological." It is similar to A. N. Whitehead's4 objectivistic rela- tivism, but more explicit in its distinction between being and value and in its characterization of value. It is in sharp contrast to R. B. Perry's5 interest-centred neo-realism, which is naturalistic and ultimately subjectivistic, and is in outright opposition to D. W. Prall's6 and D. H. Parker's7 naturalistic subjectivistic relativism.

H II3</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY Taylor's theory is realistic as contrasted with Nicolai Hartmann'sI phenomenological theory. It is nearer to the Platonic idealistic tradition than is Laird's timocratic theory because it is more inti- mately related to mind. On the other hand, it is more realistic than Urban's idealistic axiology, though Urban himself holds that his own view is "above the idealistic-realistic battle." Finally Taylor's thought is hardly touched by modern instrumentalism and simply ignores contemporary logical positivism. Taylor explains that his theory of knowledge is "essentially Thomistic, but with what a Thomist would probably regard a leaning toward an outrd realism."; He argues that we know the object of our knowledge directly, without the intervention of any tertium quid. "The form of lapideity," he says, "as it exists in the eye" and "the form of lapideity as it exists in the stone"3 are not numerically identical, and yet the form is the same in both instances. While value is not a form of the same order as lapideity, it is none the less characteristic of acts and events, and can be known by mind. "The 'disinterested spectator'," writes Taylor, "recognizes the already existing goodness of the act he rightfully approves, he does not bestow the value on the act by his approving contemplation."4 Taylor's epistemological realism is thus matched by a meta- physical realism. The epistemological argument is buttressed by two claims both pointing to the inseparability of value and existence. The first argument is that we never experience value without fact or fact without value.5 We distinguish these categories by reflective analysis; but any value we experience is always embodied in a here-now complex. Further, any real goodness we value is the activity of a real individual. Only by abstraction, and for logical purposes are values considered as universals. Values are always concrete. They are not subsistent universals. In the second place, Taylor argues, we find no separation between "facts" which are given and "valuations" which are "put on" the facts. The facts and the values are given together; or rather, we have always "facts-in-valuation," never mere facts in isolation, nor mere valuation. This is the hard core of Taylor's realism, rejecting alike the objective idealism of Hartmann's otherwise admirable analysis of value and the subjectivism of naturalists like Perry. Values are not "after-thoughts" or "psychic additions" of our own personal creation: And to myself it seems clear, again, that the beauty of the rose is no more read into, or added to, the fact of the rose than its colour. Both are, in the first instance, found, not brought, though, as the colour seems not to be found I Nicolai Hartmann, Ethics, 3 Vols., Translated by Stanley Coit, Macmillan, New York, 1932. 2 The Faith, Vol. I, p. 58. 3 Ibid., p. 42. 4 Ibid., p. 43. 5 Op. cit., p. 38. I4</page><page sequence="6">THE AXIOLOGICAL THEISM OF A. E. TAYLOR except by creatures with eyes, so the beauty, too, is not found by the man who has not the "inner eye" by which beauty is discerned. . . . Now all this seems to be no less true of our moral "ideals." As I do not add either the tints or the beauty of the rose or the sunset de meo to a rose or a sunset "given" without beauty, or even without colour, find the colour or the beauty in the given, so I do not by an "act of valuation," make Jonathan's affection for David or the self-devotion of Mettus Curtius, the humility of St. Francis, or the patient labour of Darwin good; I find the goodness there in them.I This analysis of the knowing-situation leaves many questions unanswered; but it does have the merit of insisting on a realistic distinction between the known and "the as yet undifferentiated continuum of the known-and-interacted-with."z Taylor argues shrewdly against any atomistic sensory theory of discrete sensa put together by mind. He also argues that it is impossible to draw any hard-and-fast line between perception and interpretation. Finally, he asserts that valuation is an integral part of the process of knowing. Acts are, he asserts "objectively good, exactly as iron is hard and lead soft."3 This view seems at first glance identical with that of G. E. Moore, viz., that good is a quality like the quality yellow; but it is not identical, for Taylor holds-or at least, his theory implies-that good is an objective predicate recognized, rather than an attribute perceived. His view is, in this regard, exactly that of Urban, who asserts: If the (axiological) view is adopted ... we shall cease to contrast judgments of reality with value judgments in any absolute sense.4 This statement must not be taken to mean, at least in regard to Taylor's theory, that value and being are identical. It means that they are equally real. Taylor goes on to assert: The really given is a whole situation which includes ourselves, with our definite endowment of more or less coherent schemes of value, our hopes and fears, our choices and avoidances. The history of man is no tale of the super- imposition of an edifice of "mental construction" on a basis of mere giveness. It is the story of the gradual clarification and progressive definition of appre- hensions, contacts with the "given," cognitive and practical alike, which have been there all along in vague and implicit form, in any life we can recognize as qualitatively of a piece with our own. 5 If this be so, he concludes, it is arbitrary to assume that knowledge of, e.g., physical structure, throws light on the general character of reality, but that knowledge of aesthetic, moral and religious being do not. The most illuminating insights into the character of the real are not necessarily the most distinct. Our notions of the good may be more confused than our notions of geometrical structure, but this The Faith, Vol. I, p. 60. I Op. cit., p. 58. 3 Ibid., p. 6I. 4 Urban, W. M., The Intelligible World, p. 157. 5 The Faith, I, pp. 64-5. II5</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY is no warrant for supposing that the good is any less deeply ingrained in the real or any less pervasive than spatial determination. IV VALUE AS WHAT OUGHT TO BE Value, then, for Taylor is objective. It characterizes objects known by mind. It is not added to being by mind. It is there, in the world. But what is it ? What is value ? Taylor's answer is that value is what ought to be. The good act, Taylor says, is the act that ought to be done. It is not its oughtness, however, that makes it good. To say that it is good because it ought to be is to make goodness, or generic value, deriva- tive from a subtype of goodness, ethical value. The goodness gener- ates the oughtness. The act ought to be done because it is good. Kant erred, Taylor holds, in confining his attention to the single act rather than "the So-sein which reveals itself in the performance."I This So-sein is the character of the moral agent. Though Kant was trying to avoid metaphysical assumptions, the basic principle of his theory, Taylor argues, leads from doing to being, for on Kant's theory, an act is of absolute and intrinsic worth only when it is revelatory of a character or quality of a doer who is its free cause. The ultimate moral imperative is, therefore, not "do this," but "be this." If the ultimate good is a good will, the nature of morality, says Taylor, is not accurately conceived in Kant's "What acts ought I to do ?" but is really "What manner of man ought I to be ?" Nietzsche's injunction, Werde der du bist, is thus the perfect expression for the supreme "categorical imperative" ... if only we are careful to remember from the first that I do not at the outset know wer or was ich bin. I am a riddle to myself, and it is only in the process of the Werden that I slowly and painfully gain some insight into my Sein.2 Moral process is thus activity of a free agent who is becoming more and more what it is his nature to be. Moral process is becoming, a change in value. It is true to say that a man is (in part) what he ought to be when he is becoming what he ought to be, but such a statement is incomplete and circular unless it be recognized that he ought to be good. When I speak of the good as satisfactory I mean that which contents men who are what they ought to be and will content me when I am what I ought to be. 3 I The Faith, I, p. 67. 2 Ibid., p. 68. 3 Ibid., p. I04, fn. Taylor was quite sensitive on this point, since it involved, if not an abandonment, at least a re-interpretation, of his earlier position. Several times in the Gifford Lectures, Taylor quotes Wordsworth. Might he not here also be echoing the Prelude ? Cf. Book I, lines 348-49, "The calm existence that is mine when I Am worthy of myself." iI6</page><page sequence="8">THE AXIOLOGICAL THEISM OF A. E. TAYLOR The transition from value as what satisfies men who are what they ought to be to value as what actually ought to be is a subtle one requiring analysis beyond the limits of this discussion. We will only note that the transition depends on the validity of the realistic epistemology being presented here, with its concomitant meta- physical assumption of the intimate association of value and fact in the actual world. Being and value are ultimate ontological predicates, irreducible to each other or to any other categories, inseparable but not identical, related to each other by the further category of what ought to be, a category so related to both being and value that it can be a bond between them. Holding that only individuals are real, Taylor avoids a nominalistic pluralism by asserting that an individual cannot be defined in isolation, nor in purely temporal and spatial terms. If we meditate the reasons which have led Professor Whitehead to make a sharp distinction between events and objects and to insist that location and date belong properly to events, to objects only secondarily in virtue of their "ingredience" into events, we might even be led to the view that individuality is precisely the feature in things which resists our attempts to locate and date it.' Translating Whitehead's language back into Taylor's more usual use of terms, this passage means that an individual (what Whitehead calls an event) is an individual not because it is spatially and tempor- ally distinct from other individuals, but because it is a locus for different values. Since values have more than one sort of being, or since their becoming implies an equivocal, rather than a univocal, reference to being, the presence of the values is not definable in any one temporal or spatial mode. A moral act must be a genuine histori- cal event with a definite time and space locus or it is not a real becoming. But the morality of the act is not limitable to that event, nor to the sum total of all events. Moral value thus transcends temporality, not as Kant thought, by referring to extrinsic conse- quences, but intrinsically, of its very nature. Not only moral value, but every value points beyond its concrete embodiment to eternal being. Their validity, their right to be, is eternal. Man has his own value, but as a part of the larger organism of the actual world, his are not the only values that are real. The objective axiological order is supra-individual, supra-social and supra-human. The zeorld ought to be, is worthy to be, and ought to be better than it is. Op. cit., p. 54. II7</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY V A VALUE-CHARGED UNIVERSE The one real world, says Taylor, is "a hierarchized, or many- levelled whole." To be understood, it must be grasped on all its levels. The notion that a human being is "four buckets of water and a bagful of salts" is a gross over-simplification. Taylor cites as an illustration of the failure to attain an adequate view of the actual - The mot which defines a violin solo as "the dragging of the tail of a dead horse across the intestines of a dead cat."' This, he argues, is to leave out the melody and its beauty. In the real world there are both dead brutes and beauty, not merely together, but in organic relationship. If the aesthetic values aimed at and achieved by the musician are the dominant characteristics of the violin solo, we understand the event only when we consider it from the Platonic point of view, as one in which b&amp;vayKr) (necessity) is the Vnr7pelrtlg (servant) of v6vQ; or yet again to speak with Aristotle, when the event is contemplated in the light of the end which gives it its characteristic form.3 Value is not the only determining factor in actual events. If it were, monistic idealism would be the only tenable metaphysics. There is avayicyK-the irreducible giveness of brute existence. But value may be the dominant factor. If the world is a telelogical organic whole, then value is logically prior to actuality and co- ordinate with being. It is real, but its reality cannot be an existence, but an objective, subject to acknowledgment. Value is neither a relation between a cognizing subject and an object cognized, nor a quality of things, but a unique ontological predicate like being, and related to being as what ought to be.3 If the "ideals of reason" are genuine aspects of reality, then the universe is an intelligible rational whole. Taylor holds that belief in the rationality of the universe is, while indemonstrable, a reasonable 1 Op. cit., p. 356. 2 Ibid., p. 363. s Taylor does not discuss the problem of evil adequately. His doctrine of time, however, as the becoming of what ought to be, or the ceasing to be of what ought to be (positive or negative change in value) makes it possible to avoid the simple identification of what is with what ought to be and to admit that there is a great deal that is not as it ought to be. This doctrine of time also makes impossible the sophistical denial of evil involved in the idealistic assertion that the whole is as it ought to be. The whole is as it ought to be only in the sense that reality is a purposive process becoming more fully what it is only in part; and this doctrine would hold (though Taylor does not make this point) even when the whole suffers genuine setbacks, as it may in periods of moral and cultural recession, provided only that there be significant factors striving as they ought to strive. II8</page><page sequence="10">THE AXIOLOGICAL THEISM OF A. E. TAYLOR faith. Such a belief does not mean that the universe is wholly intel- ligible without remainder. It does mean, however, that the apparently irrational given can be progressively narrowed down so that in the case of an ideal intelligence other than that of the Creator, the unintelligible remainder would be functional-i.e., an ideal limit- rather than actual. It must be remembered that Taylor includes among the "ideals of reason" the intelligible, but strictly non-logical, organizations of value in aesthetic and moral experience. He acknowledges the validity of Otto's notion of religious experience as awareness of a Wholly-Other, but says that Otto's tendency to divorce this experi- ence from the moral and the aesthetic partially vitiates his account. As the rationality of the universe is, at the last, an article of the faith of a "reasonable," not a fanatical, rationalist, so belief in the objec- tivity of value is not based on final demonstration, but rests on faith in the veridicality of value judgments; and the belief that the objective system of values culminates in a Being combining absolute value and absolute being is a further step of faith. The notion that whereas religion makes the demand for faith in the beyond and dimly descried, morality does not, but is a matter of walking in the full daylight, can arise only when we mistakenly think of moral virtue as being nothing more than the routine practice of a set of duties which are perfectly familiar to us all, from our inheritance of social rules and traditions.' The life of genuine morality is always something indefinitely more than this. In truth, with every step taken toward a life of more habitual loyalty to known duty ... we also discern new and unexpected duties.... Every self-surrender not only receives its reward in the enrichment of the personality we had set on the hazard, it also points the way to undreamed-of greater surrenders ... and compliance with the new demands "costs" more than compliance with the old. The way of life does not merely begin as a via crucis, it remains a via crucis all through. The attempt to walk that road simply in my own strength is as likely to be fatal to my moral being if I make it late as if I make it early. Morality itself when taken in earnest, thus leads direct to the same problems about "grace" and "nature," "faith" and "works," with which we are familiar in the history of Christianity.a This passage has been quoted at length because it distinguishes Taylor's moralistic theism sharply from that of Immanuel Kant. Both theories rest upon faith in the veridicality of moral insight; but for Taylor, moral judgments are not merely objective, in the sense of humanly universal, but are realistic. Moreover, Taylor's profound sense of the deepening of the genuine moral consciousness, and its increasingly tragic cost is nowhere matched in the high-minded, but somehow pedantic, moralism of Kant. I Notice the explicit repudiation of Bradley's formula which Taylor accepted in The Problem of Conduct. D The Faith, I, pp. 223-24. II9</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY VI THE TEMPORAL AND THE SUPRA-TEMPORAL We have, then, to deal with the doctrine that real historical process depends upon eternal structure more real than temporal process.I Such a distinction between grades of reality can be made, Taylor argues, only upon a value basis. Passage of time, he asserts, is associated with change in value, not merely, as in classical mechanics, with change in configuration. Even in the domain of the physical, process is constituted by successions which exhibit pervasive "universal" characters or pattern, events in which, in the terminology of Whitehead, objects, that is universals in re, are situated, becomings which in the significant language of Plato are yeveaesi etg ovalav. Still less is any morally significant act a mere event which happens.' If values actually are, as Taylor believes, the dominant features of the real, then time, as the form of change, is not mere successive- ness, but transition in value (not necessarily nothing but transition in value) in which the "not yet" and the "no longer" are distinguish- able from, but in some sense integral to, the now. Only if this be true can an act be part of a larger pattern, which is what it must be if it be historical. Unless one instant be internally related to another, obligation for the future and responsibility for the past are meaning- less. Time presents a unity-in-difference, and the difference is one of value, for the essential nature of moral process is change in value. But the unity is also one of value; the differences define a unified pattern of value being actualized in temporal process. The nature of time is thus in both its transitoriness and its continuity closely bound up with the reality of value. Becoming (temporal process) is neither ultimate, as in naturalism, nor unreal, as in absolute idealism; it is real, but not ultimate. Time is subordinate to and dependent upon eternity. All value experience is the process of actualizing what has not previously been real; it is the coming into being of what ought to be, the doing of what ought to be done (or else the perishing of concrete value, the ceasing to be of what is good). If we already are what we ought to be-if, as the naturalist asserts, "what I ought to do is what such a system of desires (as I am) wants to do" ;3 if in Kantian terms, there is no difference between "duty" and "inclination," even when they coincide-then such a view of value experience as this is I Taylor argues parenthetically that his doctrine of eternity is implicit in any realistic theory of metaphysical causality. 2 Op. cit., p. 68. 3 D.

But if, as Taylor argues, we will not merely that the course of things shall be different, but that we ourselves shall be different,' then we are willing genuine change impossible to a creature wholly temporal and unnecessary to a being wholly eternal. In his essay, "The Vindication of Religion," Taylor makes a slightly different point: Whoever says "ought" meaning "ought" is in the act bearing witness to the supernatural and the supra-temporal. . . . Only to a being who has in his structure the adaptation to the eternal can you significantly say, "You ought."3 Taylor's statement of the realistic moral argument for the eternal nature of the self, and hence the eternal reality of the value-charged universe, presents the full axiological argument at its best, not the Kantian truncated form of the moral argument which brings in deity and eternity as necessary mechanism for an external balancing of the scales of cosmic justice. Man's moral life is explicable only as a response to a supra-human supernatural reality. As man responds, moreover, he shares in the goodness of this transcendent reality; he is thus not merely what he (naturally) is, but is also what he (ideally) aspires to. His morality is not merely instrumental to other values; it is itself an ideal achievement. Life, to the moral hero, is more worth-while, more interesting, more valuable than is even the best life of the purely natural man-a theme which Taylor repeats in his last book, The Christian Hope of Immortality. It is good in itself to be courageous and unselfish; to be so is to begin to enter into the joy of the Lord. "What is the chief end of man?" asks the Shorter Catechism, and answers: "The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever." All moral experience thus finds its sanction in supratemporal moral standards. Moreover, moral experience actually demands progress toward, and ultimate participation in, absolute good. To be satisfied with a personality less than the best, as John Laird has said, is to be less than moral. Hence morality demands eternity, not as a reward (as Kant weakly conceded to the Utili- tarians) but as a compresent condition of its own rationality. Here is another form of the ontological argument. Moral experience then, taken seriously requires an object itself good, complete and whole, so that in possessing it we are possessing that which absolutely satisfies the heart's desire and can never be taken from us.3 If the moral effort of man is veridical and is not I The Faith, I, p.

We must be able to look forward to the supreme good, and to having it in perpetuity. But in such fruition our own being would have been lifted above the level of successiveness; we should ourselves have passed from temporality to eternity. Hence morality must be in its innermost essence "otherworldly." VII VALUE AND GOD Absolute eternal good is the end of human aspiration. It is also the source and sustainer of the aspiration by which man puts off his first merely self-contained and temporarily confined self-hood. God, that is, to use language technical in the thought of Christianity, must be conceived not only as Creator, but as Redeemer and Sanctifier.2 Since man is a moral-i.e., a free-agent, he can be "converted" only of his own free will; and yet, if he is to rise above temporality, the impulse must come from without. The Augustinian solution of the problem, which Taylor accepts, is that God Himself is the lumen intellectus.3 This, Taylor argues, is The only solution of the difficulty. ... We know our true good, which is no other than God Himself, by obscure, but none the less real and impressive personal contacts with God. Without this real contact with the eternal, the process of winning a true personality could not be begun.... From its humblest beginnings that (the moral) life is, at every step, one of transformation into the likeness of that which we contemplate.4 Taylor's axiological argument for theism in a sentence is this: The nature of temporal value experience is such as to be explicable only upon the assumption that it is grounded in a non-temporal, perfect Being, the most real of beings, the absolute and primary source of actuality, and the most perfect of beings, so good that none better can be conceived. This pushes the problem of the relation of value and being back one step further, placing it in their common source, God. To speak of God as the source of being is, of course, paradoxical. God must be to be the source of anything. It is absurd to characterize anything as its own source. God, Taylor holds, is the source-the cause-of all I The Faith, I, p. I05. Taylor does not press the point, but the same argu- ment holds for the intellectual search for truth and the aesthetic desire for beauty. This is an axiological, not a merely moral argument. a Ibid, pp. 233-34. 3 Ibid., p. 238. 4 Ibid., p. 239. 122</page><page sequence="14">THE AXIOLOGICAL THEISM OF A. E. TAYLOR being other than Himself. In the same way, God is good by nature. His goodness is not the cause or source of His own good activity, but is the cause-the reason for, the referent, the criterion of measure- ment-of all other goodness. The relation between the complex of finite goods and the absolute good of God is analogous to the relation between the causal network of finite beings and God's being as the final cause. Goodness is related to being as what ought to be; to say that God is as He ought to be is not to assert that there are antecedent or external conditions determining what or how God ought to be. God conforms to no form or pattern superior in meaning to Himself, either in His being or in His creative activity. In terms of scholastic theology, God's will is free, but since it is good, not capricious or arbitrary. God is His will, Deus est suum velle. When once we understand that this distinction (between God and His will) can have no place within the being of God, it seems to make no real difference whether we say that God produced creatures by an act of free will, or, with Spinoza, that he produces them "by the law of his own nature," since in God, who is the absolute prius, there can be no distinction between Deus and deitas, such as there is in us, who are always in fieri, between the man and the humanity he is ever "putting on" but has never fully put on. ... My objection to Spinoza's formula would be based not on what it asserts, but on what it denies. It asserts, truly as it seems to me, that God acts "by the law of his own nature," but falsely sets such action in God in opposition to "free action," as though the complete identity of voluntas and natura were not itself the very ideal of perfect freedom.' In this distinction Taylor is clarifying a problem that has plagued Christian thought from patristic days, the problem of the relation between God's will as ultimate cause and His will as final standard. It is one thing to say that all things are in consequence of God's will, if by will we mean complete and uninhibited expression of character, and another to say that all things are by arbitrary fiat.' The latter doctrine, Scotism, eventuated among the Scholastics in the assertion that good is good because God wills it, and even, with William of Occam, that God might have willed otherwise, so that the content of the moral law might have been the opposite of what it is. Jonathan Edwards came very close to this conception when he said in his sermon, "Sinners In The Hands Of An Angry God," that only God's mere will-i.e., His arbitrary choice-keeps the elect from their just deserts. This lack of justice, Edwards implied, is not only pleasant for the elect, but is part of God's goodness. The Scotist-Calvinist doctrine really reduces value to being, for, like the Moslem preoccupation with sovereignty, it recognizes no value standard at all. The Thomistic doctrine that God's activity is the expression of His nature seems at first glance also to reduce value Op. cit., pp. 245-46. 123</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHY to being, but it does not really do so, for natura is not simply an existential concept. God's goodness is not accidental but integral to His nature. It is axiomatic that an efficient cause must be of the same mode of being as its effect. An idea cannot move a stone unless the idea is embodied. A First Cause cannot create value unless value is inherent in the First Cause. If goodness does characterize the Source of actuality-if It is as It ought to be, then goodness is an element, and perhaps the dominant element in the being of the First Cause. Another way of stating Taylor's axiological argument for theism is this The concept of value is the most ultimate of explanatory principles. In its supreme form, absolute value, though it does not give rise to existence, nor to any particular value (the concept is not simply moral, but axiological), it is inconceivable without its corre- late, absolute being. It is, therefore, the raison d'etre of temporal actuality, for unless value be presupposed, no reason can be assigned for being taking the form of temporal actuality. In the one instance, therefore, of that absolute reality which is the ground of all other reality, to be and to be valuable are one and the same thing. Finite beings never quite are-i.e., are never absolutely real-because they do not contain the reason for their being solely within themselves. The reason for the universe must be a reason that is its own justifi- cation, a being such that to be at all and to be its own reason are inseparable co-implicates. Objective value in the universe presup- poses, therefore, a Being in Whom absolute value and ultimate being are but two aspects of one reality. Taylor's axiological argument for theism is thus a re-statement of the Platonic-Aristotelian-Scholastic doctrine that value is objec- tively real and that the sufficient reason for a value-charged universe must combine in itself goodness and being. It is consciously and intentionally pre-Kantian in orientation. It differs from Whitehead's essentially objectivistic axiology in insisting on the being of God and emphasizing His transcendence. It is realistic as contrasted with Hartmann's idealistic concept of value as essence. Good is not only, as Hartmann asserts, What-Ought-To-Be; it is, hence is a deter- minant of process. Hartmann, conceiving the problem in Scotist terms, sees "a radical and rigid contradiction,"' between the absolute claims of moral values and metaphysical theism. The realistic axiologist, however, may point out to Hartmann, that it is no more a derogation of God's being to assume that He is moral than to assume that He is rational. While God's being transcends finite rationality, infinity does not drive the rational theologian to the Neti! Neti! of Hindu absolutism. If being and goodness are ultimate co-ordinate predicables, then their relation can be internal to God's integral being. I Hartmann, Ethics, Vol. I, p. 266. University of Maine, U.S.A.
