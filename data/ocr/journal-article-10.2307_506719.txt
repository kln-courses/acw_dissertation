<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Albania MUZAFER KORKUTI AND KARL M. PETRUSO INTRODUCTION Karl M. Petruso In July and August 1991 I traveled to Albania (fig. 1) to negotiate a collaborative project with the Centre for Archaeological Research, a unit of the Albanian Academy of Sciences. The following notes and observa- tions-many of which are, admittedly, impression- istic-are a result of 10 stimulating and enjoyable days spent in the company of several professional archae- ologists on the Centre staff (including Dr. Muzafer Korkuti, former director of the Centre and the author of the report that follows) and, subsequently, during the summer of 1992, in the course of the first season of joint Albanian-American fieldwork in the country.' On the occasion of my 1991 visit, I encouraged Dr. Korkuti to submit to AJA a newsletter report on recent developments in archaeology in the country, in order to bring them to a wider audience in the West. The article that follows complements and might profitably be read alongside two reports by Zhaneta Andrea, which summarize, district by district, the most signif- icant archaeological discoveries in the country over the past 20 years.2 Among the astonishing political and economic changes that swept through the countries of Eastern Europe at the turn of this decade, perhaps no trans- formations were as profound and dizzying as those that occurred in Albania. Under the rule of Enver Hoxha, founder of the Party of Labor of Albania in 1941 and chief of state from the end of World War II until his death in 1985, Albania's path had been one of increasing isolation and institutionalized xeno- phobia; the country had in turn established and renounced alliances with Tito's Yugoslavia, Khru- shchev's Soviet Union, and Mao's China until, by the late 1970s, it had decided to go it alone and had stubbornly isolated itself as few countries have been able to do in this century. Most of the states of the Eastern Bloc embarked on their dramatic political, social, and economic transformations in 1989, and it was to be only a matter of time before Albania fol- lowed suit. Ramiz Alia, who succeeded Hoxha in 1985, was forced to bow to public pressure in the winter of 1990-1991, and in short order the country set off on the long and painful course toward democracy, the restoration of human rights, and the implementation of a market economy. The long and brutal Stalinist-style reign of the country necessarily had an effect on scholarship in all disciplines of the social sciences, humanities, and fine arts. Indeed, Albania might well be the best place in Europe to study archaeology of historical-materialist stripe, since the country remained hardline Socialist long after the U.S.S.R. had softened and broadened 1 K.

Dr. Korkuti's contribution was prepared before the second of these two reports appeared. 3 The present essay is a modest contribution to a growing list of works of analysis and commentary on the archaeolog- ical ramifications of the momentous political changes in Eastern Europe since 1989. Among the most relevant recent works on this topic in English, the following are particularly noteworthy: S. Milisauskas, "People's Revolutions of 1989 and Archaeology in Eastern Europe," Antiquity 64 (1990) 283-85; H. Cleere, "Central European Archaeology in Transition," Antiquity 67 (1993) 121-22; L.

The paeans to Hoxha typically found in books on Albanian archaeology that appeared during his reign were a prerequisite to publication (which was, of course, state-controlled). It was customary for the dictator, who was a student of history, to add a few words extolling the virtues of the courageous, struggling, and idealistic Albanian people. The con- stitution of Albania that took effect in 1976 explicitly states that the country's "dominant ideology is Marx- ism-Leninism. The entire socialist social order is de- veloped on the basis of its principles."5 With respect to archaeological publication during this period, a generous dose of Marxist cant was often part of the mix. In a general introduction to the antiquities of Albania published in 1988, an essay on ancient city planning begins with the following sentences: Marx has emphasized that separation of the town from the village begins with the transition from the tribal order to state formation. Proceeding from this defini- tion, the problem is posed in more simple terms for the colonies of Dyrrachium, founded in 627 B.C., Apol- lonia, founded in 588 B.C. and Orychum founded about the same time.6 There is an unself-conscious assuredness about ar- chaeology presented in this fashion. One might well expect to find some level of reluctance on the part of scholars who have never known the need to examine the theoretical perspectives of their disciplines to di- vest themselves of such a tradition. It is, after all, both comfort and convenience to work in a scholarly tra- dition of received dogma as powerful as that of Marx- ism. I had expected in my first visit to the country to find some vestige of adherence to the old paradigm, and I gave my hosts every opportunity to assert it in museum and site visits as well as in casual conversa- tion. In no case did this occur. When pressed about the freshly painted-over-but still quite visible-max- ims of Marx and Lenin on the walls above museum cases, docents generally expressed discomfort and sought to deflect my queries. From its construction a few years ago, much of the third floor of the expansive and attractively appointed National Museum of His- tory on the main square in Tiran? had been devoted to the glorious cultural and industrial achievements of the Socialist period. This gallery was closed in the summer of 1991 while the museum directorship awaited the results of deliberations of a special gov- ernment committee charged with reexamining the way Albania conceived of itself, its people, and its recent history. Hard questions were being asked. Ex- actly what was signified by the borders of modern Albania? How could the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo-- who constitute the majority population and face in- creasing hostility from Serb nationalists in that for- merly Yugoslav province-best be represented? Should the Albanian diaspora be portrayed? How? As this article went to press, that museum gallery re- mained closed. The library of the Centre for Archaeological Re- search in Tirani (reorganized and renamed the Ar- chaeological Institute in 1992) contains a vast and well-organized collection of scholarly journals and archaeological site reports from Eastern and Central Europe in addition, of course, to a comprehensive archive on Albanian archaeology. The bookshelves are notably bereft of monographs on archaeological history and theory, however; I concluded in my visit to that library that during the Socialist period access to such works was discouraged, if not expressly pro- scribed, since most would inevitably have been at variance with, and hence invited challenges to, the officially sanctioned Marxist paradigm. Moreover, the development of Albanian archaeology in its isolation also had an effect on questions asked in the field and the laboratory, and in the realm of techniques gen- erally.7 There is no radiocarbon laboratory in Albania, and resources for sending carbon samples abroad were lacking. Furthermore, there has been no tradi- tion of interest in matters of absolute chronology or materials analysis in archaeology. This lack of empha- sis has kept the focus of archaeological research and publication on such matters as ceramic sequences, relative chronologies and cross-dating, and artifact typologies. Questions about (for instance) the ancient environment and the role of natural resources in the Neolithic economy simply have not been asked. Moreover, nationalism-whose excesses have his- torically proven so devastating to the states of the Balkan peninsula-is always at the surface of research into the archaeology and history of Albania. After the disintegration of the Roman world, Albania was in- Trigger (supra n. 3) 234-36. 5 Constitution of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania Approved by the People's Assembly on December 28, 1976 (English edition), chapter 1, article 3 (Tirane 1977) 8. 6 A.

PETRUSO [AJA 97 vaded and ruled successively by Byzantines, Huns, Bulgarians, and Slavs before it was absorbed into the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century. It re- mained an Ottoman province until 1912; thereafter, Albania experienced occupation by Italy (twice) and Germany. This tumultuous history has, predictably, left its mark on the study of the past. For the Iron Age, much energy has been expended in demonstrat- ing the autochthony and distinctiveness of the Illyrian people, from whom modern Albanians believe they are descended. Here again, as was the case with the Marxist paradigm, one would conclude that the schol- arly agenda has been-and still is--driven to a great extent by social and political concerns. Among other changes, the increased exposure to foreign scholarship and scholars in the coming years will occasion new queries in Albanian archaeological research, queries that will be unfettered by the state- sponsored ideology of the past. New opportunities for travel abroad by Albanian archaeologists and the establishment of collaborative projects will ensure that old data will be revisited, and new approaches to fieldwork and interpretation will be generated. Al- bania is a country changing on virtually a daily basis, one that is reinventing itself and thoughtfully reex- amining its past. Scholars who follow the development of archaeological theory particularly will surely find the Albanian experience exhilarating and eminently worthy of tracking.

This article reports on investigations carried out between 1984 and 1990. It is intended to update the summary published in English in 1984 in Archae- ological Reports.8 Most of the information that follows has been published in more detail in Albanian in the periodical Iliria, which is the primary archaeological journal of the country. A map of Albania (fig. 1) showing the major sites discussed in the text and a chart outlining Albanian chronology (fig. 2) are pro- vided here. Each of the sites is discussed in the chro- nological section that corresponds to its primary period of habitation. PREHISTORY Habitation Sites Vlushe (excavated by Ylli Luftin, 1990).9 This vil- lage in south-central Albania yielded surface finds some years ago that can be dated to the earliest phase of the Neolithic. The small size of some of the lithics recovered first drew scholarly attention to the area. Recent investigations have focused on two sites in the vicinity of the village, Armenia and Vidhez. At Ar- menia an area of 4 m2 was excavated to a depth of 0.90 m. Two occupation levels (each with a hearth) were distinguished, both of which contained crude pottery fragments in association with retouched trap- ezoidal flints of microlithic size (fig. 3). At Vidhiz a larger area was exposed (9 m2), revealing a cultural stratum some 0.85 m thick. Flints of microlithic type were excavated, but no ceramic fragments were found. The excavator has suggested that Vidhez might be a Mesolithic site; if this hypothesis is con- firmed, it would be the first such site discovered in Albania. Rrashtan (excavated by Ilir Gjipali, 1984).10 In a single brief campaign that exposed a limited area, this site in east-central Albania has yielded retouched flint qj,?

Middle Neolithic anthropomorphic figurines. (Photo A. Hykaj) tools and wedge-shaped stone axes, as well as bone tools. A substantial amount of thick-walled pottery with surfaces painted with a sandy matt slip was dis- covered. In addition, finer wares with sand inclusions were excavated; their monochrome surfaces vary from red to brown to black. The forms of these vessels are very simple (open and globular shapes are most common). Barbotine ornamentation is common; in addition, impressed decoration is also found and, least commonly, white paint. Some cult vessels were discov- ered as well, including anthropomorphic and zoo- morphic figurines and four-legged tables bearing incised decoration. The material assemblage of Rrashtan is generally very similar to that of Podgorie (phase Ib). Outside Albania the closest parallels are with Porodin in Greek Macedonia. Chronologically Rrashtan is representa- tive of the final phase of the Early Neolithic of Al- bania, which is better known in the Korgei basin and regions further to the east. Cakran (excavated by Muzafer Korkuti, 1984)." In order to resolve a problem of interpretation following the excavations of 1969-1970, this site (near the city of Fier) was reexamined in 1984. Trenches G, I, and K produced a thin but uniform cultural stratum (max- imum thickness 0.50 m). Pottery recovered in the recent excavations laid to rest the contention that this site had an early Neolithic component. Whereas ves- sels with S-shaped profiles and plastic decoration typ- ical of Dunavec, phase I, were attested, the hallmarks of the Early Neolithic-impresso and barbotine pot- tery-were notably absent. On these grounds, the occupation of Cakran can confidently be dated solely to the Middle Neolithic. Among the more noteworthy finds from the recent excavations were two anthro- pomorphic figurines (fig. 4). Diersnik (excavated by Petrika Lera, 1984).12 At this site in eastern Albania an area of 175 m2 was excavated, exposing a cultural layer 1.10 m thick. Two habitation levels were distinguished. The most diag- nostic ceramic ware is a light yellow ocherous fabric; a red ocherous fabric, often bearing painted decora- tion, was somewhat less common. A black ware dec- orated with incision and applique is also represented. In many respects the ceramic repertoire recalls that of Late Neolithic Maliq (phase I) and Bar; (phase II), although overall the connections would seem to be closer with Maliq. The generally poor quality of the painted decoration is paralleled elsewhere, and indi- cates that Dersnik was occupied in the initial stages of the Late Neolithic. Katundas (excavated by Muzafer Korkuti, 1986).13 The site of Katundas, north of the city of Berat in central Albania, is a typical small karstic cave of elon- gated proportion, measuring some 24 m in maximum length and 6-10 m in width. Excavations in 1986 exposed an area of 40 m2; cultural deposition some 3.6 m thick was discovered. The site is extremely rich: its artifactual remains indicate that it was inhabited from Neolithic times to the (Greek) Archaic period. Impressed and barbotine wares, as well as frag- ments of a white-on-red painted vessel of Podgorie Ib style, indicate occupation beginning in the Early Neo- lithic period (fig. 5:1). The Middle Neolithic is rep- resented by black and grayish-black lustrous pottery " M. Korkuti, Iliria 1984:2, 258. 12 P. Lera, Iliria 1984:2, 259. '3 M.

Zaloshnja) (often bearing incised hatched triangles), which is well known at Dunavec and elsewhere in the Adriatic. Of particular significance are five rhyton fragments of Dunavec-Cakran type. The substantial remains of the Late Neolithic pe- riod include brown-on-light painted vessels (fig. 5:6) similar to those from Maliq (phase I) and Kamnik (phase I). Motifs include net patterns and zigzags, the latter occasionally found on the necks of large vessels. Alongside this native ware, four fragments of im- ported vessels were found. A complete absence of cardium decoration and Devollian ware is noteworthy. Katundas was occupied throughout the Aeneolithic period. While the remains of this period are in general typical of the Albanian Aeneolithic, they also exhibit some local peculiarities that are worthy of mention. A fine lustrous black ware found in Aeneolithic levels is not commonly attested elsewhere. On the other hand, white-filled incised decoration characteristic of Maliq phase II is absent. The Early Bronze Age pottery at the site includes thick-walled vessels decorated with punctated plastic bands and pseudobarbotine vessels. In addition, pots with vertical handles rising above the rim (character- istic of Maliq IIIa) were found. The Late Bronze Age at Katundas is represented by fragments of painted vessels of Devollian type (cf. infra, fig. 9) as well as vessels with wide necks and exaggerated vertical handles springing from the rim (fig. 5:5). Later Devollian-type vessels representative of the Iron Age (seventh-sixth centuries B.C.), as well as fragments of Corinthian painted wares, were found in the upper level of the site. Rajci (excavated by Ilir Gjipali, 1987-1989).14 The prehistoric site of Rajci, excavated in three campaigns between 1987 and 1989, is located in the fertile agri- cultural lands of eastern Albania near Lake Ochrid. A total area of 172 m2 was exposed in three sectors; the maximum depth of cultural deposits was 2.30 m. In sector A, two habitation horizons with architectural '4 I.

Stone and ceramic artifacts from the end of the Early Neolithic period. (I. Zaloshnja) remains were isolated. The earlier of the two consisted of a floor made of clay mixed with chaff, which is associated with a fragment of a clay wall reinforced by stake timbering. The later occupation level was also attested by a clay floor, more or less rectangular in plan, approximately 12 x 7 m in area. The site proved to be rich in stone tools, yielding flint blades and groundstone axes, chisels, pestles, and querns. Among the ceramics, barbotine, red monochrome, white- and red-painted, and impressed wares are well represented (fig. 6). Globular vessels with cylindrical necks are typical; flat rather than round bottoms are the rule. Painted pots are not common, but it is clear that the best parallels are with Podgorie lb. Cult objects are an important feature of the Rajcie inventory. They include clay figurines and tables. The latter are rectangular, with carefully modeled legs decorated with incised designs (fig. 6:11). A few of these have small altars at their centers or attached to one side. These items are paralleled exactly by ex- amples from Early Neolithic Porodin in northern Macedonia (Greece), with which they are no doubt contemporary. Dajp (excavated by Muhamet Bela, 1986, 1987).'5 The cave of Daj? is situated in Has, at an elevation of 1250 masl. It is a typical karstic cave, in the form of an irregular corridor 80 m long, averaging 3.5 m wide and 4.5 m high. The earliest cultural stratum (Daj I), which is 0.20 m thick, belongs to the Aeneolithic period. Of the pottery in this stratum, 75% has thick walls. The thin- walled pottery is made from a fine clean clay mixed with sand. Its surface is polished, typically gray or black and occasionally brown in color. The most com- mon vessels are those with squat biconical bodies and cylindrical necks and bowls with incurving rims. ~5 M.

Topojan. Middle Neolithic pottery. (I. Zaloshnja) Among the few decorations worthy of mention are some fragments with incised grooves. On the whole, the pottery of Dajg I is similar to that of Gradec, Nezir II, Maliq IIb, and also to the Aeneolithic pottery of Hisar in Kosovo. The archaeological materials of Dajg I, although meager in quantity, quite clearly belong to the Aeneo- lithic tradition of Albania. This is of great importance since this phase was heretofore unattested in the northeastern part of the country. The second cultural stratum, Dajg II, belongs to the Early Bronze Age and is characterized by thick-walled pottery. The main forms are vessels with bulbous bodies, wide necks, and thick lips as well as cups with one or two short handles. Ornamentation includes plastic bands with or without punctation. Pseudobar- botine pottery is also represented. All in all, the ce- ramics indicate that Dajg II corresponds with Maliq III and Nezir IIIa. A third cultural stratum, Dajg III, which belongs to the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age, was horizontally isolated. The pottery of this stratum is of better quality than that of the pre- ceding level. The most representative forms are large and deep conical plates with incurving lips, decorated with wide and oblique bands. Such forms have been found in the cave of Ktipute, in tumulus I of Barg, and at Gradishtti near Pesjoka. Large plates made by coiling were widely distributed in the central Balkans in the transitional period between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Topojan (excavated by Adem Bunguri, 1987- 1989).16 This site is located on the lowest river terrace on the east side of the Drini i Zi River, near the village of Topojan. The terrace is elongated in shape, with an area of 1.5 ha. During three campaigns, excava- tions were carried out in two sectors, A and B, and a total surface of 428 m2 was exposed, even though the cultural stratum is very thin (varying from 0.40 m in sector A to 0.90 m in sector B). In sector A at a depth of 0.90 m, an occupation horizon was isolated that consisted of a floor made of small stones in a clay matrix; the floor was burned in some places. Sector B yielded a similar floor. The tools are few in number. They are represented by a variety of stone axes and, less commonly, flint blades. The pottery, which is abundant, has thin walls, typically with smooth black-gray surfaces, and is well fired (fig. 7). In addition, a fine ware with lustrous black slip was found. The repertoire of shapes consists for the most part of bowls of various types. Only 5% of the ceramics recovered are decorated, but several 16 A.

Incised parallel bands filled with irregular lines constitute the most common ornamental motif (fig. 7:1, 3); this is characteristic of the Middle Neolithic. Plastic ornamentation is also found. The spiritual life of Topojan is suggested by four- legged cult tables, decorated with meanders or deep incisions encrusted with a red material. The culture of Topojan I is reminiscent of that of Cetush II, as well as that of Blaz III, i.e., the last phase of the Middle Neolithic. Belaj (excavated by Frano Prendi, 1987).17 This site is located on two river terraces, 80 and 100 masl, respectively. On the higher terrace a surface of 12 m2 was excavated, and yielded cultural levels some 2 m thick. The remains attest to occupation in both the prehistoric and historical periods. The stratum of the prehistoric period is 1.20 m thick and notable for its abundant but very frag- mented ceramic material, rather poor in quality. Among the vessels represented, the most common are piriform cups with two vertical handles that rise above the rim; vessels with sharp biconical profiles; vessels with plastic horseshoe handles; and vessels with per- forated handles. Plastic brow-shaped attachments were popular forms of ornamentation, as were incised decoration in geometric motifs, such as pendant tri- angles and rows of rhomboi. The pottery of Belaj is most similar to that found at the Late Bronze Age dwelling of Zagore and at Gajtan II, which according to the latest excavations can also be dated to the Late Bronze Age. Outside the territory of Albania, the pottery of Belaj resembles the Late Bronze Age pottery of the central Adriatic Illyrian regions of Halstatt, phases A and B (Central European chronology). Zagor? (excavated by Zhaneta Andrea, 1987).18 The habitation site of Zagore is located on the north- eastern part of a low hill near the village of the same name. The maximum thickness of the compact cul- tural stratum is 1 m over the entire excavated surface. The tools recovered were few in number, repre- sented by socketed hammers of a type characteristic of the Albanian Bronze Age, as well as by millstones and clay spindle whorls. The pottery, which, as usual, constitutes the greatest part of the artifact inventory, clearly belongs to a single period as indicated by its technique of production, profiles, and ornamenta- tion. Characteristic are bowls with inverted and everted rims, vessels with horseshoe handles, vessels with handles in the shape of lunate blades, and bicon- ical vessels with two handles rising above the rims. The decoration is simple; most typical are horizontal bands with or without holes, conical nipples, and fin- ger-impressed bands near the rims. A bronze needle with an oval hole characteristic of the 13th century B.C. helps to date the habitation of this site to the end of the Bronze Age. On the whole, the culture of Zagore is to be compared with that of Belaj (see above) and Gajtan II, and is characteristic of the Late Bronze Age in northern Albania. Drenovie (excavated by Petrika Lera, 1987).19 The aim of the excavations at Belaj, Zagorn, and Drenovi was to become familiar with the features of the culture of Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age habitation sites, and to supplement the data acquired many years ago in the excavations at Gajtan, Tren, and Belsh. The site of Drenovi is situated at the foot of Mt. Saint Constantine, 4 km south of the city of Korge. The terrain around the site is steeply sloped; none- theless, it was possible to excavate a surface of 53 m2. A cultural stratum 1.10-1.60 m thick with two occu- pation horizons was discovered. The archaeological material from the site is rich and consists mainly of fragments of vessels and a few stone and clay implements. Of chronological interest are 13 fragments of wheelmade vessels, which belong to the Late Geometric period, and a bronze needle of the Subgeometric period. The remainder of the indigenous pottery, also wheelmade, is characterized by a fine clay, well fired, with a smooth surface light in color. The most com- mon forms are vessels with globular bodies and cy- lindrical or conical necks fitted with vertical handles, globular necked jars, and beaked jugs. With respect to ornamentation, a brown matt paint is most promi- nent; the most popular motif is the pendant isosceles triangle. In this respect the painted pottery of Dren- ov6 recalls that of Early Iron Age Maliq, Tren, Bar?, and Ku? i Zi. Based on these findings, it would seem that the site of Drenovie covers a period that includes the Late Geometric and Subgeometric periods, with the more intensive period of occupation being the latter. Lleshan (excavated by Riza Hasa, 1987-1990).20 The site of Lleshan has long drawn the attention of scholars because of its impressive circuit walls and occasional finds acquired in surface surveys.

Lleshan. Hoard of coins found in bronze vessels, Illyrian Urban period. (Photo A. Hykaj) are particularly noteworthy, consisting of a system of three stretches of undressed stones set without mor- tar. The site was established on a mountaintop in the Shpat chain at an elevation of 1190 masl, east of the village of Lleshan, about 8 km south of the city of Elbasan. In addition to its man-made circuit walls, the site is naturally fortified, surrounded by crags on the west, south, and east. The highest part of the site is surrounded by a wall creating an acropolis 0.1 ha in area. The lower town is located to the west of the acropolis within its own circuit wall. During four campaigns, excavations concentrated on the acropolis near its surrounding wall, in the trough between the acropolis and the lower town, and in the terraced lower town itself. The stratigraphy is consistent among these three areas. Three cultural strata have been isolated, belonging to the Late Bronze Age, the Iron Age, and the Illyrian Urban period. The prehistoric levels (Bronze-Iron Ages) are nearly 1 m thick. The pottery from these levels is very fragmentary and varies in color from black to gray. Incised decoration, plastic nipples, and punctated bands are characteristic forms of ornamentation. These features suggest relations with the culture of Mat to the north. The other major category of ceram- ics is characterized by a reddish ware ornamented with matt paint. This ware is reminiscent of pottery of southern Illyria. Since Lleshan is located between the northern and southern Illyrian groups, this should come as no surprise. The second cultural stratum consists of materials of the Illyrian Urban period. The stratum contains numerous fragments of Hellenistic rooftiles as well as both locally made and imported vessels, the latter having close parallels at Durris and Apoloni. More than a thousand bronze and a small number of silver coins from Durris, Apoloni, Orik, Epirus, and Corfu have been discovered, as well as a golden earring similar to those found at Selca e Poshtmi. Worthy of mention also is the finding of a large number of terracottas in the form of bulls' heads. In the 1988 campaign, an extraordinary hoard of coins also dating to the Urban period was excavated in two very well preserved bronze vessels (fig. 8). The treasure contained 2,823 coins, of which 13 were drachmas; the mint of Dyrrachium predominates.</page><page sequence="12">714 MUZAFER KORKUTI AND KARL M. PETRUSO [AJA 97 3 0 3 CM Fig. 9. Maliq. Devollian ware with geometric patterns. (I. Zaloshnja) Nearly 800 additional coins were found during the campaign of 1989. Considering the great number of coins found, it was thought at first that Lleshan was a center of commerce and agricultural production, es- pecially stockrearing. It must be kept in mind, how- ever, that 700 of these coins were found within a limited area of 3 m2. The great number of zoo- morphic figurines in the form of bulls' heads leads one to believe that this is a cult center related to stockrearing; the director of the excavation has sug- gested that it is the precinct of a temple to Diana. Maliq (excavated by Frano Prendi, Zhaneta An- drea, and Petrika Lera, 1988-1989).21 After a 14-year hiatus, research was resumed at the well-known site of Maliq in sector C, which was exposed by recent agricultural projects. During 1988 three areas were explored. A surface of 97 m2, with cultural levels averaging 1.50 m thick, was opened. The excavations continued in these two areas in 1989, and another area of 80 m2 was exca- vated as well. The first two areas mentioned above had similar stratigraphy. An earlier layer some 0.30 m thick con- tained Middle Bronze Age (Maliq IIIc) ceramics. The next layer was deposited directly on the earlier layer without interruption, and contained pottery of poor quality with polished, light surfaces, occurring in var- ious shapes. Typical are vessels with high channeled strap handles rising above the rim, vessels with wish- bone handles, and amphoras with conical necks. The ornamentation on these vessels is simple, consisting mainly of relief decoration. They are also to be dated to the Middle Bronze Age. In the third cultural level, alongside a great number of elements inherited from the second level, Devollian ware appears for the first time, a red-painted ware with geometric patterns formed by scraping off a subsequently applied layer of paint (fig. 9). Together with this ware (which predominates) a few fragments were found characterized by matt paint in brown or maroon, but not scraped. It is significant that the two categories of painted pottery (the reserved style pre- 21 Iliria 1988:2, 248-49; 1989:2, 265-66.</page><page sequence="13">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 715 viously attributed to Maliq IIIdl and the other to Maliq IIId2) were found together and thus cannot be differentiated chronologically as had been thought. In consideration of this, the second and third cultural layers can now be ascribed to the Late Bronze Age of Maliq IIId. The discovery in this level of two bone pins of a form typical of the 13th-12th centuries B.C. in Greece permits us to date the level after the 13th century B.C. Of great interest were the new data gained in the third area explored. Over a cultural layer belonging to Maliq phase IIId2 was deposited another layer with materials belonging typologically to Maliq phase IIId3. It is characterized mainly by Devollian painted pottery of very good quality, which is to be dated to the Iron Age I period. This compact layer is followed by mixed deposits of Iron Age II and III, as indicated by fragments of Corinthian imported pottery and bronze objects decorated with motifs that can be dated to the eighth-seventh centuries. In light of these new data, it would seem that oc- cupation of the site of Maliq continued during the Iron Age; consequently we have added a new phase, Maliq IV, to the chronology of the site. Sovjan (excavated by Petrika Lera, 1990).22 The site of Sovjan is located 300 m southeast of the epon- ymous village and only 3.5 km north of the better- known site of Maliq. As a result of several surveys conducted during the first campaign in 1990, it be- came possible to define the extent of the site, now estimated at 2.5 ha. Over the entire 30 m2 surface excavated thus far, the thickness of the cultural de- posits averaged 2.40 m. Overlying these were thick deposits of earth devoid of finds due to the recent deepening of a drainage channel. Four habitation horizons were isolated in the ex- cavated area, the earliest of which is connected with a lake dwelling. Rich archaeological materials were discovered in the four horizons, represented mainly by fragments of vessels, pieces of baked clay plaster, carbonized beams, animal bones, and a few tools made of limestone, flint, horn, and clay belonging to the LBA culture of Maliq IIId and the Iron Age culture of Maliq IV. The earliest LBA pottery is characterized by an unattractive ware typically black, dark gray, or red, and a ware of light beige or ocherous yellow color. The most common forms are vessels with two vertical handles rising above the rim, bowls, and wide- throated vessels. Not one fragment of Devollian pot- tery has been found. In this level also was found a fragment of an imported vessel of Mycenaean IIIA type, along with a bone pin (also of Mycenaean type), which would date this phase no earlier than the 14th century B.C. The two groups of pottery of the first phase are present in the second phase of the Late Bronze Age also, but a gradual increase of the pottery with light tones may be noted at that time; these account for two-thirds of the ceramic fragments recovered. A new important element of this phase is the appearance of matt-painted Devollian pottery. The paint is red, ma- roon, or brown in color, typically painted directly onto the surface of the vase, but in a few cases it was applied to a white slip. The paint is quite fugitive, and cannot withstand rubbing or washing. Among the 69 painted fragments of Devollian ware, 47 exhibit patterns re- vealed by scraping. In both cases the motifs are the same, namely, linear-geometric. Ceramic cross-dating suggests that the matt-painted pottery appears in Sovjan after the 13th century B.C. and that the technique of revealing underlying painted patterns by scraping is of the same period. Of great importance is the discovery in Sovjan of a cultural level belonging to the Iron Age, which we have labeled Maliq IVa-c. Most of the materials of this period consist of light-colored pottery of good quality, known at contemporary sites thoughout the Kor?g basin. In all its attributes this ware recalls the pottery of Iron Age Tren. This is demonstrated by the discovery in this level at Sovjan of two Corinthian fragments dating to the middle of the eighth century B.C. and of a bronze pendant in the form of a sphere, of the same date. The discovery of this material at Sovjan throws new light on the continuity of habitation of the Korge plain during the Iron Age; previously this had been sus- pected only on the basis of chance finds. Konispol (excavated by Muzafer Korkuti and Halil Shabani, 1989-1990).23 The cave of Konispol is lo- cated in the western part of the Sarand? District, the southernmost administrative province of Albania, at an elevation of 400 masl, near the town of Konispol (fig. 10). It is a typical karstic cave with a southern exposure. The cave is about 50 m long, 6 m in maxi- mum depth, and 6 m in maximum height. 22 Iliria 1990:2, 250-52. 23 Iliria 1989:2, 260-62; 1990:2, 249-50. In 1992 collab- orative excavations by both authors of the present article were undertaken. A brief report on the results appeared in OWAN (supra n. 1).</page><page sequence="14">716 MUZAFER KORKUTI AND KARL M. PETRUSO [AJA 97 Fig. 10. Konispol. View of the cave entrance. (Photo A. Hykaj) During two consecutive campaigns a surface of 47 m2 was opened, and a cultural layer up to 3.60 m deep was excavated. The stratigraphy of the site is for the most part exceptionally clear, and yields evidence of occupation from Neolithic to medieval times. The Early Neolithic period is attested by impresso and pseudobarbotine wares characteristic of the Adriatic and the central Balkans. The Middle Neolithic is char- acterized mainly by thick-walled vessels and second- arily by thin-walled wares. Ornamentation is rare. On the finer wares, beaded relief decoration, Devollian- type impressions, Adriatic impressions, and gray- on-gray painted wares are attested. This ornamental repertoire relates the Middle Neolithic levels to Dunavec I. The main characteristic of Late Neolithic Konispol is a painted pottery of Maliq I style. Two subtypes may be distinguished: local and imported wares. The former is made of clay mixed with sand, is well fired, generally reddish, and lacks surface polishing. The paint is brown with broad lines and triangles filled with lines, and is not of high quality. The imported ware is also made with a clay mixed with sand. It is thin-walled, competently fired, and varies in color from cream to dark gray. Its paint is brown and always matt. The most popular motifs are linear. The ceramics belonging to the Bronze Age are characterized by thick- and thin-walled wares in gray and gray-black. The few ornamented specimens bear incised patterns. The vessels generally have short ver- tical or horizontal handles. There are a few fragments decorated with bands in relief that are paralleled in the pottery of Maliq IIIc. Also dated to Bronze Age levels are several examples of terracotta anchors, of unknown function. The Iron Age ceramics from Kon- ispol were difficult to isolate from the overlying Iron Age materials, although it is easy enough to distin- guish them on typological grounds. A few finds of Corinthian and Ionian imported pottery suggest ab- solute dates for certain strata. The culture of the Urban period is mainly attested by skyphoi, unguentaria, and black-glazed wares of the third and second centuries B.C., as well as a collection of schematic flat anthropomorphic terra- cottas. Based on these findings, it seems likely that during the Urban period the Konispol Cave was largely used for cult purposes. Tumuli Bujan (excavated by Zhaneta Andrea, 1984, 1986).24 The site of Bujan is located in the extreme northeast of Albania. It consists of 12 tumuli situated on a rocky plateau on the west bank of the Valbona River, near the city of Bajram Curri. The tumuli are small in size (8-13 m in diameter and 0.80-1.55 m in height). With respect to construc- 24 Zh. Andrea, Iliria 1984:2, 261-62; 1986:2, 254.</page><page sequence="15">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 717 Fig. 11. Bujan. Tumulus 4. (Photo A. Hykaj) tion methods, three types can be distinguished: 1) tumuli made completely of stones; 2) tumuli made of earth with a circle of stones in the center; and 3) tumuli consisting of stones and soil. The best-preserved tumulus is number 4, which consists of three layers of stone mixed with a large quantity of earth (fig. 11). This tumulus contained six burials set at different depths surrounded by stones, and had floors made of small stones. The dead were placed on their backs or sides, with legs together. In some instances, the deceased had been cremated else- where before being placed in the burial pit. Grave furnishings were sparse; a total of three clay pots, a few bronze bracelets, and some bronze spiraliform tubes were inventoried. In tumuli 3 and 5, which were built with stones, there were no burials. In tumuli 7 and 8, fragments of broken vessels were found at various depths, re- calling burial rituals documented in other Illyrian tumuli. The date of the construction of the Bujan tumuli is problematic because of the paucity of finds. There are, however, broad similarities in the meager ceramic remains with vessels from Kukes and Mat, dating to the Iron Age I period. Shtoj (excavated by Aristotel Koka, 1984, 1986, 1988).25 The tumulus field of Shtoj is located on the northeastern outskirts of the city of Shkoder. Dozens of tumuli spaced some 25-100 m from one another were found before the early 1980s. During 1980- 1983 five tumuli (nos. 1-5) were excavated, while in 1984, 1986, and 1988 five others were excavated (nos. 6-10). A total of some 160 tumuli are now known. Tumulus 6 is of special interest for its architecture and inventory (fig. 12). This tumulus was built with stones and soil, and enclosed by a ring of stones approximately 15 m in diameter. It was built in several phases. The first phase consisted of a small mound of stones and soil some 0.44 m in height and 11 m in diameter, and contains one central grave. In the sec- ond phase a cist grave was placed in its center and covered by a great mass of earth and stone, which increased its height. In this tumulus a number of different grave types can be distinguished: pit graves, cist graves, and graves surrounded by stones. The earliest burial (no. 15) in the center of the tumulus was a pit grave, set deep under the floor of the tumulus. Cist graves are represented by no. 14, which is built with four large slate slabs forming a rectangular chest covered with smaller slabs. Graves 1-13 are of the third type, bor- dered by lines of stones placed in the form of a wall and covered with small slabs. Generally the skeletons have not been preserved, and those that have survived are badly damaged. The positions of the preserved skeletons vary: some skel- 25 A.

(Photo A. Hykaj) etons lie on their side with hands near or under the face (nos. 13 and 15), while others lie on their back with legs extended. With the exception of grave 13, which contained two skeletons, all other graves were individual interments. The grave furnishings include clay pots, weapons, and other small finds. The pots were handmade from a clean clay, and are brown, gray, or black in color. The most common forms are spherical or biconical vessels with a narrow throat and two handles rising above the rim. All these types are known from tumuli of the Iron Age in the Mat District. The close cultural relationship between the tumuli of Shtoj and those of Mat is demonstrated as well by the inventory of metal finds. Weapons include spear- and lanceheads, dag- gers, and knives made of iron. Finally, fibulas with chain pendants, plates, diadems, brooches, and bronze and glass beads were found in this tumulus. Among the items inventoried in tumulus 6, a vessel in grave 14 is of special interest. The peculiar handles and the incised decoration recall a type known in the Kotorac-Cetina culture of EBA Dalmatia. Of great interest also is the discovery over the central grave of six clay anthropomorphic figurines laid out to resem- ble the rays of a circle with their heads toward the center. Associated with them was a small clay pot and the bones of a small animal. Four of the figurines are female, one male, and one a child. The figurines are schematic and in the shape of a violin. Typologically they are reminiscent of anthropomorphic figurines found in Middle Bronze Age levels at Maliq, but their earliest comparanda may be sought in the Aeneolithic levels at the same site. The finding of these six terracottas over the central grave indicates a special ritual, which, one guesses, was performed on the occasion of the construction of the tumulus and the burial of its first occupant. Two periods of use of the tumulus are suggested: Early Bronze Age (contemporaneous with Maliq IIIb) and the seventh-sixth centuries B.C. Among the other tumuli of Shtoj several are worthy of mention. Tumulus 7 (22 m in diameter, 1.60 m high), encircled by a ring of stones 14 m in diameter, contains three graves made of stone and covered with small slate slabs. The graves contained two iron lance- heads, one spearhead, one vessel with a handle rising over the rim, and one imported chalice of the late Archaic period. Tumulus 8 (20 m in diameter, 0.75 m high), made of stones and earth, had only one grave, the inventory of which contained a clay pot, a bronze spiral, and a bronze pendant characteristic of the eighth-seventh centuries B.C. Tumulus 10 (23 m in diameter, 1.60 m high) was made of stones and earth (fig. 13), and was surrounded by three concen- tric rings of stones (6.50, 10.8, and 19 m in diameter). This tumulus had a central pit grave similar to that of tumulus 6, and three other stone-built graves. The inventory was very poor. Pottery fragments reminis- cent of the Ljubljana culture of the central Adriatic suggest a date in the Early Bronze Age.</page><page sequence="17">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 719 Fig. 13. Shtoj. Tumulus 10. (Photo A. Hykaj) Mujaj (excavated by Muhamet Bela, 1987).26 The tumuli of Mujaj are located 1.5 km from the cave site of Dajg on both sides of the Kshtell stream. They are made of stones and earth. They are small in diameter (10 m maximum) and relatively low (0.20-0.50 m). Of the three excavated tumuli, one contains only one central grave, a second three graves, and a third 14 graves. Most of the graves are rectangular pits bordered by small and medium-sized stones. The floors of these graves are paved with thin angular stones. Of the 18 graves, 16 are interments and two are cremations. The skeletons were poorly preserved, thus making it difficult to determine their postures at the time of interment. Ten graves were accompanied by complete vessels and fragments, ornaments made of bronze, silver, and amber, and a number of iron weapons, including spearheads of various types. The pottery is represented by typical local forms, such as vessels with two vertical handles rising over the rim, some of which are decorated with incision. Alongside the locally produced pottery was found a chalice of the late Archaic period. Among the other finds worthy of mention is a bronze circle with three decorative protrusions of Trebenisht IIIb type, as well as a bronze pendant with a spherical body and ray pattern, to be dated not earlier than the sixth century B.C. The amber beads are greater in number and of different shapes and sizes. Based on these finds, the graves can be dated to the sixth-fifth centuries B.C. My(-Has (excavated by Muhamet Bela, 1988).27 The necropolis of Myg-Has contains six tumuli situ- ated 6-10 m away from one another. The tumuli are hemispherical and of small size, typically 0.60 m high and 6-13 m in diameter. They were built with stones and earth, with the exception of tumulus 5, which was built completely with stones. This tumulus contained only one grave. In all, the tumuli at this site contained 37 graves, which were lined with stones or consisted of simple pits. Interments predominate; the skeletal remains discovered were in very poor condition. As usual, pottery comprises the bulk of the finds inventoried in the graves. It is of poor quality and was not well fired. Among the most common forms are two-handled vessels and beaked oinochoai typical of the Mat Glasinc group. Other forms include conical bowls with upright or incurving rims, hemispherical bowls, and cups of various profiles. Decorated vessels are few, represented by chalices and skyphoi of the late Archaic period (sixth-fifth centuries B.C.). The weapons in the graves included nearly 50 iron spearheads of various sizes and a few knives, daggers, and double axes. Two bronze knives with incurved backs dating to the Iron Age I period were found. Other finds include pins, bracelets, spirals, bronze chains, silver items, and amber beads. Based on these data it would appear that the tumuli of Myg-Has were in use throughout the Iron Age. 26 M.

Hykaj) Krume (excavated by Muhamet Bela, 1989).28 The tumuli in the highlands of Krume are 3 km from the cave site of Daj?, situated on a typical mountain pla- teau. They were made of stones and earth, with an average height of 0.60 m, and varying in diameter from 7 to 14 m. They are covered with stone slabs, as was the case with some tumuli at Kuk6s, Shtoj, and Mat. Tumulus 1 is of special interest. It contained 15 graves of two types (pits surrounded by stones and pits covered with slate slabs). In only three of the graves were traces of skeletons found. All the graves contained artifacts, most commonly clay pots. A few are decorated with incised triangular patterns, generally gray or brown in color. Late Ar- chaic wheelmade ceramic imports, similar to examples found at KukAs, Mat, and Shkod&amp;r, were also inven- toried. Weapons are few in number, represented by spear- heads and knives typical of the Iron Age. In addition, bronze beads and fragments of amber were found in the burials. As was the case with the necropolis at Myy-Has, the tumuli at Krume were in use through- out the Iron Age. Luaras (excavated by Skender Aliu, 1988-1989).29 In the hills east of the village of Luaras 15 tumuli have been located, only one of which has been exca- vated. It was situated on a small hill, and has a diam- eter of 30 m and a height of 3.20 m (fig. 14). The tumulus was used during several periods. The core of the tumulus, consisting of a stone wall in the form of an ellipse, was erected for the central grave, which dates to the Late Bronze Age. The tumulus was en- larged in the final phase of the Bronze Age and the first phase of the Iron Age, when it attained its current size and shape. Its entire surface is covered with lime- stone rocks. The tumulus was used for burials also in the second and third phases of the Iron Age (eighth- seventh centuries and sixth-fifth centuries, respec- tively). The tumulus contained 203 graves. During the Bronze Age the deceased were placed on their sides in a "sleeping" position, while in the Iron Age they were laid on their backs. Only two graves contained 28 Iliria 1989:2, 269-70. 29 Iliria 1988:2, 250-51; 1989:2, 267-69.</page><page sequence="19">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 721 Fig. 15. Luaras. Characteristic pottery from tumuli. (Photo A. Hykaj) cremations. Many fragments of pots were found out- side the graves, suggesting that the fill for the tumulus came from nearby living areas. This phenomenon has also been observed in the tumuli of Rehova and Pro- dan in the district of Kolonja. At Luaras two types of graves are distinguished: simple pit burials (131 total) and graves covered with stone slabs (72 total). These two types were character- istic of the tumuli excavated earlier in the Kolonja district. The inventory of the tumulus of Luaras is very rich and varied. Some 130 small and medium-sized vessels and about 5,500 fragments of vessels, either used in the fill of the tumulus or broken in the burial rites, were found. All are handmade, from a clean fabric mixed with fine sand. The vessels are typically thin- walled with smooth surfaces and were well fired, vary- ing from red to black in color. Best represented in the ceramic inventory are "bi- phora" (double-handled) vessels (fig. 15:2); some of these appear to be unique to Luaras. A three-spouted vessel similar to one known from Vitsa near Ioannina, as well as several other multiple-spouted pots, are characteristic of the south Illyrian group (fig. 15:3). Most of the Luaras pieces are decorated with incision and plastic bands placed vertically on their shoulders. Weapons inventoried include spearheads and bronze and iron knives. A lanceolate spearhead, per- haps of Central European origin, was found. This type had not been attested previously in this area. Ornaments constitute the greatest and most varied group of finds from the tumulus. Among the 150 items inventoried are fibulae, long dress pins, dia- dems, bracelets, finger rings, and hair rings. The fibulae include specimens known from western Mac- edonia and Chalkidiki in Greece. Small finds of</page><page sequence="20">722 MUZAFER KORKUTI AND KARL M. PETRUSO [AJA 97 Fig. 16. Byllis. General view of the site, including theater and one city gate. (Photo A. Hykaj) bronze, iron, silver, bone, stone, glass, and amber were also catalogued. Many seem to be local variants in- spired by Central European examples. On the whole, the tumulus of Luaras preserves the characteristic features of the southeastern Illyrian group, with some local peculiarities. Shuec (excavated by Zhaneta Andrea, 1990).30 Near the village of Shuec, on the lake of Prespa e Vogel, two tumuli have been found, one of which has been excavated. It is 1.70 m high and has a maximum diameter of 34 m. The tumulus was made of clay with a cover of stones. The edge of the tumulus was sur- rounded by a broad and thick belt of large and me-' dium-sized stones mixed with small angular gravels. Of special interest is the existence of a dromos paved with stones, which connected the excavated tumulus with the unexcavated one. In the excavated tumulus 66 graves were discov- ered, both simple pits and pits surrounded by stones. All were inhumations. Most belong to the sixth-fifth centuries, although a few date to the first and second phases of the Iron Age. The inventory of the tumulus consists mostly of clay pots and a few weapons and ornaments that have their best counterparts in tumuli from the district of Korie. Further investigations are expected to clarify the chronology and phases of this tumulus. CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Cities and Towns Byllis (excavated by Neritan Ceka, 1984-1990).31 During the years 1984-1990 the excavations at this major site concentrated on the agora of the city, and sought to clarify its architectural history (fig. 16). A stoa delimits the northeastern corner of the agora, thus providing some protection from the pre- dominant cold northerly winds. The building is L- shaped with the long side toward the north. The wings of the stoa are nearly 144 m long. They are treated as two separate volumes separated by an entrance to the agora. The northern wing is 77 m long and 11.10 m wide, and is divided into two corridors by a colon- nade. It had two stories. The lower story has a Doric colonnade with eight-fluted columns. 30 Zh.

Byllis. Theater and skene building foundations. (Photo A. Hykaj) The remains of the superstructure are few, and are represented by fragments of an Ionic entablature and a pilaster capital, which suggests that the second floor resembled the upper stories of the stoas at Apollonia. The second arm of the stoa, beyond its 4.50-m wide entrance, continues some 60 m in a north-south di- rection. As was the case with the other wing, its end is closed. The intercolumniation is 2.70 m. In front of the stereobate of the stoa was found a cultural stratum dating to the late fourth century B.C., which was cluttered with monuments. Above this, covering a staircase of the stoa, was a deposit of the third-second centuries, which gives a terminus for the building of the stoa. During the third century A.D. the stoa was destroyed, and during the fourth- sixth centuries houses were erected atop its ruins. The architectural details of the stoa at Byllis recall those of the stoas at Apollonia and Klos, and the use of eight-fluted columns is paralleled in Epirus; the division of the building into two perpendicular vol- umes, however, is not a typical design feature. Further excavations in the agora after the discovery of this building brought to light new data regarding the city plan. On the right of the entrance to the agora was found a building whose function was apparently civic. It is 20.10 m long and 5.80 m wide, with its facade opening toward the south and its back sup- ported by the dividing wall of the agora. The building has a central porch with two symmetrical rooms. The facade of the central room consists of a colonnade. Within the room was a cultural stratum with materials of the second half of the third century B.C. During a second period (first century B.C.) the building was reconstructed using stones, some of which bore in- scriptions. One is a dedication to Artemis Parthenos and another to Hera Telia. West of this building, on a terrace 3 m high, another building was constructed along the line of the north- ern wall of the agora. It is rectangular in plan, 18.20 x 6.20 m, with a colonnade of eight-fluted columns running through it, of which four were preserved in situ. The building underwent reconstruction during the first century A.D.; this is indicated by the use of the opus reticulatum technique. In the process of clarifying the city plan and the layout of the residential quarter, a complete peristyle house was excavated. It is approximately 30 x 25 m in plan, and contains a square court 9.60 m on a side placed asymmetrically within it. It belongs to the sec- ond half of the third century B.C. Like many other houses at Byllis, it experienced many reconstructions during the first century A.D. The peristyle was nearly completely destroyed; only the rooms in the northern and eastern part have survived. The eastern part of</page><page sequence="22">724 MUZAFER KORKUTI AND KARL M.

City plan. the peristyle court yielded the remains of Doric col- umns 0.63 m in diameter, and an intercolumniation of 1.60 m. The main entrance was on the south of the building. The location of the rooms on the southeast- ern part of the house made them very suitable for habitation; the other sides of the house contained storerooms for produce. Of special interest was the excavation of a cistern situated under the northern part of the stadium. The cistern is 50.90 m long and 4.20 m wide. Its depth has not yet been determined, but appears to be at least 6 m. Its location here permitted it to accumulate water running off the higher elevations in the winter when the stadium would not have been in use. The cistern was covered with a system of arches and leveled with stone slabs. Its partitions were sealed with waterproof mortar. Among the buildings of the Roman period, a bath complex erected on the foundation of the gymnasium is particularly noteworthy. The walls of the bath are oriented north-south, following the orthogonal sys- tem of the city. Only the western part of the building has been excavated thus far. The best-preserved por- tion is a central hall, with dimensions 9.20 x 11.80 m. It was divided into two parts by arcades supported on a central colonnade made of bricks. The walls of the bath are built in the opus incertum technique, which appears in Albania in the first half of the second century A.D. In addition to the excavations in the city, investi- gations were also conducted in the necropolis, outside the northwestern part of the ancient city and adjacent to three of the city gates. In the area near one of the city gates six graves were discovered, four of which belong to the second half of the fourth century B.C. They were oriented north-south and were built of slabs of stones placed in the shape of a cist. The funerary goods included pottery, mainly of Apollon- ian manufacture. In that part of the necropolis that lies under a second entrance to the city, four burials of the third-second centuries B.C. were discovered in elaborately built rectangular graves. The graves excavated near the third gate belonged to the Late Antique period and are of interest because they con- tain materials reused from buildings of the first cen- tury A.D. Among these stones were eight inscriptions containing Latin and Latinized names and surnames. The excavations of 1984-1990 showed that the city of Byllis was built according to a very clear orthogonal plan, with the agora as its focus. The agora, situated in the southwestern part of the city, is more or less square in plan, and 200 m on a side, bordered on its southeast by a large and well-preserved theater (fig. 17). Antigonea (excavated by Dhimosten Budina, 1984, 1986-1990).32 Ancient Antigonea, one of the largest cities of northern Epirus, has been the object of sys- tematic excavation focused on clarifying the city plan (figs. 18-19). The excavations concentrated on the complexes of buildings in the center of the city (sector B), which formed an insula, the borders of which were not completely exposed. 32 D. Budina, Iliria 1984:2, 264-66; 1986:2, 259-61; 1987:2, 248; 1989:2, 276-77; 1990:2, 262-63.</page><page sequence="23">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 725 Fig. 19. Antigonea. View of the site. (Photo A. Hykaj) A surface area of 500 m2 was opened. One building (no. 4) was completely uncovered and turned out to be a mint. The building is rectangular in form, 16.6 m long and 12 m wide, and contains six rooms that communicate with one another. The main entrance of the building is on the south, next to the main avenue of the city. Through this entrance (2.40 m wide) one can enter a workshop space. In the north- western corner of this area was discovered a hearth. In its ashes a great amount of bronze corrosion resi- due was excavated, as well as four coins of the Epirote League and nine other coins, which could not be identified but which have the same dimensions as the other four. The coins suggest that the mint was in use during the third-second centuries B.C. In the western part of sector B a peristyle house was discovered. It is rectangular in plan, 18 m long and 8.50 m wide. The house contains three rooms and a corridor running north-south. The main en- trance was on the west. The perimeter walls of the building are made of blocks of ashlar stones, and are 0.65 m in width. The floors of the building are of packed clay. Judging from the finds within the house and its architecture, the building belongs to the third- second centuries B.C. In sector H another peristyle building, named "the building with the mosaics," was discovered. It is rect- angular in plan, 37 x 24 m, oriented east-west with its facade to the south. A characteristic element is the central court with dimensions 6.80 x 7.80 m. The four walls surrounding the court are built from ashlar blocks. The court had been decorated with 12 col- umns, fragments of which were found in the ruins. The columns were made of conglomerate stone; their basal diameter is 0.40 m. The columns were decorated with shallow flutes. The floor of the court was paved with a mosaic made of white stones approximately 2 cm in diameter. The mosaic was found in a damaged condition. It belongs to the third century B.C. Around the court is an irregular corridor onto which rooms of various dimensions open. The living rooms are situated on the west of the house while the other rooms are on the south. The outer walls of this build- ing are ashlar and are bonded with mortar. The main avenue of the city (which runs east-west) has been exposed over a length of nearly 60 m, and averages 8.6 m in width. The road is bordered by ashlar conglomerate blocks, which survive in places to two courses. Fragments of Doric columns and cap- itals indicate that the avenue was lined with a colon- nade whose columns (with square bases) were also made of conglomerate. The style of the columns and the finds along the avenue suggest a third-second century B.C. date. At one end of the avenue a buried pithos was excavated that held fragments of a life-size bronze horseman statue. The left hand and helmet of the rider, as well as the tail of the horse, were skillfully sculpted. One of the main objectives of the systematic re- search at Antigonea has been the location of the streets. The city plan has been reliably reconstructed on the basis of differences in color of the overlying vegetation. Street A is a major artery. It was traced</page><page sequence="24">726 MUZAFER KORKUTI AND KARL M. PETRUSO [AJA 97 Fig. 20. Durres. Cult monument, sixth century B.C. (Photo A. Hykaj) Fig. 21. Durris. Amphitheater. (Photo A.

Sidewalks 1.50 m wide line the street on both sides, 10 cm above the street level. The sidewalks and the street itself were metaled with small stones and a thin gravel. Street B, which runs east-west, crosses street A. It has been traced over 65 m, and has a grade of 5%. It is 5 m in width, and adjacent to walls and entrances of buildings on both sides. The street was paved with medium-sized stones. The construction techniques of the streets are not as elaborate as those of Apollonia, which are gravel- paved and fitted with a gutter; in terms of their width and orientation, however, they are similar. The streets of Antigonea also resemble those of Kassopi in Greece, and are to be dated to the same period. Based on the excavations to date, it is clear that Antigonea was a well-planned city. The circuit wall is separated from the acropolis in its eastern part by a square approximately 100 m on a side. Its agora is sited on the opposite side, close to the circuit wall. The residential quarter of the city was divided by streets that intersect at right angles, directed toward the cardinal points of the compass. Durries (excavated by Hava Hidri, Fatos Tartari, Lida Miraj, Moikom Zeqo, and Halil Myrto, 1984- 1990).33 During the summers of 1984 and 1986 ex- cavations in the swamp of Durres revealed a cult monument (fig. 20). Its construction consisted of a stepped pedestal 1 m high with a lower edge 3.70 x 3.00 m and an upper edge 1.60 x 1.50 m. The mon- ument has three stairs on three sides. On its southern 33 H.

Hykaj) part is a rectangular stylobate block 0.84 x 0.84 x 0.53 m. Atop the stylobate stood 16-fluted Doric col- umns 1.85 m high; Archaic features of their capitals suggest a date in the sixth century B.C. The pedestal was carefully constructed, without mortar, and clamped with lead bolts. The excavators suggest that the monument was part of a sanctuary built in a field not far from the gate of the ancient city of Dyrrachium (Epidamnos). Excavations within the ancient city from 1986 to 1990 were made possible by the clearing of several areas for new construction. Near the school named 16 Shtatori, at a distance of 43 m from the medieval circuit wall of the city, three trenches were excavated, one of which extended 5 m deep without reaching sterile soil. The earliest cultural levels yet found be- long to the first-third centuries A.D. Above these levels are deposits containing finds of the fifth-sixth centuries, and another dating to the 1 lth-15th cen- turies. Sondages were also made in the area where a new post office is to be constructed. Some years earlier a stretch of wall dating to the fifth-sixth centuries had been discovered here. The sondages suggested a date of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. In no case was sterile soil reached since the area was densely populated and inhabited continuously. Excavations during 1989-1990 concentrated on the northeastern part of the cavea of an immense theater (figs. 21-22). The gallery near the northeastern en- trance of the theater was cleared, and found to contain material of late antiquity and the Middle Ages. The clearing of these deposits allowed detailed examina- tion of the architecture of the theater, the northern part of which follows the slope of a hillside. Aside from work done at the eastern entrance of the theater, little progress has been made. The or- chestra level has not yet been reached. Nonetheless, the plan of the entire structure is beginning to emerge. The walls were constructed in the opus in- certum technique, with five lines of bricks and belts. The baths of the city, originally discovered in 1960, have been reexamined in recent years. Part of the outer channel of the bath, simply constructed in brick masonry and covered with tiles and stone slabs, has been mapped. The channel is 0.40 m wide and 0.60 m deep. Other channels of similar workmanship have been excavated. Among dozens of residential buildings containing mosaics that have been excavated at Durr6s, one de- serves special mention. At the corner of Maliq Mugo and Anton Laci streets, a house with a mosaic depict- ing a mythological naval battle was discovered. The mosaic, which was constructed in black and white</page><page sequence="27">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 729 stones, consists of four scenes surrounding a circular emblem in the center, 2.70 m in diameter (fig. 23). Scene 1 is nearly completely preserved, and depicts a hippocamp. Scene 2 is similar, but damaged. Scene 3 shows a cupid riding a dolphin followed by a triton with open arms, and scene 4 shows the same figures in slightly different postures. On the whole, the scenes of this mosaic are carefully composed. Attention is drawn to the cupids on the dolphins, which are an- tithetically arranged. The mosaic is made in the opus tesselatum technique and, judging from the motifs depicted, the excavator dates it to the first century A.D. Finally, in the district of Spitalla, 2 km north of the city of Durris, a stretch of ancient aqueduct was dis- covered. It follows a north-south direction, dropping in elevation to the south. The foundation supports are 1.50 x 1.40 m, and are constructed from local stones set in fine gravel. Triport (excavated by Vasil Bereti, 1984).34 Follow- ing the excavations of 1983, work was carried out in sector C where three cultural levels were isolated. The earliest level is 0.65 m thick and is of the Proto-urban phase, containing materials from the end of the sev- enth century B.C. to the beginning of the fifth century B.C. The second level, which is 0.40 m thick, con- tained materials of the fifth-fourth centuries, while the third level (0.30 m thick) is dated to the third- second centuries. Within the first cultural level is a stretch of wall 24 m long and 1.80-2.50 m wide, built of undressed or slightly dressed stones of medium size. The archaeo- logical material in this level consists of fragments of pithoi, amphoras, hydrias, and skyphoi. Among the amphoras one can distinguish those of type A and type B, as well as so-called East Greek amphoras. These vessels are of Corinthian manufacture. Also found were fragments of Ionic production, repre- sented by fragments of hydrias and skyphoi with bands of brown glaze. The Corinthian and Attic sky- phoi are the best represented. Two fragments of black-figured lekythoi were found. The second cul- tural level is also represented by fragments of trans- port amphoras, skyphoi, and chalices of type C. An increase of Attic and Apollonian production can be documented. These materials belong to the fifth and early fourth centuries B.C. The third cultural level is disturbed, and cannot yet be isolated chronologically with any precision. Submerged at the edge of the sea a wall some 600 m long was discovered. The wall runs more or less east-west, and is parallel to the coastline. It is built of ashlar blocks 2.80-3.30 m long. The wall varies in width. It is not clear what function this wall served, but it seems likely that it was part of the fortification system of the city. Dobier (excavated by Dhimiter Condi, 1984, 1986).35 The villa of Dober on the Pavel River in the district of Sarand? is erected on a small hill on two terraces. The plan of the villa was clear after two campaigns of excavation. It is a rectangular courtyard building oriented northeast-southwest. The central court is 20 m2. The villa is surrounded by a wall that encircles the flat surface of the hill, creating a rectan- gle 47 x 35 m. It is built with ashlar blocks. Only the foundation survives. The building was erected at the highest point on the hill. Its northwestern part was buttressed with a terrace wall. The only gate into the villa is on the northwestern part, and is 1.20 m wide. A voussoir block found there shows that the gate resembled those of the nearby villas at Quka e Ajtojt and Malathre. The archaeological materials found on the floor of this building and near the surrounding wall include fragments of Hellenistic rooftiles, pithoi, and am- phoras of the third-second centuries B.C. Also found were coins dating to the same period. The villa was reconstructed during the first century B.C. It was reinforced with new surrounding walls, which extended its area. Its floorplan was slightly modified. The third period of building in the villa occurred in the eighth-ninth centuries A.D. During that time the villa lost its importance and its previous function. In the southeastern part of the court a small church was built, rectangular in plan, 4.80 x 3.30 m. Butrint (excavated by Astrit Nanaj and Dhimiter Condi, 1986, 1989-1990).36 Excavations on the acrop- olis of the city of Butrint (Buthrotum) were concen- trated inside the circuit wall, in sectors D and E, where a surface of 110 m2 was opened revealing cultural strata 4.00-5.25 m thick. The rich archaeological ma- terial made it possible to define the different phases of activity on the acropolis. The earliest layer belongs to the seventh century B.C. and is 0.50 m thick. The materials found are numerous. Massive vessels include Corinthian am- phoras of type A. Kitchen pots include vessels of local 34 V. Bereti, Iliria 1984:2, 263-64. 35 Dh.

PETRUSO [AJA 97 Fig. 24. Butrint. Gymnasium, with mosaic paving. (Photo A. Hykaj) wheelmade manufacture and imported Corinthian and East Greek types. The material of this layer proves that Butrint was a typical Proto-urban site during the seventh century B.C. The cultural level of the sixth century B.C., 0.40- 0.50 m thick, was deposited horizontally over the entire excavated area. Its archaeological material is rich and varied. Amphoras of type B and glazed skyphoi of the period are represented. There are fragments of hydrias and kraters, decorated with black glaze. Also represented are Corinthian cups bearing vertical painted bands and lines, East Greek cups of type B2, imitation Corinthian cups of local manufacture, and various Attic vessels. The cultural layer of the fifth century B.C. is also represented over the entire excavated area, and is nearly 4 m thick. Amphoras, hydrias, and kraters were found in this level, as were cups, plates, bowls, and other smaller vessels. It is noteworthy that during the fifth century B.C. the Corinthian and East Greek imports diminish, replaced by Attic products. Excavations were also carried out in the gymna- sium, which is situated in the southwestern part of the town (fig. 24). Three rectangular rooms with northeastern-southwestern orientation came to light. The walls of the building were constructed in the opus mixtum technique. One of the rooms is paved with a mosaic and opens onto the street through an entrance 2 m wide. The mosaic covered a surface of 13 x 5.20 m. It is a geometric composition divided into three fields.

Borsh (excavated by Jano Kogi, 1986, 1988, 1990).37 Excavations in the small town of Borsh were conducted in a residential building and in a villa outside the city. The first of these, located in the southwestern part of the hill, is situated on two narrow terraces. It is a two-story building. Five rock-cut steps rise to the sec- ond floor. The building is rectangular in plan, 13 m long and 4.30 m wide. It has a corridor and several rooms in its eastern part. The walls are made of massive ashlar stones. The northern wall of the build- ing was cut into the bedrock to a depth of 2.20 m. Most of the floors of the rooms have also been made 37 J.

Also found within the building were sev- eral coins of Epirus and Finik, which are datable to the third-second centuries B.C. On the southwestern part of the hill, inside the surrounding wall, a surface of about 40 m2 was ex- cavated. The maximum thickness of the cultural layer is 3.70 m. It was created during several periods. The earliest level, some 0.40 m thick, contained fragments of vessels belonging to the Late Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age. The second layer, 1 m thick, contained pottery of the fifth-fourth centuries B.C. The third layer, also 1 m thick, contained ar- chaeological materials datable from the first to the third centuries A.D. Finally, the fourth layer, 1.40 m thick, contained materials of the 12th-15th centuries. These stratigraphic data, though not complete, dem- onstrate the long life of Borsh. On the terraces situated between the town of Borsh and the Adriatic coastline, a fortified dwelling was discovered (fig. 25). It is square in plan, with dimen- sions 10 x 10 m. Its walls were fashioned from mas- sive ashlar blocks. The wall of the building is supported on the natural rock. The corners of the building are round. The wall is two blocks thick (i.e., 1.20 m wide) and is preserved to a height of 2.80 m. The main room of the building is 7.60 x 4.00 m; this is understood to be a second-floor room, erected 2.5 m above the ground. The entire building is sur- rounded by a wall (enclosing an area 22 x 10 m), which was built in the same technique as the building itself. The few remaining archaeological finds in the building date its occupation to the second half of the third century B.C., and it is proposed that this is the period of its construction.

Hykaj) sources, excavations at ancient Apollonia were carried out from 1986 to 1990. In the surrounding eastern wall a gate was discovered, as well as the continuation of the wall some 21 m from the gate (fig. 26). The wall was built with ashlar blocks. It is 2.20 m wide and survives to a height of 1.50 m. Another stretch of wall was discovered in the southeastern part of the circuit wall of the monastery. The outer facade of the wall was cleaned to its foundation, and the oldest courses, which lie under the later wall, were exposed. The earlier wall is 11 m long and was 2.80-3.00 m high. Its facade is stepped in a technique similar to that of the circuit wall of sector C. Of great interest is the complete exposure of the tower complex that defended the southern gate of the city. It has two architectural components: a wall 24 m long and the round tower itself, which is 9.20 m in diameter, situated in the northeastern extremity of the wall. It was built of blocks of local stones that had been chiseled; stylistically this work may be dated to the beginning of the sixth century B.C. In the eastern part of the city, in sector C, traces of a circuit wall 154 m long were found. The wall follows the line of the terrain, and includes obtuse- and acute- angled turns. In this stretch was discovered a square tower that defended one of the gates. The wall was constructed from ashlar blocks of local stone erected in the sixth century B.C. and of ashlar blocks of limestone. These were reused in its reconstruction in the third century B.C.</page><page sequence="31">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 733 Finik (excavated by Astrit Nanaj, 1989, 1990).3" Excavations carried out at the site of ancient Phoinike focused on its circuit wall. The wall, which encircles the top of the hill on which the town was established, was tracked over a length of nearly 100 m, and a new entrance (2.90 m wide) was identified. Since the en- trance is located on sloping terrain, steps were set leading up to it. The right side of the entrance is fortified with a bastion 8.25 m wide. The wall itself is constructed of local blocks of various dimensions, and survives to a height of 2 m. The technique of construc- tion suggests a date in the third century B.C. Within the circuit walls, on the southern side (sector A) a peristyle house was discovered. It has two open courts whose foundations consist of well-dressed lime- stone blocks. The courtyard floors were paved with small stones set in a thick layer of lime. On the lime- stone blocks one can see traces of the 16 columns that surrounded each court. The columns were also made of limestone, and have eight flutes each. The house was supported on a terrace wall built of ashlar blocks. In addition to pottery, eight bronze coins were found in the excavation of this house. They are of the kingdom of Epirus, and may be dated to 234-167 B.C. In the first and second centuries A.D. the house underwent some modifications. One of the courtyards went out of use, to be replaced by a rectangular room. In the third or fourth century two mortar-built walls were constructed on the house, and it went out of use as a residence. Necropolises Apoloni (excavated by Lame Kogi and Vangjel Dimo, 1986-1990).4o Within the tumulus necropolis of Apoloni, one tumulus (no. 3) was excavated; it lies near the southern extremity of the hill, nearly 1 km to the east of the circuit wall. The tumulus was built with earth brought from the nearby hill. It was 2 m high, with a diameter of 15 m. The base of the tu- mulus consisted of a black soil mixed with fragments of cooking wares. A similar layer was found in tu- mulus 2; this suggests that the soil was brought from within the town. Tumulus 3 contained 30 graves, of which only a quarter belong to the seventh-sixth cen- turies, when it was erected. These graves are all in the northern half of the tumulus, while in the south- ern half were graves belonging to the end of the sixth century and the beginning of the third century B.C. Seven burials of the first phase are cremations, while only one is an inhumation. Grave 3 is the earliest one in the tumulus, and is typical of the cremations. The bottom of the grave was a slab of stone 1 m2 on which was set a large bronze lebes containing the ashes of the deceased. On this vessel a larger lebes was placed upside down, with its rim supported on the stone slab. Eighteen other vessels were found scattered around the lebes, includ- ing Corinthian skyphoi, East Greek pyxides, and ko- thons. A large Corinthian olpe with distinctive figure decoration may be dated to the last quarter of the seventh century B.C. The graves of the fourth-third century B.C. are made of tiles in the form of a cist, and with three exceptions, they are inhumations. Their furnishings include Apollonian amphoras and unguentaria. Out- side the graves in an area of 1 m2 at a depth of 0.60 m a deposit of 20 unguentaria was found. Their placement would appear to be connected to ritual activity. Amantia (excavations by Vasil Bereti, 1988- 1990).41 During two summer campaigns, excavations concentrated on the necropolis of the western part of the city, which is situated on the slopes of a chain of three hills extending from the circuit wall of the city. In the area called Shulliri i (alit, 48 graves were located. The graves were very shallowly dug, and covered with stone slabs that had been carefully dressed to fit together. Often the orthostates were buttressed by medium-sized stones on their exteriors. The graves were clustered in groups of four or five. Their orientations differed, as did their dimensions. One grave (no. 27) was exceptional for its architec- ture. It is a cist grave of ellipsoidal plan, 4 x 3 m. Typically, the deceased were laid out in an extended position. Cremation was also practiced; remains were found both within and outside the graves. Grave fur- nishings included hydrias, pelikes, skyphoi, and lek- ythoi, some of them bearing red-figure decoration. Most are of Apollonian manufacture, but Corinthian products were also inventoried. Finally, several rings (three of which were silver) and a silver coin of Cor- cyra were also found. The finds suggest a date for the Shulliri i (alit necropolis of the second half of the fourth and the beginning of the third centuries. At another locale named Qafe e Varrave, a built tomb containing 39 burials was discovered. The com- plex dates to the early Middle Ages.

It has three rooms set in line, the largest of which is 3.22 x 2.75 m. Each room had its own vault. Monu- mental tombs similar to this have been found at other Illyrian urban sites, including Byllis and Matohasanaj. They belong to the late fourth and early third cen- turies B.C. Olympe (excavated by Burhan Dautaj, 1989, 1990).42 Excavations carried out in the small town of Olympe on the River Shushica focused on the ne- cropolis, located on the west slope of a hill nearly 1 km from the circuit wall of this small city. Thirty graves clustered in small groups were exca- vated on the hillside. The graves were uniform in construction, rectangular in plan, and built with lime- stone slabs and covered with a fifth slab. In most cases the slabs were dressed only on their inner sides, and were channeled to fit together. The floors of the graves were of local stone. Their dimensions varied. Typically the deceased were placed in a north-south or northwest-southeast orientation. In most cases the skeletons were not preserved. The inventory included hydrias and pelikes with red-figure scenes and black- glazed lekythoi, bowls, and plates. The red-figure pottery recalls that of Magna Graecia of the end of the fourth century B.C. Also found were silver and bronze ornaments, including bracelets, rings, ear- rings, and glass beads. In three graves coins of Mac- edonia, Epirus, Corfu, and Apollonia were found; all date to the third century B.C. Fig. 28. Shkoder. Circuit wall of the medieval fortifications. (Photo A.

Hykaj) THE MIDDLE AGES Cities and Castles Shkoder (excavated by Skinder Anamali and Hina Spahiu, 1984; Bashkim Lahi and Gezim Hoxha, 1987-1990).43 Excavations in 1984 concentrated on a terrace in the lower part of the city adjacent to the Drin River (fig. 27). The aim of this campaign was to track the surrounding wall and to investigate the oc- cupation of this part of the city. The remains of a medieval wall were discovered, overlying a cultural deposit of late antiquity that was 2.25 m thick. The post-antique materials (including a rich assemblage of pottery, glass vessels, and metal objects) suggest that this site was occupied until the 15th century. The most recent investigations focused on the inner parts of the castle, in sectors A and C. An area of 150 m2 was excavated, which produced new chronological information. Sector C contained deep deposits, which could be distinguished as follows: the Pre-Urban Il- lyrian period, the Urban period, the Late Antique period, and the early Middle Ages. Similar strati- graphic sequences were documented during excava- tions at other parts of the site. During 1988 the excavations concentrated on the lower part of the city in sectors F and G, which are situated on the southern border of the castle and on a terrace on the Drin River, respectively. These sound- ings brought to light many habitation areas dating from the second century B.C. to the 12th century A.D. In sector G, situated in a triangle of land at the confluence of the rivers Bune and Drin, part of a circuit wall of the city dating to the medieval period was discovered. The circuit wall is some 300 m long and over 2 m wide (fig. 28). The wall in its first phase was supported on a broad foundation of undressed limestone; its upper courses are dressed on their tops and bottoms and are bonded with lime mortar. The second phase of the wall, set directly atop the first, was finished in a less sophisticated technique. Danjie (excavated by Gjergj Saragi, 1984, 1986- 1987).44 The medieval city of Danjie is located on a rocky hill 206 masl by the side of the Drin i Zi (fig. 29). The fortified system of the city consists of two pairs of circuit walls. The first, 3,800 m long, sur- rounds an area of 2.5 ha. In its eastern part this wall is reinforced with two horseshoe-shaped towers. The 43 S. Anamali and H. Spahiu, Iliria 1984:2, 269-70; G. Hoxha and B. Lahi, Iliria 1988:2, 262-64; G.

Durres. Early and Middle Medieval pottery. (I. Zaloshnja) second surrounding wall is 328 m long. It is fortified by three towers of rectangular plan, and has four gates. Within the lower circuit wall the ruins of a medieval residential quarter were found. Systematic excava- tions concentrated on the upper terraces, and sought to clarify the settlement's urban development. These soundings focused on the upper part of the city, specifically the residence of a feudal family, the Za- hariajs. This residence is located near the top of a hill, and covers a surface of 0.2 ha. The house was de- signed and built at one time, and was from the start divided into three parts. The central part of the com- plex contained the dwelling of the feudal lord, the sitting room for guests, a guardhouse, a forge, a storage magazine for grain, and a hearth; these rooms surround an open yard. The archaeological remains from this complex date only to the 15th century. The historical sources corroborate this date (Acta et Di- plomata II, p. 659). In the lower part of the city another residential complex was excavated; it had its own fortification system. Three house complexes were exposed, as well as the foundations of the circuit wall, some 90 m in length. During the cleaning of the surrounding wall the main gate of the city was located. Its architecture is reminiscent of that of Kruje. On the whole, the excavations in the medieval castle of Danji have provided a clear picture of the life of a feudal family and the architectural complexity of a small Albanian city in the medieval period.

Circular colonnaded structure, constructed in the late fifth/early sixth centuries A.D. (Photo A. Hykaj) southwestern part of the castle and at the location of the new post office in the modern city have provided a great deal of information on the occupation of the city in the Late Antique period and the Middle Ages. In order to study the stratigraphy of the city near the circuit wall, excavations were conducted adjacent to a stretch of the city wall and a tower complex dating to the fifth-sixth centuries A.D. An area of 76 m2 was opened, and a cultural layer some 2 m thick was found. The pottery spanned the period from the fifth to the 14th centuries (fig. 30). Near the ancient baths excavated some years ago in the foundations of the Alexander Moisiu theater was discovered a large and architecturally impressive monument, round in plan (fig. 31). Its floor, a sur- rounding colonnade, and a podium in its center are the best-preserved components of the structure. The colonnade is 40 m in diameter. Three full columns and fragments of several others were excavated. The columns and the capitals are of white marble. The capitals are adorned with acanthus leaves, and their corners are in the form of rams' heads. The style is typical of the Early Christian period. The floor of the monument had been covered with crystalline slabs that overlay a stratum of waterproof mortar. The podium in the center of the monument was built with stones and mortar in the form of a circle with a diameter of 4.50 m and a height of 4.80 m. Its use is not yet understood. Excavations were carried outjust outside and to the east of the colonnade. New architectural components were discovered, including a porch, a number of en- closures in the form of concentric bands, and the main entrance of the monument. These excavations brought to light the total area of the monument, whose diameter is 72 m. Excavations outside the mon- ument yielded materials belonging to the fifth and sixth centuries A.D., including coins. In the upper cultural layer both inside and outside the structure 41 built graves, gabled with rooftiles, were found. These belong to the seventh and eighth centuries. This monument was a one-story building, which has no known exact parallels in the Early Christian world. The large area of the portico suggests that it functioned as a public area.</page><page sequence="36">738 MUZAFER KORKUTI AND KARL M. PETRUSO [AJA 97 f77 k Kk Jim Aj 9r t' lif Fig. 32. Byllis. Mosaic. (Photo A. Hykaj) Byllis (excavated by Skender Mugaj, 1984, 1986- 1990).46 Research into the Late Antique and medieval periods at Byllis have concentrated in recent years on three basilicas and the circuit wall of the city. Basilica B has been completely exposed. Its dimen- sions and the sophistication of its architecture make it a distinctive building. It consists of three naves, one apse, a transept, a narthex, an exonarthex, an atrium, and an annex at its south end. The three naves are 24.70 m long and the transept is 4.70 m wide. The walls are built with stones and mortar and survive to a height of 3 m. The decorative appoint- ments adorning the building were rich: the mosaic floors of the naos and transept and the architectural sculpture are most impressive (fig. 32). The cornices, columns, capitals, and the screen were characterized by plastic ornamentation with geometric, floral, and zoomorphic motifs. Among the mosaics, that of the exonarthex is par- ticularly noteworthy. It consists of two scenes from the life of fishermen and shepherds. The first scene is distinctive for its very naturalistic depiction of ma- rine life. The pastoral scene, with figures of sheep, goats, trees, and three shepherds, is also very natur- alistic. The scenes are reminiscent of those found in the basilica at Arapaj near Durries. The transept of basilica B is 21 m long and 4.90 m wide, and contains a heavily damaged mosaic. The baptistery is rectangular (7.80 x 7.40 m), with a cru- ciform basin paved with mosaic and, in a later phase, slabs of marble. The mosaics of the naos and transept are of interest since they contained inscriptions in Greek, most of which are legible. All in all, the mosaics in this basilica are distinctive for the care taken in their production; they are generally of higher quality than others in the region. They demonstrate the ex- 46 S.

Basilica C is located in the northwestern part of the central square, west of the Roman theater. The basil- ica has three naves, a presbytery, a narthex, an exo- narthex flanked by two alcoves, and other rooms. Its maximum dimensions are 33.00 x 22.80 m. The central nave is paved with slabs of stone. The apsidal presbytery is paved with mosaics. The alcove south of the narthex is paved with a multicolored mosaic with geometric motifs and a Greek inscription in its center. The mosaic of the presbytery was heavily damaged. In the preserved part of the center is a scene with apostolic sheep, a portrait of a man, and a three-line inscription. Fragments of stone columns, Ionic capitals, and other architectural components were found in the ruins of this building. The datable finds within the basilica are from the middle of the fourth century A.D. Basilica D is situated in the northern part of the city inside the ancient circuit wall but outside the Byzan- tine circuit wall. The building is well preserved, and consists of three naves, a presbytery, a narthex, and an atrium with four porticoes. The maximum dimen- sions are 45.25 x 96.15 m. The naves are separated from one another by a high stylobate on which stone columns support brick arches. In this basilica archi- tectural sculpture is relatively rare, but it is rich in multicolored mosaics. The best preserved of them is the mosaic of the narthex, while that of the central nave is more heavily damaged in its center. The motifs and colors used in the mosaics change from floor level to floor level; the motifs in the narthex are mainly decorative, while those of the central nave have a distinctively Christian character (e.g., the entrance to Paradise and the rivers of Paradise). Six inscriptions were found in the floors of this basilica, four of which are fully preserved. A bishop's name also found in Basilica C occurs in one of these inscriptions. The building appears to have been con- structed originally in the first century. Also examined in recent excavations at Byllis was the western city wall of the Late Antique period and early Middle Ages. Four different building techniques have been documented, dating to the first, fourth, and sixth centuries A.D. In the fourth century A.D. a new city gate was erected (fig. 33). Blocks bearing Greek and Latin inscriptions were found built into the gate.</page><page sequence="38">740 MUZAFER KORKUTI AND KARL M. PETRUSO [AJA 97 Fig. 34. Vlorie. View of the excavations. (Photo A. Hykaj) Vlore (excavated by Damian Komata, 1986- 1989).47 The main objective of excavations carried out for many years in the city of Vlore (ancient Aulona) was to document the extent of the circuit wall and clarify its stratigraphy and date. The excavated part of the wall is 33.80 m long, 3.35 m wide, and survives to a height of 1.50 m (fig. 34). The wall was con- structed in two phases. The first phase was built in the opus mixtum technique, using both bricks and undressed stones of medium size. The second phase is similar in design and workmanship, and preserves traces of an arch and a staircase that led to its top. The first phase of the wall may be dated to the fourth century A.D., while the second belongs to the sixth- seventh centuries. The earliest archaeologically data- ble finds in this area are few; they belong to the third century A.D. Materials of the fifth and sixth centuries are more noticeable, and testify to intensive occupa- tion of the city of Aulona in late antiquity. Butrint (excavated by Kosta Lako, 1990).48 The excavations of 1990 focused on the clearing of a build- ing south of a gymnasium and near the circuit wall of the Middle Ages. The excavations brought to light a triple-apsed building complex whose walls are pre- served in parts to 4.5 m high and 0.85 m thick. The building is symmetrical in construction, 17 m long and 15 m wide. Its entrance is on the western side and is 2.10 m wide. The masonry of the building is irregular in general, containing small and medium- sized stones bonded with lime mortar. A leveling band made of three courses of bricks was set at a height of 1.80 m, and a second was set 2 m above this. The existence of this impressive building in this part of the city suggests that other important structures re- main to be found here as well. Elbasan-Kala (excavated by Ylli Cerova, 1987- 1988).49 In two summer campaigns the southwestern part of the castle of Elbasan was investigated. An area of 185 m2 was opened to reveal cultural strata some 4 m in thickness.

Zaradishte (excavations by Petraq Damko, 1986- 1988).50 The castle of Zaradishte is located on a low hill between the villages of Vaskop and Polene about 8 km west of the city of Korcgi. The circuit wall of the castle follows the contours of the terrain; it has a perimeter length of about 1 km, surrounding an area of 3.5 ha. The wall is built from undressed stones and lime mortar mixed with gravel, and is 3.30 m wide. Its best-preserved parts are the northern and south- ern stretches. Excavations inside the surrounding wall focused on a basilica 24 m long and 16 m wide. Its walls are not well preserved. The excavations brought to light its northern and southern naves. In the south- western part of the baptistery there is a circular font with an outer diameter of 2.20 m (fig. 35). The floor of the baptismal area is paved with bricks, while the font is floored with stone slabs. The floor around the altar has been paved with marble slabs (of which only a few fragments remain) and a layer of lime support- ing them. The archaeological material recovered consists mainly of everyday pottery and building materials. Two main phases can be distinguished at the site of Zaradishte: the third-fourth century A.D., when the site was unfortified; and the fifth-sixth century, dur- ing which time the circuit wall, the basilica, and other buildings were constructed. Kalaja e Pecies (excavated by Luan Perzhita 1986- 1989).51 The castle of Pece is situated on a hill with a very important strategic position at the confluence of the Drini i Bardhi and Lumi rivers. It is today bor- dered on three sides by the reservoir for a hydro- electric plant. The investigators concentrated on the eastern side of the castle, where a surface area of 75 m2 was opened. At the highest point of the hill exca- vations were carried out at the circuit wall, where a horseshoe-shaped tower was discovered (fig. 36). The castle is of irregular form owing to the local terrain. It is 445 m long and encloses a surface area of 0.70 ha. The width of the wall varies from I to 2.80 m. It is built of undressed stones bonded with lime mortar. The gate of the castle was found at its south- ern part. It is 1.50 m wide and built of undressed stones. In the eastern side of the castle was discovered a single-naved church 11.50 x 5.85 m in maximum dimensions. On its eastern end the church has an apse. The floor of the church had been paved with rectangular bricks. The plan of the church and the archaeological finds within date it to the fifth-sixth centuries, postdating the circuit wall of the site. 50o P.

The depth of the graves from the modern surface is about 0.50-0.70 m. The graves were rectangular in plan and of various dimensions. They are made of local stone and lime- stone slabs. The orientations of the burials differ, and there seems to be no pattern. While most appear to Fig. 37. Koman. Medieval cemetery of cist graves. (Photo A. Hykaj) 52 H.

In general, the preserva- tion of the skeletons was not good. The inventory of the graves is rich and varied. It consists of tools and weapons of iron and bronze and ornaments of silver and glass. Among the tools and weapons the most frequent are knives of different types, spearheads, and axes. The most common or- naments are fibulas, bracelets, necklaces, earrings, belt buckles, hair coils, and a great number of beads. Prosek-Mirdite (excavated by Nikollk Doda, 1986).5" Excavations at the medieval site of Prosek were carried out on two small hills some 300 m apart. In all, 42 graves were discovered. They are of two different types: cists constructed from local slabs and simple pits with no architecture. No particular ori- entation was respected. The deceased were placed directly on the floors of the tombs, on their back with arms typically placed on the pelvis. The inventory of the graves is varied. Most common are fibulas, rings, necklaces, and bracelets of bronze; iron knives, spear- heads, belt buckles, and pendants were also found. This material is similar to that discovered in the me- dieval cemeteries of Koman, Shurdhah, and Kruje, which are dated to the sixth-eighth centuries. Rapcke and Grabove (excavated by Namik Bodi- naku, 1984).54 The objective of research at these two sites was to supplement our knowledge of early me- dieval culture in Albania. At Rapcke a surface area of 30 m2 was opened, yielding six cist graves. They were oriented east-west. The deceased were placed on their back in an extended position. The finds within the graves were few, represented by two finger rings and three pairs of bronze earrings. At Grabove, a surface area of 140 m2 was opened, bringing to light a medieval cemetery in which 38 graves were excavated. In architecture, burial tech- nique and orientation they resemble the burials of Rapcke. Many of them were devoid of finds, while a few contained jewelry made of bronze and glass. Among these finds, a pair of earrings in the form of a bunch of grapes, can be dated to the 12th century. INSTITUTI ARKEOLOGJIK TIRANE, ALBANIA 53 N. Doda, Iliria 1986:2, 272; and A.
