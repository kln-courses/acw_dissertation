Time-lapse photography of a growing field mush- room, an expanding plasmodium of a true slime mold, and the production of sporangia at the tips of sporangio- phores of a common mold are used at the beginning of the film in anticipa- tion of more precise discussions of these groups. The mushroom is used as an example of fungal growth; the similar- ities of fungal morphology, nutrition, and ecology are discussed. There is a brief discussion of fungal reproduction in which the differences between sex- ual and asexual methods are illustrated. The ecological position of fungi as saprophytes or parasites is discussed. The film follows a logical sequence of events. Most students are familiar with mushrooms and thus are prepared to go from the known structure of the "fruiting body" to the unknown sub- terranean structures, the hyphae and mycelium. A discussion of reproduction is a logical next step, and the film quickly distinguishes between sexual and asexual types. Fungal nutrition is very well illustrated by growing a PÃ©nicillium sp. on starch agar and sub- sequently staining it with iodine. The demonstration of the action of extra- cellular enzymes is quite effective. This sequence on fungal nutrition is the most valuable part of the film. Dramatic time lapse photography of the growth of the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum in the intro- ductory sequence of the film is never pursued. There is no identification of the plasmodium (not even what it is), or how it is meaningful in a film about fungi. One is simply left to wonder why this yellow material was shown. The guide that accompanies the film includes four paragraphs concerning the use of P. polycephalum in the classroom, but there is absolutely no reference in the film to the organism, and thus any effective use of the organ- ism as a teaching tool is completely lost. The sequence showing the plas- modium should have been left out, or it should have been pursued by mean- ingful discussion. Two important errors occur in the discussion of the life history of the mushroom. Through a time-lapse se- quence of drawings, a single basidio- spore is seen to germinate and pro- duce hyphae (the term mycelium is not used until much later). The hyphae are never shown to be septate, although all basidiomycete hyphae produce sep- tations, an important distinction be- tween this group and the phycomycetes. Also, in the film, the hyphae eventu- ally clump together and produce the fruiting body, the mushroom. There is no recognition that mushrooms occur only from a dikaryotic (n+n) mycelium, a condition brought about by some sort of sexual interaction. Admittedly, the sexual behavior of mushrooms is too complex to be fully explained here; however, the failure to mention it is misleading, especially since it is er- roneously illustrated. The music has a futuristic, ethereal quality that I found most distracting. It is demanding enough to distract from the narration. The anthropomorphic and teleolog- ical explanations of fungal behavior are destructive to the cause-and-effect scientific explanation desired in a film such as this. Both human behavior and directional evolution are included in statements such as: "The mushroom proceeds to embark on its biological function to release millions of spores into the atmosphere," "fulfilled its bio- logical purpose, the mushroom begins to wilt," and "devise the most extraor- dinary shapes for dispersing their spores." Such statements bring the student into direct conflict with the concepts of biological evolution; al- though they simplify explanations, they should be avoided. While the photography is quite ac- ceptable and the sequence on fungal nutrition is effective, I would not use this film even for an introductory les- son. It is too ambitious in trying to cover too much material; thus, it is misleading. Correcting the misconcep- tions would take too much time. - ; James D .
