Hiller University of Duisburg Germany Copyright © 1999 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT In the field of vehicle rollover, the quantification of occu- pant safety provided by a passenger car has, up until now, been quite difficult. As existing test procedures such as FMVSS 208 and FMVSS 216 mainly aim at the structural safety of vehicles, there is a lack of standard- ized injury criteria for the occupants. The results pre- sented in this paper are based on the experience gained during the development of a rollover detection system. For this purpose a large number of rollover simulations using the modular vehicle modeling program Fasim_C++ have been conducted. This multi-body simulation tool has been developed at the Department of Mechatronics, and provides the possibility to model complex three- dimensional vehicle models and include complex mecha- tronic elements like hydraulic systems, actuators, sen- sors and electronic controllers. Furthermore the occupant behavior during rollover has been studied. For this purpose the commercial occupant simulation toolset MADYMO is used. Various accident scenarios are mod- eled using Fasim_C++ and the subsequent occupant behavior is analyzed in MADYMO. By discussing the simulation results of various rollover maneuvers, this paper suggests requirements for a stan- dardized rollover test procedure that focuses more on occupant safety than the existing regulations. INTRODUCTION Optimized occupant protection in passenger cars today is a fundamental requirement. Featuring front bags, side bags, belt pretensioners and load limiters, existing restraint systems provide a high level of protection. Addi- tionally so now that knee bags and head protecting side bags are starting to come onto market. For the activation of these protective devices comprehensive sensor sys- tems are required which can react with the appropriate deployment of restraint systems, taking into account any relevant accident parameter. For this reason future sen- sor concepts must supply information about vehicle sta- bility, approaching obstacles, vehicle interior conditions, accident type and crash severity [6]. Thus the future restraint system should guarantee occupant protection in frontal, side and rear impact as well as during rollover. Figure 1 . Occupant fatalities in traffic crashes in USA in 1 997[1 8] . Looking at the traffic crash statistics (Figure 1 ) it can be seen that the involvement rate of rollover crashes in all occupant fatalities in 1997 was higher than 22 percent. Although this rate is quite high, until now there has been only little investigation in occupant protection during roll- over. As the existing test procedures mainly aim at the structural safety of vehicles, there has been not much pressure on the international automotive industry to develop a sophisticated protection system that takes care of the occupant as well in rollover situations. ROLLOVER CRASH TEST STANDARDS Contrary to other crash types a fully developed test pro- cedure for the quantification of occupant safety in rollover crashes does not exist. Subsequent a brief overview of the existing regulations that are involved with rollover safety is given here. 694</page><page sequence="2">FMVSS 208 AND SAE J21 1 4 - The tilted table rollover test procedures according to FMVSS208 and SAE J21 1 4 are conducted using a platform with 23° tilt angle. The vehicle is thrown laterally from that platform at a speed of 48 km/h. Figure 2. Tilted table test configuration. The FMVSS 208 rollover test procedure stipulates one Hybrid III Dummy placed on the driver seat. A measure- ment of the dummy loads is not applied. No recommen- dations for maximum occupant loads are given but it is stated that all doors must keep closed and that no dummy ejection should occur during the roll movement. The dolly rollover according to SAE J21 14 recommended practice has mainly been established in order to stan- dardize the tilted table rollover test between different test facilities. It also suggest the observation of the vehicle and occupant kinematics, but it does not determine maxi- mum occupant loads SAE J857 curved guide rail - / z a / ^ / X ramp / / /•/ V=8Ū km/h 0,35 m I Figure 3. Curved rail-ramp test configuration. Although the SAE J857 recommended practice for roll- over tests was drawn up quite a few years ago it should be mentioned here because it provides a realistic simula- tion of passenger car rollover accidents. Using a curved rail-ramp procedure (Figure 3) a screw movement is applied to the vehicle at a speed of 80 km/h. To obtain occupant loading and movement during the test SAE J857 suggests use of anthropomorphic test devices, but there is no detailed information given about dummy types or injury criteria. CRASH TEST STANDARDS RELATED TO ROLLOVER - There are some further international regu- lations that play an important role in rollover safety: • FMVSS 216, • FMVSS 201 and • ECE R16. FM VSS21 6 deals with the structural safety of the vehicle. Its purpose is to reduce deaths and injuries due to the crushing of the roof into the passenger compartment in rollover accidents. To pass the roof crush test the roof structure must be stiff enough to prevent excessive defor- mation when applying a force to the roof frame of ivi? times the unloaded vehicle weight with a velocity of less than 13 millimeters per Second. FMVSS 201 specifies requirements to afford protection to occupants in interior head impact. The standard estab- lishes the performance criterion HIC(d) that shall not exceed 1000 when a special headform hits the interior lining of the passenger compartment. Contacts with the windows are not considered. In Europe there actually exists no regulation that directly deals with vehicle rollover. ECE R16 merely is related to this subject by setting forward the requirements for seat belts in various accident situations. INJURY MECHANISMS DURING ROLLOVER To understand the injury mechanisms that occur in roll- over crashes it is first necessary to analyze the character- istics of typical rollover accidents. After this it is possible to draw conclusions about resulting occupant kinematics and related injury potentials. ROLLOVER CHARACTERISTICS AND KINEMATICS - As shown in Figure 1, rollover accidents primarily occur in single vehicle crashes. According to [11] leaving the roadway with the involvement of an object struck, such as a boulder, a ditch or an embankment along-side the road is the most likely cause for a rollover. Accident situations where a vehicle skids laterally impacting an object, such as a curb or soft ground , which trips the vehicle into roll- over are also of importance (see [1] and [2]). In rollover crashes vehicles carry out complex 3-dimen- sional movements in space. A representative example would be the trajectory of a passenger car in an embank- ment maneuver, as shown in Figure 4. In that particular computer simulation the vehicle drives at an angle of 12° positive x-direction and starts to roll when the left front wheel reaches the embankment. At the end of the maneuver the vehicle has rolled 180° around the x-axis of the vehicle local coordinate system. In this maneuver the vehicle conducts rotational and translational move- ments around and along all three axes. But only the translational movements in the direction of the longitudi- nal and the vertical vehicle axes, and the rotational move- ment around the longitudinal vehicle axis, are significantly large. Neglecting the small pitch angle that occurs in that maneuver the movement can be described as a screw motion along an inclined axis. 695</page><page sequence="3">0.5v. - r r. - Z[m] ļ - r r I j „ I r. - «rh ..

Another typical rollover trajectory is shown in Figure 5. In that computer simulation a passenger car is skidding lat- erally against a curb and rolls 380° around its longitudinal axis. As the maneuver is nearly free from yaw and pitch motions as well as from translation in longitudinal direc- tion it can be described as a pure rolling motion, that is superimposed on a translational motion in the vertical plane. 1.0 J / j _ _ _ļ_ i _ L j 0.8 , " - 0.6 , 1 ; Xi- - i - . -I - * * - HS||^ , ; - - . - ■°04A 1 - - - y - • ' j X [m] y [m] 0 0 8 7 6 5 4 3 Figure 5. Trajectory of a passenger car skidding laterally against a curb. Regarding these two maneuvers, the vehicle kinematics in rollover accidents can be divided into two groups: 1. screw motion along an inclined axis and 2. pure rolling motion with translation in the vertical plane. The first group covers rollover accidents that involve impacted objects, such as boulders (working as a ramp), ditches or embankments. The second group covers tripped rollovers that occur in an impact with a curb or other obstacles, or respectively in a sideslip through soft soil. OCCUPANT KINEMATICS - The typical occupant motions that occur in rollover crashes correspond to the vehicle kinematics. Consequently the two representative rollover kinematics described in the previous section gen- erate two different kinds of occupant kinematics. In the initial stage of a screw motion rollover the occupant tends to move relatively slowly with respect to the passenger compartment. When the vehicle first hits an obstacle, i. e. the ground, the occupant starts to move rapidly towards the side the impact has come from. As the pure roll motion type is initiated by an impact it causes an immedi- ate and rapid displacement of the occupant towards the impacted side. Thus there is a high risk of occupant injury in the very early stage of the rollover. Occupant kinematics will be analyzed more closely later in the Simulation Results section. INJURIES - Like is set forward in the FMVSS 208 it is a basic requirement for occupant protection in a rollover accident that the occupant stays within the passenger compartment. Due to mandatory seat belt use laws, ejec- tion has become quite seldom. Thus today the injury mechanisms of the restrained occupant are of major interest [4]. As the belt keeps the torso of the occupant in place (within a certain range), the arms and especially the head, face and neck regions sustain a substantial number of injuries [8]. According to [4] intrusions of the roof up to 15cm do not cause serious injuries for restrained occupants, but the accelerations induced by the rolling movement due to the impact cause excessive head motions (see Figures 13 and 14). These head motions are responsible for com- pression, tension and bending loads in the cervical spine. Furthermore, with an unpretensioned lap and shoulder belt a significant torso displacement still occurs that makes contacts with the roof, the window or the A- or B- pillars very likely. How far the maximum occupant loads defined in existing crash regulations are applicable in these load cases still has to be examined, but, especially for the lateral bending motion of the neck that is relevant in many rollover accidents, there are no limits set forward in any regulation. At least many publications such as [13], [17], [5], and [15] have analyzed the biomechanical properties of the human neck under various loads and indicated some of the possible injuries. ROLLOVER SIMULATION For the development of a rollover detection system com- puter simulation plays an important role [9]. Vehicle dynamics simulation, for example, provides the possibility to test out in advance various sensors and algorithms for rollover detection. Furthermore occupant simulation can be used to establish trigger times for rollover detection. In the field of vehicle dynamics, the modular computer program Fasim_C++ has proved to be extremely helpful. For occupant simulation the commercial simulation toolset MADYMO is used. MADYMO provides sophisti- cated and validated multi-body models of crash test dum- mies, that can be placed in any accident scenario [12]. The following describes the simulation tools used for the development of the rollover detection system, ROSE, of Robert Bosch GmbH [14], Various accident scenarios are modeled with Fasim_C++ and the resulting occupant behavior is analyzed in MADYMO. For this purpose posi- tion and orientation data versus time, computed by Fasim_C++ can serve as input data for the MADYMO occupant simulations. 696</page><page sequence="4">Figure 6. Modular structure of a vehicle model in Fasim_C++ THE SIMULATION TOOL FASIM_ C++ - The multi-body simulation tool Fasim_C++ has been developed. Its main task is to support the development of vehicle controllers [10]. Controller systems such as antilock braking systems (ABS), vehicle dynamics control (VDC or ESP ) [19] or rollover detection are currently developed with the help of Fasim_C++. For that purpose an appropriate vehicle model, included in a versatile and flexible simulation envi- ronment, is required. This simulation environment has to be able to simulate different vehicle types or models with- out any recompilation. The multi-body vehicle model of a typical passenger car has to have a modular structure, so that single components of the vehicle may be exchanged depending on the simulation task. The modular structure of a passenger car, as it is used in Fasim_C++ is shown in the right hand portion of Figure 6. This modular structure enables the user to switch easily between various vehicle models. Since each module is independent and has its own data file it is, for example, possible to use the sub-module McPherson front suspen- sion in various vehicles, and in a rear as well a front axle configuration. Some changes in the data files (dimen- sions, masses, inertia, etc.) only have to be carried out to effect these changes. The modular concept was realized using the program- ming language C++. In this way it is possible to decide during runtime, which configuration of a vehicle is used without any recompilation of the program. Fasim_C++ contains a large library of different vehicle modules like wheel suspensions, tire models, powertrains, engines, engine suspensions, controllers, sensors, elasticities, rigid and flexible car bodies, several hydraulic braking systems, a driver and an environment model. The similar structure of the modules makes it easy to expand the library by adding new modules. For modeling new modules, first the physical model of a real mecha- nism is generated (abstraction). The type and complexity of the physical model depends on later simulation tasks, so in this step it is very important to specify exactly the requirements. To transform the physical model into a mathematical one, appropriate procedures for solving the arising system of differential algebraic equations (DAE) has to be found (mathematical modeling). After this the system of equations is transformed into source code in C++. For further information about the generation of the equations of motions in Fasim_C++ see [10]. The mechanical part of the vehicle is modeled as a three dimensional complex multi-body system consisting of rigid and flexible bodies and closed kinematic loops. More detailed information about the principles of multi- body simulation can be found in [7] and [20]. Figure 7 shows the topological structure of the complete vehicle, that has been used for the rollover simulations presented in this paper. The vehicle system is described with 697</page><page sequence="5">respect to the inertial system by a fictitious joint with six degrees of freedom, so that all degrees of freedom of a rigid body can be taken into consideration.

Firstly the sensor including the ROSE rollover detection algo- rithm was implemented. Thus it was now possible to analyze the trigger behavior in any simulated maneuver. To incorporate the possible collision between the vehicle and different obstacles, e.g between wheel rim and a curbstone, the original model of the power train was extended by an impact model. For this purpose a simple Kelvin-Voigt model, which consists of a parallel array of a spring and a damper element connected to an impact mass, is used [10]. Furthermore it was necessary to enhance the modeling of the environment. For the simulation of embankment and ramp maneuvers it is now possible to configure sur- faces like those shown in Figure 8. Validation - The application of the modeling techniques to the analysis of real-world vehicle problems shall be illustrated by the simulation of an embankment rollover. As leaving the road is statistically the most likely cause of a rollover situation, it is very important that this maneuver is detected by a rollover protective system. Therefore, a full scale rollover test with a middle class car (Figure 7) has been investigated in detail. ^Lv ^ b _ Street x / ^ ~^' p=0,45 ' Ramp V Y s''' ' Embankment 1 . 7^' - Embankment 2 - B I- Figure 8. Example of the surface contour used for rollover simulation As shown in Figure 9 a very good correlation between the simulation and the real experiment has been achieved. Only when the car body hits the ground does the simula- tion yield wrong results, as the contact interactions between the exterior of the vehicle and the environment have not been modeled. Since this phase of the rollover is no longer of importance for rollover detection these errors have been neglected: When the car body hits the ground rollover detection must have taken place long ago. The sensor module that has been implemented in the vehicle during simulation is fed with translational acceler- ation and angular velocity data by the chassis module, and gives back the trigger signal for controlling the roll- over protective devices. The instant of rollover detection is visualized by a cone which has been added to the ani- mation and which becomes visible above the hood when the sensor triggers (see Figure 9). Unfortunately in this particular case a recording equipment failure means that this comparison can only be qualitative. However other customer data confirms the quantitative validity of the model.

Comparison of simulation with full scale rollover With the validated model described above it is possible to perform parameter studies in order to optimize the roll- over sensing concept, and to establish trigger times for 698</page><page sequence="6">rollover protective devices like belt pretensioners and window bags. By combining Fasim_C++ and MADYMO an application and development environment can be formed, as illustrated in Figure 10. OCCUPANT SIMULATION USING MADYMO - MADYMO (MAthematical DYnamic MOdel) is a commer- cial computer package which has mainly been developed for studying occupant behavior during car crashes [12]. MADYMO combines in one simulation program the capa- bilities offered by multi-body and finite element tech- niques. Furthermore, MADYMO offers a set of standard force models e.g. for belts, airbags and the contact of bodies with each other or with their surroundings. Con- sequently, it also allows assessments to be made on the suitability of various restraint systems. One main feature of MADYMO is the availability of validated data-base of crash-test dummy multi-body models, which are suitable to study injuries sustained by accident victims with a high accuracy. The "50th percentile male Hybrid III Dummy" represents an "average" of the USA adult male popula- tion. It is modeled as a multi-body system and has 57 degrees of freedom. The interaction between dummy and passenger compartment can be represented by geo- metric primitives such as planes, ellipsoids and cylinders attached to the bodies of the multi-body system (Figure 11). As in rollover maneuvers there often occurs a slip movement between the dummy body and the seat belt, a finite element belt model for the seat belt was imple- mented. As the roof structure is assumed to be stiff enough to prevent collapsing, no intrusions of the roof are taken into account (compare [4]). In order to be able to make estimations about the occu- pant behavior when the vehicle is rolling on its bodywork the exterior contour of the vehicle was also included in the MADYMO contact modeling. SIMULATION RESULTS -The following table gives an overview of all the rollover and close-to-rollover situations that have been simulated with Fasim_C++ in order to ver- ify the ROSE-Algorithm. Especially in rollover situations, the detailed examination of the occupant behavior in MADYMO is of importance since rollover detection has to take place early enough for an "on time" deployment of the protective devices. Without Rollover Maneuver Simulation Purpose serpentine resonance behavior of the sensor skidding against curbstone effect of lateral acceleration pulse low ramp (2 wheels) triggering behavior close to rollover jump over ramp (4 wheels) behavior during free fall circular course effect of transvers acceleration gentle embankment triggering behavior close to rollover With Rollover Maneuver Simulation Purpose rolling without ground contact trigger time steep embankment trigger time skidding against curbstone trigger time high ramp (2 wheels) trigger time As defined in the section "Rollover characteristics and Kinematics", vehicle kinematics in rollover accidents can be divided into two groups. As a representative simula- tion for the group one (see above) the simulation results of an embankment maneuver are discussed as follows. Whereas, as representative for the second group (see above) a curbstone impact is analyzed. Embankment Rollover - In Figure 12 an animation sequence of the MADYMO occupant simulation of the embankment maneuver is shown (Figure 4). For that simulation the position and orientation data created by Fasim_C++ is used to describe the movements of the passenger compartment until the car body hits the ground. In order to be able to study rolling when the car body is in contact with the ground the simulation is con- tinued in MADYMO. In Figure 12 it can bee seen that the restrained driver (50th percentile male Hybrid III Dummy) experiences only small displacements during the first 90° of the rollover. Right when the car hits the ground the left shoulder and arm come into contact with the drivers door, and the head moves fast diagonally forward and toward the side window. The severity of the impact to the head is proportional to the vehicle height and the embankment height. In the context of these occupant kinematics, similar effects have been observed in ramp rollover simulations where the vehicle is passing over the ramp with the right hand side wheels. Here the impact severity is propor- tional to the vehicle velocity and the ramp height. Curbstone Rollover - Due to the plastic deformation that occurs in the vehicle body and suspension components during the curbstone impact the multi-body model does not give a very good representation of the subsequent vehicle behavior, as was shown during full scale crash testing. Consequently actual crash test angular velocity and translational acceleration data (customer confiden- tial) is used to drive the occupant simulation in MADYMO. The occupant kinematics that typically occur in a rollover accident induced by lateral skidding against an obstacle are described in Figure 13. Due to the lateral impact the vehicle is abruptly decelerated, whereas the driver is still traveling at the initial lateral speed, and due to the sus- pension preload he is slightly inclined towards the door. The seat belt is not able to hold the driver firmly in the seat and so he moves quickly towards the left hand side door. The impact of the left arm, the shoulder and the head takes place long before the vehicle has rolled 90°. The severity of the head impact, as well as the roll angle at which the head impact occurs, are directly related to the lateral skid velocity of the vehicle. A belt pretensioner strongly influences the occupant kine- matics. Comparing the trajectory of the dummy head in an 180° curbstone rollover at 36km/h without a belt pre- tensioner (dotted line in Figure 14) with the same maneu- ver using a pretensioner (solid line in Figure 14) the following conclusions can be made: 699</page><page sequence="7">Figure 1 0. Using Fasim_C++ and MADYMO 3D as calibration tools for ROSE Figure 1 1 . Dummy sitting in the passenger compartment On the one Hand the reduction in the vertical direction is very helpful for occupant protection as it increases the safety space. This is especially important when roof intrusion occurs, or the vehicle is a cabriolet. However due to the stronger restraint of the upper torso the forces in the neck are increased, and the head moves much faster towards the window. That leads to a higher impact force when the head hits the window. Although the lateral displacement of the upper torso is reduced the lateral holding force of the shoulder belt is not high enough to avoid the head contacting the window. Thus in this situa- tion it would be very beneficial to deploy a window bag to cushion the impact. • the displacement of the dummy in vertical direction is reduced and • the lateral displacement of the dummy head is increased. CONCLUSIONS Rollover sensing is a new feature on the market, and it represents a big enhancement in the restraint systems area. The idea is to include the rollover function into the actual air bag and seat belt concept so that it will improve the performance of existing restraint systems. A major problem however will be the application of such a system to real vehicles. This is because at the moment there exists no safety standard that defines occupant Safety in rollover crashes. As FMVSS 208 and FMVSS 216 focus on structural safety and the rollover test configuration set forward in the FMVSS 208 is not a very realistic repre- sentation of a true crash scenario (compare [1 ] and [2]) a new or improved rollover safety test method should be defined. This test method must fulfill the following requirements: • utilize a realistic and reproducible rollover maneuver, that covers the worst case, • set forward injury criteria, • combine structural testing with occupant safety criteria. Considering the experiences gained through computer simulations conducted for the development of the rollover detection system ROSE, it can be concluded that rolling over due to a curbstone impact induces the most critical occupant kinematics. Assuming that no roof collapse occurs a rollover protection system that is able to provide protection in a curbstone rollover should easily be able to give protection in other rollover types. To determine the quality of a rollover protection system it is especially nec- essary to define injury criteria for the head and neck region. Additionally there must be a suitable anthropo- morphic test device available, that especially provides more realistic neck kinematics. As observed already in [16] and also in the occupant simulation the neck of the Hybrid III Dummy seemed to be to stiff in the lateral direc- tion. At the moment occupant simulations are being con- ducted using a more realistic neck model according to the results published in [3].
