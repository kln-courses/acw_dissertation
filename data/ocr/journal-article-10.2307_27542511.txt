<plain_text><page sequence="1">LANDSCAPE INTO ART: HENRY JAMES AND JOHN CROWE RANSOM By ASHLEY BROWN ONE of Ransom's finest poems, "Old Mansion", has not been commented on much by his various critics, and perhaps a detailed analysis is unnecessary for a poem so beautifully articulated. All the same, it does present a special case. It is one of the few of Ransom's poems written out of a literary source, and I propose to examine here some of the ways in which he built it up. I should in fact like to defend it in this manner, because some of the poet's admirers have not been very happy with it. The late Vivienne Koch, for instance, considered it "not wholly successful", and recently Robert Buifington in The Equilibrist spoke of its "tediously" maintained tone of irony. Ransom meanwhile has continued to reprint it. The 1969 edi tion of the Selected Poems marks its sixth appearance (it was originally published in The Fugitive in April, 1924). Although it has been slightly revised for each republication up to 1963 (as Professor Buifington has carefully noted in an appendix to his book), I shall not be concerned with these changes. The source is Henry James's The American Scene (1907) and specifically the chapter on Charleston. This remarkable prose poem of a book celebrates James's return to the United States after an absence of twenty years. In his youth he had been largely confined to New York City and the more settled parts of New England, but now, in 1904, he proposed to travel down the East coast as far as Palm Beach and then west to California. He expected much from this trip, perhaps even a new subject for his novels, and he was more open to experience than ever. The American Scene mainly records his response to the principal cities on the Eastern seaboard.</page><page sequence="2">ASHLEY BROWN 207 In the late winter of 1905, after his visits to Washington and Richmond, James heads inland to North Carolina, where he spends a week at Biltmore, the Vanderbilt estate?"this vast parenthetic Carolinian demonstration", as he calls it. Then he journeys by train through South Carolina. He is not very flat tering to what he sees through the Pullman car window: "The social scene, shabby and sordid, and lost in the scale of space as the quotable line is lost in a dull epic or the needed name in an ageing memory. . . ." Indeed the approach to Charleston is al most fearful in its negation of civilized amenities. Stranded in the night between trains, ... he still nevertheless remembers how quickly even this interlude took on an interest. The gloom was scarce pene trable, but a light glimmered here and there, and formless sheds and shanties, dim, discomfortable things, straggled about and lost themselves. Indistinguishable engines hooted, before and behind, where red fires also flared and vanished; indistinguishable too, from each other . . . were the cold steel of the rails, the vague composition of the platform, and the kinder, the safer breast of earth. The place was ap parently a junction, and it was but a question of waiting? of selecting as the wisest course, among the hoots and the flares, to stand huddled just where one was. But then, he says, "as by the click of a spring", his unsettled "adventure" changes its nature: It must have broken out more particularly, then and there, in the breath of the night, which was verily now the bland air of the South?mild, benignant, a benediction in itself as it hung about me, and with that blest quality in it of its ap pearing a medium through which almost any good might come. It was the air of the open gates?not, like that of the North, of the closed; and one inhaled it, in short, on the spot, as the very boon of one's quest. 4</page><page sequence="3">208 LANDSCAPE INTO ART What is this place? Spartanburg? Columbia? We shall probably never know, but the pilgrim James has endowed it with an almost Dantesque quality, like one of those moments in the Purgatorio when the dreamer moves out of night into dawn with new expec tations. (This passage has a remarkable analogy in Purgatorio IX, which Francis Fergusson elucidated in Dante's Drama of the Mind.) It is still early morning when he alights at Charleston and wanders the streets. The city, he admits, is "no very finished picture". He is seeking a friend who has offered to be his guide, and thus he finds himself by mistake at an old house: ... a small, scared, starved person of colour, of very light colour, an elderly mulatress in an improvised wrapper, just barely held open for me a door through which I felt I might have looked straight and far back into the past. The past, that of the vanished order, was hanging on there behind her?-as much of it as the scant place would accommodate; and she knew this, and that I had so quickly guessed it; which led her, in fine, before I could see more, and that I might not sound the secret of shy misfortune, of faded pre tension, to shut the door in my face. So, it seemed to me, had I been confronted, in Italy, under quite such a morning air and light, quite the same touch of a tepid, odorous medium, with the ancient sallow crones who guard the locked portals and the fallen pride of the provincial palazzini. That was all, in the one instance; there had been no more of it than of the little flare of a struck match?which lasted long enough, however, to light the sedative cigarette, smoked and thrown away, that renews itself forever between the picture seeker's lips. This is the first of his Charleston "impressions". And it leads to other "impressions" which culminate in a "vision": . . . during these first bland hours, charged with the splen dour of spring, I caught the wide-eyed smile of the South,</page><page sequence="4">ASHLEY BROWN 209 that expression of a temperamental felicity in which shades of character, questions of real feature, other marks and meanings, tend always to lose themselves. But a deficiency was clear, which was neither more nor less than the defi ciency of life; without life, all gracefully, the picture man aged to compose itself. Here, as nearly always, James's perspectives are spatial and pic torial?rather than metaphysical or historical. What makes The American Scene so fascinating for veteran readers of his novels is his transcendence of the social milieu; he makes his landscapes and cityscapes speak, as though mute nature and society at large have at last found their voices. His attitude is loving and almost anthropomorphic. Ransom, in composing his poem from his point of view, is an historian, as it were, whose subject is the contrast between the Southern past and present. His speaker is a Southerner who often passes the old house "as an intruder", and the epoch which it represents seems "newly imaged"?that is, he has no illu sions about its antiquity. In a sense he knows it well and his ap proach to it is therefore more cautious than James's. Having seen it often, he is more circumstantial about its details: Stability was the character of its rectangle Whose line was seen in part and guessed in part Through trees. Decay was the tone of old brick and shingle. Green shutters dragging frightened the watchful heart . . . Then he re-creates James's experience: And at last, with my happier angel's own temerity, Did I clang their brazen knocker against the door, To beg their dole of a look, in simple charity, Or crumbs of wisdom dropping from their great store.</page><page sequence="5">210 LANDSCAPE INTO ART But it came to nothing?and may so gross denial Which has been deplored with a beating of the breast Never shorten the tired historian, loyal To acknowledge defeat and discover a new quest. The old mistress was ill, and sent my dismissal By one even more wrappered and lean and dark Than that warped concierge and imperturbable vassal Who had bid me begone from her master's Gothic park. Emphatically, the old house crumbled; the ruins Would litter, as already the leaves, this petted sward; And no annalist went in to the lords or the peons; The antiquary would finger the bits of shard. But on retreating I saw myself in the token, How loving from my dying weed the feather curled On the languid air; and I went with courage shaken To dip, alas, into some unseemlier world. Since the passage in James is the direct source for this part of the poem, we might observe how the poet has modified some of the details. James, in drawing on his vast European experience, makes his comparison by way of the palazzini under a certain kind of "morning air and light". Ransom's speaker likewise casts an eye back towards Europe. Earlier in the poem he mentions the "monstrous ch?teaux on the Loire" which he has recently seen (the poet was an artillery officer stationed in this part of France during the first World War). And here the falazzini are trans figured as a Gothic park (perhaps an image from Ransom's years as a Rhodes Scholar). But these are not so important. Through out The American Scene James refers to himself as the "restless analyst", who is on a "quest". Ransom wittily has his speaker think of himself as an "annalist", and a "tired historian" at that. This pun registers exactly the shift in perspective (from the pic torial to the historical) that I have mentioned. James's "seda tive cigarette" becomes a "foreign weed"?a curious phrase that</page><page sequence="6">ASHLEY BROWN 211 is repeated from the first stanza of the poem and that somehow makes Ransom's speaker seem more alien than James. He "re treats" where James withdraws "as on the completion of a mystic process". The Southerner, that is, is more ironic about the house and himself, less sure of its present value, than James, who is grateful for anything. A close reader of the poem will probably find other Jamesian details, but these are the ones that are most rewarding. I do not, by the foregoing account, intend to suggest that Ran som's poem is pastiche. On the contrary, he has taken just what he needed from James and converted it to his use. The method of the poem is leisurely, of course. It is a rather "private" poem for Ransom, an interior drama rather than his usual satire of circumstance. Neither the subdued oratory of "Antique Harves ters" nor the mock-heroic of "Captain Carpenter" would quite do for it. But the approach to the subject by way of qualification and hesitation has its own rewards as well as its own necessity. Ransom did not formally acknowledge The American Scene till 1946, when he reviewed a new edition of it (introduced by Auden) for The Nation. This would have been at the invitation of Randall Jarrell, who was acting as literary editor during that year and who was certainly aware of Ransom's long-standing admiration for the book. The review, however, takes an un expected turn. "Unprecedented in the annals of the Republic, for one thing, is such mastery of language as shows in the effort less long lift of its style." So Ransom begins his tribute. But then he shifts his argument: We will feel that American writing can never be finer than this. The danger is that in too many quarters it may be too fine. In any noble writing which has entered securely into the national consciousness, the linguistic staple probably consists in a folk element of common sententious rhetoric. But here this element is dangerously reduced; it is at once overlaid and refined till it nearly loses visibility. ... It is</page><page sequence="7">212 LANDSCAPE INTO ART very brilliant writing. But it is not writing with an epical quality; it is not of and for the people. By 1946, then, Ransom was committed to the "loose" or demo cratic society, and he no longer seriously deplored the level of public taste that he, like James, had once challenged. The "loose" society, he said, "at any rate lets its arts flourish at will, which is according to need". Under these conditions books like James's and poems like Ransom's would presumably continue to be writ ten. As for the world of the "Old Mansion", it might exist as a memory, but it could no longer act as an affront to the "unseem lier world" of the present. The irony of the poem is now im possible to repeat; the historical moment for it has passed.</page></plain_text>
