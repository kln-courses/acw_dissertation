<plain_text><page sequence="1">Naturalism and Religion. Kai Nielsen. Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 2001. 506 pages. Price $40.00. (Reviewed by Jerome A. Stone. Meadville Lombard Theological School.) his is a clear and powerful exposition and defense of a thoroughly A secular, explicitly atheistic naturalism, filled with concern for human values. This is a social, non-scientisti c naturalism with a significant place for normative issues, for objective norms and values in a disenchanted world. This is a pragmatic, non-metaphysical, non physicalistic naturalism finding affinity with Dewey, Habermas and Rorty. The first sentence of the book sets the tone: "Naturalism denies that there are any spiritual or supernatural realities." On the other hand, Nielsen's version is neither reductionist, "claiming that all talk of the mental can be translated into purely physicalist terms," nor scientistic, "claiming that what science cannot tell us humankind cannot know" (1). Nielsen advocates a social naturalism, that is, one which rejects physicalism, even such moderate nonreductive physicalisms as those of</page><page sequence="2">102 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Rorty, Davidson, or Dennett. The reason for this denial of physicalism is because humans are not just biological beings, but are irreducibly social beings, self-interpreting animals. Thus social relations are partly constitutive of humans. This is a nonscientistic naturalism. It rejects as incoherent the belief of "scientific" realists (Quine, Smart) that physics yields our best approximation of the one true description of the world. There is no one vocabulary that can do that and science is not a privileged form of knowledge. Knowing and conceptualization are perspectival. The discourses of biology, anthropology, literature, politics and common life all have their role and none is closer to "the truth." Science does not tell us about "reality in itself." We do not know what we are talking about when we refer to "reality." Science and poetry, for example, both help us to cope while neither is a uniquely correct description of the world. Nielsen's naturalism is anti-metaphysical. There is no assertion about the ultimate constituents of the world or the one true description. On the other hand it is not reductive. While ideals and norms have a natural basis, this is a naturalism which can accommodate art, morality, and religion while naturalizing them in the spirit of an uncompromising atheism. Naturalism takes humans to be language-using animals in causal interaction with other physical objects. Nielsen differentiates cosmological from methodological, ethical, and scientistic naturalism in order to identify himself with the first (135ff). Cosmological or worldview naturalism holds that everything is either composed of or dependent for its existence on natural entities. Methodological naturalism holds that only empirical methods and their logico-mathematical auxiliaries are legitimate. Ethical naturalism is the view that ethical beliefs are a subspecies of empirical beliefs. Scientistic naturalism, a subspecies of the second, holds that all reasonably held beliefs are scientific or else commonsense beliefs compatible with and of the same type of method of confirmation as the scientific. This is also a form of historicism, meaning that ideas and attitudes are part of social practices that are historically and culturally distinctive. There is no universal point of view. However, we are not imprisoned by our practices, nor is this a form of relativism. We can, as Neurath suggested, rebuild the ship at sea. We can alter our social practices. We can assess our social practices critically, even though we do not stand free of them. There is also a cross-fertilization between</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 25, No. 1, January 2004 103 cultures. We are partly free from some aspects of our culture. By using a wide reflective equilibrium (fallibilistic, historicist, contextualist) we can reflect on our moral judgments. This avoids relativism and ethnocentricism. Our conviction of the significance of the moral life is compatible with our scientific picture of the world. We do not need to define ethical terms in naturalistic terms, such as "good" as "answering to interests." The brunt of philosophical work is conceptual analysis, but its ultimate aim "should be the attainment of wisdom and the articulation of a Lebensphilosophie, the central segment of which consists in systematic critical normative inquiry. It is the problems of human beings, the problems of human conduct, the problems of morals in a broad sense, that are at the center of such a conception of philosophy" (234-235). There are some significant challenges to naturalism, challenges often ignored by recent expositors, which Nielsen addresses (154-178). One is to articulate a way of stating which types of alleged entities are natural and which are supernatural. The older way of claiming that natural substances are material can no longer be simply asserted given the changes in physics in the last century. Drawing on the work of William Dennes in Yervant Krikorian's Naturalism and the Human Spirit, Nielsen describes natural entities as events with qualities and relations. Now the question becomes how we know that natural events, as described, are the only existents and that supernatural events are not. In other words, how is naturalism itself to be justified? To say that this is our choice of basic categories, of our fundamental linguistic or conceptual framework, is question-begging. On the other hand, we cannot maintain, however tempting it would be, that naturalism is itself an empirical claim, for we cannot articulate the truth-conditions or assertability-conditions of such a claim. Nor can we say that naturalism is more adequate to the facts of experience than alternative positions. This is the echo of a now discredited representationalism. Nielsen suggests adopting a Rortyan strategy of arguing that naturalism enables us to cope with problematic situations more adequately than the alternatives. In addition there is another line of argument. There are many common-sense and routine scientific beliefs of which we can be</page><page sequence="4">104 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy confident. "Naturalism is justified as the most systematic articulation and Occam's-razor-respecting expression of what is involved in relying on those unproblematic beliefs." (178) All of these unproblematic beliefs can be justified by the use of scientific method. Thus it is reasonable to use the same method in problematic cases. No religious beliefs can be justified by scientific procedures. Thus we have prima facie good reasons not to accept religious beliefs for they are not validated by the "widely used, consistently successful, and uncontroversially acceptable" scientific method of fixing belief (178). All of this can be done without appeal to "ultimate commitments," or alleged "metaphysical grounds" of science. We need not accept the challenge of the critics that naturalists should develop a theory of nature or "the natural." Rather we can proceed by trying to show that when someone tries to claim a "transcendent reality" no sense has been given to his or her talk and that when we try to make intelligible claims about what there is, we are, for all we can tell, talking about some qualified existent in space-time. His critique of theism involves two claims: 1) that the more na?ve, anthropomorphic ideas of God are superstitious and involve false beliefs, while 2) that the more sophisticated, non-anthropomorphic conceptions of God (e.g., "Pure Spirit" or "Being as such") are incoherent. In addition there is a third claim (which he refers to as a suspicion, apparently because he has not analyzed this thoroughly): 3) that certain philosophical conceptions of God, such as that of Whitehead, Dewey, Hare and Braithwaite, are neither incoherent nor anthropomorphic, but are really atheistic (254, 423, n. 8). More specifically, a) Whitehead's God is at a considerable distance from the God of monotheistic religions, b) where the views of this third type are coherent (as with Spinoza), they reveal an atheistic substance, and c) their metaphysical strands are at least as incoherent as traditional non anthropomorphic theism. Besides, metaphysical thinking, and the theologies relying on it (Tillich, Whitehead, Hartshorne, etc.) are nonstarters. Clearly Nielsen needs to make a more careful argument for this. Further examples of conceptions of God that are basically atheistic are those of religious humanists who use the term "God" to stand for moral aspirations of deep concerns. Nielsen appeals here to an ethics of words (235). Finally, d) Wittgensteinean fideism is at best obscurantist. In addition to these arguments, in a world of cultural pluralism where, for example, many Chinese or Buddhist people have not been</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 25, No. 1, January 2004 105 acculturated into a form of life in which a monotheistic god is embedded, the burden of proof is on the theist. Atheism has a critical and an explanatory side. On the critical side, Hume, Russell, Flew, Paul Edwards, and Paul Kurtz give grounds for rejection of a belief in supernatural or spiritual beings. People can make sense out of and order their lives as moral beings without such belief. On the explanatory side, a naturalistic conception of religion will explain religion as a function of human needs. Religion fulfills a variety of human needs. At one point Nielsen lists eight of these functions (44-45). A functional theory of religion should not reduce these to one true function. It is not necessary to be religious to understand religious experience, although you need to be sensitive to understand it well. It is helpful not to have a "tin ear" in religious matters. But a naturalist need not be so afflicted. Since the Enlightenment there is a cumulative cluster of arguments against theism that has gradually increased in force. The religious apologetic defense is generally a turn to faith accompanied with an assertion that without belief in God naturalism leads to moral nihilism and despair. Naturalists need to point out that a reasonable and morally compelling secular sense can be made of morality, that revelations and faiths are many and often conflicting, and that the concept of God is problematic. We need to account for the incoherence of the conception of God and to explain what the believer's belief is really about. A naturalistic "error-theory" of theistic religion (paralleling the error-theory of morality) does that. For nontheistic religions the error-theory would have to take a different form. An error theory, without leaving its naturalistic base, "acknowledges the importance of the pervasive and persistent affective side of religion, while still accounting for the ersatz-cognitive side." It further explains 4"the strong hold that the religious life has on people" (43). Thus a naturalistic error-theory of religion explains its origins, its claims to truth, how these claims are errors, and also its persistence. Given Nielsen's error-theory, a genuine understanding of religion is incompatible with believing it. On the other hand, an empathetic understanding attuned to religious experience is possible. Having such a feel for religion does not require belief, but rather a sense for what makes religion so compelling. Belief in immortality is not necessary to give life meaning. The analytic techniques of linguistic philosophy can help us come to grips</page><page sequence="6">106 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy with the meaning of "the meaning of life." There is no general formula in view of which we can say what the meaning of life is. We certainly do not derive it from God's purposes. Yet people can give their lives meaning through purposive activity without recourse to metaphysics or theology. In this volume Nielsen has special sections on Sidney Hook, Ernest Nagel, Wittgenstein, Antony Flew, Hilary Putnam, and Jean Hampton. Should the reader be overwhelmed with the size of this volume, the heart of Nielsen's argument can be obtained by reading the Introduction and Part One, 120 pages of careful exposition. It is worthy of note that Nielsen's naturalism approaches religion as essentially erroneous attempts to satisfy several human needs. My chief criticism is that he has not even imagined the possibility of a naturalistic reconstruction of religion or of a genuine religious naturalism. At one point he drops a hint that there are antireligious religious persons, religiously sensitive persons, among whom he includes Feuerbach, George Eliot, and himself (359-360). These people have "finely tuned religious sensibilities." They reject religious beliefs, practices and institutions and hope they will fede away, but with "continual remembrance" of them, since the fullest kind of human flourishing exceeds morality. If this hint could be developed we might have a religious naturalism, rather than a naturalistic rejection of religion.</page></plain_text>
