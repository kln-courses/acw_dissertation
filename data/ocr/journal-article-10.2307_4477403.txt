<plain_text><page sequence="1">CLEOMEDES AND THE PROBLEMS OF STOIC ASTROPHYSICS Astrophysics, the physics of the celestial realm, is a neglected topic in Stoic physical theory since it lacks the considerable theoretical and historical interest of the cosmological system of which it is an ancillary part. Yet there is a Stoic treatise from late antiquity, Cleomedes' Caelestia, that in the course of dealing with astronomy also indirectly supplies a fairly complete account of this subject, and highlights some of its theoretical problems. By exploring its testimony we can perhaps place Stoic astrophysics on a firmer basis of evidence and theory. ' The Stoics, like Aristotle (de caelo 289al8-19), regarded the heavenly bodies as composed of "that in which they are located". Both called this medium aiOip, but for the Stoics it was not an immutable substance but an unstable firesphere. (Cleom 2.1.335-338 notes its gradations of density.) The air below it received exhalations from the earth, and these continued rising to nourish the heavenly bodies (Cleom. 1.8.79-99; Sen. Nat. Quaest. 2.6.1; cf. S.V.F 2.527 at p. 168.25-26). The planets and stars (themselves individually spherical)2 moved in the aijp at different distances from a stationary cosmocentric earth. Their "spheres", unlike Aristotle's solid spheres, were only "conceptual" (vooi5wvot), i.e., geometrical abstractions of the orbital paths of the planets; see Cleom. 1.8.70, 77, and 2.1.72, where although used only of the solar sphere, this term must be applicable to other orbits too. (The fixed stars were, of course, located in a wide band; see Cleom. 2.3.49.) Being formed from the aOihp, the heavenly bodies also possessed an intrinsic heat that increased in proportion to their distance from the earth, and their rarefaction. Bodies located at a point somewhere beyond the moon become "totally igneous" (lLdvt3 'ptva), and thus intrinsically luminous, with only the moon deriving its light from the sun (Cleom. 2.1.336-338; 2.3.91-95; 2.5.4-6). Planets had a density identical to that of the area of the ai"p in which they were lo- cated. This is clear from the terms in which Cleomedes rejects Berossus' theory of the moon as "half-fire" (hiniupo;). He argues (2.4.10-12) that the moon, like the other heavenly bodies, has to be "the same in substance [as its medium]" (6gooiza r o'vaMq). The moon's own density is thus defined by the density of air and ai"p (Cleom. 2.4.37-41), at the junction of which it is located (Cleom. 2.2.37-38; 2.3.83-84, 90-91). A fortiori the density of other planets and of the fixed stars must be definable in terms of the medium in which they are located. Posidonius (F128 E.K.) also states the principle that a heavenly body must "partake of' (ptcaagpdv&amp;v) the medium in which it is located, and Plutarch I For the essential evidence on astrophysics see Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta (hereafter S.V.F.) 1.1 15-122 and 2.646-707. Cleomedes will be cited by name from R. TODD, ed. Cleomedes: Caelestia (Teubner: Leipzig 1990). 2 Such sphericity (unlike the sphericity of the earth; see Cleom. 1.1.172-175, 190-192) is not derived from any physical theory, but is probably based on the teleological principle of the perfection of the sphere (Cleom. 1.5.139-144).</page><page sequence="2">76 ROBERT B. TODD (De fac. 928D = S.V.F. 2.668) correlates the formation of heavenly bodies with the differing densities in different parts of the a&amp;i'fp. But this extension of Stoic physics to the heavens raises the problem of how these bodies are individuated if their density does not differ from that of their medium. How can non-lunar celestial bodies be separately "igneous", if the aOitp itself is a firesphere (a npx8pilq oi5aia, Cleom. 1.5.129-130)? WOLFF3 may speak of "the motion of fire being visible as the motion of the celestial bodies", but what is the physical theory that explains how such igneous bodies are differentiated from their medium? (Also, why is such visibility restricted to these bodies, and not to the mediums in which they move, when those mediums are themselves "igneous"?) Seneca, Nat. Quaest. 7.1.6-7 helps us somew- hat by reporting two competing theories that address these questions. One is that the stars and planets are solid (i.e., earthen) bodies that biochemically acquire heat (and light) from their medium (ignem alienum pascentia); another is that they have an intrinsic and "concentrated" heat and light (flamma contracta). The objection to the second theory is that such an intrinsically igneous body would be unstable, and so be dispersed by the motion of the heavens, unless it had something to contain it (nisi aliquid haberet quod teneret et a quo teneretur). Seneca thus implies that the first theory should be accepted.4 But if the general Stoic theory of centripetal motion5 implies that a body's density determines its location in the cosmos (i.e., determines how close it gets to centre), then a heavenly body could not both be formed from the aiEhp in which it is located, and be more dense than its medium (the solution implied by Seneca). For then it would move centripe- tally to a medium of equivalent density, from which again it could not be differentiated. If, on the other hand, planets and stars are less dense than their medium, then they should move centrifugally to a more rarefied medium of equivalent density - from which they will again be indistinguishable. The problem of how heavenly bodies have their "own body" (oiKctov Cr*a; Cleom. 1.2.38-39; 2.1.337; 2.3.88) remains as long as we assume, as we have so far, that individuation depends exclusively on density. That is, the processes of condensation and rarefaction that plausibly explain the basic distribution of matter into even elemental strata in the Stoic cosmos (depicted at Cleom. 1.5.126-137, cf. 1.1.46-48, 101-103) cannot explain the observably uneven distribution of celestical matter, whereby planets of varying sizes, as well as the fixed stars, all exist and move within invisible spheres. The Stoic cosmogony starts with the most rarefied form of matter (fire) and subjects it to condensati- on and rarefaction, but the final result ought to be an evenly stratified, and progressively more igneous and luminous, upper cosmos, entirely unpeopled by any separately identifia- ble entities. 3 M. WOLFF in J. BARNES and M. MIGNUCCI, eds., Matter and Metaphysics (Fourth Symposium Hellenisticum) (Naples 1988), 481. 4 FRANCIS BACON, Thema Coeli (in J. SPEDDING et al., eds., [London 1870], III, 778) thought that the heavenly bodies were defined by being more rarefied than their aetherial medium. See also BACON, Descriptio globi intellectualis (SPEDDING III, 743). Both passages suggest that BACON was familiar with Seneca, but unmoved by the objection that such bodies would disperse. s On this much-discussed theory see most recently WOLFF (cited in n. 3), and also D. J. FURLEY, Proceedings of the Boston Area Colloquium in Ancient Philosophy, 9, 1993, 57-75, who takes the standard position, followed here, that all the bodies in the Stoic cosmos are attracted to its centre.</page><page sequence="3">Cleomedes and the Problems of Stoic Astrophysics 77 Now a "big bang" cosmogonical theory (reduced to crude terms) can explain the arbitrary distribution of matter in the cosmos as the abrupt dispersal of highly condensed originative matter. But Stoic cosmogony posits only the evolving condensation of maxi- mally rarefied originative matter (the xfvp teXvtK6v), and so cannot explain the genesis of individual celestial bodies. The status of the earth points up the problem: it is an individual body, like a planet or a star, but is securely individuated only because it is the locus of all the densest matter in the cosmos. The formation of celestial bodies within material spheres, on the other hand, cannot be explained in the same way. They cannot be the loci of the densest matter within a medium of uniform density. Yet for the Stoics the formation of the cosmos is not just an account of the redistribution of originative matter into states of varying density. Their cosmos is an organism (e.g. Diog. Laert. 7.142-143 = S.V.F. 2.633 = Posid. F99a E.K.), and the heavenly bodies are living things individuated by a soul, which is identified as nve-figa. But this animistic explanation of individuation still creates problems in celestial physics. nvEi~uga is a dynamic compound of the active elements, air and fire (e.g. S.V.F. 2.442) and, as such, can individuate matter that is passive (i.e., earth and water).6 It therefore explains the variety of terrestrial com- pounds (pneumatized entities, as it were) better than it does the existence of celestial individuals located in an inherently active ai"p. To form heavenly bodies "pneumatic" atijp has to be somehow self-transforming, i.e. lvei4ia must be able to act on itself to create the bodies observable as planets and stars. Bot does Stoic physical theory allow for such a process and such a result? G. STRIKER may be right in saying that for the Stoics heavenly bodies are ("have to be" would be more accurate) "unified into spherical bodies by their own portion of pneuma".7 The problem is whether this is a theoretically legitimate, rather than merely convenient, application of the theory of pneuma. To take a simple analogy: water makes a separate mudpie when mixed with earth, but when mixed with itself it is still just an undefined mass of water. Similarly, how can the Stoic firesphere plausibly act on itself to create separate physical entities? But even if Stoic animism (or "organicism") can be allowed to explain the individuation of heavenly bodies as part of a teleological plan, what about the motions of these ensouled planets and stars? They are all revolved diurnally by the aether, but planets are also deities that over longer periods move "independently" or "intentionally" (npoatpealccfK,), a term used twelve times by Cleomedes (e.g. 1.2.8,24, 53) 8 These self-moving planets have varying speeds in proportion to the density of their constituent matter (Cleom. 2.1.334- 338), and they maintain their eccentric orbits within the limits of the zodiac (Cleom. 2.5.133-134; cf. 1.2.53-72 and 2.7.1-4). But if a planet is as dense as its medium, then there is no reason in physics for it to deviate, as it does (Cleom. 1.2.1; 1.4.73-74, 87-88), from the circular motion of the surrounding aicOp. If its density determines its speed, then it should also determine its direction. So any concept of "independent motion" (motion "chosen" by the planets) is essentially an anthropomorphic rationalization of data for which 6 See further, for example, D. HAHM, Southern Journal of Philosophy, 23 (Suppl. Vol.), 1985, 39-56 at 50; he, however, says nothing about the processes needed to produce and maintain planets and stars. 7 In a commentary on FURLEY (cited in n. 5) 81. 8 STRIKER (see preceding note) suggests that these apparently individual intentions are the result of "a single decision by the world-soul", a speculation that might be supported by Cleom. 1.4.41, if np6vota there is not just the sun's "forethought" but a cosmic master-plan.</page><page sequence="4">78 ROBERT B. TODD physical theory can furnish no explanation. (FURLEY [see n. 5] rightly calls it "mythical motion".) The sun and moon, for example, conveniently reveal their intentional motion within limits that directly conform to the general pattern of natural teleology (Cleom. 1.4.40-43, 2.1.387-392, 396-399). But this just rationalizes observations, consistently with, but not as an inference from, physical and teleological first-principles.9 Meanwhile the other planets and the stars have no terrestrial influence. Their "intentions" serve no anthropocentric purpose, except perhaps the aesthetic and moral one of being inspiring objects of contemplation (see Sen. Nat. Quaest. I, Praef. 7-13). A similar status can hardly be accorded the theories of Stoic astrophysics itself. University of British Columbia ROBERT B. TODD 9 As such, it does not maintain the philosophy of science expounded at Posidonius F18 E.K. (the probable theoretical background to Cleomedes' treatise; see TODD, Aufstieg und Niedergang der Romi- schen Welt, 2.36.3, 1989, 1368-1369). Here physical theory is said to offer astronomers the "first- principles" (apXai) of their secondary observational science, and these must include a theory of the identity and motion of celestial bodies.</page></plain_text>
