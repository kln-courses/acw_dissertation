<plain_text><page sequence="1">At first sight the work of the three young Irish artists, Theresa McKenna, Gwen O'Dowd and Marc Reilly looks much of a muchness; largely abstract compositions, based loosely on the landscape and with the emphasis on formal and textural effects. The impression is reinforced by the monotonous uniformity of the long gallery in which they are displayed, and although on closer scrutiny, differences between them are evident, I was left with the linger ing impression that the exhibition as a whole lacked sufficient variety to make it interesting. It is impossible to overstate the impor tance of a catalogue to an exhibition as not only a descriptive guide to the individual works, but as a statement of the overall intentions of the show. In this case one had to be satisfied with a list of the works on view, and a single sheet profile of each of the exhibitors. The latter were in part bi lingual (English/Welsh), reminding us that the exhibition had just returned from what the press release described as "a highly successful tour of Wales". In the light of this fact, the contribution of Gwen O'Dowd seemed particularly appropriate, as the paintings shown here were the result of four months spent in Wales during the summer of 1986. In terms of subject they were ostensibly land scapes related to precise locations, having titles such as Llanberis Path, Cwm Rheidol 1 etc., but as John Hutchinson (O'Dowd was the only member of the trio favoured with a serious written analysis) said in his eulogistic assessment of the artist, "her sense of place ... remains predominantly an interiorised conception, related more to self-exploration than to direct representation". O'Dowd's paintings, mostly medium sized (90 x 70 cm.), oil on paper, are rich in tonal and textural effects and sometimes appear to take on the characteristics of fissured slatey rock itself. A number of them, such as, Pen-Y-Pass North Wales, are sombre in tenor, their brooding gloom alleviated only by the highlighting of a solitary feature such as a road or in this case what appears to be a land-locked mountain tarn. Looked at in another way, the lake becomes a glowing crystal, glinting from within some darker mineral matrix, as though the artist had attempted to distil the petrographic essence of the North Wales mountain landscape. Other works are painted in a lighter hue, such as the series on the theme of Cwm Rheidol which features craggy mountain landscapes, redundant mine workings, and forest interiors. In this particular sequence, O'Dowd conveys a poignant sense of evolution and mortality, the huge tree trunks and roots of the present forest, recalling their long-dead predecessors from the Carboniferous Age, the archaic lepidodendrons, which themselves in more recent times became the goal of the now equally defunct mining industry in North Wales. A further suggestion of transience is apparent in the large slatey-green col oured, mixed-media composition entitled Llanberis Path (or elsewhere, On the Llanberis Pass). Here a line of broken down wooden fence-posts ascend a precipitous moutain path, their diagonal sequence finally disappearing into the unknown, truncated only by the picture edge, like some Egyptian pyramid of awesome magnitude, painted by the French Romantic, Hubert Robert. This epic quality in O'Dowd's work reaches its cosmic climax in the Snowdonia subjects, such as Dark Mist ... Snowdonia. Here the terrible mountain is suffused by an enveloping grey mist, and is reminiscent of Turner's sublime Alpine vistas, or more recently, of the heroic and symbolic landscapes of Therese Oulton. Both Oulton and O'Dowd whilst being impressive 'textural' painters, share the</page><page sequence="2">40 danger of slipping into rather hackneyed romanticism of outlook. Marc Reilly's work divides sharply into a group of four large acrylic compositions, and more than twice that number of col oured pencil drawings. A rather terse and uninformative accompanying statement notes that most of the work is based on the landscape of Co. Wicklow, where the artist lives. The drawings, identifiable simp ly by calender references to particular dates, e.g. 8th Sept. 1986, are mostly crudely drawn forest views. They appear to be little more than superficial sketches, some of which are unfinished, and unrelated to the larger painted works. In my opinion they should not have been exhibited. By contrast, the artist's larger composi tions take on an aura of mysterious and symbolic significance. These expres sionistically painted canvases show a strongly outlined crouching figure within four different landscape contexts. The varying backdrops intone the mood for each study, happy and optimistic amongst the colourful shrubs in By the Rhododen dron, sombre and dejected in the muddy, olive drab Rain in the Garden. Such Manichean dualism of subject coupled with the primitive energy of the forms brings to mind the visionary eschatological creations of that arch romantic, William Blake. Theresa McKenna's work is different both in form and content to that of the other two. It is based on the ancient monuments of Ireland such as the dolmens and passage graves. She has previously worked in tapestry, and like O'Dowd, is much concerned here with surface textural effects. In this instance she uses her technical skills to simulate the appearance of natural rock. Fragments of creased and textured paper are mounted on a loosely woven cotton base, the latter being allow ed to show through in places, and a mix ture of graphite and beeswax is then applied on top. The whole assumes the natural appearance of a dark, basaltic rock, veined here and there by waxy (mineral) accretions. The constructs range in scale from almost life-size megalithic assemblages down to small picture size compositions, and the visual impact varies accordingly. The larger works evince a disconcerting pseudo-real aura as of an actual archeological monument, the smaller appeared either to be studies for the latter or else rocky landscape vistas in their own Gwen O'Dowd, 'Pen y Pass, Snowdonia'. Oil on Paper. 20" x 28". right. Some of the larger pieces, such as Tribute 111, assumed a rather uninspired structural configuration of counterpoised elements, reminiscent of a portal dolman, or simply a group of standing stones. In other more interesting and ambiguous cases the formal groupings seemed to also take on a symbolic and even directly anthropomorphic meaning, as in Associa tions, which could both have been inter preted in sexual terms ? as a copulating couple. In a few instances, evidence of 'primitive' man-made decorations such as spirals and geometrical shapes, appear on the surface of the rock, their presence implying some kind of mystical purpose. Such ritualistic purpose is also alluded to in the more atmospheric and subtle of the smaller studies, such as, Dowth, Co. Meath. Here three intersecting circles coil snake-like around a central cruciform shape, possibly suggesting a female sym bol of fertility. McKenna and indeed each of the artists succeed at times in penetrating beyond the superficial aspects of the landscape and evoking something of its essential, archaic and symbolic associations. And, all in all the exhibition proved to be more interesting and thought provoking than I had first anticipated, though perhaps for reasons other than those intended! Peter Jordan</page></plain_text>
