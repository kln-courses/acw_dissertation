VOGELSANG ABSTRACT: Drawing upon the developmental work of Loevinger and Fowler, the author speculates upon the existence of work attitudes that accompany each stage and explains how the attitudes influence people's orientations toward work and family. Recent work in personality and faith development has shown that the way we perceive ourselves and interpret experience changes over time but can become soUdified at certain stages of our Uves. There also exist attitudes toward work which accompany each of the stages. These attitudes influence how people choose their careers, how they function on the job, and what satisfaction they derive from their work. In order to be effective at helping people with their vocational directions, we need to be sensitive to their personaUty and faith development and to their work attitudes. Baruch et al., in a study of 52 men and 91 women of middle-class background, discovered five thematic orientations to career and family: purposeful breadwinner, oppressed breadwinner, role polarizers, conflicted, and happy harmonizers.1 The purposeful breadwinners are concerned with the needs of their famiUes. Work is accepted as an instrument to satisfy those needs. Work is not a means of self-actualization but a means of providing. The oppressed breadwinners view work as a bitter experience. Their fam?ies compensate, but they consider their fam?ies the only reason they are working. They feel unchallenged by work and feel they are sacrificing themselves for the sake of others. The role polarizers invest themselves heav?y in either work or family. One or the other becomes their whole Uves. The conflicted feel work demands interfere with their fam?y role. They derive satisfaction from both and feel puUed between them. The happy harmonizers enjoy their famiUes and their work. They feel a sense of weU-being and contentment about their Uves. John D.

She does not imply that there is a developmental aspect to the attitudes. However, as I used and modified Baruch's scheme in counseUng and compared it initiaUy to Loevinger's work2 and later to Fowler's,31 discovered a relation between work attitudes and development. There are obvious comparisons between Baruch's oppressed breadwinner and Loevinger's self-protective stage wherein the person thinks in terms of advantage and control. One is either controUed or controls. Also Baruch's happy harmonizer is similar to Loevinger's integrated stage wherein conflicts are reconciled and the person finds a sense of inner peace. Rather than try to fit Baruch's scheme with Loevinger and Fowler, I have found it more productive to examine the stages of development, see what work attitudes emerge, and use Baruch's work as a guide for the possible attitudes that exist. Table 1 shows the different stages of development and what I speculate are the accompanying work attitudes.

The external world exists only as an extension of the self. People who persist in these structures into adulthood would be nonfunctional. People who suffer from schizophrenia may be said to regress to these levels. The first stage in</page><page sequence="3">JohnD. Vogelsang 133 normal development that involves awareness of more than that which is self and nonself is the impulsive stage. This is also the stage in which one could persist into adulthood and stiU be functional in socially acceptable ways. People at the impulsive stage are preoccupied with their bod?y feelings?particularly sexuality and aggressiveness?and what others can give. They are motivated by a desire to satisfy basic needs and by a fear of retaUation. They try to find ways to exploit others in order to get their needs met yet avoid punishment. They are oriented toward the present, tend to ignore past fa?ures, and to reduce consequences to avoiding current discomfort. Fowler describes people's faith orientation at this stage as intuitive projective. Their sense of meaning is derived from powerful, egocentric images and feeUngs. Their thought patterns are fluid and ruled more by fantasy and intuitive connections than logic. What they beUeve comes from powerful authority figures. Though they may imitate the logical reasoning of others, their sense of primary causes is magical. The work attitude that accompanies this stage is work as means. For ch?dren at this stage work is a way of acting out impulses, exploring the world, and incorporating some of the power of the adult presences in their Uves. Children pretend to be poUce officers chasing criminals, doctors heaUng sick people, parents providing nurture as a way of expressing and exploring their own feeUngs of aggression and nurture. Ch?dren also play at these roles to assim?ate magicaUy the power of the adults and to estabUsh a concrete connection between themselves and the adult world. To have an image of themselves in the role is to possess the essence of that role. Adults who have ceased to grow beyond this stage may be aware of, and can inteUectuaUy talk about, themselves in terms of the other stages, but their automatic and unconscious responses are stiU governed by the structure of this stage. Adults might talk about God's call or acting on a sense of divine direction, but the actual reason for their choices and their satisfaction comes from fulfilUng basic needs and an image they have of what it is to be an adult and independent. The sources of these images are powerful adult figures who have made an impression on them. Just as children beUeve they can possess the quaUties of adult figures, people at this stage feel that the job quaUfies them as adults operating in the grown-up world. They magicaUy become the mature person with the responsib?ities and power of an adult. Work is also a means to satisfying a need for security and a need to control their Uves through financial independence. As people move to the next stage and beyond, they concentrate on different issues and structure reaUty in more and more complex ways; but the structures and concerns of a previous stage can persist into other stages. People can impulsively seek to satisfy their needs and be intolerant of frustration, while beginning to concern themselves with fitting into what they perceive to be Ufe's hierarchy of power: As another example, they can stiU be very concerned with pleasing others (conformist stage) and want to develop their own independent goals.</page><page sequence="4">134 Journal of Religion and Health Loevinger refers to the next stage as self-protective. People at this stage tend to externalize blame and to be manipulative and wary of others. Their main rule is don't get caught. If there is trouble, it is because of someone else or a characteristic of themselves that cannot be changed. They are preoccupied with advantage and control. Life can be seen as a zero-sum game: one person's gain is another's loss. Fowler caUs this stage the mythic-Uteral. People accept the stories, beUefs, and observances of the community they are in. They tend to interpret symbols literally, to have a simple perspective on life's meaning that can be conveyed in a coherent but unexamined story. They tend also to see the forces moving in their Uves in anthropomorphic terms. Power and authority Ue with the people in authority roles with whom they have a personal relation. The work attitude for this stage is work as self-sacrifice. Children view careers and work roles in terms of advantage and control. They quickly distinguish between positions of authority and lesser positions on the hierarchy as they strive now to imitate powerful authority figures and to find their place within the power scheme. They begin to see the world in terms of a hierarchy of power. There are people who have power over them, while they have power over younger brothers and sisters or their toys. They strive to be in a position of authority with others or give in to those whom they perceive to be more powerful. Work, whether chores or the work roles in society, is seen as what one does in order to get something in return. Work is also a way to appease the authority figures in order to be rewarded by them. God can be seen in a similar way, someone whom they pray to and do good works for in order to get something in return. Adults operating from this stage view work as diametricaUy opposed to their needs and as a highly competitive world where they cannot afford to be honestly themselves. To them the working world is competition, manipulation, and one person finding a way to take advantage of the other. They project their own fears and needs as forces controlling the world. They feel their bosses, other businesses, society in general cause them to be competitive. They feel they have to act in a loving way to appease God and get what they want, and to act in a certain pragmatic way to appease their bosses and get the promotion they want. Because they feel controUed by the situation, they seek to gain power by controlling others. They tend to be authoritarian in their personal relations. They hold back from fully committing themselves to another person. They tend to blame the other person for anything that goes wrong. They are reluctant to take personal risks, particularly to express their feelings clearly. Everything must be controUed; spontaneity is to be avoided. FeeUng they have to protect themselves and that they are being manipulated, the adults at this stage very often deceive others and themselves. Their deceptions can be unconscious to the point that they seem to beUeve honestly in fairness, democratic decision making, and the intrinsic rewards of work, but they act totaUy in the opposite way. If they could find an easy way to make a lot of money, they would do it. If they have a family, they w?l tend to blame their famiUes for their having to work, or use their famiUes as an excuse for their having to manipulate people.</page><page sequence="5">JohnD. Vogelsang 135 Loevinger's next two stages are closely alUed with Fowler's stage three and the work attitude of identification. The conformists want to foUow external rules because they are the group-accepted rules. Because they identify their welfare with that of the group, they feel guilty for breaking the rules, for that is to go against the group. They are preoccupied with appearance, social acceptability, and approval. They worry less about punishment than about disapproval. They are insensitive to individual differences, and they tend to identify others and groups in terms of stereotypes. They value niceness, helpfulness, and cooperation. The conscientious conformists become more aware of themselves in relation to the group norms. They begin to appreciate multiple possibiUties in situations. They differentiate norms and see that there can be exceptions to rules. They become concerned with adjusting themselves to situations and the reasons behind norms. They stiU perceive motives and reasons in the simplistic and stereotypical terms that predominate in their social groups. Like Loevinger, Fowler considers this level to be modal for most adults. People at the synthetic-conventional stage are acutely tuned to the expectations and judgments of significant others. Those others could be figures of traditional authority roles who are considered personally worthy or the consensus of a valued group to which people belong. They tacitly hold unexamined ideologies that provide a basis for their identities. The ultimate reaUty is structured in terms of the interpersonal relations of people's valued groups. They lack a strong enough grasp on their own identity and judgment to have an independent perspective. People at this stage identify with their work. Their sense of purpose and identity Ues in performing their social role. They derive self-worth from belonging and being accepted by others. They strive to accommodate themselves to the norms and beUefs of the group and to perform their duty well. They are concerned about retaining the good opinion of the respected authorities in their Uves. When they think of themselves, they tend to think in terms of their role functions; this is why they can have difficulty deaUng with unemployment or retirement. If they have identified with their role as a parent and spouse, the empty nest or a divorce can be very difficult for them. However, either can also be the crisis they need to make the transition to the next stage. At the conscientious stage people take a criticad view of the standards they have previously accepted. They evaluate their own experience and develop self-chosen goals and rules. They have a sense of responsibiUty, and they think in terms of the consequences of their actions. They are more likely to feel guilty for hurting someone than for breaking a rule. They are preoccupied with being responsible, differentiating feeUngs, the motives for behavior, self respect, achieving their own goals according to their own standards, and self expression. They are uncomfortable with disorganization and procrastination. They recognize exceptions and contingencies. They feel that they are the originators of their own destinies. They think in terms of complex and differentiated polarities: dependent versus independent, inner versus outer.</page><page sequence="6">136 Journal of Religion and Health Fowler's individuative-reflective stage is sim?ar to this and Loevinger's next stage. People at this stage take seriously the burden for their own commitments, Ufestyle, beUefs, and attitudes. Their identity is differentiated from the group and the roles they perform. They critically examine values and are aware of how culture and situations affect values. Authority for them Ues in their own judgments as informed by self-ratified ideologies. They feel tension between the polarities of individuality versus being defined by a group, unexamined feeUngs versus critical reflection, self-fulfillment versus service, commitment to a relative versus struggle with the possib?ity of an absolute. People at this stage view work as their aU-in-aU. They are aware of conflict between the importance of their personal Uves and the importance of self expression. They resolve the conflict by investing themselves in work or the fam?y?whichever route is sociaUy accessible to them. They do not take on the role of the careerist or housekeeper because it is the social norm; they decide for themselves which is a primary expression of their own values and beUefs and what is possible given their social situation. They are not as dependent upon the opinion of others as they are upon the work being intrinsically rewarding. A great deal of their self-worth and sense of efficacy comes from their performing what they consider to be significant work. Though they have internaUy chosen values, they stiU center their sense of self-efficacy and worth in what they perform in the world. They might become a cUmber-up-the achievement-ladder, a dedicated social reformer, a mother who organizes other women on the block for shared day-care and support groups. For the careerists, their personal Uves may be held in abeyance until they achieve certain goals. They realize this is actually sociaUy approved in our culture, and they use that approval to justify seeking their own self-expression. They become easily dissatisfied with routine and want to be involved in what they feel is important. At the individuaUstic stage people share the concerns of the conscientious stage plus a respect for individuaUty and emotional dependence. They are preoccupied with development and differentiating their inner and outer Uves. In the process of differentiating, they become more aware of the conflict between their needs and the needs of others and the conflict between their desire for individuaUty and their concern for emotional dependence. Relations with others are seen partly as antagonistic to their urge to achieve, though they are more tolerant of themselves and others. People at this stage experience conflicts between their desire for the satisfaction they derive from the intrinsic rewards of their jobs and then desire to maintain personal relations that are supportive. Or they are very much involved with their famiUes yet feel the need to explore other goals. For both, work and personal relations seem to be offering totaUy different gratifications that interfere with each other and seem irreconc?able. The interference may be to the point that when they are engaged in one they find it difficult to forget the other. Work foUows them on vacation. They feel tense</page><page sequence="7">JohnD. Vogelsang 137 while working late to finish a project, because they feel they should be spending the time at home. FeeUng puUed away, they try to make the best of moments when they feel one aspect of their Uves is not conflicting with the other. Those are their moments of grace and presence. At the autonomous stage people have the courage to face and deal with inner conflicts and with conflicting needs and duties. They are more able to tolerate ambiguity and accept the unresolvable conflicts of Ufe. They respect their own and others' autonomy yet recognize the need for interdependence. They are preoccupied with vividly conveying their feeUngs, maintaining personal ties, understanding how the mind and body affect each other, and finding the psychological causes of behavior and their place in the social context. They replace a need to achieve their goals with a need for self-fulfillment in whatever situation they are in. Striving gives way to insight and acceptance. They can take a broad and objective view of the world and differentiate it into complex patterns. People of conjunctive faith are able to integrate into themselves much that is suppressed or unrecognized in the previous stage. They reclaim and rework their past and open themselves to the voices of their deeper selves. They work to unify opposites and are ready to be close to that which is different and threatening; but they are also a?ve to paradox and contradictions. They know the reaUty of irrevocable commitments and acts and strive to cultivate and nurture other people's identity and meaning. They recognize their connectedness to the group; they know that they are in many ways the result of class, tradition, cultural myths, ideals, but they can see themselves both as a product and an individual. They can immerse themselves in their group's beUefs yet recognize that the beliefs are relative, partial, and distorting. Authority for them is in their own judgment and in the reflective and reasonable claim of others. They know the possibiUty of unity but vividly experience the divisions of the human family as they Uve and act between an untransformed world and a transforming vision. People with the self-fulf?lment work attitude stiU experience conflicts between their personal Uves and their work, but they have replaced, on an emotional level, achievement with self-fulfillment. Whereas the conflicted people feel puUed between the different gratifications of family and work, between the emotional rewards of personal Ufe and the earned and tangible rewards of work, people at this stage see both as different aspects of the same satisfaction. The demands of one may at times need the energy they would Uke to devote to the other, but they feel that is the nature of the human predicament. Pursuing a fam?y problem to its conclusion and solving a problem on the job have their intrinsic rewards and are variations of their self fulfiUment, their fulfiUing the caU to wholeness. Their identity and sense of purpose transcend their career. They can fully commit themselves yet differentiate themselves. They reaUze that their careers define them in others' eyes, but they know that they are expressed in many more ways than their careers. They feel open and willing to risk developing other sk?ls and interests</page><page sequence="8">138 Journal of Religion and Health even if they obtain only a minimal proficiency. They de?ght more in the perspective and insight gained by learning and using a skiU than in their performance. Both Loevinger and Fowler speak of the difficulty of describing the last stage because so few people seem to reaUze it fuUy. Another issue is that most researchers are themselves operating at a lower stage; the structures of that lower stage influence their conceptuaUzations of the last stage. Loevinger only briefly describes this stage. The integrated people have obtained reconc?iation of many of their conflicts. They renounce the unattainable, cherish individuaUty, and concern themselves with a new consoUdation of their identity. Fowler's more deta?ed description of his last stage, universaUzing faith, leads to a better understanding of what work attitude people would have. People at this stage are ready to sacrifice themselves and to risk the partial justice of the present order to find a more inclusive justice. They totaUy trust in and are loyal to the principle of being. They experience the freedom of integration with their sense of God and accept the responsibiUty that goes with that freedom. They spend themselves on making real the imperatives of love and justice in the present. They celebrate the diversity and complexity of creation. They recognize the relativeness of aU beUefs and their transcendent power through being related to God as expressed in the particular moments of revelation aU faith traditions have. Authority comes from personal judgment informed by past experience, freed of ego concerns, and drawn from an intuitive discernment of purpose. Fowler also says that human vocation at this stage is seen as bringing about the kingdom of God. So few people obtain this stage, yet we exhort people to consider their work as kingdom work. Only at this stage can people actuaUy experience their work as not only an expression of themselves and their beUefs but also as an expression of the divine presence within them. They move through their work and personal relations not foUowing principles they have accepted from others, but acting from an inner drive of love and justice. We are all caUed to reach this stage of wholeness; and to perform our prophetic roles as ministers and counselors we need to help others to see its possib?ity. However, we also need to be sensitive to the other ways people conceive of themselves and their work. Only then can we lovingly accept them and become a part of their individual growth. Only then can we lovingly accept ourselves and be aware of our own growth. References 1.
