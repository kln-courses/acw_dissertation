<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 10 Interpreting long-Term human-environment Interaction in amazonia Anna C. Roosevelt This chapter seeks to combine a retrospective analysis of archaeology in amazonia  with a reflection on how scholarly agendas evolved to dovetail with the interests  and perspectives of living amazonian peoples. in mid-twentieth-century scientific  approaches, amazonia was seen by pioneering social anthropologists and archaeolo- gists as a wilderness that limited human adaptation to a unitary tropical forest culture  of camps and villages relying on slash-and-burn cultivation and foraging. although  these scholars did not conceive of the possibility of indigenous impacts on the for- est, the cultural geographers of that time did, based on cultural features of soil and  topography that they observed. in the later twentieth century, ethnographers also rec- ognized in amazonia evidence of cultural effects on habitats, in the course of research  on surviving indigenous land management systems and the cultural concepts behind  them. at the same time, research in the approaches of “new archaeology” revealed  evidence of not just one indigenous tropical forest culture but a wide variety of chron- ologically and regionally distinctive indigenous human cultures and landscape adap- tations through prehistory and history that had significant effects on the habitat even  to today. Throughout this whole period, researchers’ approaches tended to bifurcate  into those who used deductive scientific hypotheses and empirical tests of them on  the one hand and those who used description and analysis of native views and knowl- edge on the other, approaches not always compatible with each other. native amazonians, as informants and as assistants in research studies, have  made their own observations about and interpretive insights into both ancient and  doi: 10.5876/9781607325727.c010 209 </page> <page sequence="2"> 210 rooseVeLt modern human-environment interactions, via traditional cultural approaches that  embody deeper and broader memories and understandings of these relationships  than do the Western ones. in their more integrative cultural systems of ancient land- scapes, acute and fundamental scientific knowledge is interwoven with emotional  states and symbolic concepts into a rich tapestry of a widely shared great tradition  of amazonian mythic and historical cosmology. These traditions explain the cre- ation of the world, the origins of human societies, and the relationship of human  societies with their environments through time and space. With such expansive  knowledge and concepts, amazonians have maintained high levels of sustainabil- ity and a high quality of habitat and human health over more than 13,000 years.  However, the domination by european populations from the outside has marginal- ized amazonian people politically, geographically, and economically and has sig- nificantly damaged their physical and mythological environments, as well. in the  future, by taking a more sovereign role, amazonian communities can contribute  further to the preservation of their cultures and habitats as both project directors  and contractors in research based on more holistic, nuanced, and practical views  of amazonian landscapes through time and space. Their participation as sovereign  stakeholders could also help secure their rights to both territories and lifestyles and  lead to fairer, more effective, and more productive sociopolitical, judicial, and envi- ronmental management there in the future. a TheoreTICal JourneY In amazonIa: envIronmenTal lImITaTIon  TheorIes on human oCCuPaTIon oF The amazon raInForesT in the mid-twentieth century, in approaches of the first generation of scientific  anthropologists and archaeologists to the question of indigenous land use in  amazonia, the environment was seen as an unalterable given that limited or even  forcibly directed human affairs. as such, the character of the environment was  assumed and thus not investigated by researchers at the time. The overall environ- mental determinism theory seemed so logical that it was used more to explain the  archaeological record than to be tested by that record. Human adaptation to the  amazon environment was seen as more or less unitary and unchanging through  time: an archetypal “tropical forest culture.” so, human subsistence and land- management patterns in amazonia were not treated as archaeological problems  but as givens. similarly, the behavior of indigenous populations through time had  expected characteristics for scholars. people were assumed to have adapted to habi- tat by migrating from one place to another, rather than by developing new ways  to use resources in place and cultural methods to maintain connections to com- munities in other regions. scholars nevertheless recognized major variations in the  </page> <page sequence="3"> interpreting Long-terM HUMan-enVironMent interaction in aMaZonia 211 environment over space, and these were incorporated into their statements about  regional differences in tropical forest culture and changes through time as popula- tions migrated through amazonia (Lathrap 1970; Meggers 1972; steward 1949).  generally, anthropologists contrasted the resource productivity of the major allu- vial floodplain regions to the resource poverty of the uplands away from large riv- ers. such differences were considered the causes for contrasts in population size  and density and in cultural complexity between regions. but this approach—often  called cultural ecology after the concept developed by cultural anthropologist  Julian steward—only saw causality from environment to humans, not the other  way around. Thus, people in resource-rich areas could develop denser settlement  and more complex cultures, and people who moved out of those areas into poorer  areas were considered to have been diminished in population and cultural complex- ity because of the lesser resource availability there. The gaIa hYPoThesIs in the natural sciences, however, field researchers had recognized for a long time that  both animals and plants could have strong effects on their habitats and each other.  different levels of population density of deer, for example, were known to have very  different effects on forest vegetation and thus on other animals, and even plant spe- cies distributions were recognized to have influenced other plants in the community,  as when certain tree species, such as black walnut, change soil chemistry around  them in ways inimical to other plant species. in the late twentieth century, the gaia  Hypothesis built such insights into a comprehensive scheme that has gained popu- larity and even general scientific acceptance. first articulated in the mid-twentieth  century, it contributed the insight that the larger community of biota has a strong  effect on the global characteristics of the earth and its atmosphere, over and above  the effects of particular chemical and physical processes (Lovelock 2000). after a period of criticism, refinement, and testing, the tenets of the gaia  Hypothesis have been integrated into many disciplines. its practical implications  for human ecology are that the entire community of life-forms are essential in the  development and maintenance of physical and chemical systems on earth and in  the atmosphere. Thus, disrupting life-forms on a massive scale through uncon- trolled industrial impacts could lead to significant deterioration of the earth’s abil- ity to sustain life. in its early application in amazonia, particularly, scientists study- ing environmental water budgets showed that more than half of the tropical forest  region’s moisture at any particular time was tied up in the vegetation of the forest  mass (figure 10.1) (salati and Marques 1984; salati and Vose 1986). When the for- est was removed, these scientists showed, much of the original moisture became  </page> <page sequence="4"> 212 rooseVeLt Figure 10.1. tropical forest at taperinha.  unavailable, and the sudden direct exposure of the ground to sun and wind led to  further losses. Thus, not only was the forest an important factor in stability and  recycling of moisture in amazonian climate, but its removal could threaten the  integrity of the entire biophysical system. perhaps such research eventually made anthropologists more aware of the pos- sibility that the amazon rainforest might not have been a purely natural unilinear  causative force upon indigenous human cultures as much as a complex natural com- munity that had long interacted with human communities, resulting in continuing  change, mutual influence, and adaptation in both communities. in any case, scien- tists’ first conscious awareness of the possibility that there had been a more complex,  multilinear, and mutualistic relationship between humans and amazonian habitats  during prehistory came not so much directly from theoretical insights but from  problem-oriented empirical findings that they made as a result of applying method- ological innovations from north america to the region. The “new arChaeologY” In amazonIa a new generation of archaeologists began looking at amazonian sites, sequences,  and regions in the 1970s and 1980s, many of them influenced by contacts with  founders of the “new archaeology” (binford and binford 1969), such as stuart  </page> <page sequence="5"> interpreting Long-terM HUMan-enVironMent interaction in aMaZonia 213 struever, Jane buikstra, and Howard Winters, in my case. developments in north  american archaeological theory and method motivated its practitioners to pursue  problem-oriented research in interdisciplinary paleodietary, paleoenvironmental,  and bioarchaeological fields, as well as settlement analysis, among other direc- tions. The “new” approach by american archaeologists continued and developed  steward’s environmental determinism/cultural ecology. but in doing so, it also  brought more recognition of the fact of systematic cultural change through time,  especially in response to change in demographic parameters. by implication, if  there had been a series of different cultural solutions to humans’ need to engage  with their environments, then the characteristics of a particular environment could  not have been as limiting to demographic and cultural development as originally  thought by steward. applied to amazonia, such research soon furnished evidence that there had  been—not just one but—many chronologically and regionally distinct prehistoric  human cultures and settlement arrangements and that their sequence of devel- opment was unexpectedly long and complex, going back at least 13,000 calendar  years (e.g., roosevelt 2000, 2014). so, whereas the early paleo-indians chose to  move about seasonally, collecting a broad spectrum of natural plant and animal  species as they moved, early Holocene foragers chose to settle down along rivers  and wetlands and subsist by intensifying use of certain local fish and shellfish (fig- ure 10.2). subsequently, so-called formative amazonians added various domestic  crops to their subsistence mix and spread out widely but thinly in most regions.  in only a few places did the early agriculturalists group into large dense concen- trations of population. populous later prehistoric complex cultures narrowed and  intensified resource use, specializing in mass collection of aquatic resources and  cultivation of plant staples, while their country cousins in the hinterlands main- tained a broader spectrum of resources for their support. Thus, by implication a  current people’s relationship with their habitat was not necessarily the same as that  of their predecessors nor even of their neighbors (roosevelt 1989, 2014). since  there had been changes through time, one could not necessarily “project” today’s  ethnographic patterns into the deep past. one had to investigate specifically the  patterns of different periods as well as different places to reveal the patterns of  similarity and difference. naTIve amazonIans’ agenCY In The  relaTIonshIP wITh TheIr habITaTs More or less at the same time as these developments in archaeological method  and theory in amazonia, several ethnobotanists and ecological anthropologists  </page> <page sequence="6"> 214 rooseVeLt Figure 10.2.

These alterations  involved such things as large raised field systems in wetlands and large anthropic  earth deposits on uplands (denevan 1966; smith 1980; sternberg 1975). The above- mentioned ethnographic and economic botany studies of the 1970s and 1980s  found further evidence of significant, purposeful human effects on the botany and  soils of their habitats and recovered important new information on indigenous  savants’ interpretation of habitat in terms of regional ritual systems and cosmolo- gies. not only were living amazonian indians visibly impacting their environments,  but they were doing so in both purposeful and in unconscious ways, leaving their  virtual “footprints” in the forests. for example, some people had created vast cul- tural forests dominated by certain useful palms. others had made a series of clear- ings in order to encourage the proliferation of plants useful in their medicine or  technology systems. recognition of these dynamic processes enriched understand- ing of the relationship of people to their habitats, but attention to the role of cos- mology and myth in the relationship was rare (balee 1999). </page> <page sequence="7"> interpreting Long-terM HUMan-enVironMent interaction in aMaZonia 215 arChaeologIsTs Come To reCognIze The dYnamIsm  oF The human-envIronmenT relaTIonshIP continuing archaeological research in amazonia in the 1990s and first decade of  the twenty-first century also encountered evidence of prehistoric indigenous land- scape management strategies that altered habitats, in some cases with far-reaching  effects that still today influence the nature and quality of environmental resources  and condition people’s attitudes and approaches to them. evident from this con- tinuing research were interesting contrasts among contemporary but different pat- terns of prehistoric settlements within a community in terms of people’s choices  of resources to use and management of their landscape as a whole. archaeologists  interested in issues of environment and subsistence had to develop collaborations  with local savants as well as with academic natural scientists, in order to identify  species and explore their properties and significance. These collaborations exposed  further contrasts in different prehistoric groups’ approaches to and interpretations  of landscape, in addition to the continuities (e.g., Heckenberger 2004; piperno and  pearsall 1998; roosevelt 1991, 2000, 1994). in the background behind this research, general archaeological theory contin- ued to develop in new directions, some of them inspired by early debates between  “new archaeologists” influenced by environmental determinism and other archae- ologists influenced by “postmodern” thinking that privileged a view of the human  past where human agency was unfettered by any systematic influence from environ- ments. Many of the archaeologists practicing in amazonia subsequently adopted  elements from both paradigms in their approaches and also maintained relation- ships of communication and collaboration across anthropological subfields and  national boundaries. both the american anthropological association and the  society for american archaeology welcomed these kinds of cross-paradigm rela- tionships by providing places and times for discussion and publication about them.  archeologists themselves organized formal interdisciplinary discussions of these  issues with the help of sponsorship of natural history museums, universities, and  foundations (neves et al. 2010; roosevelt 1994; Visigalli and roosevelt 2010). one  result of these interactions was the integration of the new archaeological evidence of  prehistoric cultural complexity and change into social anthropologists’ interpreta- tions of the ethnographic present. another of the results of these processes of inter- action was the further development of archaeologists’ analysis of archaeological ico- nography and style in the context of their growing familiarity with the conceptual  iconography and interpretive art styles of living amazonians (e.g., roosevelt 1991).  Thus, amazonian archaeology benefited from the addition of conceptual studies  of aesthetic and ideological patterns to the more utilitarian materialistic study of  empirical food and demographic patterns. </page> <page sequence="8"> 216 rooseVeLt examPles From The lower amazon once archaeologists working in amazonia became interested in recovering biologi- cal objects from sites, such a wealth of specimens turned up that they have only just  begun to be identified and interpreted. nearly all sites that have been explored with  directed recovery techniques have produced an abundance of ecofactual as well as  cultural materials. These materials in the discrete components of archaeological sites  furnish a partial picture of an ancient human landscape at different points in time  because during each phase of occupation people brought to the sites many kinds of  environmental materials from the wider areas of their catchments, and ecofacts also  entered site-deposits through natural processes. people presumably did not utilize  and bring back specimens of all the possible species available to them, but archaeo- logical sites nonetheless usually yield large numbers of diverse specimens of bone,  shell, macroplant parts, pollen, phytolith, leaf scale, or other microscopic compo- nents, often identifiable at least to genus and often to species (with the exception  of pollen, which may be only identifiable to family or subfamily). some items are  adventitious inclusions in sites, such as parts of insects from the soil fauna or weeds,  but these, too, can reflect features of human activities and their habitats. The avail- able species at any point in time and people’s choices from the available species are  illuminating both for understanding the nature of the environments in their catch- ment areas and of their sense of the importance and utility of different plants, ani- mals, and materials, whether from practical considerations or from considerations  deriving from their ideas about human ecology, society, and the supernatural. ConTrasTIng human aPProaChes To bIoTa and  CaTChmenTs In a regIon over TIme and sPaCe The differences and similarities between the biological remains in different time  components of ancient human sites and in archaeological sites of the same time  period in different parts of a region were revealing (roosevelt 2000). The prehistoric community at santarem on the south bank of the Lower amazon  in brazil had maintained a dense, diverse, high canopy forest and broad faunal  diversity in its environs in the formative period around the beginning of the first  millennium bce. in the local region formative pottery is decorated with simple  incised geometric designs. in the gray-brown-stained, charcoal-flecked soil layers  of that site, we found the remains of a diverse group of large and medium fleshy  fish and a few smaller mammals, such as large rodents. There also were specimens  of tasty, succulent fruits and berries along with the faunal remains. The structure of  the wood charcoal and isotopic chemistry of the dated carbonized plant remains  fell in ranges of reference studies in closed-canopy tropical forests. according to our  </page> <page sequence="9"> interpreting Long-terM HUMan-enVironMent interaction in aMaZonia 217 excavations, the soils in the perimeter of the living areas of the early period lacked  the artifacts and earth structures we found in intensively occupied areas but were  also magnetized by burning and stained and mottled a light gray-brown from soot  and charcoal. We’ve interpreted these latter areas as the agroforestry sites where  people maintained or planted desirable trees in open patches that they created for  planting of cultigens, through selective clearing and burning of vegetation. Later on, between about ad 1200 and 1500 in late prehistory, the human occu- pation of the santarem site became much larger and more crowded. our analysis  of the charcoal showed that the effects of this later occupation turned the closed- canopy hardwood tropical forest habitat that existed in the formative cultural  period into a more simplified one dominated by more open-grain, fast-growing  trees and shrubs and more open areas of crops and orchards. The community’s  faunal-collection activities and plant-cultivation systems also had been simplified  by this time. The great majority of fish eaten daily were now very small: between  anchovy-sardine-size to trout-size catfishes and characins, and among the carbon- ized plants were more remains of the common, coarse but productive cultivated  cocosoid palm fruit genera such as Astrocaryum and Attalea. Larger fish such as  the formative people dined on now only occurred in the deposits of the remains of  ceremonial feasts, adjacent to people’s house mounds. The foods consumed at feasts  include remains from more succulent and delicate fruits, such as the cultivated  water palm Euterpe (acai) and the domesticate Bactris gasipaes (pupunha), and the  large fleshy fish the formatives appreciated, though no longer the small mammals.  Thus, in this later time people’s resource base seems to have been partitioned, with  high-volume everyday food production focused on smaller and bonier but more  abundant and resilient populations of food fishes and common palms, and the rarer,  more difficult to catch or produce species and succulent, delicate fruits used only  for food in ceremonial occasions, identified by funerary remains and the making  and use of fine ritual art objects. Late prehistoric santarem residential neighborhoods were composed of regular  rows of small house mounds next to ceremonial facilities and large, low platforms,  where cremations and ritual caches of fine art objects were placed in formal ceremo- nies. The density and size of the human population in these neighborhoods were  so great that people’s meter-thick, charcoal-black refuse deposits literally blanket  the entire four square kilometers of the late prehistoric site. in brazil these black  cultural soil deposits are called black indian soils. We know from contact period  accounts that these deep dark deposits rich in artifacts and ecofacts were used by  indians for intensive infield cultivation of field crops and orchards, and most are still  used this way by brazilian country people (figure 10.3). in this way the amazonians  developed a way to efficiently reap further harvests from the refuse produced by the  </page> <page sequence="10"> 218 rooseVeLt Figure 10.3.

That the amazonian  forests were never cleared on a wide scale by indigenous people seems quite firmly  established by the results of paleoecological research, which give overwhelming evi- dence of prehistoric biological assemblages whose characteristics fall well within  the range of current forests, not of savannas. The approach of the santarem community to its habitat and subsistence would  presumably have been responsive to changes in the cultural role of the site as it  evolved from a large, independent formative village to a large and wealthy cultural  center in its region toward the end of the prehistoric period. The choices probably  also reflected the large size and density of population of the later settlement, which  stood along major transportation routes between different cultural and ecological  regions. its location was the junction of several large, productive resource biomes at  the intersection of the mainstream amazon and the tapajos river, a large tributary  coming from the brazilian shield and limestone areas: the upland forests, extensive  cultivable floodplains, and major fisheries. This late prehistoric santarem site was the center for the classic style of the  incised and punctate Horizon, which extended for hundreds of kilometers along  the amazon banks east and west of the tapajos river mouth (stenborg 2004). This  style’s iconography emphasized raptorial birds and carnivores and well-ornamented  </page> <page sequence="11"> interpreting Long-terM HUMan-enVironMent interaction in aMaZonia 219 men and women. females are most common in the art by far, but the males hold  special objects, such as rattles and bags, seemingly related to shamans’ roles. The  relationship of communities in the larger region seems to have been partly con- ditioned by the threat of raiding, in addition to intense cultural and ecological  exchange, for many of the closely culturally related communities near santarem felt  the need to take defensive locations along the high riverbanks, despite the inconve- niences these must have entailed, such as distance to water, fisheries, and floodplain  planting fields. people in many regions of amazonia developed their own versions  of the incised and punctate Horizon and other cultural horizons, and it seems,  based on the evidence for defensive works, that these entities may have competed as  well as participated in shared cultural styles with each other.

Like the contemporary cliff villages near santarem, however, this hinter- land community seems to have sensed a threat of raiding, for it maintained a sturdy  post-and-thatch wall across the entrance of the cave at this time. This cave is also the site of one of the first documented human occupations in the  amazon (figure 10.5). in the millennium between about 13,000 and 10,000 years ago  (calendar years), we find paleo-indians living both in the floodplains and interior  </page> <page sequence="12"> 220 rooseVeLt Figure 10.4.

They  seem to move around a lot but return repeatedly to the same campsites for hundreds  of years, sometimes staying for many months. The paleo-indians created large poly- chrome painting compositions on the rocks and caves of Monte alegre, opposite  santarem, representing both people and animals and important heavenly bodies  such as the sun, which they aligned to mark seasonal events like winter solstice sun- set (davis 2014). The paintings also include geometric designs, some of which may  have served as notational devices. Monte alegre is not the only region with extensive  rock art; other site complexes occur in many parts of the amazon and in eastern and  southern brazil outside the basin. The large numerous paintings constitute a lasting  imprint of the cultures of the first colonists on the amazon landscape. only a few living sites of the period have been identified as yet, so we only know  about their resource use at certain times of year. in the late rainy season and early  dry season, Monte alegre paleo-indians living at the cave focused their attention  on groves of rugged, fertile upland palm trees (genera Attalea and Astrocaryum),  whose fruits and seeds are rich in fat, vitamins, and carbohydrates, and also certain  common and prolific tree beans (Hymenaea genus of the fabaceae family) in the  hill forests, whose fruits are rich in fat, vitamins, starch, and protein. They also  spent a lot of time in the floodplain lakes below the rocky hills to get fish, turtles,  </page> <page sequence="13"> interpreting Long-terM HUMan-enVironMent interaction in aMaZonia 221 Figure 10.5.

There are few mammals in their food remains, though, other than  a small number of medium-size rodents. perhaps because of their more mobile  lifestyle, the paleo-indians were not there long enough each year to exploit the  great breadth of resources that the later santarem culture inhabitants of the cave  sampled. to judge from the distribution of their distinctive projectile point types,  paleo-indians roamed in much larger catchments than the late prehistoric people,  reaching deep into the fast rivers of upland interfluvial areas south of the santarem  municipality in the middle Xingu river drainage. in contrast, the late santarem  period people’s culture never extended far inland from the main amazonian  floodplains, though it reached long distances along it. in the southern interfluves  that they penetrated, the paleo-indians would have found both diverse lithic raw  materials and the huge fishes that migrate between the fast tributary streams and  the amazon main floodplains. </page> <page sequence="14"> 222 rooseVeLt already during this earliest-known human occupation period, paleo-indians  seem to be actively managing their habitat. My and other’s results suggest that some  cutting and burning were being done in the forest to encourage concentrations of  the cocosoid palms, which proliferate under human disturbance, often sprouting  more vigorously when cut to the ground or burnt, outcompeting less aggressive  reproducers among the trees. The fruits of such palms were the single most abun- dant plant remains in the paleo-indian deposits at the site, and their stable carbon  isotope ratios indicate that they had grown not in the shade of the understory but  in clearings cut in the tall forest that still clothed the hills at the time. The paleo- indians cached large heavy cutting and chopping tools flaked from tough, resilient  stone in the cave, presumably for that purpose. it is also evident that these paleo- indians were thrifty with their food resources. not a single example of the carbon- ized palm fruits that we excavated in the cave had escaped being laboriously cracked  open to get out its fatty inner kernel. TaPerInha amazonian people don’t seem to have settled down in year-round settlements until  after most regions had been reached by the paleo-indians’ descendants: the archaic  people. permanent settlements occur only in a few regions at first, starting around  6,000 to 7,000 years ago in the middle archaic period. We found one of their sites  at taperinha, nor far downriver from santarem, where richly wooded uplands abut  extensive creeks, rivers, and wetlands (figure 10.6.) (roosevelt 1995). paleo-indians  had roamed there periodically, leaving behind a few projectile points, but to main- tain themselves longer in one place, the people of the subsequent pottery archaic  culture focused on a more monotonous diet of shellfish and those small fish that  can be harvested intensively locally and won’t quickly run out or migrate away for  good. The early people’s garbage heaps are really full of their remains and not much  else. in only a few amazonian regions that we know of did people settle down in  this way, usually where wooded upland creeks and rivers debouched into especially  productive muddy river backwaters or estuaries. it’s easy to dig shellfish in the soft  mud there and, though amazonian people mostly gave up the shellfish for horticul- tural plants in the formative period, mentioned above, almost all riverside commu- nities have kept their focus on small fish for their everyday protein food. The best  way to get these tiny fishes nowadays is to net them in small streams or capture them  in baskets behind dams in the dry season when the main rivers are low. The people of the taperinha culture were the first to create pottery vessels, which  they used for cooking, presumably, the fish and shellfish that predominate in their  middens. only a few of the sherds are decorated, with simple geometric incised and  </page> <page sequence="15"> interpreting Long-terM HUMan-enVironMent interaction in aMaZonia 223 Figure 10.6.

Their imagery is poorly understood because of the small sample  and small pieces, but the patterns continue to be used in later amazonian pottery,  and in it they represent hair, weavings, and basketry. The archaic people also built  mounds, as did later amazonians, by heaping up empty shells and other garbage,  and they ate different food during ceremonies. for example, small turtles are com- mon in sandy areas around the mound where burials were placed but they are not  common in the shell-midden remains. during the santarem period in late prehistory, when the paramount chiefdoms  warred for cultural and natural resources, people clustered their houses densely  all along the high cliffs that loom above taperinha, apparently for defensive pur- poses, as mentioned above. The thick black cultural soils and orchards that accrued  around houses remain among the most important agricultural resources in the area  still today. maraJó The low-lying major estuarine regions at the mouth of the amazon, almost a thou- sand kilometers downstream from santarem, was the birthplace of the magnificent  amazonian polychrome ceramic Horizon more than a thousand years ago. Large  </page> <page sequence="16"> 224 rooseVeLt Figure 10.7. Cultural forest on Monte Carmelo mound group, Marajó island.  villages of the polychrome culture on Marajó island were built atop large mounds  in the middle of the seasonally flooding plains. The ancient villages had groups of  large thatched dwellings built on top of wide, flat artificial mounds, with anthropic  black soil deposits, orchards, and urn cemeteries between individual house mounds  (figure 10.7). Village mound platforms vary in height from less than a meter to ten  meters or more, which is much higher than necessary to avoid the seasonal flood- waters. Thus, either or both defense and status may have motivated the creation of  these monumental constructions Here on Marajó, people continued the ancient reliance on small fish as a staple  protein source, complemented with pods of the legume tree Inga, the common  cocosoid palm fruits, and various herbaceous plants, probably planted and culti- vated on the black soil areas. Large, succulent fishes, some of them from one to  three meters long, and special cultivated water-palm fruits, such as acai, were used  only for ceremonial feasts, held in the open areas of the mound sites (roosevelt  1991). around the mounds today acai will only grow if you water it, so it seems likely  that the Marajoarans indeed were planting and tending palms of this species. The large ceremonial dishes and funerary urns and ritual items from the feasts  are absolutely covered in the sinuous polychrome designs for which the cultural  horizon is named. This, perhaps the most important of the amazon-wide ancient  art styles, was still spreading upstream across the region when europeans arrived,  so missionaries were able to learn from the omagua elite female artists that their  </page> <page sequence="17"> interpreting Long-terM HUMan-enVironMent interaction in aMaZonia 225 polychrome style represented the skin patterns of the great anaconda, creator  and ruler of the universe and shaman leader of the fearsome amazon women who  invented sorcery and the ritual arts (roosevelt 2013). This mythic iconography is  one of the strongest links between amazonians over space and time. The suPraregIonal amazonIan CosmologY today, the heritage of the polychrome ceramic Horizon is an important nexus  from which archaeologists can bring the findings of generations of research on  interactions between humans and the environment into a dialog with the cultures  and identities of living amazonian peoples. among the many modern amazonian  cultures descended from the polychrome Horizon culture, worship of the great  supernatural anaconda female shaman continues, serving to integrate the body  of indigenous scientific knowledge of the environment with people’s ideas about  proper social organization, cosmological origins, and the nature of the supernatural  powers (roosevelt 2013). The modern supraregional cosmology is centered upon a creation myth in which  anaconda Woman is carved from the trunk of a fruit tree by her father, the old  shaman, and the sun wins her for his wife in challenges of his skill and resourceful- ness. in the course of a series of confusing events, the sun creates fish and manioc,  and Woman shaman creates magic and the arts and fashions the Milky Way galaxy,  which is the supernatural amazon. she fills this part of the amazon with the life- giving and protecting milk from her breasts. by following the shamanic rituals that  she invented, including the taking of the hallucinogenic drugs that flow from the  supernatural river as milky sap through certain plants, humans can learn from and  appeal to the supernaturals in support of human interests. The anthropomorphic  spirit twin animals that each person is thought to have are enlisted by ritualists to  intercede with the supernatural “masters” or “mistresses” of the animals on behalf of  human souls and their access to life-giving knowledge and resources. The spirit peo- ple’s bodies, as seen in trances, are said to be covered with the bright designs of the  anaconda’s skin patterns. Modern women shaman paint these patterns on people’s  bodies and on artifacts as prayers to the spirits for help and protection. The spiritu- ally potent beings and things described in the creation myths also bear significant  scientific information about the structure and function of human societies and the  natural environment. for example, the stories of the interaction of Woman shaman  and the sun actually follows the interaction of the heavenly bodies, as amazonians  understand them (davis 2014). similarly, beliefs about the relationships of spirit  animals and plants express knowledge of not only the appearance but also the social  behavior, reproduction, and ecology of the biota (roosevelt 2013). so, the mythic  </page> <page sequence="18"> 226 rooseVeLt great anaconda is represented as female, following knowledge of the larger size  and social dominance of female anacondas. she also is cast as a dangerous canni- bal, for female anacondas do eat other anacondas, including the smaller males, who  cluster about females during mating. in relation to human society, she is the spirit  animal espoused by leading women in the matrilineal/matrilocal communities of  the shipibo, where women are considered to own the family house, where they  were born, and where mature women lead the society’s only initiation ceremonies,  which are for girls, not boys. important elements of this immaterial cosmology can be traced back into  amazonian prehistory, through the material remains of ancient cultures, men- tioned above. With their rock art, the paleo-indians had created solar observatories  to watch the movements of the sun and constellations (davis 2014). Men, women,  and children were all involved in rituals at the sites, for we find their handprints  marked within some designs. some constellations and comets are personified as  humans or animals, and sometimes their reproductive status is marked, as in the  images of breeding plumes shown on a heron icon. Later on, some formative art  styles depict animals with human stance, limbs, and accoutrements; these appear  to represent beings such as the ethnographic supernatural “masters” and “mistresses”  of the animals. santarem art also depicts men and women with their spirit ani- mals mounted on their heads and shoulders, as well as the images of male shaman  shaking rattles, mentioned above. These dynamic images represent people going  through the process of communicating and traveling to be with supernaturals in  the other world. in polychrome art, both ancient and modern, the patterns of the anaconda’s  skin dominate the style just as Woman shaman, the great anaconda, is thought  to dominate the other world. on Marajó her image is a prominent effigy, and  elements of her creation story are referenced in ceremonial objects, such as small  ritual cups shaped as breasts. depictions of her include references to shamanic  procedures, such as rattling (figurines representing her body may contain rattlers),  whistling or blowing, containing a spirit in her belly, or wearing a shaman’s shirt  (roosevelt 1991). There are interesting changes as well as the continuities in ritual amazonian art  and presumably the cosmologies behind it as different societies develop and change  through time in different spaces. for example, animals from the waters or under- ground, now considered Woman shaman’s sphere, predominate in the art of Marajó  and its successors among the matrilineal shipibo and omagua, whereas animals of  the land and sky, the sun’s sphere, dominate santarem art. Yet, even among very  different current amazonian societies, such as the small, patrilineal village societ- ies of the northwest amazon and the populous matrilineal societies of the upper  </page> <page sequence="19"> interpreting Long-terM HUMan-enVironMent interaction in aMaZonia 227 amazon, the basic cosmology is essentially similar, despite the myriad of local par- ticularities. both the shipibo and the tukanoans recognize and worship Woman  shaman as their creator, and both employ very similar customs and rituals to link  their societies to the supernatural powers. How is it that through such a long time span and such diversity of culture and  environmental interaction, amazonians preserved basic outlines of a cosmology?  part of the explanation may be that their cosmology is based on an understand- ing of the universe, the amazon basin, and the skies that has not changed much  through the millennia of human occupation (roosevelt 2014). another explana- tion is that a cosmology first formed by the paleo-indians has been passed down to  today because of the continuous settlement in the basin from the beginning. each  new culture that archaeologists recognize shows clear links to earlier ones, and such  links can often be traced over wide areas of the basin. if we can judge from modern customs, ancient amazonians would have visited  other communities to take part in their rituals and would have invited outsiders to  their own. in this way local versions of myths that developed would have a chance  of influencing other ones. communities’ current myths about their origin often  link their region with one of the other important cultural regions of amazonia,  showing that people recognize a mythic-historical landscape much larger than that  where they now live and much older than the era in which they live. for example,  northwest amazon peoples who retain the polychrome Horizon style claim that  the great anaconda brought their ancestors up in her belly from Marajó island  at the mouth of the amazon where a woman ruled. Mythic-historical narratives  communicated in formal ceremonial enactments and accoutrements, in the iconog- raphy of the communal house as well as in informal storytelling, are themselves an  important medium of transmission for the cosmology today. for example, modern  shamans who have never made or seen a type of prehistoric object, such as the atlatl,  are nonetheless perfectly able to recognize pictures of them because of descriptions  encoded in mythological accounts. (i observed this phenomenon of ancient knowl- edge preserved by myths rather than by actual objects in 2005 when discussing pic- tures of prehistoric objects with shaman and chiefs who had gathered in santarem  for a brazilian government workshop before they took on the job of being the  teachers for their communities.) also important in communicating cosmological  concepts over time and space would have been the material representations of the  ideas in ancient and modern amazonian art. ancient objects retrieved by later peo- ple from deposits of earlier cultures are sometimes found placed reverently in the  later cultures’ ceremonial deposits (roosevelt 1991). today, also, some amazonians  learn about ancient cultural ideas and knowledge through archaeologists’ books  and presentations, and vice versa. </page> <page sequence="20"> 228 rooseVeLt Changes In The auTonomY oF amazonIan CommunITIes  vIs-à-vIs resourCes aFTer euroPean ConQuesT Huge changes have taken place at santarem and its environs and Marajó since the  european conquest of the amazon and their incorporation as provincial munici- palities in the modern nation-state. in this situation of lesser local autonomy, new  patterns of human-environment interaction have changed the approaches to the  landscapes around occupation sites. The environment around santarem—now a  much larger and more urbanized settlement—has become even more depauperate  in diverse life forms than in late prehistory. With the much larger modern popula- tion, the addition of large transient visitor populations, rampant illegal gold-min- ing upstream, few cheap local fuel sources, a large interregional market, and the  introduction of domestic animal pasturing, what was fast-growing secondary forest  in later prehistory has now diminished to open savanna woodland over much of the  land around the city. The loss of forest is associated with a loss of rainfall in both  santarem and Monte alegre, close by across the river. as a result, at santarem larger  forest and river faunas and the diverse, succulent wild and domestic amazonian  fruits have become expensive to obtain because they are no longer available in the  thinly vegetated, ravaged environment around the city. ordinary people cannot  afford these foods or the petroleum-based fuels of the modern economy, with the  result that their general nutrition and health are not good, and their fuel scaveng- ing has further reduced the woody vegetation around the city, which otherwise  could furnish them with valuable dietary supplements in the form of fruits, herbs,  and small faunas. in the overgrazed, overburned cattle pastures on the upland areas  around santarem and Monte alegre, the Attalea palms so appreciated by the paleo- indians are flourishing, but the cattle grazing there are the primary beneficiaries. in the Monte alegre hills, the human population seems to have diminished since  later prehistory. no one has lived at or near the cave site since the conquest, we  know from the cave radiocarbon dates and cultural remains, though there is now  a village of dispersed houses and gardens down the hill on the floodplain at the  lakes, as there was in later prehistory, and its inhabitants regularly come into the  hills to hunt, gather, or pasture animals. a wide range of fruits and fish continue to  be easily available to the lakeside villagers, both from the hill forests and from the  floodplains, their gardens, and their corrals. deer and other sizeable game still can  be caught in the hills, despite the creation of much pasture for the cattle economy  and despite hunting now being illegal there. although the population in the Monte  alegre hills lacks a nearby clinic for treatment of ailments, people’s health is quite  robust, for they continue to support themselves with local cultivated, collected, and  hunted foods without undue effort into advanced old age. and there is still more  than enough forest around to supply their fuel needs. </page> <page sequence="21"> interpreting Long-terM HUMan-enVironMent interaction in aMaZonia 229 The general amazonian pattern of using the abundant smaller fishes for daily  food continues in the Lower amazon today, and many riverside communities earn  cash by selling their surplus catches. but the larger species can be had mainly in  city restaurants for tourists or elites or in the outer hinterlands, such as the Monte  alegre hills, where the population is low enough and isolated enough that people  can get still the larger fish for themselves. The industrial fishing industry in both  municipalities of santarem and Monte alegre is causing big problems for local  people now because the large mechanized boats can easily overfish, using refrigera- tors to preserve the large catches for sale in the city markets. despite the existence  of laws on the books that protect local communities’ resources from outsiders’ use  without permission, enforcement is nonexistent. on Marajó, the ancient forest has been removed over much of the eastern part of  the island, and cattle herds have replaced the flourishing population centers of the  ancient mound-building societies. indigenous languages, religion, and social orga- nization have been effaced for the most part on Marajó. both new migrants and  families with local roots now live in small villages and towns, and scattered tenant  ranchers serve the ranchers who own most of the anthropic pastures. The land in  much of the amazon was distributed as huge baronies to the generals who led the  defeat of the final uprising against the portuguese, and Marajó was divided into  large ranches. conversion of so much land to grassland must have diminished rain- fall, and overgrazing and trampling by herds has muddied Marajó rivers and lakes.  However, many indigenous skills continue to be held: pottery making, artisanal  fishing and foraging, and cultivation of fruit trees and native crops, which continue  to be important in people’s diets. something that stands out about recent change through time in amazonia is the  contrast between euro-american and indigenous attitudes toward settlement mobil- ity in regard to resources. some archaeologists, colonial administrators, missionaries,  and development aid specialists tend to feel that permanent settlement is the prefer- able pattern. certainly it fits an environment in which most land is privately owned,  as it is today. archaeologists tend to think it was an important evolutionary advance  to produce enough food locally with agriculture to stop having to forage over a lot of  territory to get enough to eat. Missionaries and colonial administrators felt that it was  more civilized, organized, and christian to produce food with domestic animals and  plants, and it was certainly more convenient for them when the indians they were try- ing to control stayed in one place near colonial centers. Modern development experts  don’t approve of shifting cultivation and hunting, which they assume harms the land  and wastes people’s time traveling to dispersed fields and hunting sites. However,  shifting settlement has been one of the ways that amazonians have managed their  environments without permanently reducing their economic productivity. </page> <page sequence="22"> 230 rooseVeLt for example, indigenous amazonians who have been interviewed seem to give  a high value to what social anthropologists refer to as trekking (e.g., politis 2007).  Listening to what amazonian people have said about it over the years makes the  trek seem a combination rest cure, second honeymoon, hiking-and-swimming  vacation to the cabin for the children, going fishing with dad and mom, tourist  trip to commune with the wilderness, gourmet picnicking, and special expedition  to gather valued resources to bring home. people do not complain about having to  go on trek. They look forward to it. trekking means getting away from it all, being  away from noise and smoke and chatter of the village or town. it means the family  and its special friends and affiliates can be together. The water at trekking sites is  cleaner, and the beach is less crowded. The kids get to snack on especially delicious  unusual fruits and bite-sized faunas you can catch with your hands. participants can  get together for dam-fishing picnics on small streams and eat as much as they can  hold of delectable smoked fish, then collapse in their hammocks and sleep peace- fully in the quiet of the currently uninhabited forest. spiritual reasons for trekking also have been articulated by amazonians. for  example, the nukak of the northwest amazon in colombia told anthropologist  gustavo politis that they like to go deep into the heart of their territory to special  long-standing groves of domesticated palms such as pupunha because they believe  that their ancestors established those, and they can commune with their spirits  there (politis 2007). away from crowded settlements and their unsanitary condi- tions, there’s less exposure to infectious disease, a pattern that might be interpreted  as spiritually safer, since evil spirits are thought by amazonians to be a cause of  illness. in addition, the faraway places have culturally special foods and materi- als not available at current horticultural villages, and people appreciate and seek  these out between harvests. Many ethnographers have written that tukanoans and  arawakans in the northwest amazon schedule their important initiation dances  with the fruiting time of special groves of trees with a mythological relation to the  creation time when the ancestral lines of humans were born. such ancient groves  have been identified over large areas of the amazon and stand as witnesses to the  long-term management of vegetation by indigenous people. as such, they are not  only a seasonal resource but also an important tangible cultural ecological property  for future generations. That seasonal and periodic changes of settlement are good  for the environment as well as good for people is unarguable. game animals and  faunas helpful for pollination or other services come back in greater numbers in the  now-quiet settlement. secondary vegetation containing nutrients for future har- vests can grow back in gardens and fields left fallow when people spend time away. trekking in the forests has become an unavailable luxury, though, for many  people in the santarem-Monte alegre region because of the rise of industrialized  </page> <page sequence="23"> interpreting Long-terM HUMan-enVironMent interaction in aMaZonia 231 and globalized soybean farming to the south and north. in league with a brazilian  government port-administration company, the Us cargill company has devel- oped a truly enormous facility at santarem to load soybeans onto large transport  craft from as far away as europe. The brazilian company cdp bulldozed large  areas of the archaeological mounds in santarem to create the port for this trade,  and the remaining deposit is being heavily polluted by illegal dumping of danger- ous chemicals used in mechanized loading operations. to feed the international  shipping trade, very large areas of ancient cultural forests in the south of para  state have been deforested for permanent farms to grow the beans to be exported  from santarem. established by outsiders with sweetheart loans from cargill or  the brazilian government, these farms are not being managed in a sustainable  way. The widespread clearing and exposure of land to weather lead to drought and  nutrient deficiencies, and with time it reverts to pasture for the cattle herds that  replace the former local indian communities, who have withdrawn further south  ahead of the bulldozers. at the mouth of the amazon, on the tidal rivers of Marajó and the other delta  islands, local people both feed themselves and their families and make money  making floodplain forest products such as the valuable water palm acai. The local  family concerns work sustainably, living on fish and forest products and both  harvesting and regenerating the groves. Their sites are literally covered with dense  anthropic acai groves (figure 10.8). in contrast, foreign companies usually destroy  these ancestral groves as they harvest the trees, limiting future production in  those spaces. finally, perhaps the most harmful change since the conquest was the forced  acculturation that people along the amazon mainstream underwent during the  first two centuries of missionization and that continues still today. This process  separated people both from their conceptual cosmology and from their social  organization, neither of which suited the christian religion and Western notions  of proper social organization that conquerors forced on them. This deculturation  process did not, however, separate people from their deep knowledge of their habi- tats and basic artisanal skills, which continue quite intact. and, despite statements  to the contrary (fraser et al. 2014), amazonian indians have not disappeared.  indigenous people who still speak their traditional languages and carry out their  ceremonies and art traditions still dominate populations in the hinterlands of  amazonia. However, this situation will not remain for long, because indigenous  lands and cultures are not in practice being protected from forced dispossession  by amazonian countries, despite all the laws that provide for maintaining them  on their ancient lands. </page> <page sequence="24"> 232 rooseVeLt Figure 10.8. Anthropic acai grove, Marajó island.  naTIve amazonIans, researCh, and reParaTIons native amazonians, incorporated into projects both as informants and as assistants  and participating in debate as members of conferences, have contributed further  observations and interpretive insights of their own about both ancient and modern  relationships of people to their habitats (neves et al. 2010; posey 2002; Visigalli and  roosevelt 2010). Whether they are native americans or rural nationals of mixed  heritage and geographic origins, these people from the amazonian regions being  studied by anthropologists turn out to have their own range of research interests  relating to cultural development and landscape management. The following are some of the thoughts that indigenous community members  have articulated to me. some leaders of cayapo communities in the southern  amazon drainage have expressed interest in studying examples of ancient Marajó  art, which they regard as the work of their ancestors. They also express strong  interest in the possibility of archaeological excavation of their ancestral sites and  the maintenance of museum collections of special prehistoric art objects in the  local community, rather than in national museums. When we retrieved from  gold miners a huge, jewel-like crystal projectile point that had been removed  from the area (figure 10.9), the cayapo living at the find-site requested that it be  returned to be kept in their ritual men’s house (roosevelt et al. 2009). at present,  cayapo chiefs of communities in the middle Xingu interior south of santarem  </page> <page sequence="25"> interpreting Long-terM HUMan-enVironMent interaction in aMaZonia 233 Figure 10.9.

The curuaia community a little further north on the curua river in the middle  Xingu in the direction toward santarem also sees anthropological research as a  validation of their cultural histories. When we invited curuaia leaders to recruit  adolescents from their community to take our intensive field-training course in  environmental archaeology in the future, the leaders expressed the wish to learn  the archaeological techniques and evidence themselves. They were especially  interested in our archaeological evidence for long-term intensive occupation of  the region by indigenous groups. They felt that the information was ammunition  for being more assertive in maintaining their independence, holding onto their  land, and being more involved in negotiations when companies or government  agencies wanted to implement large projects locally. When brazilian nationals  try to deny that the curuaia have always been there, as they are wont to do, the  </page> <page sequence="26"> 234 rooseVeLt community now can use the archaeological evidence to prove their long-term  presence in the landscape. The surviving people of the ancient polychrome Horizon have been especially  engaged with researchers in the past. for example, the shipibo communities of the  Ucayali drainage in lowland peru have long collaborated with social anthropolo- gists and archaeologists, giving help to their research and at the same time learning  about their past culture from sources they get access to through exchanges with the  scholars (Lathrap 1970; roosevelt 2013; Weber 1975). some shipibo leaders have  even come to Us cities to go over museum collections from their culture, and they  keep in touch with anthropologists through the internet. important results that  some ethnographers have had through interviews with shipibo artists on the sub- ject of the symbolic and spiritual meaning of iconography suggest that further work  with other living descendants of the ancient polychrome Horizon in, for example,  french guiana, would be useful. polychrome-descendant people have already given  important testimony about their understanding of the ritual and ecological mean- ing of animal images, and their interpretations of specific images on the ancient  pots from nearby archaeological sites promise to be illuminating in the future. as  mentioned above, shipibo say that their large female effigy beer pots represent the  great anaconda, who created the heavens. This shipibo belief is just one example  of the stories with which amazonian indians integrate the great tradition of their  cosmology with their acute observation and understanding of the natural world  and their societies. rio negro tukanoans and arawakans, also descendants of the polychrome Horizon,  have been collecting, interpreting, and publishing with scholars their research relat- ing archaeological features such as petroglyphs with their current mythology, cos- mology, and landscape ecology (cabalzar 2010; roosevelt 2013). Their take on the  iconography of the great anaconda, whose image they portray on their longhouse, is  parallel to that articulated to ethnographers by modern shipibo. northwest amazon  people’s concepts integrate their expert knowledge of social life and the anthropic  environment into a complex and vivid legendary landscape populated with ancestral  animal-human characters. for them, the amazon mainstream is the great anaconda,  who they believe carried them up to the rio negro from Marajó island, where they  say the Woman shaman ruled before she was defeated and fled with her minions to  the otherworld in the sky. They point to the paleo-indian petroglyphs on rock out- crops as the marks they made in the course of their escape. shamans say that they can  obtain her precious, life-protecting milk from the sap of the sinuous, mottled-bark  Banisteriopsis caapi vine, her magical plant species. not surprisingly, the patterns of  the anaconda’s skin has become a pan-amazonian symbol of solidarity in the north- west amazon and beyond ( Jean Jackson in roosevelt 1994). </page> <page sequence="27"> interpreting Long-terM HUMan-enVironMent interaction in aMaZonia 235 i can envision in the future a conference of indigenous polychrome Horizon– descendant groups from all over the amazon with researchers from all over the  world, to pursue further study of this cultural tradition and discussion of its  broader significance in the memorializing of historic landscapes and the inter- preting of amazon ecology. to record and explore further the range of tradi- tional concepts connecting particular species of plants and animals with ances- tral deities and social and ritual practices would be a great advance. people’s  current understanding and practices in regard to the anthropic dark earths of  the amazon would also be illuminating. but even just collecting a registry of  all known cultivated trees, vines, shrubs, and herbs, all recognized animal spe- cies, and their characteristics and linkages within the ecosystem and the mythic  cosmos would go far in clarifying the details of ancient indigenous management  and ritual systems. today, native amazonian communities have the option to contribute to  research more assertively as both project directors and contractors, and their con- cepts of the integration between humans and spiritual ancestors could contribute  to an even more holistic and nuanced approach to the study of humanized land- scapes through time and space. such pursuits might lead to an entirely different  approach from all past scholarly ones, not envisioned by anthropologists. in any  case, the communities’ active participation in research on their regions could give  important incentives and pressures for the acceptance of more assertive leadership  from indigenous people and communities in the face of the growing power of  governments and outside companies to intervene in locales without the permis- sion of their inhabitants. it’s clear that recent industrial-scale, globalized systems  of land use in the amazon have been unsustainable economically and destructive  both ecologically and culturally. but it’s also clear that amazonia is a durable land  of great natural resources and can certainly continue to both support its popula- tions and produce abundant wealth. by their dynamic cultural sequence, native  amazonians have given ample proof of their ability to devise ingenious new ways  of resource management and lifeways over time, all the while keeping very much  alive their regional cosmology. Their long-lived prehistoric societies and the evi- dent continuity in their culture sequences are a testament to their success. and  they have done these things without destroying the region’s fundamental resource  base. one might even say that they had enriched the soil as well as the forest’s  diversity of useful species and at the same time built one of the great cultural  traditions of the world. Therefore, in addition to their unassailable human right  to a strong role in decision making about this region, their patrimony, they bring  an unbeatable record of effective and innovative land management and cultural  development, a contribution that is sorely needed now. </page> <page sequence="28"> 236 rooseVeLt reFerenCes anderson, anthony b., peter Herman May, and Michael J. balick. 1991.
