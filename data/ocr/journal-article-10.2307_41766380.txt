Bailey It night, is five and minutes the townspeople past mid- night, and the townspeople of Vidin in northwestern Bul- garia are celebrating the New Year with toasts and lib- eral shots of rachiya, a clear plum brandy. Meanwhile, thieves take advantage of the moment and force their way into the local museum. Fif- teen minutes later, in answer to the museum's alarm, po- lice arrive to find a half dozen life-size Roman marble stat- ues stolen. This museum break-in differs from those that make newspaper head- lines in most European cities because in Bulgaria the loot- ing of museums has reached epidemic proportions. In the three years since Bulgaria be- came a democracy, burglars have struck seven museums. Museums, however, are not the only targets of this new breed of criminal. Five thou- sand icons have disappeared from Bulgaria's churches during the past 12 months, and the country's archaeolog- ical sites are easy prey. Bulgaria has a rich cul- tural heritage. From the an- thropomorphic figurines of the first agriculturalists and the magnificent gold and copper ornaments of the first metal-users to the intricate craftsmanship of Thracian silversmiths, its peoples have left a superb artistic legacy. It is ironic that the plundering of this legacy should co- incide with the onset of democratic government. In the wake of political upheaval few resources have been di- rected toward the protection of archaeological sites and museums. Before 1989, the antiquities business involved small groups of highly specialized looters servicing a lim- ited foreign market. The subsequent relaxation of border controls and the consequent increase in opportunities for international travel and contact with Western countries have provided a context in which archaeological looting has flourished. But the problems facing the museums and archaeolo- gists of today's Bulgaria were developing long before Todor Zhivkov and his harsh com- munist regime were over- thrown. Traveling exhibitions of gold from the Copper Age Varna necropolis on the Black Sea and Thracian gold and sil- ver objects served as excel- lent, but unintentional, ad- vertisements to Western an- tiquities collectors of Bul- garia's potential. Bulgarian archaeologists and local mu- seums have added to the problem by openly dealing with looters and treasure hunters. Donors of finds are treated as cultural heroes, their photographs placed in local newspapers. By law, Bul- garian citizens are required to turn in any artifacts discov- ered while digging a garden or plowing a field. Provincial museums, however, encour- age treasure hunters by buy- ing antiquities. If not pur- chased, administrators fear that the artifacts will find homes in Western European collections. The negotiations accompanying such pur- chases seldom include rigorous investigations into an ar- tifact's provenience. During the years of tight socialist price-and-wage controls and heavy state investment in the preservation of the nation's past museums were able to buy almost everything that was brought to them. Now, with money tight, museums have had to spend their limited funds employing guards and installing electronic burglar alarms; little money is left to pur- chase antiquities. The result is that looters now sell their wares in the West, and there is little that Bul- garia's museums can do about it. Furthermore, the end 26 Archaeology</page><page sequence="2">The gold ornaments, above, are from Varna, a Late Copper Age site on the Black Sea coast.

Dire economic times provide a fertile climate for the looting and selling of artifacts. Laws pertaining to antiquities theft, developed in 1962, have failed to keep pace with the rapidly changing social and economic situation. The fine for the looting of an archaeological site is the equivalent of about $12.00, but the return on a few Roman coins, an icon, or a silver Thracian bowl can be hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of dollars. One night's work with a spade and flashlight can buy five years' worth of food and drink, and a Volkswagen to boot. The most troublesome aspect of the existing antiqui- ties laws is that the onus of proof is on the police. In the- ory they must prove that a suspect artifact or icon has been looted from a site or stolen from a church, and not accidentally found, handed down from parent to child, or plowed from a field. In practice the police must catch a looter in the act of robbing a site, which is difficult with- out an elaborate network of informants. An attempt to address the problems of looting and cultural crime is being made by a group of concerned academics and lay people in Sofia. Virginia Kostadinova and her colleagues at the newly formed Social Council for the Preservation of Bulgarian Heritage have begun pub- licizing the problem and educating the public about the national importance of the country's artifacts and sites. Kostadinova has produced three films for Bulgarian tele- vision. The first two, Indiana Jones is not in Your Imagination and Chronicle of an Actual Disappearance , were funded by a Bulgarian national newspaper and private donors and are awaiting air time. Lack of funds has stalled produc- tion of the third. In a country with one television channel, intense coverage of national political debates, and a new hunger for previously unavailable Western films and soap operas, it is not easy to convince programmers to sched- ule documentaries of this sort. In addition to the campaign to educate average Bul- garians about the value and importance of their cultural monuments, Kostadinova has also called for new laws that would raise the penalties for looting and shift the burden of proof that an artifact has or has not been looted from the police to the collector. Ivan Panajotov, a member of the Archaeological Institute of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and president of the Bulgarian Ar- chaeological Society, would like to see a regional author- ity with a mandate to investigate suspected crimes against the cultural heritage, to monitor the preservation of sites, and to restore some respect for the country's ar- chaeological heritage. Panajotov admits that established collectors will continue to buy and sell artifacts and that new laws may need to include plans to accommodate the legal acquisition of cultural artifacts by private individu- als and organizations. Bulgarian archaeological authorities, however, realize that attempts to control and eliminate the looting prob- lem within Bulgaria will only succeed if they are matched by a coordinated effort between Bulgarian customs officials and Interpol agents working the Eu- ropean art and antiquities markets and auc- tion houses. Until they are assured that the drain of antiquities to Western markets can be stopped, many Bulgarian museums will continue to try to staunch the flow by buying artifacts, which of course will only stimulate further looting. Those with the Social Council for the Preservation of Bulgarian Heritage can only hope that their effort to break this cycle will be aided by an economic recovery and government cooperation. ■ Douglass W.
