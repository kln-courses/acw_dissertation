<plain_text><page sequence="1">RUTH OLITSKY RUBINSTEIN 'Tempus edax rerum': a newly discovered painting by Hermannus Posthumus* THE large archaeological fantasy (oil on canvas, 96 by 144.5 cm.), acquired in 1983 in Vienna by the Prince of Liechtenstein for his collection in the Schloss Vaduz (Inv. No.740), is signed by the artist, Hermannus Posthumus, and dated 1536 (Fig.2; Fig.3, No.32; Fig.4). In this same issue (see page 433), Nicole Dacos places this hitherto almost unknown painter in his artistic context; here I shall consider the picture's content. Painted in the year of the entry of Charles V into Rome, it is a fascinating document of the archaeological milieu early in the reign of Paul III. The papal brief of 28th November 1534, appointing Latino Giovenale Manetti as Commissioner of Antiqui- ties, eloquently describes the precarious state of Roman monuments which must be protected from fire, theft, pil- lage, ivy, brambles, neglect - dangers as eternal as Rome itself. 1 The painting transcends any genre. It is not a topo- graphical view, like the contemporary 'Mantua map' of Rome, nor purely an imaginary landscape with ruins or mythological scenes, nor is it a forerunner of the light- hearted Baroque and Rococo capricci. It can be seen per- haps as belonging in part at least to the iconographic tradition of the Triumph of Time, with architectural frag- ments strewn in the path of Time's chariot and submerged cities in the background, as in Jacopo del Sellaio's illustra- tion of one of Petrarch's Trionfi in the Museo Bandini, Fiesole. Here, however, Time is not personified by the usual decrepit figure with an hourglass, but is rather rep- resented by the Menologium rusticum Vallense (1),2 the Ro- man sundial and rustic calendar owned in the Renaissance by the della Valle family, and now lost. This Posthumus has made the necessary starting point of the three itiner- aries which we shall follow in the catalogue below. The most obvious indication of the theme of the painting is, of course, the inscription from Ovid's Metamorphoses XV, 234-36: 'tempus edax rerum...' (15), a recurring topos in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. 'Ravenous time and envi- ous age, you destroy everything', the fragment reads, and round about in the foreground of the painting lie the disiecta membra of Time's greed. These fragments correspond to sculpture and architec- ture known through contemporary drawings to have exis- ted in Rome by 1536, some of them already safely preserved in private collections. The Cesi collection,3 for example, is represented by the 'Torlonia Vase' (7), the 'Juno Ludovisi' (22), and perhaps already by the 'Albani puteal' (45). While these famous pieces can be easily identified, the precise identities of some of the others seem to have been deliberately obscured, as if Posthumus enjoyed puzzling the cognoscenti in various ways, for example by combining elements from similar statues such as the two famous pairs of river gods (50,52), or by show- ing some of the monuments, which in his day were whole, as mere fragments exaggeratedly gnawed by time: the Torlonia vase (7), and the 'Temple of Bacchus' (41), also overgrown by just such vegetation as that which Latino Giovenale Manetti had been appointed by the Pope to combat. Thus far - though other themes emerge in the middle ground and distance - the painting seems to have been designed for contemporaries who knew the antiquities of Rome well from their tours of the private collections, and who could accept its playful challenge to their knowledge. But, on another level, the picture can be interpreted as an appeal to save the ruins of Rome. In 1536, the archaeologists, artists, collectors and tour- ists - like the tiny excited figures on the second and third ridges - were confronted by the overwhelming immensity and confusion presented by the ruins disfigured by Time. But ways could be found to preserve these visible remains of the ancient skill. Statues could be saved from the lime kilns by private collectors, while monuments in situ could be measured (21,50), drawn (as 52), and presented to scale in plan, elevation, and section, their missing parts restored on the drawing board, with the help of ancient texts, as Raphael pointed out to Leo X in his famous letter of 1519,4 so as to reconstruct their original appearance, and also eventually to reinterpret them in new buildings. We can thus read in this mysterious painting an implicit appeal to cognoscenti to collect, and to artists to study what still remained in order that it might be preserved. It is also a reminder that far more remained to be discovered below the earth's surface, as the figures with torches illu- minating the wall paintings show (Fig.5). In this way the hopeless truth of Ovid's passage on tempus edax could be alleviated. Indeed the collections of antiquities in Rome increased dramatically in the years that followed; the Pope's family, the Farnese, themselves led the way by *Warmest thanks go to Phyllis Bober, and the Census of Antique Works of Art Known to Renaissance Artists at the Warburg Institute, University of London; and to Nicole Dacos, Gwendolyne Denhaene, and Elizabeth McGrath for their valuable suggestions. The painting will be exhibited at the Metropolitan Mu- seum of Art in the autumn of 1985; I am grateful to Guy Bauman for showing me his entry for it in the forthcoming exhibition catalogue, Liechtenstein: the Princely Collections.

GOLZIO: Rafaello nei documenti, Vatican City [1971], p.84. 425</page><page sequence="2">HERMANNUS POSTHUMUS excavating from the Baths of Caracalla statues which have withstood the tooth of Time. By April 1536, Latino Giovenale Manetti had become a maestro delle strade as well as Commissioner of Antiquities, and in both these capacities cleared a route for Charles V's triumphal entry through the archaeological zone, de- stroying many houses and churches that encumbered the view of the antique monuments along the way.5 Post- humus himself may well have been involved in the prepa- rations for the entry of the Emperor, as a 'maestro Ermanno' was paid for decorations of the Porta S. Sebastiano through which Charles V entered the city.6 The inventive reconstructions in the middle ground (47 and 53) contain elements which might refer to the empire of Charles V, and specifically to his conquests in Africa at Tunis: a theme of the decorations at the Porta S. Se- bastiano was the African triumphs of the two Scipios; the emperor was there celebrated as the third. This could account for the introduction of so many Egyptian antiqui- ties in the middle and background of the painting. Far more needs to be studied than I have suggested here. Perhaps other passages from the fifteenth book of Ovid's Metamorphoses hold clues to the distant background of this evocative masterpiece, the commission and prove- nance of which await discovery, as well as the explanation and identification of many of the ruins. 5R.

CATALOGUE The following is an attempt to identify some of the antique sculpture, archi- tecture and other features in Posthumus's painting, mostly through comparison with contemporary drawings. The draughtsmen concerned are artists who were in Rome in the 1530s: Amico Aspertini from Bologna, in Rome 1532-c.1540 (P. P. BOBER: Drawings after the Antique by Amico Aspertini: The Sketchbooks in the British Museum, London [1957]); Martin van Heemskerck, a Dutch painter in Rome from 1532 until 1536 (two albums in the Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin- Dahlem, contain his Roman drawings as well as some by another hand which NICOLE DACOS in this issue (p.437) attributes to Posthumus. The albums are published by c. HiLSEN and H. EGGER: Die romischen Skizzenbiicher von Marten van Heemskerck, I, Berlin [1913], II [1916]; hereafter referred to as Heemskerck I and II); Francisco de Hollanda, a Portuguese humanist whose sketchbook in the Escorial was made in 1539-40 (E. TORMO: Os Desenhos das antigualhas que vio Francisco d'Ollanda, Pintor Portugues (... 1539-1540 ...), Madrid [1940]). The catalogue is numbered according to three itineraries beginning with the one nearest the viewer; each proceeds forward from left to right from the dominant figure in each group. The paintings, indicated by letters, are described separately by Nicole Dacos (A-F after No.40 below). The numbers in the catalogue correspond to those on Fig.3; the asterisked entries in the catalogue refer to precisely identifiable monuments. Itinerary I. Nos.1-40; sculpture and architecture *1. Marble sundial with rustic calendar carved with the twelve signs of the zodiac on three sides of its base. Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, VI, 2306 (here- after CIL) as the Menologium rusticum Vallense, as it was in the della Valle collections in the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, after which it was no longer recorded; present whereabouts unknown. Only two or three of the many sixteenth century representations of it antedate Posthumus's painting: (i) Anonymous untitled tract on Roman calendars published by G. Mazzocchi in 1509 (British Library, Case 125 dd 22; D. E. RHODEs: 'Further notes on the Publisher Giacomo Mazzocchi', Papers of the British School at Rome, XL [1972], pp.239-42; R. MORTIMER: Harvard College Library ... Italian 16th Century Books, II [1974], p.435 with illustration of p. 1 inscribed 'Romae in domo de la Valle'; see also R. WEIss: The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity, Oxford [1969], p.158, and pl.13 illustrating p.2 with May and June). The twelve months of the calendar are shown two to a page, on pp.1 recto to 3 verso; the signs of the zodiac are reversed. (ii) A measured drawing of both sundial and calendar base showing the front and right side, but seen more from above than in Posthumus's view. Together with a detailed description in a letter signed by Andreas Coner and dated 1513, it was intended to serve as a model for a new replica to be made for Bernardo Rucellai's Orti Oricellari in Florence (T. ASHBY: 'Sixteenth-century Drawings of Roman Buildings attributed to Andreas Coner', Papers of the British School at Rome, II [1904], pls.47-48; pp.32-34). (iii) Ashby also notes among others, Antonio da Sangallo the Younger's draw- ings of two sides of the calendar, with the months January-April, and September-December, showing cracks and breakages, inscriptions, and reliefs of the zodiacal signs and pairs of Dioscuri above (Uffizi, 2108 A,a: 35 by 46 cm.; b: 35.5 by 47.5 cm). Further printed references to the calendar in the Renais- sance are in R. SCHOFIELD: 'Giovanni da Tolentino goes to Rome: A Description of the Antiquities of Rome in 1490', Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, XLIII [1980], pp.254-55, n.63; p.249, nn.20-21). Posthumus has emphasised the sundial and base in his painting by raising it on another base and by sharply lighting the front which shows the months May-August, and throwing the right side into deep shadow (Fig.6). He has placed it in a key position as the starting point for both tours of the precarious foreground, and descent to the middle ground (see Itinerary III). True to the motto tempus edax rerum, the bottom half of the calendar has been consumed, and only the inscriptions of the number of days and hours of daylight headed by the relevant zodiacal signs are visible on the front. Above it the sundial displays its multiple faces (s. L. GIBBS: Greek and Roman Sundials, New Haven and London [1976], p.390, no.7007). 2. Bearded herm. 3. Circular altar with relief of genii holding garlands. Cf.Dosio, album, Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale N.A.618, f.33 b (G. TEDESCHI GRISANTI: "'Dis manibus, pili, epitaffi ed altri cose antiche", un codice inedito di disegni di Giovannantonio Dosio', Bollettino d'Arte, XVIII [1983], p.92. Not yet identified, or illustrated). 4. Architectural fragment. 5. Large shallow marble basin with frontal lion's head relief in centre. 6. Fragment of gold(?) vase with acanthus decoration below, lacking pedestal. *7. A modified fragment of the 'Torlonia Vase', a marble crater with a relief of a Bacchic symposium. By 1536 it was already installed in the Cesi gardens where it was drawn as a fountain basin by Heemskerck I, fol.25f. For other drawings, see N. DACOS: Le Logge di Raffaello, Rome [1977], pp.235-36; P. P. BOBER and R. O. RUBINSTEIN: Renaissance Artists and Antique Sculpture, A Handbook of Sources, forthcoming, Cat.No.92. The vase is now in the Museo Torlonia, Rome (c. L. VISCONTI: I Monumenti del Museo Torlonia, Rome [1884-85], No.297). 8. Terracotta jar, overturned with mouth to plane. 9. Amphora, possibly silver, with acanthus frieze and handle, and bearded mask. 10. Broken slab. 11. Piece of a curved cornice with egg and dart moulding and floral frieze. It appears to have been gnawed by immense teeth. 12. Curved fragment of a carved moulding. 13. Chunky architectural fragment, possibly from a capital. 14. Fragment of large white marble tazza, upside down. Elegant 'rococo' pan- elling with delicately carved stylised plant tendrils framing a satyr mask along the top; handle broken off. 15. Stone tablet inscribed with lines from Ovid (Metamorphoses XV, 234-36): TEMPVS EDAX RE/RVM TVQUE INVI/DIOSA VETVSTAS/O(MN)IA DESTR VITIS ('Time devourer of things, and you envious age destroy all'). The quotation itself is part of a longer passage which continues: vitiataque dentibus aevil paulatim lenta consumitis omnia morte! ('and slowly gnawing with your teeth, you finally consume all things in lingering death!'). Guy Bauman informs me that the pentimenti in DESTRVITIS which came to light in the recent cleaning, is explained by the artist having first written COSVMITIS and then overpainted the CO with DE, and the VM with TRV.

Draped female torso with high belt, and roll of drapery falling across the body from the right hip. Drapery common to Muses and a type of Apollo Musagetes. 17. Strigillated sarcophagus with couple standing in the central panel. Although it lacks the lateral figures, Posthumus's sarcophagus could have been inspired by one known since the Middle Ages in the atrium of S.Saba, traditionally thought to have been the tomb of Vespasian and Titus (F. MATZ and F. VON DUHN: Antike Bildwerke in Rom, II, Leipzig [1881], No.3099), or another of this very common type of marriage sarcophagus. 18. Rim of a red marble crater? Possibly carved with masks. 19. Grey marble column, gnawed at one end (beyond the column on which the artist sits). 20. Colossal white marble column base. 21. The dark-bearded artist (Fig.7) wears a white turban, and the unexpected heat of the season and his exertions have caused him to push back his clothes, exposing bare arms and legs. With his dividers he records the proportions of the base, which he has drawn on the sheet of paper lying on a tablet precariously near the edge of the yawning abyss in the immediate foreground. Straddling the column beside him is a set square with a puzzling cylindrical object with a lid raised above it connected by a double cord. Professor B. A. R. Carter has offered an explanation of this mystery: he thinks it is not a plumb line or a magnetic lodestone in a brass or silver case, as has been suggested, but an inkpot, the lid of which can slide up in use and down when travelling, on the cords which are threaded through holes at the top of the inkpot and pass through the lid. This interpretation is supported by the quill pen in the artist's turban, and the drawing in ink on the ground. *22. Colossal marble head, known in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as the 'Juno Ludovisi' (Fig.3). It is identifiable by the small palmettes in the diadem, even though the hair lacks the characteristic crinkliness of the original. Posthumus would have seen it in the Cesi collection (HOLSEN, op.cit., at note 3 above, p.35, Cesi No.149). In 1622 it was acquired by the Ludovisi and is now in the Museo Nazionale Romano, inv.no.8631 (s. AURIGEMMA: Le Terme di Diocleziano e il Museo Nazionale Romano, 4th ed., Rome [1958], p.xxv, p.79, No. 190; w. HELBIG: Fiihrer durch die ofentlichen Sammlungen klassischer Altertiimer in Rom, 4th ed., III [1969], No.2341, as a portrait of the younger Antonia). Posthumus's seems to be the earliest representation of the head which Francisco de Hollanda, fol.26, drew three years later in the Cesi collection. BOBER and RUBINSTEIN, op.cit. under No.7 above, No.6, quote Goethe, who owned a cast of it: 'It is like a canto by Homer'. *23. Neo-Attic marble crater with a frieze showing three linked draped figures moving to the left, above a gadrooned bowl; lacks a pedestal. Posthumus appears to be the first artist to represent this crater, which, according to two other sixteenth-century drawings was both in the della Valle collection and in the Villa Giulia. Later it came into the Farnese collection and was much restored in 1796 before being sent to Naples, where it is now in the Museo Nazionale, Inv.No.6778. The drawing by Lambert Lombard in the Arenberg Album, Mus&amp;e de l'Art Wallon, Liege, notes the location as 'Al giardino del cardinal di la Vallo in Roma', and shows it at an angle revealing paired satyr-mask supports to the missing handles later restored as two voluted coils. G. DENHAENE (Lambert Lombard et l'Album Arenberg, Dissertation, Brussels, Universith Libre, 1983, Cat.No.136, p.14 and Fig.203a) thinks Lombard copied an earlier drawing with this inscrip- tion in the 1550s. Lombard himself had been in Italy in 1538 after which he returned to the Netherlands. This would explain why the second drawing, evidently made in the very early 1550s, noted that the crater was 'a la vigna di Julio papa nel giardino di sopra'. This drawing, in the Witt collection of the Courtauld Institute of Art, No.3358, shows all six figures of the crater as in a frieze, and the top is drawn separately without the bowl. It has been recently attributed to Battista Franco who left Rome for Venice in the early 1550s (M. VAN DER MEULEN: 'A "Rubens" Drawing Reattributed', in Essays in Northern European Art presented to Egbert Haverkamp-Begemann on his Sixtieth Birthday, Doorn- spijk [1983], pp.166-72). 24. Colossal female torso, draped, with high belt and thick roll of drapery sweeping around her left hip. For references to a number of statues of this Isis-Fortuna type which exist in various museums and collections, but without information on their early provenance, see R. CALZA et al.: Antichitt di Villa Doria Pamphilij, Rome [1977], No.61. A figure of this type was drawn by Heemskerck I, fol.34 vc: a 'Niobid' drawn in the Villa Madama on Monte Mario, later in the Farnese collection and now in Naples (Inv.No.6391; A. RUESCH: Guida illus- trata del Museo Nazionale di Napoli, Naples [1911], No.248; s. REINACH: Repertoire de la statuaire, Paris [1807] I, 316, 4; II, 418, 4). 25. Torso, turned to left, of a figure with draped haunches. Cf. a similarly draped torso, considered by HOLSEN and EGGER to be male, in the lower Gallo garden, drawn by Heemskerck I, fol.72 e, and p.40. *26. Square funerary altar (Fig.7) with barely legible inscription which is a distorted version of Posthumus's probable model, among the thousands of Roman inscriptions in the computerised index to CIL VI, the closest to his. Posthumus's inscription seems to read: [D] M/ FABI Q/ M FALIX F/ M B T. CIL VI, 17623 is on a lost funerary altar dedicated to the shades of an eleven- year-old girl: DIS MANIBUS/FABIA QUARTILLA/ C. FABI. FELICIS FILIA/V. A. XI. MES.V./FEC. BEN. MER. Posthumus could have read this insctiption in j. MAzzoccrl us: Epigrammata antiquae urbis, Rome [1521], p.xliii, recorded in the house on the Quirinal of the late-Quattrocento humanist, Pomponio Leto, whose famous Accademia Ro- mana Paul III had attended in his youth. The fasces on the left of Posthumus's altar could have been modelled on a woodcut of an ornamental group of fasces in Mazzocchius's book, p.cxxi. True to his theme, Posthumus allowed Time and Age to obscure the inscription. *27. Torso of a youth corresponding to a large male torso on the right in the Santa Croce store-room as drawn by Heemskerck (I, fols. 29v, 52v and 60v). I am grateful to Phyllis Bober for this observation. 28. Large marble head (Fig.7) with short beard and roll of hair framing the face. From a statue of a god, possibly Neptune? 29. Head of a young woman with loose hair. Cf. the Sleeping girl or Nymph, Rome, Museo Nazionale, inv.no. 1194 (AURIGEMMA, op.cit. under No.22 above, Pl.CIIb, p.164, No.492); drawn by Dosio probably in the 1560s (TEDESCHI GRISANTI, op.cit. under No.3 above, p.86, fol.1 le). 30. Colossal male head, a fragment of the top part with a helmet decorated with an acanthus scroll (Fig.4). Could it be a free variation of the very high relief of the Cesi 'Pyrrhus' in profile to the left drawn by Heemskerck I, ?f54, and by Francisco de Hollanda, fol.17v? It, can be seen in the right foreground of Hendrick van Cleef's view (1584) of the Cesi sculpture garden (VAN DER MEULEN, op.cit. at note 3 above, Fig.27; HiLSEN, op.cit. at note 3 above, p.34, No.145). It passed to the Villa Ludovisi (T. SCHREIBER: Die antiken Bildwerke der Villa Ludovisi in Rom, Leipzig [1880], pp.63-64, No.31), and is now in the Museo Nazionale Romano. 31. Ionic capital, right hand fragment. 32. Colossal marble right foot with simple non-military Hellenistic strap sandal fastened with an ivy leaf above the toe, a somewhat feminine touch suggesting that it was worn by Bacchus or one of his female votaries. Written on the base: Hermaijus Posthumus pinge(ba)t 1.5.3.6 (Fig.4). Heemskerck also signed a colossal foot with a different sandal in his Triumph of Silenus, c.1536 in Vienna, Inv.No.990 (R. GROSSHANS: Maerten van Heemskerck, Die Gemdlde, Berlin [1980], colour plate II, cat.no.24 as the Triumph of Bacchus; Grosshans illustrates other examples of colossal marble feet in Heemskerck's works). For examples of antique colossal feet, see C. A. PICON: 'Big Feet', Archd- ologischer Anzeiger, XCVIII [1983], pp.95-106. 33. Acanthus frieze, fragment. Many examples of this common type survived in the Renaissance. Cf. a frieze in the house of Andrea della Valle (BARTSCH XIV, 528). 34-40. Unidentified fragments. Itinerary I: A-F; paintings (described by N.Dacos; see Fig.3) A. Ornamental motifs in black on a yellow ground, with an eagle with out- spread wings; they might have been inspired by the Domus Aurea, although no precise comparison is possible. B. On the lower register, under a Greek key motifin yellow on black and a green band, a sacrificial scene. This kind of subject is never illustrated in the Domus Aurea, and seems rather to have been inspired by a relief. The red garland separates the victimarius and the animal he is preparing to slaughter from the draped figure. Below the garland the painter has incised, it would appear, in the varnish, a male sexual organ, perhaps in reference to the obscene inscriptions which sometimes appear among the graffiti in the Domus Aurea. C. A female figure clothed in white followed by a bearded satyr who hoists a nude man on to a mule. Behind, a bearded clothed Dionysus dressed in oriental fashion, holds what might be a patera. The painting once bore a two-word inscription of which the first word could be 'priapus' and the second '... bilis'. D. On the lower level can be glimpsed two grey panels, perhaps of brick, decorated with red and grey ornamental motifs. E. A dancing figure dressed in white. Behind, a man in profile leads two animals which could be panthers, attached to a chariot on which rides a figure clothed in a long robe, who could be Dionysus. The theme does not correspond to any painting of the Domus Aurea and could instead have been inspired by a sarcophagus. It should be noted, however, that a scene 429</page><page sequence="6">HERMANNUS POSTHUMUS of similar inspiration is represented in the Codex Wolfegg, fol.44v-fol.45r, with the inscription 'soto tera de stuco'. The exact location of the latter is unknown. F. Vault with lozenges alternately painted black with a basket of flowers and yellow with a satyr's head. The lozenges are edged with a red Greek key motif. Nothing similar appears at the Domus Aurea. Below, to the right of the two figures entering the grottoes, part of a panel with a figure on a yellow ground can be made out. Itinerary II (41-46). The more distant part of the same hill beyond the painted chasms can only be reached by returning to the della Valle Calendar (1) and proceeding along the further ridge to the right. *41. The 'Temple of Bacchus', as it was known in the Renaissance for its mosaics of 'spiritelli' harvesting a vineyard, was the fourth-century A.D. mausoleum of Constantia, daughter of Constantine the Great (d.354), and still stands well- preserved as S. Costanza, next to the basilica of Sant'Agnese outside the Porta Nomentana (P. A. FRUTAZ: II Complesso monumentale di Sant'Agnese, 2nd. ed., Vatican City [1969], pp.72-83). It was much drawn in the Renaissance and described in guidebooks and architectural treatises. A splendid comprehensive view of the interior was drawn by Francisco de Hollanda, f. 22. Posthumus dramatises his theme by showing only four bays of the inner ring (Fig. 10) which had twelve pairs of columns supporting the dome, which he has covered with huge octagonal coffers like those in the Basilica of Constantine, in place of its delicate mosaics. He has introduced on the soffits of the arches stucco panel reliefs like those in the Colosseum drawn in Heemskerck's Sketchbook II, f.58 (see also DACOs in this issue, p.437 and Fig.12, as by Posthumus). 42. Roman altar tilted towards ravine with framed tablet without an inscription. 43. Composite capital with curved abacus, cf.no.39, but seen from below. 44. Fragment of moulding. *45. Marble puteal half buried, and carved with relief of draped female figures in linked procession to the left (Fig.10). This is the famous puteal in the Cesi collection in the sixteenth century (HijLSEN: Antikengdrten, p.30, no.117) and is now in the Villa Albani Torlonia (HELBIG, op.cit., IV, 3226). It was drawn by Lambert Lombard (on the same sheet as our no.23, q.v.) and twice in Frans Floris's sketchbook in Basel (c. VAN DE VELDE: 'A Roman Sketchbook of Frans Floris', Master Drawings VII [1969], p.282, no.68; idem, Frans Floris (1519/20-1570). Leven en Werken, Brussels [1975], pp.353-54). Heemskerck II, f.37, shows the puteal in the Forum of Nerva, so it may not have yet been in the Cesi collection when Posthumus included it in his painting. All the other repre- sentations of it are later, such as the drawing of its six figures in the Codex Pighianus (c.1550), Berlin, Staatsbibliothek (o. JAHN: 'Ober die Zeichnungen antiker Monumente im Codex Pighianus', Jahresberichte der k. sdchsischen Gesell- schaft der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig, XX [1868], No.106). 46. Corner of a marble cornice. Itinerary 1I (47-55). From the della Valle calendar (1), a descent can be made into the valley beyond. 47. An imaginary funerary monument with a laureate portrait bust, a tomb, and trophaic and Egyptian decorative motifs (Fig.9). The general scheme, in its three-storied, three-bayed elevation, roughly sug- gests the Nymphaeum Aquae Giuliae on the Esquiline which was still the site of the 'Trophies of Marius' until they were removed to the Campidoglio in 1590. (G. TEDESCHI GRISANTI: I Trofei di Mario, Rome [1977], pl.XIV, showing clearly the three stories with arches in the Gamucci print; BOBER and RUBINSTEIN, op.cit., Cat. No.174). a. A freestanding anthropomorphic trophy, not too unlike one of the trophies of Marius. c. Sepulchral urn with domed lid on high base. *b,*d. Egyptian basalt lions. Since 1444 they were much drawn in front of the Pantheon,. Heemskerck I, f. 10, and Francisco de Hollanda, f. 16v provide con- temporary comparisons. In the late 16th century Sixtus V installed the lions in his fountain, the Acqua Felice on the Quirinal, and later Gregory XVI brought them to the Vatican where they are now in the Egyptian Museum (G. BOTTI and P. ROMANELLI: Le Sculture del Museo Gregoriano Egizio, Vatican City [1951], Nos.26-27; A. ROULLET: The Egyptian and Egyptianizing Monuments of Imperial Rome, Leiden [1972], Nos.273-4, Figs. 279-283). f. Bust of a laureate emperor? Perhaps suggested by the draped bust of 'Pyrrhus' dominating the Sassi courtyard from a high niche, as drawn by Heemskerck in a separate drawing in Berlin (KdZ 2783, HOLSEN and EGGER, op.cit. in preface to this Catalogue, II, pl.81). e,g. A pair of mummified Egyptian herms carved in relief on pillars. h. Pier carved with relief of hanging trophies, perhaps suggested by the trophaic pilaster reliefs of the Arch of the Argentarii. 48. Possibly a half buried city gate attached to a wall. 49. Egyptian obelisk broken in three and piled on the ground (see Figs. 2 and 3). Although it does not correspond exactly with any of the obelisks that could have been known to Posthumus, the one on the Campidoglio, drawn erect by Heemskerck, had been felled in 1535, and was later drawn lying in three segments on the Campidoglio where it remained supine until 1587 when it was brought to its present site at the Villa Celimontana. For the Capitoline obelisk, see J. BYAM SHAW: Drawings by Old Masters at Christ Church Oxford, Oxford [1976], I, Cat. No.41: Cronaca?; I, Fig.3: Naldini, 1560, drawing now in Vaduz, Stiftung Ratjen, showing the top lying on rough ground; C. D'ONOFRIO: Gli Obelischi di Roma, Rome [1965], pp.204-16, Fig.110: drawing by Giovanni Colonna da Tivoli, 1554, showing the obelisk lying in three sec- tions. For the history of other obelisks known in Rome in the sixteenth century, see also ROULLET, op.cit., pp.68-93, Nos.68-91. It is possible that this recently fallen obelisk is the one which inspired Post- humus's fragments. A piece of white paper with something written on it can be seen lying on the ground nearby. 50, 52. A pair of colossal marble river gods, the Nile and the Tiber dressed as the pair from Montecavallo, which were brought to the Campidoglio in 1517, but in the posture, and with the attributes of the pair in the Vatican Belvedere, which, however, are nude. For the Capitoline pair, drawn by Heemskerck (I, folios 45, 61; II, 72), see BOBER and RUBINSTEIN, op.cit., Cat. No.65 A and B; and for the Vatican pair (the Tiber is now in the Louvre) see H. H. BRUMMER: The Statue Court in the Vatican Belvedere, Stockholm [1970], pp.191-204 with docu- ments and drawings; F. HASKELL and N. PENNY: Taste and the Antique, New Haven and London [1981], Nos.65 and 69; BOBER and RUBINSTEIN, Nos.66 and 67. Posthumus has painted an artist who has scaled the shoulder of the Nile (50) to measure its right biceps with dividers, while another artist in front of the sphinx (51) draws the Tiber. The exaggerated contrast in scale between human beings and colossi is a point made by v. BUSH in her thesis on The Colossal Sculpture of the Cinquecento, New York and London [1976], pp.71-73. 51. An Egyptian male sphinx (see Fig.2) carved in a green stone and possibly based on the one that Francisco de Hollanda (f.26v) drew on the Capitoline, and is now in the Louvre (ROULLET, op.cit., No.285, Figs.298-304), although others of the type were known in Rome, such as the headless Savelli sphinx drawn in 1554 by Giovanni Colonna da Tivoli, Vat. Lat.7721, folios 9v,10; (M. E. MICHEL: 'Giovanni Colonna da Tivoli: 1554', Xenia, Quaderni 2 [1982], pp.28-29. ROULLET, op.cit., No.288, Figs. 308-9). See also the Sphinx drawn in Heemskerck II, f.26v (DACOs, Fig.13), drawn by Heemskerck (I, f.27) in Jacopo Gallo's garden. 53. An invenzione (See Fig. 15) surmounted by Jupiter seated on a celestial sphere supported by Atlas and Hercules on either side of a central block with a relief ofJupiter's eagle. An altar stands in the aedicula in the base. *a. Jupiter corresponds to Heemskerck I, f.24 of the Jupiter installed in the exedra of the Villa Madama, with its right arm broken off. Only the lower part of this marble statue with its throne survives in Naples, Museo Nazionale (BOBER and RUBINSTEIN, op.cit., No.1). b, c, d. Atlas and Hercules (identified by his lion skin) standing and support- ing a celestial sphere banded by the signs of the zodiac is also seen in an engraving by Aldegrever dated 1550 (BARTSCH VIII, p.392, No.91). e. The relief of an eagle, holding a thunderbolt, head to left and wings outspread, corresponds both to a description by Aldrovandi of a relief in the Casa Savelli (u. ALDROVANDI: Delle statue antiche che per tutta Roma in diversi luoghi, et case si veggono, in L. MAURO: Le Antichith della Citt&amp; di Roma, Venice [1556], p.233) and to a drawing of about 1550 in the Codex Coburgensis, f. 1 (F. MATZ in Monatsbericht der k.Preussischen Aka- demie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, Philos.-hist.Kl., [1871], p.468, No.41), (Fig.8). The drawing, however, includes a zodiac band which Post- humus omits, having.applied almost the same selection of signs to the globe above. In 1882 a relief in the Museo Torlonia, described by MATZ-DUHN, op.cit. at Cat. No.17, III, No.3540, was tentatively identified with Aldrovandi's description. f. An altar decorated with a garland, no inscription visible. 54. An elegant marble tazza with acanthus handles, gadroo:ned bowl, and narrow pedestal. Cf. a squatter version on a higher and more elaborate pedestal drawn, possibly by Posthumus, in the Heemskerck 'sketchbooks', II, 46 b. Unidentified by HiLSEN and EGGER. 55. Square base with inscription S. P. Q. R. and illegible inscription. 430</page><page sequence="7">IN- of -:X v ?i ~aii~i~3 , :iii-:N M Wi : "-i$"'"::' 'i: Z?53 6.

It includes a portico supported by caryatids, a Gothic arch, and, to the right, the incongruous bulwark of the Roman Castel' Sant' Angelo (57), origi- nally the tomb of Hadrian. This is a visual pun of topical interest, as Charles V's daughter, Margaret of Austria, had married Alessandro de' Medici in Naples on 29th February, 1536, and was soon to inherit this fortified village, then under Medici rule, and called Castelsantangelo (R. Lefevre, Ricerche su "Madama" Margarita d'Austria e l'Italia del '500, Castelmadama, 1980, ch. III). It lies on the left bank of the 'Anio' which can be seen cascading down under a bridge. The reference to the round Temple of the Sibyl (58) further confirms Tivoli (Tibur) as the inspiration of this surrealistic mountain landscape. A strange colossus (59) sits on a bridge, brooding over the waters; perhaps it is one of the Egyptian cynocephali (baboons) known in Rome. For examples known in the sixteenth century, see ROULLET, op.cit. at this Cat. No.47, pp. 125-8, Nos.245-249. A sculptured group on a large base (60) could be a 'restored' version of the famous 'talking statue' Pasquino, in fact, a fragment of Menelaus supporting the body of Patroclus, a group which existed in two other replicas known since 1570 and now in Florence (HASKELL and PENNY, op.cit. at this Cat. No.50, Cat. No.72; for Pasquino see also BOBER and RUBINSTEIN, op.Cit., No. 155). In Posthumus's day the figures were thought to represent Hercules overcoming Geryon (HASKELL and PENNY, p.292). A colossal marble statue of a Muse (Fig. 10) (61) wrapped in her drapery and leaning cross-legged on a cylindrical support in the pose of Polyhymnia, known in the Renaissance from Muse sarcophagi (for example, M. WEGNER: Die Mus- ensarkophage, Berlin [1966], No.128, pl.89; BOBER and RUBINSTEIN. op.cit., Cat. No.37). In the mid-sixteenth century a Muse in this pose was labelled Clio byJacopo Strada (Vienna, Nationalbibl. Cod. min. 21,2; I am grateful to DirkJanson for bringing these drawings, on which he is working, to my attention). It would seem suitable for the Muse of History to contemplate the mysterious distant city in which ancient and modern monuments can be seen. The Distant City (62-65) ... 'arcus, templa, trophea, theatra, amphitheatra, circi, naumachiae, porticus, columnae, sepulchra, epitaphia, eulogia, moles, aquaeductus, statuae, signa, tabulae, lapides, marmora' ... the monuments of Rome and its surroundings which Paul III appointed Latino Giovenale Manetti to conserve (MARINI, op.cit. at Cat. No.1, p.282) shimmer generically in the distance while the smaller of them, and the more collectable, loom in the foreground. To the list can be added obelisks (62) and pyramids (63). Modern architecture is also represented in this untopographical panorama. A structure similar to Bramante's exedra of the Vatican Belvedere (64), com- pleted by Baldassare Peruzzi in 1535-36, reminds Phyllis Bober of Aspertini's free drawing of it in his later sketchbook in the British Museum (BOBER, op.Cit. in preface to this Cat., Fig. 119, and pp.15 and 86). Finally a quattrocento palace (Fig.10) with a square crenellated tower (65) suggests the Palazzo S. Marco somewhat as it is seen in the 'Mantua view' of Rome in the Palazzo Ducale, Mantua, also painted in 1536 (Palazzo Venezia. Paolo II e lefabbriche di S.Marco, Exh. Cat., Rome, Palazzo Venezia [1980], p.93, No.51).</page><page sequence="10">41 W-w om: g I x. 1? al. ?JW a le. k:i 4i. L .q. e. 4K w to ....... .... . P3 11.
