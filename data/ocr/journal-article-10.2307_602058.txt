<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ways to Paradise: The Chinese Quest for Immortality. By MICHAEL LOEWE. Pp. xiii + 270. Boston: ALLEN &amp; UNWIN, INC. 1979. $34.00. In his most recent work, Michael Loewe examines three subjects central to Chinese art of the Han dynasty: the painting of about 168 B.C. found in tomb No. I at Ma-wang- tui, bronze mirrors with the TLV design, and representations of the Queen Mother of the West. The chapters devoted to these three subjects, which may be read as independent essays, are preceded by an introduction to the Han frame of mind and followed by a short chapter on the lunar hare and solar bird. Loewe concludes with six appendices on various aspects of the TLV mirrors, and a full bibliography. The subjects of art and iconography which Loewe studies are closely related to Han funerary practices and religious beliefs. Using texts of the Han and earlier periods for comparison and explication, Loewe puts the artistic images into the context of the development of Chinese ideas about the cosmos and immortality. Loewe has analyzed the relevant Chinese sources, and arranged his results in an organized and coherent structure. He also makes accessible to Western scholars the careful research of Japanese historians of religion as well as the recent discoveries and publications of Chinese archaeologists. He presents well-reasoned discussions of the major theories explaining elements of Han iconography, in light of the archaeological finds of the past decades. He uses a comparative and critical approach to his primary and secondary sources, many of which he gathers together here for the first time. As a compendium of past and recent scholarship on the subject in both Asia and the West, this book is enormously valuable. It is important as well for the cumulative picture Loewe constructs of the native Chinese beliefs about death and immortality, and about communica- tion between humans and the heavens. Loewe shows, through concrete examples, the high level of development and com- plexity of native religion in Han China before the advent of Buddhism. The Han intellectual world was not, as has often been supposed in the West, a spiritual vacuum into which Buddhism was drawn. The development of both Buddhism and Taoism in the centuries following the Han must be re- examined as we learn more of the early history of Chinese religious thought. Despite the contributions Loewe makes, his work contains flaws. First, there are not enough drawings and illustrations to make his points clear. A book in which central points of the argument depend on accurate communication of visual images requires adequate illustrations. Unfortunately, to be certain of understanding some of the images Loewe discusses, the reader will have to consult other sources. The book is also difficult to read without referring to its primary and secondary sources. Loewe takes material from so many places, and then presents it in such condensed form, that he does not always seem to have digested it. He does not make pnough generalizations to ease the reader through the mass of data. A more serious flaw is that Loewe relies too much on his secondary sources. In particular, he depends too much on a controversial article by Kominami Ichir6, which provides the basic conceptual framework for Chapter 4. Kominami's contention that the myths of the Herd Boy and the Weaver Girl and those concerning the Queen Mother of the West are related to each other and to a cyclic conception of universal order is a hypothesis rather than an established fact. Loewe should have presented a more balanced account. When he does generalize, Loewe runs into logical problems. One of his central points is that the focus of Chinese beliefs about immortality shifted from east to west from the Former to the Latter Han. There is no firm evidence to support this theory. The image of a paradise in the east continues with vigor into the Six Dynasties period, while the Queen Mother of the West was probably already an important religious figure in the early Han. It seems more likely that the notion of immortality was connected with complementary mythical</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 643 paradises in the east and the west throughout most of the Han. There was probably always a slight bias towards the west, the traditional direction of death and the afterlife. The fact that there may be no firmly identified depiction of the goddess in human form before the first century A.D. is not surprising, nor does it indicate that she attracted no cult-there are few anthropomorphic representations of any deities on mirrors or tomb reliefs until well into the Latter Han. The Queen Mother of the West may in fact appear earlier: a figure in the murals in the tomb of Pu Ch'ien-ch'iu (first century B.C.) may be the goddess or her servant. Furthermore, historical and literary sources of the pre-Ch'in and early Han, which Loewe cites, contain numerous references to the goddess. But these faults, some of which are unavoidable in such an ambitious work, do not prevent WaYs to Paradise from being an important contribution to the fields of Chinese religion and art history. With his command of the sources and his use of an interdisciplinary approach, Loewe provides a model for research into iconography and the history of religion which, with some slight adjustments, will serve future scholars well.
