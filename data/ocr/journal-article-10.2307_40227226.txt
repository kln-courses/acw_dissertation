Although one generally thinks of business and industry in connection with the word "management", this term is on the way to acquiring a wider meaning. One speaks of management of defence, hospitals, education, research, etc. Since the concept of management originally comes from business and industry, we wish to examine whether in taking over this concept to other fields, basically it remains the same, or whether, when applied to other fields like education, defence, etc., the concept of management has to be based on foundations which are very different from those of business management. Transfer of concepts from one field of study to another is quite a common feature of interdisciplinary development of knowledge in recent years. As Jantsch1 remarks this may be only cross-disciplinary, since the methods of natural sciences are imposed on other disciplines. The names of subjects like "Econometrics", "Sociometry", "Biophysics" bear witness to this "intermarrying" of concepts from different disciplines. The applica- tion of scientific methods and statistical techniques to social sciences2 which led to the development of behavioural sciences can also be considered as a transfer of the methods of natural sciences to social sciences. The epistomological significance of this "transfer" can only be understood if the foundations of two different branches of knowledge are analysed, and similarities as well as differences between the two are clearly brought out. For management such an analysis is of practical importance. Organizations for which the goals are not primarily economic require a philosophy of management basically dif- ferent from that of business management. This fact is often not well recognised, as is evidenced by the recent trend of considering education as a manufacturing industry. Goals, Organization and Management At the outset it is necessary to give a general definition of management* which would include management of business or industry as well as management of other organisa- tions like education, defence, or research. We define management as the means or meth- Mr. Anand S.

Darr, "A Reflective Analysis of Management Theory and Practice", Personnel Journal, Oct. 1969, p. 770. 1975/4-5 85</page><page sequence="2">ods used by an organisation to achieve its goals. While an organisation can have more than one goal, we assume that each organisation has one primary goal, and others are subsidiary in the sense that they support the primary goal. In fact we shall distinguish between organizations according to their primary goals. Business and industry are or- ganizations for which the goal is primarily economic. Defence and educational organi- zations are organizations for which the goals are not primarily economic. Needless to emphasise that we do not believe that all goals are in the ultimate analysis economic as some thinkers maintain. Transfer of Business Management Techniques Economics and Quantitative Methods While one accepts the basic classification of organizations into those having primarily an economic goal, and those a goal other than economic, it does not mean that organi- zations with primarily a non-economic goal have nothing to learn from management of business and industry. First of all even an organization which has primarily a non- economic goal must take care that it has sufficient resources and funds to realise its primary objective. "Economic sufficiency" has to be one of its subsidiary goals; in such a case, "Economic sufficiency" has to be judged in relation to the primary objective of the organization. This is no problem as long as the primary objective is clear. It should be emphasised, however, that economic sufficiency is conceptually different from "profit maximisation under constraints". In the latter case "constraints" are either physical or those of the market situation. In the former "the restraints on profit" come deliberately from within - the spirit and the objective of the organisation. Thus economic theory and general techniques of finance and accounting are useful for the management of organizations with non-economic primary goals in so far as they are aids to achieve the goal of "Economic sufficiency". Mathematical tools like operations research and statistical techniques can also be used for this purpose as well as to solve other non-economic problems of the organizations, where sufficient care is taken to spell out these problems precisely. Non-economic prob- lems are generally not quantifiable, but this should not present any difficulty as long as the problem can be precisely structured. Modern mathematics deals with abstract structures. Thus even computers can be used for information analysis, selection and analysis of structure of languages. Computers are already used to help medical diagnosis as well as to predict election results. Thus mathematical tools and computer systems can be used effectively for the management of organizations with non-economic primary goals, provided one bears in mind their limitations. In fact mathematics considered as a study of abstract structures and computers as instruments for analysis of information are applicable wherever such structures and information exist. Behaviour Sciences In business management one has come to realise that economics, finance and accounting, and mathematical tools are not sufficient to ensure success. A very important factor is the behaviour and motivation of the people working in an organization. No organiza- tion can achieve its objective unless it can "manage" its people. The importance of sub- jects like Anthropology, Sociology, and Psychology is recognised in business manage- ment. However, it is assumed that in order to apply the theories of these subjects to business management, it is necessary to get rid of the speculative and "value-biased" theories of these subjects and develop theories which are scientific and based on empir- 86 1975/4-5</page><page sequence="3">ical observations. The development of behavioural sciences and its impact on business management reveal this scientific endeavour. It is necessary to understand in what way scientific understanding of human behaviour is different from philosophical understand- ing of human nature. We have to understand why only scientific study of human behav- iour is considered to be important for business management. The basic difference between a scientific theory and a speculative theory is that while the former deals with generalisation based on observations and inductive logic, the latter deals with ideas or values which need not be derived by repeated observations and in- ductive logic. It follows that the objects corresponding to these ideas need not be as precisely measurable as scientific method would demand. Thus Kant's concept of "cate- gorical imperative* belongs to philosophy. There is no way of verifying scientifically whether there is a conscience in the heart of every human being, telling him what he should or should not do. "Mind"4 cannot be the object of scientific investigation. How- ever, even in such a pragmatic field of marketing management a well known scholar, Philip Kotler5 raises the question of conscience. In order to judge how far the scientific study of human behaviour is relevant for the management of organizations with non-economic primary goals, we shall briefly review the effects of the application of these techniques in the field of business management. Empirical studies of consumer behaviour, the motivation of the consumers to buy a particular product, and the effect of advertising on the consumers give important clues to the management to design a market strategy. Similarly theories of organization be- haviour based on empirical studies help in better management of personnel and in solv- ing problems of industrial relations. Behavioural sciences are thus successfully assisting business and industry to achieve their primary objective - the maximisation of profits. Behavioural sciences just provide techniques to the management of business and industry to achieve their goal which is primarily economic. Being only a scientific study of human behaviour the behavioural sciences eschew all questions of values, i. e. they do not say anything about the norms of human behaviour, about the goals and aims of human existence. They only tell us that under certain circumstances a group of people behave in a particular way when they are subjected to certain stimuli. Generally this is not a deterministic law but is interpreted in the light of the mathematical theory of probabil- ity. The understanding of human nature as a living being with the capabilities to or- ganize information can be conceptually reduced to biology, cybernetics and information theory. This gives almost unlimited power to control and influence human beings. We all know how business and industry control and influence the people by pictures and messages communicated through different media. There is a danger that if the primary objective of business and industry be considered as profit maximisation unbiased by any "value judgement*8, then this "control" and "influence" can go too far. Pointing out some of these dangers which result from unrestrained use of techniques of marketing, Philip Kotler7 refers to the cultural pollution and excessive materialism in USA. Even business and industry cannot ignore the revolt of the younger generation, parti- cularly of the Hippies, against the loss of human values under the pressure of excessive materialism. If a way is sought out of the sociological problems of today, like student 4 Blair J. Kolasa, Introduction to Behavioral Science for Business, New York, John Wiley, 1969, p. 13. 5 Philip Kotler, Marketing Management, 2nd ed. New Delhi, Prentice-Hall of India, 1972, p. 803. 6 Gail M.

The dangers of these reductionist con- cepts in the study of social sciences are exposed by Churchman and Jantsch. Churchman remarks, "perhaps one of the most ridiculous manifestations of the disciplines of modern science has been the creation of the so-called "social sciences"8, "which pursue the mech- anistic ideal of 'objective' empiricism as the physical science disciplines"9. Commenting on the domination of scientific methods and economics on other disciplines Jantsch writes "one of the most conspicuous attempt of cross-disciplinary polarization is the reformulation of management, planning and organization - even explicitly the plan- ning of change ... - in terms of the empirical and reductionist concepts of the applied behavioural sciences. Other cross-disciplinary attempts to dominate a level of educa- tion/innovation system by imposing narrow disciplinary concepts, starts from economics. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), for example, has applied purely economic criteria and linear methods (econometrics) to education and to scientific research and development and is setting out to do the same to environmental problems and aspects of social and technological systems . . . The belief of economists in the supremacy of their thinking and the ease with which their absolute claim is accepted today, constitute one of the main obstacles to a systems approach to education . . ."10 Non-Economic Goals: Organization and Management If a wider and deeper understanding of human nature and behaviour with a recognition of the "anthropomorphic" values is necessary even for business and industry, how much more essential it is for organizations with non-economic primary goals, which can only be understood in terms of purpose and values! Nation Let us consider a nation as an organization. Managing a nation would mean using dif- ferent methods to lead the nation towards its primary goal. Although the development of a stable economy is one of the goals of a nation, it is doubtful whether it can be the primary goal. Cultural and intellectual development could be considered as an equally important goal for a nation. As a nation develops in different directions, one could say that the primary objective of a nation is a harmonious development of its cultural and intellectual life with economic and technological progress. This idea of harmony which is conceivable only if an integral view of the development of a nation is taken, can be practically realised only if the "managers of the nation" have a deep understanding of the spirit, tradition, and culture of the nation. Such an understanding does not come from the study of the behavioural sciences which consider the understanding of human behaviour to be on the same level as the understanding of natural sciences, without ever questioning the validity of such an assumption. That understanding of human behaviour is basically different from understanding of phenomena of natural sciences has been clearly shown by Duncan. As he explains, understanding human behaviour requires "cognition from within", whereas phenomena of natural sciences need only observation from outside11. It is necessary for the "managers of the nation*' to study literature, art, 8 C. W. Churchman, Challenge to Reason, New York, McGraw-Hill, 1968, p. 85. 9 Op. cit. (1). p. 20. 10 Op. cit.

Defence This wider understanding of management is equally true in the case of defence manage- ment. The goal of the defence organization of a country is to defend the country against foreign aggression. History has shown again and again that besides sophisticated weap- ons and military strategy, the determination, integrity and high morale of the armed forces play a decisive role in achieving the final objective. The "managers of defence" should know how to instil these qualities in the armed forces, and this is only possible if they understand how the nation lives in every individual and how the individuals are integrally related with the purpose and values of the nation. History gives numerous examples how generals have led their armies to victory mainly because they could inspire them. Education Planning of higher education has been receiving serious attention all over the world12. Whereas in the case of defence, the primary goal is quite clear perhaps it is not usually understood what should be the purpose and ultimate aims of higher education. It is perhaps true to say that most students opt for higher education because it gives them the opportunity of higher earnings. In that case, one thinks that the aim of higher edu- cation should be to impart professional training, so that even universities should only be training grounds for the "future jobs" of the students. Industries require more and more people with specialised training in particular subjects which only universities can give. From this point of view the role of universities becomes subservient to that of business and industry, and higher education becomes just a tool for the primary objective of economic development. This is, however, a onesided view of the aims of education. It is doubtful whether the aim of higher education is only to enable the students to get higher earnings. Even the Vice Chancellor, University of Lancaster, England, Mr. Carter, wonders whether one of the goal of education should not be "to make the community, or the world, better in a sense not wholly economic - by improving the quality of life and by advancing culture"?13 In fact the ultimate goal of education should be learning and creativity which go beyond the satisfaction of an individual's physical and economic needs. It is through this process that an individual learns to transcend his ego and live and work for others. Gross expresses it clearly "True self -development involves an en- largement or broadening of the ego, an extension of the self so that it covers much more than self, a fusion or integration between the ego and others . . . The struggle for sur- vival may wreck others. The pursuit of commergence and differentiation may prevent others from attaining similar ends. The pursuit of self-development in the sense of learn- ing, creativity and love has none of these indirect results"14. It is clear that if the goal of education is to impart technical knowledge for jobs as well as a wider knowledge relating to purpose and values of human existence, then what the centres for higher education should teach as professional skills and how they should be related to the wider cultural goals of education is the central problem for management of education. Where- as quantitative and financial models may help to solve the technical problems of man- 12 Clark Kerr, "Foreword", Higher Education, Vol. 1, No. 1, February 1972, pp. 1-2. 13 Charles F.

Education must harmonise the "quality of life* with the "standard of living". The General Theory and its Relevance to India The development of a nation towards a harmony of scientific and technological progress and cultural life is only possible, if those who frame the policies of the nation are in- spired by the integral vision of man where ethics is not divorced from economics. The importance of ethical values is not only felt in the industrially advanced countries, but their importance for the harmonious development of the developing countries can- not be overemphasized. Most of these countries have got political freedom from colonial rule during the last twenty to thirty years. After the transfer of power the impoverished masses of these countries expected that their own rulers would put an end to the exploi- tation imposed by the colonial rule, and design a new order directed towards the uplift of the masses consonant with their culture and tradition. In order to realise the primary goal of national development after India's independence, the first task was to bring about the necessary social changes which would prevent the exploitation of the masses by a few. In trying to take measures to accelerate such social changes, the leaders of the newly Independent India were vehemently opposed by the business community15. The leaders had then to decide whether they were prepared to make sacrifices to bring about a radical change in the social structure. In fact, before independence the same leaders willingly suffered many hardships and made sacrifices to achieve the goal of independence. Nehru himself emphasised that he would never yield to unjust opposing forces to bring about the radical change: "... revolutionary changes cannot be brought about by reformist tactics and methods. The reformer who is afraid of radical change or of overthrowing an oppressive regime and seeks merely to eliminate some of its abuses becomes in reality one of its defenders."16 However, Nehru found it very difficult to stick to this line of action after independence. The non-co- operation of the business community who tried to sabotage the social reforms led to a serious economic crisis. Nehru had only two alternatives to overcome this, either to yield to the vested interests or to crush them mercilessly. Ultimately he decided to protect the vested interests, because he lacked courage and could not take upon himself the responsibility of inflicting "distruction and injury" which a ruthless elimination of the power of the business community would involve. He himself confessed before the Constituent Assembly in April 1948: "After all that has happened in the course of the last seven or eight months, one has to be very careful of the steps one takes so as not to injure the existing structure too much. There has been destruction and injury enough, and certainly I confess to this House that I am not brave and gallant enough to go about destroying any more."17 After independence, the leaders have always taken a "soft" attitude whenever their attempts to implement the social re- forms were opposed by the "upper strata", thus postponing social and economic revolu- tion without which no national development is possible18. 15 M. Bredier, Nehru a Political Biography, London, Oxford University Press, 1959, p. 509. 16 Ibid., p. 511. 17 G. Myrdal, Asian Drama, Vol. 1, New York, The Twentieth Century Fund, 1968, p. 275. 18 Ibid., pp. 277-278. 90 1975/4-5</page><page sequence="7">The failures of the leaders - "managers of the nation"19 - to banish poverty has been consistantly due to their failure to practice what they preach. Since the leaders them- selves made a farce of all ethical values by their hypocrisy, corruption and dishonesty spread far and wide. The leaders were more motivated by their personal ambitions than by the urge for national development. The Government policies were made to safeguard the interests of the "upper strata". That which has suffered most due to such policies is education which is the foundation of any kind of development. Not only were the cul- tural and traditional values disregarded in the educational policy, there was no proper planning with the perspective of uplift of toiling masses which has been one of the primary objective of national development. Since basic ethical values are indispensable for national development, and theories of "management of people" of present business management techniques rely heavily on behavioural sciences20 (which eschew all questions of values), the „ managers of the na- tion" in India should understand the restricted scope of behavioural sciences and the prime importance of values in the management of a nation. Conclusion We thus see that in the general theory of organization and management it h necessary to distinguish organizations according to their primary goals. We have defined manage- ment as the means employed to achieve the main objective of the organization. We have shown that if the goals are different, then these means must also be different except for technical problems analysed in terms of mathematical models and computer systems. Whereas the primary objective of business and industry can be expressed in purely economic terms, the primary objective of a nation, or of educational and research organ- izations can only be understood in the wider context of tradition and culture and ethical values. This wider context cannot be disregarded even by the organizations for which the goal is primarily economic, because economic development cannot be considered without having a perspective of the entire environment - a realization which is dawn- ing on many thinkers in the western world. We have shown that for a developing coun- try like India, economic development in terms of the nation as a whole has not taken place, primarily because ethical values did not figure anywhere near the horizon of India's national planning. 19 This idea of harmony whidi is conceivable only if an integral view of the development of a nation is taken, can be practically realised only if the "managers of the nation" have a deep understanding of the spirit, tradition, and culture of the nation. 20 Being only a scientific study of human behaviour the behavioural sciences eschew all ques- tions of values, i. e. they do not say anything about the norms of human behaviour, about the goals and aims of human existence. 1975/4-5 91</page></plain_text>
