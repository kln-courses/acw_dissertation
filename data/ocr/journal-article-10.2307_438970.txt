That Milton should now so consistently be associated with scientifi- cally retrograde attitudes thus seems to reflect our own rather than his distance from the seventeenth-century origins of modern science. For we too easily forget that during this formative period, no "advance- ment of learning," scientific or otherwise, could yet be conceived as succeeding apart from the requisite disclaimers about the folly of seeking superhuman knowledge and the proper assurances of humil- ity before heights of Divine Wisdom that we find in the epigraphs above.2 To reassess Milton's place in the scientific revolution therefore also means reassessing our own, for in contrast to the fairly "intoxicated" attitudes toward progress that accompany the technological and cos- mological breakthroughs of the twentieth century, in the past both the scientific specialist and the general public regarded an honest skepticism as the best policy toward the unknown, and perhaps un- knowable, secrets of divine Providence. Further, despite what we seem to "know" about the early modern period, no fully secular outlook exists among any of its scientific pioneers. Even those who, like Fran- cis Bacon, Galileo, and Thomas Hobbes, wished to separate questions of natural philosophy from religion remained fully confident that nature's answers would ultimately vindicate the basic if partially ob- scured truths of scripture, and Isaac Newton, the greatest scientist of the age, fused his inquiries into the secrets of nature and scripture more closely than all the rest. Later, similar fusions of providential with natural law, whether Deist or more orthodoxly Christian, were not undermined but strengthened by Newton's success in discovering the physical laws of gravity, a force that he himself considered divine.3 Milton's associations with all of these pioneers-even Hobbes, with whom he shares similar positions on materialism and mortalism, and from whom he differs primarily in his far more providential concept of natural law-is severed only in the late nineteenth and early twen- tieth centuries, by two consecutive developments in biology and as- 2. Milton can also be linked to the Boyle Circle and John Pell, a prominent mathe- matician and disseminator of early English atomism. See A.

This strategy was not only far safer than targeting the Holy Bible itself but seems to have lent psychological force, in the famous early twentieth-century Milton controversy, to the faction that considered his epic obsolete. Although the controversy itself has long since been settled, in its after- math the tendency to regard Milton's thought as a quaint museum piece, or a missing link cast off from the "great chain" of vital Western ideas, still remains.5 This idea of a single, unilinear great tradition has been too often and too decisively debunked to need refutation here, but it bears men- tioning as a lingering influence on the second and most telling charge against the vitality of Milton's science: his epic cosmology stands on the wrong side of the great scientific revolution initiated by Coperni- cus, furthered by Galileo, and completed by Newton.6 Refuting this by now routine claim is considerably complicated by the fact that no sin- gle figure, development, or concept can accurately be said to define this revolutionary "moment," which matured slowly and irregularly under the influence of a series of natural philosophers who adhered to no uniform set of theories: not heliocentrism, nor materialism, nor 4.

Ironically, Stanley Fish's Surprised by Sin: The Reader in "Paradise Lost" (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967) helped to resolve the Milton controversy only by reinforcing older ideas about the epic, namely, that it upheld exclusively theological and ethical as opposed to empirical values. For a telling critique of this approach, see Karen Edwards, Milton and the Natural World: Science and Poetry in "Paradise Lost" (Cam- bridge University Press, 1999), pp. 15-39, esp. pp. 31-33 (my review of Edwards's book appears in this issue, pp. 299-303). 6. Fallon specifically refutes the main tenets of Lovejoy's Great Chain of Being. In The Matter of Revolution: Science, Poetry, and Politics in the Age of Milton (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1996), John Rogers complements Fallon's study by showing that Mil- ton's vitalism places him in the forefront of contemporary natural philosophy. Finally, in Contemplation of Created Things: Science in "Paradise Lost" (University of Toronto Press, 1992), Harinder Singh Marjara takes issue with Svendsen's assessment of Milton's "me- dieval" science by showing that it rests upon an untenably linear view of scientific progress, while Edwards argues that Milton only employs "backward" biological "lore" for satiric purposes. None of the studies above discusses Milton's cosmology or episte- mology in relation to contemporary debates over the Ptolemaic/Aristotelian world- view, although all assume his divergence from Aristotelian traditionalism.</page><page sequence="4">234 MODERN PHILOLOGY empirical inductivism, all of which have proved unsuitable candidates for that honor. Yet if leading historians of science are clearly right in refusing to identify the birth of modern science with a single theory or outlook like Copernicanism, the popular tendency to associate a critical phase of its development with the ascendancy of heliocentrism is at least partially valid, even though the theory remained contro- versial throughout most of the seventeenth century and was never accepted by such important champions of the new philosophy as Bacon.7 For despite his undoubted contribution to the climate that culminated in Newtonian mechanics, Bacon remained skeptical about the Copernican hypothesis, in part because he lacked both Newton's mathematical skill and his confidence in mathematics as a means of scientific proof. Yet in this respect at least, Bacon's background and bi- ases reflect those of the educated public in general. The first Cam- bridge professor of mathematics, Isaac Barrow, was not installed until 1663, and when he was, he significantly defended his new position by arguing that a prominent advantage of his discipline lay in preparing the mind for the logic of Aristotle.8 However, beyond mere Aristotelian or religious traditionalism, a much overlooked factor in the slow acceptance of heliocentrism was the fact that it did not at first seem to offer the irrefutable mathe- matical and astronomical advantages that it can be seen to have in retrospect. It was not able to abolish epicycles or eccentrics and, in abolishing Ptolemy's equants, it not only had to add some new ones but actually complicated the calculation of the orbit of Mars. After Johannes Kepler's theory of elliptical orbits (a theory ignored even by Galileo) solved some of the problems that Copernicus's circular orbits could not, many of these objections began to disappear, but 7. According to the seminal historian of science William Whewell, "if we must select some one philosopher as the hero of the revolution in scientific method, beyond all doubt Francis Bacon must occupy that place of honor." See his Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences Founded upon Their History, 2d ed., 2 vols. (London, 1857), 2:230.

For Kepler's influential patron, Tycho Brahe, had incor- porated their shared astronomical data into another mathematically workable, geocentric alternative, a system in which all the planets but the earth revolve about the sun. Since no theoretical, let alone empir- ical, confirmation of heliocentrism was available until Newton pub- lished his Principia Mathematica in 1687, thirteen years after Milton's death, the responsibility for the low repute of the poet's "mixed" cos- mography must be partly attributed to the lingering influence of "vul- gar triumphalism," the long discredited, linear model of scientific progress that overlooks not only interim alternatives like Brahe's but also the residual traces of medieval and occult ideas in all seventeenth- century cosmologies, including Newton's own.9 Nevertheless, there is no denying that long before Newton, a sharp epistemological divide already existed between traditionalists, who clung to the theory and methods of Aristotle, and empiricists like Bacon, who stressed the superiority of observation and induction over the deductive logic of the schools. Yet, ironically, there is even less room for denying Milton's early and late adherence to the Baco- nian faction; he not only played a leading part in it but often adopted positions which, in retrospect, appear more advanced than Bacon's own. His Second Defence (1654) proudly records his postgraduate pur- suit of advanced mathematics, including (as his nephew, Edward Phil- lips, informs us) practical applications characteristically slighted by Bacon.10 Putting into effect the model outlined in Of Education (1644), he required that his gentlemanly students practice the "instrumentall science of Trigonometry, and from thence [go] to Fortification, Architec- ture, Enginry, or navigation" (CPW, 2:392), which, unlike the Lord Chancellor, he would not consign to "mere" craftsmen.

Westman provides a convenient summary of the limitations of Coperni- can theory listed above in "Proof, poetics, and patronage: Copernicus's preface to De revolutionibus," in Lindberg and Westman, eds., pp. 169-70. In the same place, Westman traces "Vulgar Triumphalism" to the highly polemical, anticlerical, and simplistic his- tories of science of Voltaire and Condorcet, whose views unfortunately continue to resurface in "science textbooks, newspaper editorials, and a few undergraduate exami- nations."

From that perspective, Of Education does not actually offer a radical program of reform, although as Charles Webster points out, it did provide a sem- inal "compromise between the new and old pedagogies." For that rea- son alone, the treatise was carefully read and appreciatively received by the more radical Comenian reformers, all of whom shared Milton's fundamental conviction that traditional scholastic methods "stopped and hindered all true and generous philosophy from entering" the universities (CPW, 1:854).12 And as Harris Fletcher pointed out, Mil- ton's humanistic reading program needs to be placed in the context of the well-nigh universal "assumption that the use of all kinds of sub- ject matter for praxis in [classical] language study was fundamental" to early education at a time when even advanced geometry was still largely considered a branch of logic. However, even Fletcher believed that Milton's use of Geminus's clas- sical work on elementary astronomy (first century B.C.E. but available in a contemporary Greek/Latin format) and Sacro Bosco's thirteenth- century Latin text On the Sphere (Venice, 1574) lent an "essentially medieval ... and ... Ptolemaic" character to the astronomical branch of his pedagogy. But this assessment overlooks the fact that Christo- pher Clavius, one of Galileo's earliest supporters, himself wrote a com- mentary on Sacro Bosco, and that Geminus of Rhodes himself did not actually exclude the heliocentric hypothesis. 13 Instead, he admitted that the geocentric model merely expressed Ptolemy's preference for certain "suppositions" with which the "celestial appearances can be made to agree." As a result, "the astronomer must therefore maintain 11. On Barrow, see Gascoigne, p. 225. 12.

Fletcher also intriguingly suggests that Milton's lingering humanism may be a response to "the unfor- tunate vogue of teaching several vernaculars from Latin, all at the same time," derived from Comenius'sJanua (1:330).

This is the reason for Heraclides Ponticus's contention that one can save the apparent irregularity of the sun by assuming that the sun stays fixed and that the earth moves in a certain way. [But] the knowledge of what is by nature at rest and what properties the things that move have is quite beyond the purview of the astronomer."14 Of course, this astronomical "agnosticism" was a commonplace generally used not only to elevate Aristotle's qualitative method over any exact quantitative method but also, as Geminus clearly indicates, to separate mathematical astronomy from the "real world" studies of physics and practical geometry, fields which Galileo would revolutionarily reunite. Here Geminus's practice very closely imitates his theory, for another central feature of Aristotelian science was its absolute separation of the sublunar and supralunar spheres, the latter of which supposedly obeyed mathematically perfect laws inapplicable on earth. When Gali- leo argued for the reality of the Copernican system (an approach that the literary editor of De revolutionibus [1543], Andreas Osiander, had initially discouraged in a cautious preface unauthorized by Coperni- cus), Galileo was thus doing far more than making the sun the center of the solar system. He was radically proposing not only that human understanding could penetrate higher realities but also that it could do so only by applying earthly geometry to the heavens-thereby end- ing the artificial segregation of mathematical physics and astronomy that had persisted since antiquity. 15 Milton consistently announces his commitment to a Baconian/ Galilean reformation of modern learning not just through his philo- sophical monism but also through his incessant attacks upon the "monkish and miserable sophistry" of the schoolmen (CPW, 1:854), an anti-Aristotelian agenda begun early and continued in late treatises like The Likeliest Means to Remove Hirelings out of the Church (1659) and the posthumous De doctrina Christiana (1825). The former of these (pub- lished not long before Milton began composing Paradise Lost) deplores all "schoole terms and metaphysical notions," "syllogisms," and other "scholastical trash," again ascribing them to "the idle sophistrie of monks, the canker of religion" (CPW, 7:304, 317). And both works draw 14. Cited in Pierre Duhem, To Save the Phenomena, trans. Edmund Doland and Cha- ninah Maschler (University of Chicago Press, 1969), p. 11. 15. William R.

After savagely parodying the Aristotelian system of essences and qualities in his "Vacation Exercise" and sixth Pro- lusion (1628), Milton culminates his attack in the seventh and (accord- ing to its modern editor) the "finest of the Prolusions" (1632), a "praise of knowledge" and of natural history modeled on Milton's careful read- ing of Bacon's 1605 Advancement of Learning (CPW 1:287). Given this general background-and given that Galileo or his telescope is approv- ingly cited on five separate occasions in Milton's epic (the only con- temporary reference to appear there at all)-the central objection to finding the influence of the new empiricism in the epic itself thus cen- ters on Raphael's discussion of the alternate schemes of the universe. For superficially, its conclusions might seem closer to Geminus's ironic denial of our capacity for ultimate truth than to the new astronomers' revolutionary attempts to penetrate the heavens. 16 Solicit not thy thoughts with matters hid, Leave them to God above, him serve and fear; ... Heav'n is for thee too high To know what passes there; be lowly wise: Think only what concerns thee and thy being; Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there Live, in what state, condition or degree, Contented that thus far hath been reveal'd Not of Earth only but of highest Heav'n. (8.167-68, 172-78).17 If to a modern ear this advice sounds stringently anti-empirical, we must recall that to a seventeenth-century reader, it would come across 16. Raphael's view can be instructively compared to the preface that Snecanus added to Georg von Peurbach's Theoricae novae planetorum (Bologne, 1591), which re- marks that "in order to satisfy the experience [of the senses], the Astronomers are obliged to assign so monstrous a form to the celestial spheres, that if they speak truly, it would be impossible to think of anything more deformed than Heaven.... And none- theless, reason refuses to admit that such a deformity could be attributed to the very noble celestial bodies .... One can therefore learn from Astronomy that the blindness of human intelligence is so great that it is not even capable of reconciling diverse sense experiences." Unpaginated preface cited in Fernand Hallyn, The Poetic Structure of the World: Copernicus and Kepler, trans. Donald M. Leslie (New York: Zone, 1990), p. 299, n. 40. But unlike Peurbach, Raphael does not regard human intelligence as blind, in- stead insisting that it becomes even less so when it concerns itself with matters natu- rally near at hand. This conclusion closely echoes the First Day of Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. 17.

Moreover, taken in context, Raphael's advice is actually far closer to the typical stance of the virtuosi-"that the learned praises of one who has studied the Almighty's works are more acceptable to God than the blind wonder of the ignorant"-than to that of true anti-empiricists or detractors of the Royal Society like Henry Stubbe.18 Not only does Raphael endorse the appropriateness of a naturally "unspeakable desire to see, and know / All these his won- drous works" (3.662-63), but he also teaches (as Adam acknowl- edges) that it will ultimately be gratified so long as he retains a proper "Baconian" attitude toward its gradual attainment: "Well hast thou taught the way that might direct / Our knowledge, and the scale of nature set / From centre to circumference, whereon / In contempla- tion of created things / By steps we may ascend to God" (5.508-12).19 Rather than forbidding knowledge, as Adam clearly understands, Raphael has been encouraging a protoscientific attitude concerning the gradual, cumulative nature of the empirical enterprise, in con- trast to the instantaneous, mystical penetration of divine secrets that Satan will sophistically offer Eve. That kind of pseudoknowledge rep- resents the mere "dreams" of other worlds that Paradise Regained (1671) associates with the "fabling... and smooth conceits" (4.295) of Platonic myths like the Timaeus, and that Raphael implicitly associ- ates with a scholastic hierarchy of material, efficient, formal, and final causes.20 In effect, then, both Raphael's organic depiction of a monistic "one first matter all" (5.472) and his distinction between the Creator's 18.

Westfall, Science and Religion in Seventeenth-Century England (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1958), p. 24; on the conventional pieties, see Howard Schultz, Milton and Forbidden Knowledge (New York: Modern Language Association, 1955). 19. The fact that Satan speaks the first quoted lines (3.662-63) does not logically in- validate the attitude that he assumes here, which is used to gain Uriel's approval and as- sistance in his exploratory journey. Milton's own approval of this unfeigned attitude is signaled by his attributing it to the unfallen Adam and Eve, who spontaneously praise the "translucence" of a God-in-nature "dimly seen / In these thy lowest works, yet these declare / Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine" (5.157-59). 20. This fabler can be clearly identified with Plato as "next" to Socrates, the philoso- pher who said "he nothing knew" in the previous line. The Platonic myth Milton had in mind is less clear, but the Timaeus is proposed here both because it explicitly announces itself as a myth and because Bacon's Descriptio Globi Intellectualis (considered below) ex- hibits a similar scorn for the "immaterial heavens and spaces" by which the Platonists, "not without superstition, arrogance, and some disorder of mind," attempt to give "their philosophy a diviner character."

Baconians tended to caricature this some- what circular method as (in Michael Hunter's formulation) an "a priori 'notional' way of reasoning.., associated with scholasticism," which not only "attached little significance to accurate observations and experiment" but tended to "idolize" Aristotle's achievement by deny- ing "the possibility of any improvement of ... [his] synthesis."22 Thus, like other contemporary Baconians, Milton clearly understands that the pursuit of empirically useful knowledge had far more to do with demolishing the Aristotelian dependence on abstract, preestablished classifications than with simply replacing their cosmology. Neverthe- less, Hallyn is typical in according Milton no place in this movement except to remark in passing that he was "one of the promoters of the cosmological revolution" who found the "geocentric universe, scientifically unacceptable as it had become, . . . more satisfactory in terms of imaginative associations, identifications, and correspon- dences." The latter part of Hallyn's assessment (which he derives from Milton's recent commentators) is actually true only in an extremely limited sense. Like Copernicus's and Kepler's astronomy, Milton's cos- mos remains earth-centered but not actually Ptolemaic, in that sense sharing the "profoundly anthropocentric" perspective Hallyn associ- ates with the Copernicans.23 While the distinction is subtle, it is not only enormously important in making Paradise Lost a profoundly 21.

Despite the quite different eras in which they worked, Alastair Fowler and David Masson defend this thesis in distinct but not incom- patible ways. For Fowler, Milton is determinedly yet also intelligently undecided as to which world system to endorse, although Fowler ac- knowledges that Raphael's rhetoric often suggests strong Copernican leanings. Masson goes even further in uncovering these leanings. Less cautious than Fowler and perhaps less influenced by the later era's neopositivist standards of science, he is also more imaginatively sym- pathetic to the broader context of Raphael's central question-"What if the Sun / Be Centre to the World?" (8.122-23): In this last passage Adam is represented as arriving by intuition at the Copernican theory, or at least as perceiving its superior simplicity over the Ptolemaic; and though the drift of the Angel's reply is that the question is an abstruse one, and that it is of no great consequence for man's real duty in the world which system is the true one, yet the balance of the Angel's remarks is also Copernican. There is no doubt that these two passages were inserted by Milton to relieve his mind on the subject, and by way of caution to the reader that the scheme of the Physical Universe adopted in the construction of the poem is not to be taken as more than a hypothesis for the imagination.24 If Masson can be criticized for exercising an overly Romantic bio- graphical imagination in intuiting Milton's actual intentions, he should also be praised for noting the strongly hypothetical, that is, Baconian and/or Galilean principles, of Milton's cosmos. Yet Masson's case could have been made even stronger by noting Milton's disagreement with his most immediate literary predecessor, Guillaume de Salluste Du Bartas. Unlike Milton, Du Bartas remains so committed to commonsense, pretelescopic models of the universe that this creation poet flatly rejects Copernicanism as obviously ab- surd-so obviously that he places the Copernicans, not the Aristote- lians Milton so savagely caricatures, in his equivalent of Milton's Paradise of Fools. The fools' paradise of Paradise Lost draws upon its "original" in Du Bartas's Devine Weekes and Workes (in Sylvester's 1605 English translation) only to caricature its conservative and outdated collection of scientific errors. Bacon had famously lain the blame for such errors upon the idols of the theater or of false philosophy, mere innate human preferences or notions that Raphael, like Gali- leo, scornfully associates with the Ptolemists' "devout" adherence to 24.

As a result of this idolatrous misdevotion, they earnestly "contrive / To save appearances" by girding "the Sphere / With Cen- tric and Eccentric scribbl'd o'er, / Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb" (8.81-84). Such contrivances promote a humanly commonsensical geocentrism only by defacing the vast frame of the cosmos with an ultimately uncommonsensical, ugly, and unwieldy system. This objection is even more significant in context than it may seem today, since rather than directly identifying sense experience with empiricism, seventeenth-century science at first needed to exalt the counterintuitive nature of a divine plan "too high," hidden, and/or mathematically abstract for more naive human "scribblers" to grasp. This approach caused the enemies of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo to revile them for dismissing apparently well-attested empirical "facts" in favor of "mere" numerical hypotheses, for while mathematical proof was then still considered the highest form of certitude, even Bacon thought it held only within pure mathematics. In the wake of Galileo's enforced capitulation to this bias, only with great difficulty did New- ton begin to persuade his scientific contemporaries that mathematics could be used to demonstrate the operation of physical laws-an- other position that Milton seems to anticipate.25 Raphael's notable caution in deciding which chief world system is best able to "save the appearances" thus seems to derive from Milton's Baconian awareness that, Geminus to the contrary, it was never accept- able for scientists to manipulate "appearances" to fit preconceived theories of any kind. In this he again clearly favors the empiricist faction in the debate currently raging over scientific method, a posi- tion succinctly summarized in Bacon's essay "On Superstition" (1625). There he defines the tactic of fitting "arguments... to practice, in a reversed order" as typical of "'the schoolmen [who] were like astronomers, which did feign eccentrics and epicycles, and such engines of orbs, to save the phaenomena; though they knew there were no such things'; and in like manner, .... the schoolmen had framed a number of subtle and intri- cate axioms and theorems, to save the practice of the church" (Works, 6:416). Yet as Bacon also wisely insists, valid empirical skepticism does not necessarily validate the opposing (or Copernican) position. Apparently preferring Tycho Brahe's elaborately documented geo- centric alternative to heliocentrism, he also identifies superstition with the kind of unsubstantiated speculation or "Chaos" that prema- turely introduces a "new primum mobile that ravisheth [or overturns] all the spheres of government" (Works, 6:416). Nevertheless, it seems relatively clear that Milton, like Bacon, primarily associates elaborate 25. Kargon (see n. 2 above) pp. 118-32.</page><page sequence="13">Catherine Gimelli Martin o Milton's Epistemology Reconsidered 243 techniques for "saving the appearances" with the cumbersome, "Papist," and fundamentally superstitious primum mobile and mystically concen- tric crystalline spheres of the old astronomy, which in his epic cosmos have given way to scientific optical glasses. Also like Bacon, Milton supports the formation of tentative, speculative hypotheses as the best way to secure an "interim" knowledge that will achieve complete certi- tude only (as Areopagitica [1644] insists) with the "Masters second comming" (CPW, 2:549).26 Indeed like Bacon, Milton clearly associates the traditional cosmol- ogy with "mere" superstition. His divorce tracts liken the traditional laws of marriage to "no Law but sin muffl'd in the robe of Law, ... which are too foule Hypotheses to save the Phaenomenon of our Saviours answer to the Pharises about this matter. And I trust anon by the help of an infallible guide to perfect such Prutenick tables as shall mend the Astronomy of our wide expositors" (CPW, 2:243). The Prutenick tables he refers to here are the Copernican planetary tables of Erasmus Rein- hold, and his analogy demonstrates Milton's approval of Reinhold's astronomical corrections. But, because the tables had been super- seded by Kepler's Rudolphine Tables of 1627, the reference has incited the usual complaint about Milton's dated astronomical information (see the Yale editor's gloss on the passage). Yet, this complaint anach- ronistically overlooks the fact that during the 1640s most of Kepler's work was very little known in England, even by astronomers.27 Addi- tionally, by defining proper hypotheses in the new inductive sense of first laying down a position to be proven, "then answering what may be objected either from Scripture or light of reason" (CPW 2:242), Milton actually anticipates the attitudes toward induction later adopted by the most "advanced intellectual circles" of Restoration England, the Royal Society virtuosi, who would similarly require that hypotheses be supported by the careful "collection of data and the construction 26. Whether or not Bacon's method included the use of hypothesis is a vexed ques- tion, but Peter Urbach very convincingly refutes modern detractors of Baconian method by showing that they misinterpret what he meant by "anticipations of nature." See Urbach (n. 7 above), pp. 30- 45. Hunter's important work in Science and Society in Restoration England also supports Urbach's contention that Baconian induction was not opposed to hypothesis but strongly approved its uses so long as it was subjected to rig- orous testing and avoided premature systematization (p. 17). Historically, however, there does seem to have been some confusion among Bacon's own followers; on the seventeenth-century debates on the subject, see Barbara Shapiro, Probability and Cer- tainty in Seventeenth-Century England: A Study of the Relationships between Natural Science, Religion, History, Law and Literature (Princeton University Press, 1983). 27.

[of] principles based on cautious and tentative theorizing from past experience."28 Thus, like Kepler himself at one stage of his career, Milton faced a cosmological dilemma in writing Paradise Lost that seems to have cen- tered on choosing between Galileo's fully Copernican astronomy and Brahe's alternative, not on any lingering nostalgia for the mystifica- tion and confusion increasingly associated with the Ptolemaic model.29 Yet, since in either case the essential conflict was between geocentrism and heliocentrism, and since it was far easier to deal dismissively with the Ptolemaic model than with Brahe's, both Raphael's central ques- tion-"What if the Sun / Be Centre to the World, and other Stars / By his attractive virtue and their own / Incited, dance about him various rounds?"-and the details of his flight to earth seem designed, as Mas- son intuited, to favor both Galileo's telescopic discoveries and his fun- damental Copernicanism. Simply by reporting the possibly "Imagined Lands and Regions in the Moon" in terms that recall Galileo's com- parison of the moon (inhabited or not) to our terra firma, Raphael confirms that the cosmos consists of plural "worlds and worlds" amidst which earth "first appearing" seems but "A cloudy spot" (5.263, 265- 66). Again following Galileo, the angel makes the earth's "Terrestrial Humor" cosmically continuous with the dark spots Galileo found on the sun (3.610). Satan's voyage additionally demystifies the supralunar sphere by suggesting that the sun's real chemical action is the only likely source of the transformative energies formerly identified with "That stone, or like to that which here below / Philosophers in vain so long have sought" (3.600-601). Given that both Bacon and Newton continued to dabble in alchemy, Milton's eagerness to associate the powers of the philosopher's stone with nothing more mysterious than solar energy again indicates his typically sound blend of empirical skepticism and pragmatism. But as to the earthly search for the philos- opher's stone itself, his repetition of "in vain" at the beginning of the next line consigns this "dream" to the vanities of the Paradise of Fools, 28. Shapiro, p. 172. But as Michael Hunter points out, the members of the Royal Society were so diverse not only in their scientific sophistication and political affilia- tions but also in their methodology that their own historian (Thomas Sprat) actually slights the role of hypothesis. See his Establishing the New Science: The Experience of the Early Royal Society (Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell, 1989), pp. 28, 54, 207-15. Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer present the contrary view of the Royal Society as promoting uniformity through the public witnessing of experiments in Leviathan and the Air Pump: Hobbes, Boyle, and the Experimental Life (Princeton University Press, 1985). 29. For a similar opinion, see Alastair Fowler, ed., The Poems ofJohn Milton (London: Longmans, 1968), p. 820, n. 8.117-22.</page><page sequence="15">Catherine Gimelli Martin o Milton's Epistemology Reconsidered 245 where many other things "Imagin'd rather oft than elsewhere seen" (3.599) are found-or rather, lost. In contrast to these illusions, Milton clearly supports the unex- pected things actually revealed by the telescope. Advancing physical hypotheses to explain phenomena like Galileo's controversial sun- spots rather than merely dismissing them as optical illusions, as Gali- leo's Aristotelian detractors did, the narrative voice wittily remarks that Satan would no doubt be the darkest of such spots that Galileo "Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw" (3.590). The poet then speculates that real sunspots might be the result of some "Terrestrial Humor mixt / Here in the dark" with higher elements ("precious things") refined by the sun's fire (3.610-11). Since Aristotelian/Ptole- maic cosmologies ruled out this synthesis of earthly and heavenly phenomena, this speculation again illustrates the physical uniformity of Milton's epic cosmos. The firmly heliocentric bias noted by Masson is also apparent in his depiction of Adam's growing dissatisfaction with "commonsense" geocentrism once he begins to consider the improb- ability of having vast interstellar spaces circle the earth diurnally. In response, Raphael enthusiastically suggests an alternative that accu- rately paraphrases Galileo's heliocentric observations of the planets: "Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid, / Progressive, ret- rograde, or standing still, / In six thou seest, and what if sev'nth to these / The Planet Earth, so steadfast, though she seem, / Insensibly three different Motions move?" (8.126-30). For contemporaries who had read Galileo's account of his discovery of the sometimes "hid" moons of Jupiter (an account available in English fifty years earlier), the archangel's knowledgeable gloss on the planets and the "three different Motions" that the Copernicans assigned to the earth-axial, orbital, and the later omitted "motion in declination"-would seem to supply an authoritative confirmation of both Galileo's observations and the Copernican theory he supported. 30 In contrast, the Ptolemaic Du Bartas not only exhibits none of Mil- ton's consistent fondness for mobile, dancing stars as emblems of 30. On the importance of Galileo's discovery in defeating the anti-Copernicans and its English reception, see Boas (n. 9 above), pp. 318-20. On cosmic dances, see Fowler, p. 596, n. 3.579-81, which also usefully corrects Hughes's error concerning the "three different Motions" described in this passage: "The three motions attributed to the earth by Copernicus: namely, diurnal rotation, annual orbital revolution about the sun and a 'third motion' or 'motion in declination'... later Tycho Brahe was able to dis- pense with this third motion" (p. 821, n. 8.130). In the broader context the celestial dances refer to astronomical observation, since charting their "wandr'ing" courses ('planet' means "wanderer") is to follow dancelike perambulations. Thus Bacon's De- scriptio Globi Intellectualis asks "whether there be many different centres in the system, and as it were many dances?" (Works, 5:523).</page><page sequence="16">246 MODERN PHILOLOGY God's glory but predictably treats the three principal motions of the Copernican system with open disdain. Although Du Bartas himself was hardly medieval-his Reformed synthesis of scripture, Neopla- tonic interpretation, and critique of both ancient and contemporary cosmic theory, in fact, suggests why the work of this French Calvinist remained popular throughout Milton's era-his science is far more backward looking and orthodox than Milton's.31 Not only does his Trinitarian God unambiguously place the earth in the center of the concentric circles of the Ptolemaic system, since, as he firmly an- nounces, "In all the World, God could not place so fit / Our Mother Earth, as in the midst of it"; but Du Bartas goes on to relegate the Copernican hypothesis to the "lunatic" domain of false or foolish sci- ence. Inverting this strategy, Milton reserves the entire Ptolemaic sys- tem for his contrary version of the Paradise of Fools.32 In doing so, he draws on a tradition of epic satire rooted in Ludovico Ariosto, whom Du Bartas follows by locating the delusions of those who have lost their wits in the moon-for both, still the traditionally lowest and "weakest" of the Ptolemaic spheres. Milton retains this parodic "space" but displaces it from the moon-which now contains Galileo's "imagin'd Lands" for future telescopic exploration-to the peak of the Ptolemaic system, the primum mobile, now the most suitable "no where" to warehouse his foolish and mad philosophers. With this in mind, Raphael's derisive remarks about the "quaint Opinions" (8.78) of the Ptolemaic astronomers may be read as a direct rebuttal to Du Bartas, who dismissed the Copernican adherents as "Brain-sicks ... / That lose themselves still in contrarie waies" by de- nying that the planets circle the stationary earth as surely as "Cart- nailes fastened in a wheele." Du Bartas continues: Preposterous Wits that cannot row at ease, On the smooth Channell of our common Seas. And such are those (in my conceit at least) Those Clarkes that thinke (thinke how absurd ajest) That neither Heav'ns, nor Starres doo turne at all, Now dannce about this great round Earthly Ball; But th'Earth it selfe, this massie Globe of ours Turns round-about once every twice-twelve howers: And we resemble Land-bred novices 31. See George Coffin Taylor, Milton's Use ofDu Bartas (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1934); as Hughes (n. 17 above), p. 174, notes, Sylvester's translation made the poem more popular in England than it ever was in France. 32.

Also, if the earth obeyed all three Copernican motions, cannonballs would "recoyle" in their own paths, birds be unable to navigate by the sun, and the earth be unable to avoid the violent winds of its own rotation. "Arm'd with these reasons," he then asserts that "'twere superfluous / T'assaile the reasons of Copernicus, / Who, to salve better, of the Stars th'appa- rance, / Unto the Earth a three-fold motion warrants / Making the Sun the Center of this All. / Moone, Earth, and Water, but one onely Ball." It seems clear that Du Bartas knows that the "three motions" of the Copernican model do a somewhat better job of "saving the appearances" of the planetary orbits, but he must reject the theory not only for the "commonsensense" reasons he lists but also because he still believes that the Divine handiwork demands the Platonic/Aristo- telian dignity of stasis. This final objection is implicit in his remark that "I oft admire Greatnes of mightie Hills, / And Pleasant beautie of the flowerie Fields, / And count-les number of the Oceans sand / And secret force of sacred Adamant: / But much-much more (the more I marke their course) / Stars glittering greatnes, beautie, number, force."34 Rather than citing in Du Bartan fashion the stars' perfect, perma- nent circles as the final cause "explaining" their eternal orbits around the earth, Milton's Raphael appeals to the new scientific standard of motive force as the "proper" or efficient explanation of their courses, without even stopping to consider any of the atmospheric objections raised by Du Bartas-most likely because they had already been an- swered on the Second Day of Galileo's Dialogue on the Great World Systems (1632), a text clearly echoed by Raphael.35 Thus Raphael in- stead asks why the earth should not move "With inoffensive pace that 33.

With the same swift, imaginative stroke that grants earth her own atmosphere, he also sug- gests that the stars Du Bartas sees circling "about this great round Earthly Ball" may instead rotate about the sun, and "By his attractive virtue and their own / Incited, dance about him various rounds" (8.124-25). Finally, Raphael slyly asks Adam how, without a solar- centered system, he might dispense with that "swift / Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos'd / Invisible else above all Stars, the Wheel / Of Day and Night" (8.133-36). This problem is obviously intended for Milton's contemporary readers, since Adam has proposed no such intricate system of invisible rhombs, let alone likened the revo- lution of the spheres to earthly wheels, one of the most ancient and "circular" idols of the tribe. Milton exposes this idol simply by allowing Adam to discover the naivete implicit in his original question: Why should the vast and mighty heavens "superfluously" speed around the "sedentary Earth," this mere "punctual spot" (8.23, 27, 32)?36 In fortu- itously seizing on the idea that the vast distances experienced by Raphael and later charted by Kepler, Brahe, and Galileo make it un- likely that this earthly point or punctus can be the center of these infinite heavens without the awkward artifice of epicycles and rhombs, our ancestor also foresees the "idolatrousness" of his anti-Copernican descendants, who will think that assigning earth properly "industrious" motions makes it less worthy than the stationary sun. Milton himself had earlier taken essentially the same position as Adam/Raphael in his academic exercises at Cambridge. In fact, his seventh Prolusion actually overgoes their antigeocentrism in sarcastically questioning why the "vast spaces of boundless air are illuminated and adorned by everlast- ing lights... merely to serve as a lantern for base and slothful men," which again presupposes the advantages of an "industrious earth" filled with inquisitive Adams (CPW, 1:292). In summary, then, Du Bartas's scientific outlook may be said to con- trast with Milton's as tradition to innovation or as stasis to motion, in no small part because the Ptolemaic cosmos had appealed to Du Bar- tas upon the very grounds that Raphael most emphatically invalidates as mere idols of the tribe. Such idols falsely suggest that merely hu- 36. As Fowler notes, the "accuracy and subtlety of this line is generally missed. rhomb is... a magic wheel [in Greek], and refers to the imaginary primum mobile or tenth sphere, which in the medieval planetary system revolved diurnally about the earth with incredible swiftness, carrying the interior spheres of the stars and planets with it" (p. 822, n. 8.834). Significantly, Adam regards the earth as a mere "point," an increas- ingly accepted conception that helped prepare the way for the new astronomy; see Victor Harris, All Coherence Gone (University of Chicago Press, 1949), p. 25.</page><page sequence="19">Catherine Gimelli Martin o Milton's Epistemology Reconsidered 249 man notions about the relation between the earth's "nobility" and its cosmic position can either rightly (as Du Bartas would have it) or wrongly (as Adam would have it) decide the question of the actual de- sign of the universe. Correcting both, Raphael insists that "Great / Or Bright infers not Excellence" (8.90-91) in relation to both life and its Giver. For like the sun, the stars are relatively "barren" insofar as solar "virtue on itself works no effect, / But in the fruitful Earth" (8.94-96) and her inhabitants (8.98-99). Further, although God's infinite or "numberless ... Omnipotence" could cause the heavens to revolve di- urnally about the earth with "Speed almost Spiritual" (8.108-10), the solar "virtue" or life force actually seems to "officiate" with more truly godlike efficiency at the center of the planetary system. Here, as in Milton's Christian Doctrine, the emphasis is not on "extraordinary prov- idence of God" but on "God's ordinary providence" (CPW, 6:340-41), a consideration which at last seems to "clear" Adam of doubt (8.179) as to why the earth's motions only seem to make the stars complete "(... thir swift return / Diurnal) merely to officiate light / Round this opacous Earth" (8.21-23) -his original question.37 Yet how could he possibly be cleared of doubt unless he grasps Raphael's point that the sun and stars are not mere planetary signposts or "officials," as they had been for Du Bartas, but ordinarily efficient or "officious," and hence more probably central, dispensers of light and life? Or how in this they aptly reflect the true Prime Mover, now not a sphere or a static being but a life force who not only numbers the num- berless stars (8.19, 107-8; see Ps. 147:4), but lends his messengers the almost "spiritual" speeds needed to traverse them? By eliminating Brahe's objection to the vast distances Copernicans introduced into the universe in favor of the Keplerian school's objection to the still more incredible speeds introduced by the geocentrists, Raphael has effectively confirmed the fact that these speeds now operate within a vastly expanded universe, not in turning crystalline spheres around.38 In the process, he also implicitly confirms the mature conclusion reached in Bacon's chief astronomical work, Descriptio Globi Intellectualis (not published by Gruter until 1653): the sun, "that body which has the chief office in the system[,] should occupy that place from which it may best act on the whole system and communicate its influence" (Works, 4.516).39 37. For a similar evaluation of his theology, see Edwards (n. 5 above), p. 32. 38. See Hallyn (n. 21 above), pp. 158-59. 39. This statement represents Bacon's most favorable consideration of Copernican- ism, but it must be remembered that his reflections do not necessarily invalidate the Ty- chonic system, where all the planets except the earth revolve around the sun.</page><page sequence="20">250 MODERN PHILOLOGY For Masson, the probable heliocentrism of Milton's actual cosmos is further confirmed by Satan's instinctive propulsion toward the sun's centrally "attractive virtue" (8.124), the literally "Magnetic beam" that reflexively "warms / The Universe ... to each inward part" by shoot- ing "invisible virtue even to the deep" (3.583-86).40 This affirmation of Kepler's attempt to use William Gilbert's innovative experiments on magnetism to explain the source of solar power again shows Milton implicitly supporting his version of heliocentrism, the "first serious attempt to interpret the mechanism of the solar system" before New- ton.41 It also further invalidates the Aristotelian division of the uni- verse into sublunar and supralunar spheres. Raphael explicitly makes this point in another passage echoing the Descriptio, where Bacon in- sists that "those supposed divorces between ethereal and sublunary things seem to me but figments, superstitions mixed with rashness: seeing it is most certain that very many effects, as of expansion, con- traction, impression, cession, collection into masses, attraction, repul- sion, assimilation, union and the like, have place not only here with us, but also in the heights of the heaven and the depths of the earth" (Works, 4:512). Allowing his rhetorical questions to shade into tenta- tive assertions, Raphael similarly proposes the essential relativity and reciprocity of a universe in which the earth may now act as a "star" to the moon: ... what if that light Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air, To the terrestrial Moon be as a Star Enlight'ning her by Day, as she by Night This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there, Fields and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce Fruits in her soft'n'd Soil, for some to eat Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descry Communicating Male and Female Light, Which two great Sexes animate the World, Stor'd in each Orb perhaps with some that live. (8.140-52) 40. Hughes confirms my sense of 'officiate' as here suggesting to dispense or furnish (p. 363, n. 8.22). As Hughes also notes on p. 273, n. 3.608-12, the idea that solar rays engender gems in the earth appears in stanza 8 of Cowley's The Extasie, which indicates its currency even among such scientific promoters of the Royal Society as Cowley. 41.

As Hallyn points out, despite the mystical overtones involved in praising the sun as the temple, throne, lamp, eye, and "visible god" of this world, these ideals inspire the mathematical breakthroughs of both Kepler (whose planetary speculations Raphael also reflects) and Newton (whose gravitational laws ironically justify the occult concept of attraction at a distance).42 But in any case, except among strict mechanists like Hobbes, this animist vocabulary remained scientifi- cally respectable until long after Milton's death, when it still appears in Newton's alchemical writings, not to mention earlier, when Bacon turned away from mechanistic atomism to embrace the chemical phi- losophy descended from Paracelsus. In fact, Bacon's speculation that there are two basic "types of spirits; the 'animate' and the lifeless," or the airy and the fiery, seems to explain much about the materia prima of Milton's Chaos, which when summoned to creation is also divided into two types: those that can be "infus'd" with both "vital virtue" and "vital warmth," and those fated to remain inanimately and/or "tartare- ously" "adverse to life" (7.236-39). In both cases, this aversion to life is produced by the particles being "cut off and surrounded by the grosser body which intercepts them." Milton associates the "grosser body" with the vital fires of the sun, whose quasi-divine chemical agency is firmly "centered" in its universe by the golden compasses of the heavenly Son (7.235-37).43 Although not without some of the residual mysticism characteristic of the age, solar centrality has thus been effectively confirmed long before the dialogue on astronomy ever begins. Along with Milton's invocation to light, Raphael's verification of everything that Satan has witnessed on the sun strongly suggests that rather than merely in- habiting the fourth sphere above the earth (as in the Ptolemaic con- ception it should), the solar sphere here acts as a quasi-Copernican dispenser, king, or (as Satan calls him) visible "God / Of this new World" (4.33-34). This dignity aptly reflects the fact that since "here on Earth / God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n" (5.329-30), both heaven and earth are now centered around a single, blinding, but also nourishing throne of light. Here below it appears as the 42. See Hallyn, pp. 89-93, 127-29, 186-98; and Robert S.

Critical attempts to disconfirm this heliocentric orientation by associating Galileo's "less assur'd" vision with Satan's have proven unconvincing in both internal and intertextual terms. Internally, Raphael's wholly benign voyage to an earth "Not unconform to other shining Globes" (5.259) seems to be guided by telescopic eyes not un- like either those of the Sun's Archangel or those through which "by night... Galileo, less assur'd, observes / Imagin'd Lands and Regions in the Moon: / Or Pilot from amidst the Cyclades / Delos or Samos first appearing kens / A cloudy spot" (5.261-66). The obvious cause of the astronomer's "lesser" assurance is thus not his "falleness" but the fact that he must observe the moon by night, not by the light of Uriel's sun; also, unlike Uriel, Raphael, or the Greek navigator mentioned here, Galileo cannot actually pass through and explore the "cloudy spot[s] " he glimpses.44 Otherwise, their voyages all share the positive valence generally accorded them in Puritan literature, the faithful "Pilot" testifying to God's glory as "through the vast Ethereal sky / [He] Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing" (5.267-68). Externally as well, the positive implications of the Galileo image can be demonstrated by looking at its probable source in Bacon, who praised Galileo's "optical instruments" as akin to "skiffs and barks" that "have opened a new commerce with the phenomena of the heav- ens; an undertaking . .. both in the end and in the endeavour a thing noble and worthy of the human race." Bacon goes on to compare the stars to "so many small and invisible islands" amid a "sea of ether" (De- scriptio Globi Intellectualis, in Works, 4:512-13, 536), images Milton seems to echo both in the passages cited above and in Raphael's most firmly "decentered" description of man's place amid a continuum of multiple "worlds and worlds."

And for the Heav'n's wide Circuit, let it speak The Maker's high magnificence, who built So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so far; That Man may know he dwells not in his own; An Edifice too large for him to fill, Lodg'd in a small partition, and the rest Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best known. (8.98-106) Adam's "small partition" "not ... his own" is unlikely to be the center of a universe to which he is not only a "late" addition (7.92) but in which he occupies a mere outpost within a "wide Circuit" now clearly testifying to the glory of its incomparable Maker (cf. Bacon, Works, 5:515-18). Considering the weight of the evidence in Masson's favor, it may seem strange that few modern readers have concurred with him in recognizing the fundamental heliocentrism of Milton's universe. But like most scholarly myths, the illusion of Milton's backward-looking science and antiquated astronomy can be traced to an otherwise rep- utable source. Francis R. Johnson's important 1937 work, Astronomical Thought in Renaissance England, not only rediscovered an early English Copernican, Thomas Digges, but also pejoratively contrasted Digges with Milton, thereby reaffirming Huxley's earlier attack on Milton's scientific credentials. Johnson's attack set a lasting precedent that Mas- son could not countervail, in large part due to the latter's misunder- standing of the Paradise of Fools. Johnson's evaluation of Milton's expertise has thus become the conventional wisdom: had he possessed up-to-date scientific knowledge, the poet would have "adopted the Tychonic cosmology as the basis of the universe given in Paradise Lost," since by the time of the poem's publication that cosmology pro- vided the only valid geocentric alternative to Copernicanism. Thus for Johnson, Milton "was a poet, not a scientist," and his earlier admirers' claims concerning the extent of his astronomical learning are com- pletely unfounded.45 Johnson then goes on to make the by now routine survey of the outdated textbooks recommended in Of Educa- tion, which allows him to draw what remains the standard conclusion: 45. Masson's own theory is that Milton wished not to offend more conservative Pur- itan associates like the Smectymnuanns, who as late as the 1640s cite the Copernican doctrine "as an unquestionable instance of a supreme absurdity," although Masson finds Milton "even then ... far in advance of his contemporaries on this question." See Masson (n. 24 above), pp. 38-39.</page><page sequence="24">254 MODERN PHILOLOGY "Milton's imaginative picture of the universe was intimately interwo- ven with the Aristotelian-Ptolemaic conception of concentric spheres."46 There are several major inconsistencies in Johnson's argument, only some of which have been addressed above. First, the argument presumes a sharp and largely anachronistic distinction between math- ematical or theoretical and descriptive astronomy, the latter of which Johnson admits Milton possessed to a superlative degree. Yet, as Fow- ler's edition demonstrates, descriptive astronomy was profoundly al- tered by the new theory. Second, although Johnson recognizes that Milton's primary source for Raphael's dialogue on astronomy is Gali- leo's Dialogue of the Two Chief Systems of the World (that most anti- Ptolemaic work that he also admits Milton knew well), unlike recent historians of science, Johnson considers Galileo's Dialogue itself to be outdated, since it had taken on only his Aristotelian and Ptolemaic adversaries rather than the Tychonic system, which could not be so easily refuted. But in fact, as Johnson also admits, since the Tychonic system could not be refuted until after Newton, neither Galileo nor Milton could have constructed a dialogue on these rival systems, ex- cept perhaps in mathematical terms incompatible with literary debate or epic description. For, if judged solely by the proofs obtainable from direct observations of the stellar motions, Tycho's system remained just as valid as that of Copernicus until the first measurements of stellar parallax were made in 1838. There is little wonder, then, that as the Ptolemaic system became increasingly indefensible from the scientific point of view, the Tychonic system, which was scientifically tenable, was adopted as a middle ground by all scientists who were unwilling to accept the Copernican system in its entirety. The fact that the heliocentric theory rather than the Tychonic was finally enthroned upon the ruins of the Ptolemaic cosmology by the end of the seventeenth century was due solely to its proving more amenable to physical and mechanical explanations of the planetary motions and not to any confirmation by astronomical means. It required Newton's mathematical demonstration ... in terms of his law of universal gravitation to eliminate Tycho's system as one of two possible choices . .. and to leave Copernicus in undisputed command of the field.47 46. Masson's evaluation is fair-even Boyle remained skeptical of Copernicanism in the 1640s-but Francis R. Johnson rebuts this position in Astronomical Thought in Re- naissance England: A Study of the English Scientific Writings from 1250 to 1645 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1937), pp. 285-87, quotation on p. 286. Balachandra Rajan takes the same view as Johnson in "Paradise Lost" and the Seventeenth Century Reader (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1962), as have most scholars ever since. 47. Johnson, p. 221.</page><page sequence="25">Catherine Gimelli Martin o Milton's Epistemology Reconsidered 255 Read objectively, this passage completely invalidates Johnson's own critique of Milton: had Raphael presented Tycho's system as the more defensible model, he would have been wrong within a little over a de- cade. On the other hand, had he taken the strong Copernican posi- tion defended by Milton's younger contemporary, John Wilkins, the historian of science would still have to admit that "not all of ... [his] arguments would stand the test of modern scientific scrutiny," in part because they were "designed to appeal to his contemporaries." Thus by Johnson's own admission, using Galileo as a primary source for the dialogue on astronomy makes sense in the contemporary historical context, not least of all because that context still included antagonists like Alexander Ross, Henry Stubbe, Meric Casaubon, and Richard Baxter, all staunch Aristotelian or religious opponents of everything that Milton supported--Bacon, Galileo, and of course Wilkins him- self, whose Discourse concerning a new Planet: Tending to prove, That 'tis probable our Earth is one of the Planets Raphael often seems to echo along with Galileo's Dialogue.48 Moreover, Johnson loses sight of the epic's intended readership: not professional mathematicians and as- tronomers but a post-Restoration public more dubious than ever about revolutionary change, political or scientific. 49 Given the anti- papist, anti-Inquisition sentiments as well as the nontechnical outlook of this public, Galileo (rather than the unpublished and virtually unknown Newton or the semiforgotten Digges) is obviously the right touchstone for rehabilitating the ideals of the advancement of learn- ing so central to Milton's program. To establish that this program is on the "right" side ethically as well as scientifically, Raphael makes his Edenic science education condi- tional on Adam's rejection of a dangerous corollary that it might otherwise seem to support. For Milton, accepting the conclusion that the Copernican system "proves" that the greater should not serve the lesser (8.85-88) is another potentially idolatrous idea where "man's real duty in the world" is concerned. Adam and Eve in fact fall precisely by collapsing this duty into neat binary oppositions, Eve by letting Satan's pseudo-empiricism tempt her into a new form of geo- centrism divorced from heavenly oversight, Adam by letting Eve tempt 48. Ibid., pp. 278-79. Grant McColley shows that Milton's dialogue had followed the debate between Wilkins and Ross in his "Milton's Dialogue on Astronomy," PMLA 53 (1937): 728-62, but, perhaps due to Johnson's influence, wrongly regards Milton as anti-Wilkins, as Fowler notes (n. 29 above), p. 820, n. 8.117-22. For a review of the op- ponents of the new science listed above, see Westfall (n. 18 above), pp. 21-25. 49.

Both thus "invent" the idols of the tribe by exalting "greater" human ends in isolation from the means that actually placed them in the garden: the truly greater God who continues to serve his lesser creatures.50 Further, unlike Ba- con, Eve forgets that the "elegance" of Satan's hypotheses (9.1017-18) cannot guarantee a truth that has not actually been demonstrated but merely asserted in a manner completely contrary to Raphael's sober marshalling and weighing of evidence. Yet through God's "Prevenient Grace" (11.3), they will recover their prelapsarian ability to test all evidence carefully and impartially according to Raphael's method, al- though not without some postlapsarian interference by the passions. The epic audience's own task of repairing the "ruins of our first parents" (CPW, 2:366-67) obviously demands a similarly stringent me- thodological synthesis of discursive (or inductive) and intuitive (or deductive) reason. As Raphael teaches (5.486-500) and the narrative voice assents, this method is earthly, not mystically "rapt above the Pole" (7.23) like that of the foolish pilgrims on their way to the Para- dise of Fools. For real human progress demands a Baconian synthesis of lesser means with greater ends that will reject not just binary op- positions but the false hierarchies they generate as satanic idols block- ing the true advancement of learning.51 Because the deluded pilgrims vainly progressing through the Para- dise of Fools seek not only the wrong ends but the wrong means-the "ladder" of the old Ptolemaic cosmos-it and not Galileo is clearly associated with satanic delusion. By overlooking the parodic purposes of this false paradise, Masson weakened his own argument and was forced to conclude that Milton's epic conformed to the old astronomy in symbolic design, if not in theoretical fact. Nevertheless, like John- son, he usefully notes some details that challenge his own assump- tions. Masson is particularly surprised that during Satan's flight the small earth which is "so conspicuous" at the center of the Ptolemaic diagram of the universe 50. Adam reductively reasons that since he and Eve are literally "one flesh," he must join her in eating the forbidden fruit. This anthropomorphic literalism is specifically rejected in Milton's Tetrachordon (1645), which goes on to show how this kind of biblical exegesis is based upon bad logic, since it subordinates what should be understood as the preeminent efficient and final causes (i.e., the human and divine purpose of mar- riage) to far weaker formal causes. See CPW, 2:603-9. 51. Victor Harris (see n. 36 above) succinctly describes Bacon's position on the fall as one that condemns only "blind and immoderate zeal," and not knowledge per se, and insists that God is gratified neither by falsehood nor ignorance (pp. 130-31). Har- ris does not directly associate Milton with Bacon but places his representation of the fall in the same general camp (pp. 160-63).</page><page sequence="27">Catherine Gimelli Martin o Milton's Epistemology Reconsidered 257 either was not visible even to angelic eyes from such an amazing distance as the opening at the zenith of the Primum Mobile, or was not yet marked. The luminary that attracts Satan first, from its all- surpassing splendour, is the Sun. Though the tenant only of the fourth of the Spheres, this luminary so far surpasses all others in majesty that it seems like the King not only of the seven planetary Orbs, but of all the ten. It seems the very god of the whole new Universe--shooting its radiance even through the beds of the stars, as far as the Primum Mobile itself. Yet this quibble itself assumes that Milton's universe contains a pri- mum mobile, although the passage which Masson cites (3.571-87) does not actually name it as such. In fact, it only names the "calm Firma- ment" (3.574), which (as Masson had previously observed) irregularly describes not "the eighth or Starry Sphere [of the ten], but... the whole continuous depth of all the heavens as far as Primum Mobile."52 In addition to this irregularity, only one word in the nonparodic part of the passage concerning Satan's flight directly alludes to the Ptolemaic as opposed to other kinds of planetary orbits or spheres- the term 'convex' (3.419), which might suggest that Satan had landed on the outer shell of the primum mobile, the first convex of that system. But if he had done so, then heaven itself would lie beyond it, outside the primum mobile, where only the false philosophers of the fools' par- adise expect to find it. They are of course disappointed. As a result, the "convex" on which Satan lands cannot be identified with the heav- enly crystalline sphere: it marks a far vaguer boundary line between the ordered universe culminating in heaven and the Chaos from which Satan is departing. Since as in Genesis 1:6 this non-Ptolemaic "firma- ment" marks merely a vague boundary between the higher and lower "waters" of creation, Masson's assumptions prove unsatisfactory, first of all, because not only Ptolemaics but also Copernicans like Kepler imagined the created universe existing in a sphere enclosed by the fixed stars, separated from God, though still radiating the light of both.53 Second, as Masson again agrees, the tightly compressed spaces of the Ptolemaic system conflict with the vast cosmic distances tra- versed by Satan during his passage through and beyond Chaos, which like heaven and earth is an indeterminately "spherical" boundary, at first appearing as "a Globe far off / ... now ... a boundless Continent / Dark, waste, and wild... Save on that side which from the wall of Heav'n, / Though distant far, some small reflection gains / Of glim- mering air less vext with tempest loud" (3.422-24, 427-29). 52. Masson, pp. 41-42. 53. Hallyn (see n. 21 above), pp. 177-79.</page><page sequence="28">258 MODERN PHILOLOGY The characteristically equivocal, unshell-like nature of Milton's uni- versal boundaries is further underscored by his five references to tele- scopic perspective, which, we have seen, should be taken as broad symbols of the "Reformed," Galilean, or expanded universe. In Areo- pagitica, Milton characteristically invokes the great Galileo to symbol- ize the folly of drawing premature limits to human understanding: licensing one's preferred or received beliefs not only illegitimately inhibits the free competition of ideas from producing a Baconian expansion of learning but (as in Bacon's "Of Superstition") also leads to other "Romish" absurdities. Chief among these is making "the famous Galileo . . a prisoner to the Inquisition, for thinking in Astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican licencers thought" (CPW 2:538). These same absurdities reappear in the Ptole- maic cosmology of the Paradise of Fools, which is similarly inhabited by the same Franciscan and Dominican imposters who presided over Galileo's condemnation. Ascending the concentric circles of "the Plan- ets seven, . . the fixed / And that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs / The Trepidation talkt" (3.481-83) in their false habits, they, like the trepidation of their spheres, have become mere "talk," the phenomenon itself having been discredited by the intrepid Brahe. As the original imposter or liar, Satan's status as the first to enter this limbo of vain astronomy underscores Milton's parodic intent, which also requires establishing a figurative gap between this domain and the real cosmos that Masson, for one, overlooked. The gap between the fools' paradise and the cosmic boundary where the voyager at last "some small reflection gains" of real light (3.428) is established in part by framing Satan's entrance and exit from this limbo with epic similes stressing its literal emptiness. As the fiend enters this delusional realm, the narrator points out that his predatory intentions produce a "cany" or "canny" lightness (3.439) that he shares with the other fools. As "a Vultur on Imaus bred" he steers down from the symbolically evil North across snowy mountains bounded by the "roving Tartar," on the one hand, and, on the other, by "Chineses" who "sail" the "barren plains" below in wind wagons (3.431-32, 437-38). Here the association of the Tartar with Satan's Tartarus, and of the Chinese with canny yet morally dubious cun- ning, seems strong, especially if Merritt Hughes is right in thinking that Milton additionally associated these "cany" Chinese wind wagons with metaphorical wind, that is, with the "lying" name of their Jesuit chronicler, Juan Gonzalez de Mendoza.54 The association becomes stronger still when we recall that Dante's Limbo (itself discredited by 54. For complete details, see Hughes (n. 17 above), p. 268, n. 3.438-39.</page><page sequence="29">Catherine Gimelli Martin o Milton's Epistemology Reconsidered 259 Protestant theology) is surrounded by similar winds, and that similar delusions of power and glory had propelled Satan's imperial forces down from the frozen North to the barren plains of Milton's hell (1.344-55). Later, as Satan leaves this literal Limbo or "nowhere" and heads toward the "Arch-chemic Sun" (3.609), a comparable epic sim- ile marks his transition back to physical reality, where he will continue his equally inopportune "sailing" to Eden. There "North-East winds" ironically propel him "Beyond the Cape of Hope" as he hopelessly scents the "balmy spoils" to be foolishly despoiled in his self-defeating colonization of Eden (4.159-61). But in between, other allegorical pointers clearly indicate that while earthly events may well be literal "shadows" of those in heaven (5.574-75), the cosmology of the Para- dise of Fools and of its crystalline primum mobile resembles the exploits of its inhabitants: both offer only mere dreams of order, virtue, worth, destined to dissolve along with the hopes of its deluded pilgrims. The fact that Milton's Limbo of Vanity is even more windily empty than his Chaos, and hence as scientifically suspect as the Ptolemaic universe of Dante's epic, is also signaled by Milton's ironic inversion of details taken from Dante's Limbo. Harboring neither classical sages nor tragic lovers, Milton's version is home to mere "windbags"- "Aereal vapors... / Of all things transitory and vain" (3.445-46). Mocking not only Empedocles, one of Dante's noble philosophers, but Dante's version of St. Peter, he then goes on to make the entire episode into an elaborate parody of cantos 27 and 28 of the Paradiso. There, after meeting with St. Peter, the poet "magically" ascends to the crystalline sphere. In place of this ascent, the "painful Supersti- tion and blind Zeal" of Milton's climbers literally dash their hopes to the winds just as "Saint Peter at Heav'n's Wicket, seems / To wait them with his Keys" (3.452, 484-85). Yet Dante himself seems less a target of this satire than his cosmological and sacramental system, particu- larly since his depiction of St. Peter's denunciation of those "Ravening wolves in shepherds' clothing.., .seen from here above through all the pastures" (Paradiso, 27:55-56) must have found favor with Milton, who echoes it in "Lycidas" (see lines 114-29). Yet the fact remains that these ravaged "pastures" are precisely what Milton locates in his crys- talline sphere, the last place where Dante would have "seen" them as he passes beyond in search of higher things. Thus, if from his height the Italian poet can clearly see "the mad track of Ulysses" (27:82-83) much as Milton can track Satan, only Dante can praise the primum mo- bile as both the "swiftest of the heavens" (27:99) and as utterly remote from all earthly things. Because "Its parts, the nearest and the highest, are so uniform that I cannot tell which Beatrice chose for my place" (27:100-102), Dante is aware only of a "still centre" that "moves all</page><page sequence="30">260 MODERN PHILOLOGY else round it, begins here as from its starting-point, and.., .has no other where but the Divine Mind .... [For] Its motion is not deter- mined by another's, but from it the rest have their measures" (27:106- 10, 115-16).55 This static plenum distances Milton from Dante just as surely as from Du Bartas, a point that becomes even clearer when we contrast Dante's questions to Beatrice in the following canto with those that Adam asks Raphael.56 Dante asks his Lady why the "wheels" of univer- sal order do not conform to the earthly world of sense, essentially the same question Milton later gives to Eve. The difference is that both Dante's question and Beatrice's answer are cast in Ptolemaic terms: Why is it that from our earthly perspective, the planetary orbits be- come "more divine the farther they are from the centre," or earth, but in the supralunar universe they are more divine the closer they are to the centre," or God (28:46-51)? Beatrice's reply is precisely the re- verse of that given by Milton's Raphael, for in contrast to his "great / Or Bright infers not Excellence," she reveals that "Greater excellence must make greater blessedness; greater blessedness takes a greater body when the parts are of equal perfection. This sphere, therefore, which sweeps along with it all the rest of the universe, answers to the circle that loves most and knows most; so that if thou apply thy mea- sure to the virtue, not the appearance, of the spirits that appear to thee as circles, thou wilt see in each heaven a marvellous correspon- dence with its Intelligence, of greater with more and smaller with less" (28:67-78). In other words, although closer to the universal "center," God's primum mobile appropriately has the greatest circumference of all the spheres, which Beatrice finds commensurate with the holiness of Him and his blessed saints. After this explanation, Dante is abso- lutely cleared of doubt by Beatrice very much as Adam is by Raphael: "when my Lady granted me her clear answer.... like a star in heaven the truth was plain" [la donna mia del suo risponder chiaro, / e come stella in cielo il ver si vide] (28:86-87). However, in Paradise Lost these spheres have been so "scribbl'd o'er" (8.83) that Milton conceives this "height" as truly circular, in the sense of dizzying or mystifying: containing the least knowledge and smallest minds of any in his epic cosmos. This again makes Satan the most appropriate "fool" to expe- rience the illusions of his Limbo of Vanity, whose fundamental bar- 55. Paradiso, in The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri, trans. John D.

There can be little doubt, then, that this "Limbo large and broad, since call'd / The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown / Long after" is "dedicated" solely to Satan's future followers: all who pursue compara- ble delusions once "Sin / With vanity had fill'd the works of men" (3.495-97, 446-47). With wry humor complementing the rapt humil- ity that characterizes the paeans to light that open and close this book, Milton concludes that this barren realm will not long lack equally bar- ren inhabitants-all those who build "thir fond hopes of Glory or last- ing fame" only upon "Naught," that is, nothing more than "the praise of men" (3.449-53). Since it will be "to few unknown"-and since Milton himself has perhaps had more of a glimpse of the shipwrecked hopes it contains-his list of its contents can hardly be exhaustive. In- stead, its occupants symbolize each kind of "lunacy" that Bacon associ- ated with the idols of cave, the tribe, the marketplace, and the theater. The giants who dominate the earth before the flood represent the idols of the cave, falsely measuring their deeds by their own confused perception of their true "height," which leads to "many a vain exploit, though then renown'd" (3.465). Next in folly are those who pursue the idols of the tribe and the marketplace, interrelated forms of false worship that, rather than granting them the godlike power they covet, merely reproduce the linguistic confusions and delusions linked to Babel (3.466-68). Last and perhaps most pitiable of all are those who pursue the idols of the theater, that is, the vain philosophers, who like Empedocles delusively leap into Aetna's flames, or like Cleombrotus, foolishly drown in a sea of false expectations, in either case seeking shortcuts to a purely fictitious or fruitless immortality. Their succes- sors are thus "many more too long, / Embryos, and Idiots, Eremites and Friars" (3.473-74), pilgrims searching for religious relics, sinners foolishly self-"sanctified" by donning Dominican or Franciscan robes at their deaths-in short, all who put faith in "embryonic," "idiotic," and idolatrous philosophies sanctioned only by "painful Superstition and blind Zeal" but lacking both self-knowledge and its proper Baco- nian corollary, objective observation. Suitably, then, these fools retrace Dante's progress through the circles of his "superstitious" Ptolemaic cosmos, only to be blown wind- ily "awry" into the vast reaches of the far greater cosmos that God actually created: They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt, And that Crystalline Sphere whose balance weighs The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov'd; And now Saint Peter at Heav'n's Wicket seems</page><page sequence="32">262 MODERN PHILOLOGY To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot Of Heav'n's ascent they lift their Feet, when lo A violent cross wind from either Coast Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry Into the devious Air; then might ye see Cowls, hoods, and Habits with their wearers tost And flutter'd into Rags, then Reliques, Beads, Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls, The sport of Winds: all these upwhirl'd aloft Fly o'er the backside of the World far off Into a Limbo large and broad (3.481-95) Milton's relish for biting ecclesiastical satire is hardly less obvious here than his skill at cosmological spoof. Had he any more real credence in the Ptolemaic system than in the notion that St. Peter held the keys to the kingdom (an allegorization, based on Matt. 16:19, that Protestants generally regarded as foolish), he would hardly have thus "exploded" it along with all the hopes of this fool's paradise, nor would he have placed the crystalline sphere in a scatological whirlwind flying off "the backside of the World." The Ptolemaic system's medieval circles, like its "trepidation talkt," are here at last represented as idols no less asi- nine than the rags and tags of Romanist doctrine that appropriately vanish into their own "devious air." In contrast, the quite unDantean beatific vision of heaven from which Satan is so "sadly" if inevitably excluded (3.525) contains abso- lutely no allusions to the concentric circles of the Ptolemaic universe, which have collapsed into his Limbo along with Dante's entire peni- tential system for regaining a paradise, which, in Milton's mortalist view of the resurrection, was never otherworldly in that sense at all. The remainder of Satan's voyage to earth revolves around his flight to the sun and the reliable information he gleans from its archangel, Uriel. After passing "amongst innumerable Stars" that possibly harbor other "Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flow'ry Vales" but are no longer inscribed in otherworldly wheels (3.565-66, 569), Satan him- self is drawn to its apparent center: "The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven / Allur'd his eye ... where the great Luminary / Dispenses Light from far" (3.572-73, 576, 579), like the "God / Of this new World; at whose sight all the Stars / Hide thir diminisht heads" (4.33-35). Nevertheless, because Milton's hesitation in the same passage as to whether Satan's course is "by centre, or eccentric" (3.575) no more confirms the heliocentric hypothesis than the conclusions of Raphael's lecture have, we must make a final attempt at answering the vexed question of why this residual ambiguity remains. Here the soundest conclusion would seem to point in two apparently opposite but not</page><page sequence="33">Catherine Gimelli Martin o Milton's Epistemology Reconsidered 263 actually incompatible directions. First, as a pragmatic Baconian, Mil- ton may still have hesitated in choosing between Brahe's intermediate model of the universe and that of the major Copernicans, for while the latter accorded with the more orderly design that could be expected of his rational God, Brahe's method more closely conformed to the careful, commonsense principles of observation extolled by Bacon, who preferred it for those reasons.57 Second, like nearly every major proponent of the early scientific revolution, Milton's science is heavily permeated with Neoplatonic forms of thought that ultimately descend from Nicholas of Cusa's speculations on metaphysical infinity (proba- bly, as Alexander Koyr&amp; believes, via the voluminous propagandizing of Giordano Bruno). Yet, as we have seen, in abstract terms, these forms of thought do support the theoretical expansion of the universe.58 But before Newton, their variants had become so complexly hybridized that, particularly after Brahe, as Marie Boas notes, it is "often difficult to tell whether a man is a Copernican or not,.... [since] Copernican- ism itself comes to include many different concepts." This final point seems most directly relevant to Milton's "mixed" position, which like that of his protoscientific countrymen, Bacon, Gilbert, and Digges, typically "combined rational science and mysticism in a peculiar blend.""59 As a result, the most balanced assessment of the new science of Paradise Lost should describe it as a visionary composite of Bacon's method, Gilbert's magneticism, and (most ironically) Digges's con- strual of the vastly enlarged celestial sphere as an indication of the wonder and majesty of God. For pace Johnson, Milton's affinity with Digges is shown by the fact that like Raphael and Uriel, as well as the Milton of The Reason of Church Government, Digges regarded the astronomical and the theo- logical heavens as essentially continuous.60 Adopting the complex per- spectival stance that Fowler associates with Milton's cosmology, Digges argued that since the brightness of the stars to human eyes exists only in relation to their distance from us, "the greatest part rest by reason of their wonderful distance invisible unto us." He then proceeds to argue that their domain "may well be thought of us to be the glorious court of the great God, whose unsearchable works invisible we may partly by these his visible conjecture, to whose infinite power and maj- esty such an infinite place surmounting all others both in quantity and 57.

Thus, despite his characteristic mixture of theology with astronomy, Digges is also, as Boas remarks, scientifically radical: "In breaking the bounds of the finite universe and wiping out the upper boundary of the celestial sphere, Digges has conceived the abolition of the boundary between the starry heavens and the firma- ment as well. If one could fly through the stars (which are only like our Sun) he would arrive straight in Paradise."61 While this boundlessness does not precisely describe Satan's flight through the universe-he is blocked from entering heaven by the walls and gates glimpsed in the distance-it does indeed seem to explain Raphael's journey. More- over, unlike the allegorical ladders that are not "There always, but drawn up to Heav'n sometimes / Viewless," even Satan is allowed to see the heavenly gates of diamond, gold, and "orient Gems," along with the sea "Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearl" directly beneath them (3.506-7, 516-19). These details seem to supply the equivalent of Digges's "etherial" theological paradise. "Ascending by degrees magnificent" (3.502) on the other side of the firmament where our universe begins but, in remaining physically continuous with heaven, does not end, Milton's jewel-like heavens seem to crystallize not only the cosmic and solar but all the "precious things" of the earth. This conception is fully compatible with Digges's metaphysical Copernicanism. The same metaphysical yet monistic Copernicanism seems to in- form Milton's elaborate description of the symbolic jewels worn by Uriel, which are organically generated in the sun and imparted by it to earth. These continuities again contrast with the barriers of Dante's cosmos, which cause him to seek and receive supernatural aid as he passes through the supralunar crystalline spheres of the Ptolemaic universe. In Milton's epic, the angel of the sun himself erases these boundaries as Uriel reports his eyewitness experience of the uni- formly "material mould" of the cosmos: I saw when at his Word the formless Mass, This world's material mould, came to a heap: The cumbrous elements, Earth, Flood, Air, Fire, And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav'n Flew upward, spirited with various forms, That roll'd orbicular, and turn'd to Stars Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; Each had his place appointed, each his course, The rest in circuit walls this Universe. (3.708-9, 715-21) 61. Boas, pp. 107-8.</page><page sequence="35">Catherine Gimelli Martin o Milton's Epistemology Reconsidered 265 Since only an "ethereal quintessence of heaven" composes the sphere of fixed stars that "in circuit walls this Universe," Uriel clearly implies that the intermediate walls or crystalline spheres of the Ptolemaic uni- verse have disappeared into the Paradise of Fools. In their stead we find "numberless" stars and a chaotic infinitude "rul'd" only by the Word of the infinite Godhead (see 7.165-70). Although the Platonic/ Aristotelian schema of the five elements-earth, water, air, fire, and quintessence-remains, its presence is itself not enough to realign this cosmos with that of the old astronomy. Kepler himself had retained this fivefold system in a newly geometrized form consistent with the new astronomy, and in any case, these subatomic particles of matter (or whatever they now are) have already been securely identified with the monistic/vitalist continuum of Raphael's "one first matter all." But perhaps most significantly of all, the dream of physically ex- tending human vision into the very courts of God is not relegated to a Paradise of Fools but instead endorsed. Here again, the cosmology of Paradise Lost seems to correspond to Digges's notion that the "orb of fixed stars extendeth itself infinitely up in altitude spherically, and therefore immoveabl [y] ... [into] the palace of felicity garnished with perpetual shining glorious lights innumerable far excelling our sun both in quantity and quality; the very court of celestial angels devoid of grief and replenished with perfect endless joy."62 In The Reason of Church Government, Milton entertains an intriguingly similar concep- tion of infinite bliss, proposing that in heaven the blessed Saints' "happinesse may orbe it selfe into a thousand vagancies of glory and delight, and with a kind of eccentricall equation be as it were an in- variable Planet of joy and felicity" (CPW, 1:752). Thus, in beginning to ask "What if the Sun Be Centre to the World" and if the earth be a planet, Milton early seems to have taken the logical, if radical, step of supposing heaven itself to be an "invariable planet" that surpasses the other stars chiefly in transcendently or "eccentrically" combining infinite motion with infinite rest, another radical departure from the Ptolemaic system's circular "repetition of that which is prescrib'd" (CPW, 1.752). As a result, his heaven's oblique but real continuities with earth finally undermine the gulf that Johnson inaccurately in- serted between Milton and Digges and, in the process, establish the scientific protomodernity of both. 62.
