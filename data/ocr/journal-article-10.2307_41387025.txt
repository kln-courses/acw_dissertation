With the promise of that ritualistic incantation, the traditional beginnings of folk tales invite their listeners and readers to suspend disbelief, to enter into wondrous lands where exciting adven- tures and impossible happenings are part of the everyday. Where beanstalks grow sky- scraper tall, straw spins into gold, and toads turn back into princes. In a blending of fan- tasy and reality, good always overcomes evil and everyone- almost always- lives happily ever after. To believe in magic wands, gingerbread houses, talking scarecrows, glass slippers, wishing caps, elves, and trolls is to enter a make-believe world which spans both nations and generations. The term folk- tale encompasses "all forms of narrative, written or oral, which have come to be handed down through the years." And thus, according to Charlotte S. Huck and Doris Young Kuhn (Children's Literature in the Elementary School , Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1961), the term includes epics, ballads, legends, folk songs, myths, fables, and fairy tales. Although the basic purpose of folk tales is to entertain, their vitality and long sur- vival indicate additional values. According to May Hill Arbuthnot ( Children and Books , Scott, Foresman, 1964) these tales "contain in their picture language the sym- bols of some of the deepest human feelings, and satisfy in fantasy human desires for beauty, sincerity, achievement, and love. The castle speaks of achievement and the little hut of peace and security . . . love fortifying the weak, the misunderstood and the oppressed giving them sanctuary in peril and reinforcement in their weakness and rewarding their courageous struggles." Because children in the primary grades spend much of their time in make-believe play and those in the intermediate grades are only beginning to free themselves from the world of magic, the world of imagina- tion and reality which folk literature creates is one they can both enjoy and understand. Moreover, folk tales afford teachers the opportunity to develop the sort of imagina- tive engagement with literature that is the foundation of more mature appreciation. In exploring the area of folk literature, this ERIC report focuses on ways folk tales can be and are incorporated into daily classroom activities. It seeks to uncover the kinds of needs which folk literature fulfills and to suggest the kinds of things teachers can do to make children's encounters with folk literature valuable as well as fun. In discussing the effects of folk literature on children, Ruth C. Horrell ( Readings About Children's Literature, David McKay, 1966) contends that tales vicariously and otherwise supply a variety of needs: "emo- tional security, moral stability, achieve- 1024</page><page sequence="2">NCTE/ERIC Report: Once Upon a Time . . . Folk Tales and Storytelling 1025 ment, aesthetic pleasures, loving and being loved, escape and change brought about through imagination, and the need to know. Even the need to belong is vicariously satisfied in many of the tales." However, Lillian Hollowell (A Book of Children's Literature , Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1966) points out that the use of folk tales, especially fairy tales, is somewhat controversial. Some disapprove "for moral and religious reasons, asserting that the craft and cunning that often helps folk heroes achieve their purposes does not in- still worthy ideals in children." Others con- Using the Eric System NCTE/ERIC (the Clearinghouse on the Teaching of English) is the information service of the National Council of Teachers of English in cooperation with the U. S.

And still others suggest that folk tales would be a good substitute for much of what children daily view on TV. The accumulated wisdom and art in folk literature is often treated as mirroring the culture from which it was created. But some educators today warn of the danger in children's regarding folk stales as a true reflection of present-day ethnic groups and specific cultures. Although tales may help children to "get inside of" a culture, it is important that they not be substituted for a study of a culture. Instead they should be dealt with as one aspect of a culture and viewed in the "long ago" light in which they were created-to entertain, to explain, or to popularize a particular hero or event. The comfortable words of a story teller can best bring to life the "long ago" and "far and away" world of folk tales, and, through repeated tellings, make that world a part of the lives of all who, at any age, accept the almost compelling invitation of "once upon a time." Although the media has done much to enrich the literary lives of children, a storyteller conjures giants out of individual imagination, creates castles in the mind, and fleshes out heroes by personal personification. And these are still more splendid, more real even than those on any screen. To relegate the telling of folk tales of an unfamiliar voice on a spinning black disc, to the confines of a 16mm view, to a cereal-interrupted TV screen, or to only the printed page- how- ever colorfully illustrated- ignores the oral tradition and human heritage from which folk tales began. Telling folk tales (rather than reading them) enriches and entertains in an unfor- gettable way. It calls forth the imaginative involvement of its listeners, spontaneously</page><page sequence="3">1026 Elementary English invites their active participation, and often times sparks various outlets of creative ex- pression in art, music, or drama. According to Arbuthnot, storytelling triggers chil- dren's interest in books long before they themselves can read and it helps them to develop their powers of aural comprehen- sion. She further points out that because there is no book between the speaker and his audience, the storyteller can give the story- plus his own enjoyment of it- with- out being hampered by the printed page. Being able to "spin a yarn" or "weave a tale" is an art, an art which depends upon so loving and living a tale that the teller can breathe life into it for his audience. Ruth Sawyer ( The Way of the Storyteller , Viking Press, 1965) suggests that would-be storytellers begin by learning their story incident by incident or picture by picture- never word by word! "Work by the in- stinctive method of seeing your story first, of making it live for you to the point that you can make it live for others. And in this process of making it live, fit the words whether your own or another's to each movement of life as it comes to pass before the inner eye." Only in this way, she claims, will the storyteller be able to achieve his goal- "to create a story; to make it live during the moment of the telling; and to arouse the emotions of wonder, laughter, joy, amazement." Whereas storytelling enhances the enter- tainment value of folk literature, other ap- proaches and activities highlight other aspects. One such aspect is apparent in the many ways that the oral tradition will vary the same folk tale. Throughout a variety of versions, the same fundamental thread runs. Perhaps one of the best ways to help older children understand the continually creating nature of folk tales to be found in the various versions of them is to begin by exploring the folklore of their everyday world. Alan Dundes ( Elementary English , April 1969) suggests illustrating the funda- mental nature of oral tradition by asking each child to explain such items as: when Christmas presents should be traditionally opened, what the number of candles left burning on a cake signify, or what should be called out after a game of "Hide and Seek." From such exercises, both the diver- sity and unity of folklore emerges. This same combination can also be shown, he ex- plains, by examining their own folk poetry: "nursery rhymes, jump rope rhymes, hand clap rhymes, ball bouncing rhymes, and autograph book rhymes." Moreover, "by using the materials of folklore as a point of departure, the educa- tional process may be comprehended as dealing with the real world rather than with a world apart from the world in which the students live. With this approach, the classroom becomes a laboratory or forum for a consideration of 'real life' as it is experienced and perceived by those being educated " Ronald T. LaConte and Compton Rees (Elementary English , May 1971) carry the exploration of folk tales one step further in their description of a program in which students progress "from pupil-made myths, to recorded myths and folktales of various cultures, and finally to the general body of literature in all its many variations." Taking into account Piageťs continuous adaptive process of accommodation and assimilation, they sought to provide learn- ing experiences in such a way as to provide analogies between what mythic literature has created and what the children created. If a child can discover that the same aspira- tions and frustrations he projects into his own myths and tales also "occur in similar form in other myth stories and indeed in general literature around him, he learns something both about himself and the na- ture of art."</page><page sequence="4">NCTE/ERIC Report: Once Upon a Time . . . Folk Tales and Storytelling 1027 In much the same way that folk litera- ture combines fantasy and reality and mixes magic with daily events, so also the language arts teacher must somehow skill- fully combine the "far away" with the everyday. To dissect too much destroys the flavor. Not to tie-in at all may miss the point. But to be able to dissolve the class- room walls in order to see the castles beyond on some days and then on others to help children discover the folklore that lives within them is to blend the best of both worlds. Just how a teacher goes about this depends upon his own style, his under- standing of his pupils, and perhaps his own secret recollections of walks in en- chanted forests. The remaining portion of this article de- scribes ERIC documents which deal with the "once upon a time" in a variety of ways. The first group concerns the effects of folk tales upon children, the second looks at the art of storytelling and folklore in children's games, and the third presents a detailed 1-6 cur- riculum based on folk literature. Each of the ERIC abstracts is followed by a list of "de- scriptors" denoting major concepts treated in the full text of the document. Folk Tales and Children The following four documents discuss and explore the relationship between the fantasy of folk tales and the imagination of children. The first focuses on the way fanci- ful literature speaks to the "inner child," the second concerns the way folk literature helps to expand the imagination, the next contrasts the vitality of folk tales to the un- imaginative here-and-now stories of basal readers, and the last one deals with the rele- vancy of magical literary worlds to the child's own imaginative realm. "Literature for Children: An Engagement with Life." By Arthur T. Allen in The Horn Book Magazine , 43 (December 1967): 732- 37. (ED 021 838: EDRS Price: MF-$0.65 HC- $3.29 7 pp.) The two complementary questions- "What does literature do to young readers?" and "Can literature be taught?"- are not easily answered. Youth should not employ literature as an exclusive guide to life since they will encounter numerous unrealistic situations. Instead, literature should entice them to deal vicariously with vivid, new experiences and thus to feel themselves more deeply immersed in life. They should experience new responses and begin to de- velop their imaginations and critical abili- ties. If literature can be taught, children should first be taught to listen to the story as a whole and then to participate actively in literature through such creative dramatics as pantomime and play acting. As the chil- dren's own awareness and the story develop together, they become readers ( or listeners ) , then performers, and finally dreamer-cre- ators.

Paper presented at International Reading Association Conference: Boston , 1968 , 10 pp. (ED 022 620: EDRS Price: MF -$0.65 HC- $3.29) Most criticisms directed at basal reader stories concern the unreal characters which tend to depict only middle-class families and use unreal language patterns. However, such criticisms do not get to the core of the problem. A comparison of stories from basal readers with some famous folk tales illus- trates how the here-and-now stories from basal readers fail to stimulate children's imaginations. The folk tale is unique in elic- iting fanciful interpretation from children and adults because it is read at the level ap- propriate for the reader or listener. It per- mits self-discovery by allowing the reader or listener to look inside himself and allows the child to raise questions about himself and his own future. In contrast, the here- and-now stories from basal readers leave no room for the imagination. They lack life and passion and are too concerned about other children.

International Board on Books for Young People and the International In- stitute for Children's Juvenile and Popular Literature, 1967, 9 pp. (ED 022 750: EDRS Price: MF- $0.65 HC-$3.29) The fantastic tale is a genre of children's literature in which magic and reality are found side by side in a superficially plau- sible story with a definite historical setting. Motifs characteristic of the tale are living toys, strange children, modern witches, space and time displacements, "doors" to the wonderland, the mythical world itself, and combat between good and evil. Writers of this genre may be attempting to satisfy the child's need for pleasure, to free his imagination, or "to impart knowledge and character." Certain hypotheses hold that the fantastic tale is particularly relevant to 8- to 10-year-olds who must be freeing them- selves gradually from their beliefs in magic. Further research, however, is needed on two problems- whether the mental struc- ture of a child is by definition more recep- tive to magic than that of an adult, and whether children can extract philosophical truths from such tales.

Chil- dren's Services Division , American Public Library Association , Chicago , 1968, 35 pp. (ED 028 797: EDRS Price : MF-$0.65 HC -$3.29) This bibliography of materials, resource aids, and bibliographies for storytellers and storytelling is the result of a study by the Storytelling Materials Survey Committee of the Children's Services Division. In addi- tion to surveying library school curricula, the committee collected and evaluated ma- terials (including books, periodicals, pam- phlets, indexes, bibliographies, recordings, tapes, films, and film strips). The materials listed in this bibliography are those which are recommended for consideration and use. Following an introductory discussion of storytelling as a creative art, the bibliogra- phy is divided into four parts. Part I lists books and excerpts of books related to the art of storytelling, books dealing with poetry for children, and bibliographies and indexes to children's literature. Part II is devote^ to pamphlets and periodical articles of interest to the storyteller. Part III covers multi- media aids for the storyteller, including books and periodical articles on the subject and lists of available recordings of stories and poetry, tapes, instructional records and tapes for the storyteller, films, and film- strips. Part IV summarizes a survey of li- brary school courses in storytelling offered in seventeen U. S. library schools.

Folk Literature Curriculum The following six abstracts present The Nebraska English Curriculum for Grades One Through Six. This curriculum guide is based primarily on providing an under- standing of the heritage of oral tradition and the use of folk literature as a way of helping children better understand them- selves and the world around them. All of these documents are available in micro- fiche; however, hardcopy versions must be obtained from University of Nebraska Press, 215 Nebraska Hall, Lincoln, Nebraska 68508. A Curriculum for English, Grade 1, Units 1-12. Curriculum Development Center, Ne- braska University, Lincoln, Nebraska, 1966, 133 pp. (ED 013 806: EDRS Price : MF - $0.65 HC- not available from EDRS)</page><page sequence="7">1030 Elementary English The Nebraska Elementary English cur- riculum is based on the premise that desire to read, understanding of one's native lan- guage, and competence in composition de- velop from a continuing exposure to liter- ature of superior quality. The sequence of literary works and analogous compositions leads the child from an apprehension of the "mythic" and anthropomorphic to an aware- ness of the realistic and analytic. An oral approach to literature is stressed. Children are encouraged not only to enjoy and un- derstand what is read, but also to manipu- late language devices themselves through oral storytelling and written composition. Literature is classified in one of nine "pseu- do-genres"- folk tales, fanciful tales, animal stories, adventure stories, myths, fables, other lands and peoples, biographies, and historical fiction. Each of the 70 units in the six grades contains (1) introductory mate- rials outlining objectives of the unit and re- lating it to other units, ( 2 ) background ma- terials about authors, characters, themes, and style, (3) suggestions for inductive teaching procedures, (4) related composi- tion, language, and poetry exercises and assignments, (5) bibliographies for students and teachers, and (6) lists of audiovisual aids. In grade one, children are introduced to literature in all "pseudo-genres" except historical fiction. Teaching procedures em- phasize identification of repetitive situation and word patterns in literature and recogni- tion of meaning in simple story forms. Drawing upon what they learn from class reading and their explorations in language, children are then able tò dramatize scenes and compose stories of their own.

A Curriculum for English, Grade 2, Units 13-22. 113 pp. (ED 013 807: EDRS Price: MF- $0.65 HC- not available from EDRS). In the Nebraska English curriculum for grade two, development of a sense of lan- guage usage and of narrative form and plot is stressed. Such classic folk tales as "Little Red Riding Hood" and "The Three Bears" point out the repetition of plot structure and language found in stories. Fun with language forms is encouraged through the reading of "just so stories," and an under- standing of the myth is furthered in "The Golden Touch." Three aesop fables are pre- sented for simple analysis of common de- vices and patterns used in fables. Moreover, several Dr. Seuss stories and two adventure tales- "Blaze and The Forest Fire" and "The Bears on Hemlock Mountain"- help stu- dents perceive both real and fanciful views of reality. "Crow Boy" and "Caroline and Her Kettle Named Maud" illustrate how children today share universal experiences and problems with children of different cul- tures and different times. As children be- come familiar with literary methods and begin to recognize rhythmic and phono- logical patterns in compositions, they are able to create stories of their own, using as models the literature read in class. (JB) A Curriculum for English, Grade 3, Units 23-33. 152 pp. (ED 013 808: EDRS Price : MF- $0.65 HC- not available from EDRS) The Nebraska English curriculum for grade three continues to center on the read- ing of literature, with related language and composition activities. To strengthen chil- dren's awareness of the oral and repetitive patterns in folk literature and of the literary purposes of these devices, several Grimm fairy tales are read and then compared with modern stories- "Madeline" and "The Five Chinese Brothers," for example- which con- tain a series of parallel elements. Several animal stories are analyzed for such stylistic features as repetition, alliteration, and ono- matopoeia. "The Blind Colt" is read for its realistic treatment of animals and its use of</page><page sequence="8">NCTE/ERIC Report: Once Upon a Time . . . Folk Tales and Storytelling 1031 words that appeal to the senses. "Winnie The Pooh" and "Mr. Poppers Penguins" illustrate conflict and comic adventure in stories. Three Greek myths and the talking beast fables of Chaucer and the Brothers Grimm help children to understand the myth and the fable as conscious literary classifications and as part of our cultural heritage. "The Red Balloon" exemplifies the universality of human emotion, whereas "The Courage of Sarah Noble" and the bi- ography, "Columbus and His Brothers," acquaint children with historical themes. (JB) A Curriculum for English, Grade 4, Units 34-44. 153 pp. (ED 013 809 : EDRS Price : MF- $0.65 HC- not available from EDRS). Grade four of the Nebraska English cur- riculum extends and reinforces concepts in- troduced in previous grades. American folk literature, with its heroes exemplifying heroic qualities of the culture, is studied for its appeal to students and its use of descrip- tive and figurative language. Effective use of phonological patterns is illustrated in "Charlotte's Web" and "Brighty of Grand Canyon." In "Homer Price," fabulous and plausible adventures are contrasted and plot pattern is analyzed to point toward the study of the modern epic form. "Hiawatha's Fasting" and three Greek myths expressing the moral idealism of two cultures are used to further children's knowledge of the myth. The reading of Aesop's Fables, studied more analytically here than in previous fable units, leads to the children's dramatizations of stories with morals. "A Brother for the Orphelines" points out similarities in emo- tions and behavior of children of different cultures. Finally, two biographies- "Willa" and "Leif The Lucky"- are read for their simple and accurate presentation of fact, their vivid characterizations, their portrayal of the passage of time, and their revelation of every side of a subject. ( JB ) A Curriculum for English, Grade 5, Units 45-57. 197 pp. (ED 013 810: EDRS Price : MF- $0.65 HC- not available from EDRS) The Nebraska English, curriculum for grade five continues the presentation of literary techniques used to produce works of imagination. In "Tall Tale American," "Rapunzel," and other fairy tales, the Amer- ican and European folk traditions are com- pared for common stylistic and structural devices. A more complex use of techniques used in fanciful stories is seen in the fairy tales of C. S. Lewis and Hans Christian Andersen and in "The Bidpai Fables" and "Jataka Tales" from India. "The Door in the Wall" provides an introduction to the study of symbolism. Building upon previous grade-level units, the reading of five Greek myths furthers students' understanding of mythic thought and patterns, and "The Merry Adventure of Robin Hood" prepares children for a later study of epic form. The relationship between subject matter and theme is seen in "King of the Wind" and "The Island of the Blue Dolphins." "Chil- dren of the Covered Wagon" and "This Dear Bought Land" enhance children's awareness of their historical heritage. In addition, "Dr. George Washington Carver, Scientist" is read to study a literary type and to enable students to assess the personal qualities of a character in literature. (JB) A Curriculum for English, Grade 6, Units 58-70. 244 pp. (ED 013 811: EDRS Price: MF- $0.65 HC- not available from EDRS). Grade-six units of the Nebraska English curriculum culminate the elements of all previous units and point toward a more analytical study of literature. "The Seven Voyages of Sinbad" is used to review the folktale "Pseudo-Genre." Lewis Carroll's "Alice" stories and "A Wrinkle in Time" illustrate the fanciful tale at its best. "Big Red" completes the units on animal stories, and "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" intro-</page><page sequence="9">1032 Elementary English duces the basic novel form. A study of norse myths reiterates devices used in myths and presents the first serious study of mythology as literature. "The Hobbit," with Tolkien's use of mythic characters and conceptions, illustrates many levels of symbolic meaning. "The Wind in the Willows/' an epic fable, introduces a satiric, humorous, and allegor- ical representation of society. The stories of King Arthur and Ulysses, built around a single hero, point to the place of the hero in the epic form. Cultures outside the chil- dren's experience are seen in "The Secret of the Andes" and "Hans Brinker." A biogra- phy, "Cartier Sails the St. Lawrence," en- hances both literature and history through its inclusion of excerpts from logbooks. The final unit, on the poems of Robert Frost, demonstrates some of the basic tools neces- sary for the reading and understanding of poetry. (JB)</page></plain_text>
