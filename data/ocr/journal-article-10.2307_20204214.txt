All rights reserved SUBJECT REVIEWS (* denotes that a book is specially recommended for school libraries.) Greek Literature Since I've sometimes been disparaging about handbooks, companions, and guides, it is only fair to acknowledge that Kathryn Gutzwiller's 'introduction to the literature of the Hellenistic age for students of classics and for general readers with an interest in the ancient world' (xi) is exceptionally good.1 Informative chapters on Hellenistic history and culture, and aesthetics and style, precede the longest chapter, which surveys the field by author and genre. The final chapter has a thematic structure: learning and innovation; book culture and performance; social and political back ground; the critical impulse in literature and art; and Roman reception. Gutzwiller covers a lot of ground in not very much space, without the exposition ever appearing either skimpy or cramped, and gives a good sense of the breadth and diversity of Hellenistic literature (not just poetry), along with a basic understanding of the histor ical, social, and cultural context. This is a model of the genre. Mark Payne2 acknowledges that 'formalist' criticism has served Hellenistic poetry well, but aims to transcend it by providing 'a detailed account of the kinds of world-making' found in Theocritus' bucolic poetry (9). Though his detailed observations left me with a deeper appreciation of the variety and subtlety of the poet's fictional techniques, the title's 'invention of fiction' makes a stronger claim for Theocritus than fictional invention. The thesis that his bucolic world was 'the first fully fictional world in Western literature' (1) is not sustained, and depends on a distinction between 'mimetic' and 'fully fictional' fictions that is not clearly articulated, and will not (I suspect) prove sufficiently stable to bear the weight placed on it. There is more solidity in Andrew Morrison's fine study of the 'primary narrator' in archaic and Hellenistic poetry,3 which demonstrates sustained and sophisticated engagement on the part of Callimachus, Theocritus, and Apollonius with a wide range of archaic poetry (choral lyric, monody, iambus, and elegy, as well as Homer and Hesiod). In their use of a variety of narrative techniques ('quasi-biography, the development of consistent narratorial personas across an author's corpus, the relationship of such a narratorial persona to the historical author's biography, the creation of an impression of extempore composition by the narrator, the depiction of the narrator's relationship with the Muses, and . . . the use of emotional and evaluative language by the primary narrator' [36]), the archaic poets provided a 'pattern book' for the construction of narratives and narrators (14), on which their successors drew. The discussion of Callimachus (focusing on the Hymns, Aetia, and Iambi) is the longest and richest chapter, fully justifying Morrison's insistence that 'Callimachean aesthetics ... are 1 A Guide to Hellenistic Literature.

'The fact that the Muses claim for themselves the ability to speak falsely as well as truly is clearly not a destabilising of Hesiod's own narratorial authority . . .' (76): how could it not be? On the other hand, the reading of the Argonautica as telling a story about 'an evolving "crisis" of the narrator' (272; the narrator is not, of course, Apollonius), in which 'the narrator is progressively losing confidence in his own ability to tell his story' (297), came to seem disconcertingly plausible. David Fearn4 examines Bacchylides' engagement with the poetic tradition, and with the cities and individuals who commissioned the poems. His discussions of Bacchylides 13 and 15 are lengthy, subtle, luxuriantly footnoted, and undeniably rewarding. His reassessment of the relationship between kuklioi khoroi and (not exclusively Dionysiac) dithyramb is also important, if not entirely accessible: here, as elsewhere, many readers will wish that he had provided an orderly intro duction to the issues, and been less allusive in his treatment of the secondary literature. Consideration of the performance contexts of kuklioi khoroi introduces an attempt to understand the Panathenaea as an ideologically significant civic event. The case, though unavoidably speculative, is also suggestive; the reminder that we should not exaggerate the uniqueness of the City Dionysia is certainly salutary. But there is also much to argue with. Assembling complex patchworks of connections to particular passages in Homer and the tiny proportion of archaic poetry that has fortu itously survived does not strike me as the most fruitful or plausible way of approaching Bacchylides' allusiveness. Claims about what a text makes 'us' do (130, 274, 277) disguise normative recommendations as descriptive reports: 'immediately we are struck' (283) - are we? all of us? (Who are 'we'?) The implication that a certain reading is automatic and universal sits uneasily beside Fearn's demonstration of the ways in which different contexts of reception may open up diverse readings. Fearn confuses intentionalist with biographical readings (3 f.); despite his scepticism, he displays a hyperintentionalist readiness to make statements about the contents of Bacchylides' consciousness (122). I do not believe that Greek poetry is so obsessed with 'authority' and 'authorisation' as to warrant twenty-seven occurrences of these words in twelve pages (5-16). WTiat evidence is there that the co-existence of multiple inconsistent variants was felt to be 'problematic' (15)? Didn't it provide poets with rich opportunities for creative re-appropriation? Such opportunities are central to Barbara Kowalzig's dense study of archaic and early classical song-culture.5 She is concerned both with the malleability of myth, ritual, and religious song and with their 'social efficacy'. In particular, aetiology expressed in ritual choral performance is identified as 'central to an incessant process of forging and re-forging religious communities': aetiology is the 'primary form through which myth plays a function in ritual, and thence in society' (8, cf. 393). An incisive general discussion of myth, aetiology, ritual, and performance introduces a series of detailed and thoroughly documented case studies: D?los, Argos, Aegina, Rhodes, Southern Italy, Boeotia. Kowalzig begins with a relatively cautious claim: 'myth and ritual could work as 4 Bacchylides. Politics, Performance, Poetic Tradition. By David Fearn. Oxford Classical Mono graphs.

Few would say that myth and ritual cannot do this work, or that they are wholly unrelated to historical processes. Something far more contentious is on offer when myth is used as a source for speculative reconstructions of Aeginetan economic history (210-13), or the sixth-century history of Delphi (195-201). In the latter case, it is extravagant to say that the texts make it 'overwhelmingly clear' (199) what Neoptolemus' 'real motivations' in going to Delphi were; it is not even clear what 'real' could mean in that context. There is a difficult problem here: even if Kowalzig's reconstructions identify genuine correlations between song and historical process, how would we establish the direction of influence to show that myth and song were socially efficacious, and not (say) retrospective articulations of rather political change? The stronger claims to centrality and primacy are even harder to verify. Moreover, though Kowalzig sometimes treats ritual song's effects as aspirational (38), not neces sarily successful (388), they are more often presented as inexorable: 'you cannot argue with a song' is a recurrent claim (50, 117, 188, 357). That is nonsense: myth, ritual, and song can be resisted, subverted, ignored, or simply routinized into insignif icance. I was left doubting whether the gap between interpretation of ideological content and demonstration of historical effect had in fact been bridged. But even if it hasn't, this book is an impressive achievement. Ismene Lada-Richards assures us that her treatment of Lucian and pantomime dancing6 'has placed the genre and the artist back onto the map of the imperial and later antique world as powerful and central elements of the political, social, intellectual and symbolic orders' (162). Here, too, the claim to centrality goes beyond the evidence: the book's informative and well-documented treatment of detail (which makes it genuinely valuable) is strikingly at odds with its unsubstantiated confidence concerning pantomime's wider signifi cance. A style that abounds in superfluous qualifiers stokes the pervasive hyperbole: infinitely, supremely, inexhaustible, ever-dreaded, etc. Insights are 'invaluable' (20, 29, cf. 31) or 'unparalleled' (21); information comes in 'precious pieces' (24). The loose writing can be deeply puzzling: no matter how fervent is our wish to uncover the 'real' pantomime underneath the many layers of appropriation and concomitant distortion, we shall always stumble on a hard and stubborn inner core which cannot be peeled away, because it is part and parcel of pantomime's very essence (77) - come again? However much we want to find the 'real' pantomime, we shall always find pantomime's very essence? Certain traditions of practice existed in a diverse social-cultural milieu, and elicited diverse responses; essences, intrinsic powers, and an 'inherent doubleness' are not needed to account for this. I wonder, finally, whether an opportunity for illuminating use of comparative evidence has not been missed. Noh and Kathakali receive fleeting references (48, 184, 186). But the Kathak dance tradition seems a more apposite model: it certainly puts a question mark by the 'even' in 'we even hear of the dancer's meaningful use of his eyes' (44).

The framing sections and linking dialogue get limited attention: the book 'does not claim to offer a general or well-rounded account of the text as a whole' (1). Rather, we have an exhaustive survey of analogues to Lucian's tales, addressing two reciprocally related questions: what does an understanding of the traditional form (or forms) of the tales with which Lucian works tell us of his art and the strategies with which he has manipulated his material? And what does an understanding of Lucian's art, the stock-in-trade of recurring themes and the portfolio of agendas on display in his wider oeuvre, allow us to know (by a sort of subtraction) of the traditional form or forms of the takes with which he works? (1) Some under-motivated speculations (most notably the suggestion that the statue of Pellichus is priapic [148-52]) weakened my willingness to trust Ogden's expert judgement when the analogues did not look much like the targets - as often happens in studies of 'story types'. Given the fluidity with which informal tales are treated in casual conversation, I wonder whether trying to relate Lucian's work to existing tradi tions on the basis of scattered, and sometimes not very similar, extant written analogues is entirely realistic. Two books on word order in tragic dialogue take very different approaches. Helma Dik8 is concerned with questions of pragmatics: the communicative structure of sentences, and the flow of information (2). She is herself a marvellous communicator, explaining technical concepts from Functional Linguistics with great clarity, and allowing the reader to 'bathe' (30) in lucidly analysed examples. Her qualitative approach is, inevitably, more accessible than the quantitative methodology of Nicholas Baechle's study of the metrical constraints of the iambic trimeter on the placement of words:9 statistical tables rarely fire the imagi nation. A focus on linguistic resources for communicating meaning is in any case likely to be more rewarding than a focus on constraints. Tragedians dissatisfied with a constrained word order were always free to try a different approach; if they did not, the order must have been acceptable. Since the effect that Baechle finds is quantita tively slight, the poets were either rarely constrained or often sought out alternatives when a constraint appeared. These comments are not meant to be dismissive of Baechle's work (Dik is respectful: 88 f., 121 f.); but it will inevitably appeal to a limited and highly specialist readership. Dik can (and should) be read by anyone who wishes to deepen their appreciation of tragic dialogue. David Carter provides a very successful introduction to politics in Greek tragedy.10 After briefly outlining some key issues, he surveys a selection of contrasting approaches to the 'political' dimension of tragedy in recent scholarship (Podlecki, Macleod, Goldhill, Griffith, Seaford, Hall), commenting on their respective advantages and disadvantages. After presenting his own 'working definition', he discusses Ajax, Antigone, Euripides' Suppliants, and Trojan Women. A final chapter looks at political reception of tragedy (note, not the reception of political tragedy), with particular reference to Antigone and Trojan Women. Carter begins by contrasting weaker and stronger senses of 'political' 8 Word Order in Greek Tragic Dialogue. By Helma Dik. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2007. Pp. xvi + 281.

In fact, the weaker sense is utterly feeble, the stronger pretty weak: 'drama that is meant to have a political function in society' is glossed by 'tragedy could engage with contemporary issues and (occasionally) events' and 'the festival . . . can be considered as a political organ, allowing the audience to reflect'. But a single example (say, Eumenides) suffices to establish the possibility of 'engagement' (a usefully vague word); and would anyone claim that tragedy prevents reflection? Adapting Macleod's formula, Carter defines 'political' as 'a concern with human beings as part of the community of the polis9 (6). This is capacious enough not to evoke strenuous dissent (although Ajax is not a perfect fit [91 f.]), and its capaciousness complements Carter's sustained emphasis on the diverse ways in which different plays are political - which I applaud, along with his focus on the city-state in general, not exclusively on democratic Athens. But though he defines the political in 'political function', the concept of political function is left unexamined; as I've recently argued elsewhere, that's not straight forward. Isabelle Torrance's introduction to Seven Against Thebes11 is a more qualified success. It follows the usual format of the Duckworth series: an outline of play and trilogy, and a survey of reception ('legacy'), frame thematic chapters: city and family; divine forces and religious ritual; warriors; women. But reference to secondary literature tends to be superficial: an airy 'it has been suggested . . .', with no indication of the basis of the suggestion or the nature of the argument, does not give the target audience useful tools with which to think. The treatment of problematic issues (such as the relationship between divine and human agency) is often not deep enough to give the beginner an insight into the nature of the problem. By contrast, elementary points (for example, that invoking Ares and Enyo is 'milita ristic', and that the Seven are a serious military threat [49]) are unnecessarily laboured. The interpretation sometimes needed a little more thought. Treating parthenoi engaged in self-initiated panic with mature women acting on the instigation of the army's senior commander in Iliad 6 is surely misleading (97). And if you say 'like Peter, who denied Christ three times, Laius had defied Apollo three times' (56), can you also say 'no blame can be attributed to Laius for returning to the oracle three times' (60)? In her Further Reading (150), Torrance looks forward to N. J. Sewell-Rutter's then forthcoming discussion of issues of inherited guilt, curses, and divine causation. Guilt by Descent12 has now come forth, and is deeply unsatisfactory. That is partly because of the style: verbose (it takes 205 words to say that it is useful to compare decisions in different Aeschylean plays, whether or not Aeschylus' audiences did so [162 f.]), mannered ('the peculiar quiddity of this inescapably absorbing genre' [xi]), and fond of clich? ('crime begets crime' [30]; 'the mortal of tragedy is no puppet of the gods' [175]). But that could be endured if the substance was better. Sewell-Rutter makes much of the fact that scholars who use 'curse' in a broad (though in English entirely idiomatic) sense risk falling into equivocation, and postulating unnecessary curse-events (66). Yet he does not deny that trans generational misfortune in tragedy sometimes results from a curse in the narrow sense. Instead, when an ancestral curse has to be acknowledged, the question changes: 11 Aeschylus. Seven Against Thebes. By Isabelle Torrance. Duckworth Companions to Greek and Roman Tragedy.

Obviously, if there are many strands, every strand is one of many. The discussion of Antigone begins by denying that the play relies on a curse, or taint of inherited guilt, 'in any significant sense' (115), and ends by denying that inherited guilt or some curse is 'the crucial fact' (119, my emphasis): note the slippage. Note, too, the tendentious treatment of textual evidence: 'a brief allusion, accounting for some dozen lines' (119). Playing an explanatory role in the plot does not entail being the focus of attention in the play; and genuinely brief allusions will suffice to bring background factors to an alert and knowledgeable audience's attention. Here, and in the treatment of the end of Electra, Sophocles' subtle allusiveness is underestimated. Correcting that misjudgement will require some adjustment to the characterization of the distinctiveness of Sophocles' treatment of transgenerational misfortune ('in Sophocles . . . the sorrows of the house and its manifold corruptions tend to irrupt into consciousness, becoming known or realized, rather than working through the medium of Erinyes and curses in the Aeschylean or Euripidean fashion' [173]). 'The long and countless course of Time/Revealing what is hidden, then shrouding what appears' - SPLAT! Encoun tering a full-stop there was like walking into a glass door (Ajax 646-7). Peter Meineck's rendering of Ajax and Philoctetes is occasionally marred by its disdain for syntax and excessive compression. By contrast, Paul Wooodruff's Women of Trachis and Electra are occasionally verbose.13 Far more often, this sequel to the same pair's well-received translation of the Theban plays hits an appropriate mean - in spoken dialogue, at least. They are less successful in finding a distinctive voice for lyric, and can be clumsily prosaic ('Unless I have totally lost my mind' [Electra 472]). Lyric is signalled only by labels ('strophe', etc.), recitative not at all. But, on balance, this is a text that I could happily adopt for teaching. Its claims are reinforced by a favourable price and generous notes. The opening of Diane Arnson Svarlien's Medea14 reveals a translator who can write with genuine distinction, in proper sentences, with a rare sense of rhythm: I wish the Argo never had set sail, had never flown to Colchis through the dark Clashing Rocks; I wish the pines had never been felled along the hollows on the slopes of Pelion, to fit their hands with oars? those heroes who went off to seek the gold pelt for Pelias. (Med. 1-6) Yet she, too, fails to find a distinctive lyric voice. Recitative is certainly distinctive, but the rhythmical effect is unhappy: 'You wouldn't go wrong, you'd be right on the mark / if you called them all half-wits, the people of old' (Med. 190-1). Even in spoken dialogue, I sometimes tripped over a jarring choice of word: 'I hope old Pittheus is safe from harm? / not done in by some freshly sprung disaster.' That's Hippolytus 794 - or 883 f., according to the marginal line numbers. Why do translators persist in 13 Sophocles. Four Tragedies.

Simon GoldhilPs How to Stage Greek Tragedy Today15 sometimes lapses into statements of the obvious, sometimes into statements of the far from obvious - can you see the merits of putting Sophocles' Electra in a petri dish (37)? Perhaps you needed to have been there. But given the challenging task that Goldhill has set himself, it is the rarity of such lapses that surprises. He tackles six key difficulties facing modern productions of Greek tragedy: theatrical space; the chorus; the actor's role; politics; translation; figures (heroic and divine) from myth. Each chapter prefaces a review of salient features of tragedy in its classical context to accounts of how selected modern productions have tackled the difficulties, success fully or unsuccessfully, and a deliberately open-ended discussion of how it should be done, 'not laying down the law' (2) but exhibiting possibilities and exploring issues. Petri dishes were not alone in making me wonder about the boundary between staging and travesty. If asked to name a tragedy portraying the victims of attack by an overwhelming superpower, one perhaps might think of Trojan Women (though Troy wasn't a pushover) - but Persians (133)? 'Tragedy is not a good place to be a woman' (148): being a man in tragedy isn't exactly a bundle of fun, either. When it comes to giving people a bad time, tragedy is an Equal Opportunities genre. Goldhill consider ately explains obscure allusions, as in 'Bradford, an industrial town in the north' (12).

The practice in this volume is exem plary; there are five indexes, covering: the life and works of Marcus Tullius Cicero; personal names; main passages discussed; Latin and Greek terms; and subjects. A reader who wishes to know whether a particular issue is discussed in this volume should, with the aid of these indexes, have no problem. There follow two collections of essays on Lucretius, one from Oxford and one from Cambridge.

The difference here is that all the contributions, apart from the seventeen-page introduction by the editor, have been published before.

After an introduction by the joint editors, Stuart Gillespie and Philip Hardie, the collection falls into three parts entitled 'Antiquity', 'Themes', and 'Reception'. Under 'Antiquity' we find 'Lucretius and Greek Philosophy' by James Warren; 'Lucretius and the Herculaneum Library' by Dirk Obink; 'Lucretius and Roman Politics and History' by Alessandro Schiesaro; 'Lucretius and Previous Poetic Traditions' by Monica Gale; 'Lucretian Architecture: The Structure and Argument of the De rerum natura" by Joseph Farrell; 'Lucretian Texture: Style, Metre and Rhetoric in the De rerum natura' by E. J. Kenney; and 'Lucretius and Later Latin Literature in Antiquity' by Philip Hardie. Under 'Themes' we find 'Lucretius and the History of Science' by Monte Johnson and Catherine Wilson; 'Moral and Political Philosophy: Readings of Lucretius from Virgil to Voltaire' by Reid Barbour; 'Lucretius and the Sublime' by James I. Porter; and 'Religion and Enlightenment in the Neo-Latin Reception of Lucretius' by Yasmin Haskell. Under 'Reception' we find 'Lucretius in the Middle Ages and Early Renaissance: Transmission and Scholarship' by Michael Reeve; 'Lucretius in the Italian Renaissance' by Valentina Prosperi; 'Lucretius in Early Modern France' by Philip Ford; 'Lucretius in the English Renaissance' by Stuart Gillespie; 'The English Voices of Lucretius from Lucy Hutchinson to John Mason Good' by David Hopkins; 'Lucretius in the European Enlightenment' by Eric Baker; 'Lucretius in Romantic and Victorian Britain' by Martin Priestman; and 'Lucretius and the Moderns' by Stuart Gillespie and Donald Mackenzie. There are three indexes: one of 'Works Cited', one of 'Main Lucretian Passages Discussed', and one 'General Index'. Julia Gaisser's Catullus1 is another collection in the Oxford Readings in Classical Studies series, very similar to the Lucretius collection discussed above. Here, all the contributions are from the second half of the twentieth century, apart from three fascinating examples of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century scholarship. The twenty-eight essays are subdivided into eight topics: Part I: Catullus and his Books: 1. 'Catullus, c. 1' by Frank Copley (1951); 2. 'Catullus 116' by C. W Macleod (1973); 3.

A Textual Reappraisal,8 John Trappes-Lomax, familiar to many for his textual notes elsewhere, proposes a truly radical approach to the text of Catullus. His roughly 600 suggestions fall into a number of categories: he restores many cases of republican orthography that he believes have been lost through Augustan or later 'correction'; he draws attention to the fact that m, in, ni, u etc. can be difficult to interpret correctly in a Carolingian script; and he argues strongly that the text has suffered interpolation both in ancient times and later. These interpolations are sometimes whole lines (where the interpolator thinks that it is possible to improve the text) and sometimes of single words, where the interpolator is correct in thinking that an interpolation is required, but chooses badly. Most of the suggestions are not new, which Trappes-Lomax scrupulously acknowledges; what makes this work truly novel is that all the sugges tions are assembled and defended according to a coherent understanding of how the text has been treated by its enthusiastic but incompetent admirers. The book is very easy to use: it proceeds through the text in the canonical order. Each passage to be corrected is printed according to Mynors' OCT; there then follows the discussion followed by a repeat of the passage in Trappes-Lomax's version. John Briscoe's magisterial commentary9 on Livy 38-40 follows naturally from his commentaries on books 31-3 (1973) and 34-7 (1981). As is well known, and as his preface confirms 8 Catullus.

But it seems very likely that it is for these commentaries that he will always be best known. Few ancient authors have been served as well as Livy has by S. P. Oakley and Briscoe. Readers who work on Livy will require nothing more than to know that the book has appeared; readers unfamiliar with Livy may still find the commentaries useful, especially if they contain, as this one does, extensive indexes. The preface of Stephen Heyworth's OCT10 begins uncontroversially: 'The text of Propertius is one of the worst transmitted of the classical Latin authors' (vii). He then proceeds to demonstrate the fact by means of sixty-one pages devoted only to describing the manuscripts and their relationship to one another. The text is provided with an apparatus much fuller than is normally permitted to OCT editors, but sparser than, in all the circumstances, a reader might well require. And so Heyworth has provided us with Cynthia,11 a much larger book, whose preface begins: This book is in the first place an attempt to explain and justify the text of Propertius published in the Oxford Classical Texts series. But no text is definitive, and a second purpose is as impor tant to contribute to the debates . . . about the lacunae in the text and the divisions between poems, about the correct readings and the meaning and significance of each couplet, about the poet's style . . . The commentary is primarily textual; it does not venture into more literary aspects of interpretation except when they seemed to me to bear on textual issues, (vii) These words describe the commentary perfectly; from now on it will be impossible to say anything about Propertius without first consulting Heyworth. In The Other Virgil,12 Craig Kallendorf shows how much older is the conflict between those who see the Aeneid as an optimistic celebration of Rome's greatness and those who find it a pessimistic critique of Augustan pretensions than is normally supposed. The writer roams with confidence and great learning through much renaissance literature in a wide range of languages; he also displays a masterly account of modern scholarship. He writes clearly, revealing himself to be, if I read him right, a moderate 'pessimist'. This is a handsome book with many interesting plates. ^Patricia Johnson's Ovid Before Exile13 is a study of Ovid's creativity in a world in which the freedom to write enjoyed by Virgil, Horace, Propertius, and Tibullus was being steadily eroded until it perished in his exile. A number of myths treated in the Metamorphoses are seen, at least in part, to reflect the social and political events of the day. Each treatment is very full and reflects a determination to omit the work of no modern scholar. At the end, Ovid is seen, though exiled and with his poetry vanished from public libraries in Rome, to be confident, and rightly confident, that his Metamorphoses would survive. Interesting evidence is presented to support Ovid's claim. John Davie has a distinguished record as a translator of the classics, notably of Euripides. His admirers 10 Sexti Properti Elegi.

There is also a very full introduction and copious notes by Tobias Reinhardt. The book will prove to be an excellent introduction to Seneca. Christoph Kugel meier's major work on Senecan Tragedy15 spends four sections on a general analysis and a fifth on how it can be applied to the eight individual tragedies; in common with many modern commentators, he omits the Hercules Oetaeus and the Octavia. In the space allowed for this review it would be impossible to do justice to Randall Ganiban's Statius and Virgil.16 Just as Virgilian scholars have, in recent years, been divided between those who take a 'pessimistic' view of the Aeneid and those who take an 'optimistic' one, so has Statian scholarship been divided between those who see in the Thebaid a wholly bleak view of the human condition and those who see redemp tion at the end of the epic and hints of redemption elsewhere. Ganiban discusses both epics from this point of view but with a predominant emphasis on the Thebaid. A glance at his index locorum reveals that Ganiban is not one who attempts to win the day by selective quotation: hardly a line is ignored. No serious study of the Thebaid can afford to ignore this work. Most books of literary criticism are ephemeral; commentaries, if they are sound, live on. Rhiannon Ash's edition of Tacitus Histories 217 will surely endure, partly, of course, because of the appeal of Tacitus himself, but significantly because of the thoroughness and clarity of Ash's commentary. After 36 pages of introduction, we are given another 36 pages of text followed by 309 pages of commentary and 17 pages of 'select' bibliography, 10 pages of a general index and a seven-page index of Latin words discussed. This is indeed a monumental work, whose worth it will take time fully to appreciate. The difficulties of translating Apuleius18 are notorious; the risk is that an accurate translation of the meaning can conceal the real character of the work, which relies on all sorts of linguistic tricks to amaze and amuse the reader.

The translation certainly reads well; readers must judge for themselves how far Apuleius' linguistic tricks survive in Relihan's version. Ruth Morello and A. D.

John Henderson has produced an idiosyncratic edition of the Etymologies of Isidore of Seville,20 the sixth- to seventh-century encyclopaedist who had such a profound influence on mediaeval scholarship. Henderson's technique is to present a (usually brief) passage, translate it, and then write a note on it in the style that he has made his own. He does, however, display much more sympathy with Isidore than is shown by Lindsay, the editor of the 1911 OCT Needless to say, no one would embark on a project like this without the support of very considerable learning. Despite his protes tations to the contrary, Henderson shows himself to be well equipped for the task he has set himself. Classical Latin appears to be without regional dialects, yet Latin evolved in little more than a millennium into a variety of different languages (the Romance languages: Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese etc.) .Was regional diversity apparent from the earliest times, obscured perhaps by the standardisation of writing, or did some catastrophic event in late antiquity cause the language to vary? . . . This book establishes that Latin was never geographically uniform. The changing patterns of diversity and the determinants of variation are examined from the time of the early inscriptions of Italy, through to late antiquity and the beginnings of the Romance dialects in the western Roman provinces. These are the questions and answers addressed with his formidable erudition by Adams in his The Regional Diversification of Latin.21 After a general introduction, he discusses first republican inscriptions followed by a range of classical authors, after which he treats Spain, Italy, Africa, and Britain. But this is the merest skeleton of this book; to see the full flesh the reader must set aside many hours to appreciate and do justice to this wide-ranging work. doi:10.1017/S0017383508000582 D. E.

At the end of term, students were faced with such examination questions as 'How much corn did the Athenians annually import from the Euxine?' and 'WTiat calculations have been in part founded on this passage as to the population of ancient Attica?' The study of this text was topical, as it coincided with British involvement in the Crimean war. At the time of writing (April 2008), the American President's visit to Kiev is indicative of the revival of Western interest in this part of the world. A parallel scholarly development is suggested in Moreno's book on the Athenian grain supply, which shows the fruitfulness of looking beyond the Mediterranean basin and towards the Black Sea area when writing Athenian history.1 Moreno concludes that, in the fourth century bc, Athenian aristocrats, posing as democrats, promoted the royal economy of the Spartocid dynasty in order to secure the passage of their grain to Athens. Moreno makes a clear case for the reliance of the Athenians on imported grain in the fifth and fourth centuries BC. Some of the analyses are controversial, in particular those which are based on notions such as self-sufficiency (see Foxhall below), carrying capacity, and the portrayal of Athens as a consumer city (a concept problematized by Vlassopoulos [see below]). Contentious also is the interpretation of some archaeological evidence (such as that at Agios Vasileios on the north-east coast of Euboea [131]), the portrayal of an elite-controlled Athenian democracy, and the sweeping use of the term 'demagogue'. Nevertheless, this is a highly stimulating for mulation of an old question. Challenging the scholarly tendency to pronounce the eclipse of the polis in this period, Graham Oliver2 shows how the Athenians confronted the challenges of an era in which the fragile commercial relations of the fourth century had been destabilized, in which the Athenians struggled to maintain control of the Piraeus (and periodically their own countryside), and in which the population fell in many parts of Attica. Oliver demonstrates how the Athenians developed a military strategy and command structure that protected areas of Attica (in particular Rhamnous, Eleusis, Vouliagmeni, and the area around Porto Raphti) that were important in the exploitation of the Attic countryside. Against the old belief that Hellenistic warfare was dominated by mercenaries, Oliver demonstrates the reliance of the Hellenistic polis on its citizens' performance of military obligations. He shows how the civic institutions of the polis both encouraged the residents of Attica to contribute to the security of the city and negotiated with overseas donors in order to guarantee the food supply: Athens' interaction with the rest of the Mediterranean is attested in the epigraphic evidence for honorific decrees. Oliver's reading of ancient economics highlights the role of state interventionism. The book shines light on important but obscure institutions: the discussion of Athenian sitonai is the most detailed in any language. It also demonstrates the close correlation between the history of economies and that of political and military events. Oliver's book is one that presents itself as 'bottom-up' history, which starts with the perspective of those 'rela tively unknown people who worked the land' (5), and achieves this through a detailed 1 Feeding the Democracy.

Eidinow's is another book that successfully pursues history from below.3 Focussing on the question tablets directed at the oracle at Dodona and curse tablets deposited in wells, graves, or rubbish-pits across the Greek world, she demonstrates the ways in which divination and cursing served as tools for risk management: oracles, she suggests, were used by uncertain individuals who sought assurance that they were making the right choice; curses were used by those who were in a dangerous situation or position of conflict as a way of reducing the powers of their enemies. We are drawn away from the scholarly focus on the role of the Delphic oracle as a device for collective decision-making or justifying state-sanctioned decisions. Eidinow, deploying laconic and fragmentary material with skill, emphasizes personal (as opposed to collective) aspirations: the ways in which individuals dealt with the risks and uncertainties of health, business, love, travel, and rivalries of all kinds (especially choregic [Chapter 8] and litigious [Chapter 9]) demonstrate Eidinow's wider point. But the evidence for binding curses reminds us that high politics permeated every form of discourse in ancient Athens: her catalogue of curse tablets includes one curse directed against Demetrius of Phaleron, leader of Athens 317-307 (SGD 14, p. 408) and another which may be Lycurgus of Athens (NGCT 5, p. 438). Harding's The Story of Athens* trans lates, in one affordable volume, the complete fragments of the Atthidographers. The introduction is extremely useful, and presents Harding's own view of the Atthidographers as chroniclers whose accounts reflected not just the communal memory of the different communities that populated Attica. His Atthidographers made use of archaeological remains in their reconstructions of the past and, against Jacoby's interpretation, deployed documentary evidence with increasing sophisti cation. An underlying theme of this publication is that Atthidography, which started in the fifth century BC, with Hellanikos of Lesbos, as a study of mythography, chronography, and ethnography, developed into contemporary historiography in the hands of fourth- and third-century practitioners such as Androtion and Philochorus. Harding wants his readers to appreciate the extent to which the Atthidographers worked upon specific themes: this position informs the arrangement of material, which is ordered according to personality (e.g. Kekrops and Theseus) or topic (the Areopagus, the Persian Wars). This makes the volume particularly useful (and some times revealing) as a tool for investigating different traditions or historical events. The ordering of the material makes the shape of the publication distinct from Jacoby's author-by-author presentation in FGrH (which is followed by Brill's New Jacoby, which will offer, in both print and electronic form, translations and new commen taries on all the authors in FGrH). While the Athenian polis is at the heart of the Atthidographers' view of history (and also of that of Oliver and Moreno), the central concern of Vlassopoulos' monograph is to think beyond the polis.5 He challenges the orthodoxy that privileges the city-state as the most important form of 3 Oracles, Curses, and Risk among the Ancient Greeks.

Vlassopoulos shows that modern scholars have used the notion of the polis as a way of understanding Greek history that made it reproduce the narrative of the nation state. This point leads him to highlight the limits to ?o//s-bounded approaches to history (the notion of the consumer city is neatly problematized in Chapter 5). Vlassopoulos offers a novel interpretation of Aristotle's concept of the polis, reading it not as a 'bounded entity', but rather as 'the agglomer ation of a variety of associations and relationships' (96). Such associations have varying aims and configurations that might not coincide with those of the polis: the upshot of this is to make the polis seem less of an independent and self-sufficient entity than modern scholarship widely assumes. His concluding proposal, that ancient methods of reconstructing the past (Aristotelian analyses of political philosophy, the travel narrative, and invented dialogue) can still offer value to modern analyses of the Mediterranean world-system, suggests wider implications not just for the writing of history but also for the meta-disciplines of historiography and the history of schol arship. P?barthe's monograph6 reassesses the relationship between Athenian political culture and the public uses of writing in ancient Athens. Setting aside the question about the links between democratic ideology and the public use of writing, P?barthe demonstrates the great extent to which the inhabitants of Attica would have been exposed to writing. Engagement with written documents would not have been restricted to those involved with the politics, jurisdiction, and central administration of the city but extended also to those involved in the administration of demes, temples, and phratries, and those who used written communication in private or commercial contexts. He suggests that Harris' estimate of 5-10 per cent literacy is an underestimate of the true engagement with writing: he argues that not only literates but also those with a more rudimentary understanding of writing would have dealt with written documents. P?barthe shows how writing was central to the functioning of both domestic political activity and also Athens' relations (hegemonic and otherwise) with other states. The lack of thorough engagement with the commemo rative and dedicatory deployment of writing means that this is not a comprehensive study of the phenomenon, but anyone interested in literacy or the use of writing will need to take into consideration P?barthe's take on the subject alongside the works of Harris, Thomas, and Sickinger. Sommerstein and Fletcher's Horkos1 is the first volume deriving from a Leverhulme-funded project, which began in 2004, on the oath in the archaic and classical Greek world. The significance of the oath, a ritually reinforced declaration (2), is manifest to any reader of Greek literary or epigraphical texts: even Thucydides, who does his best to take religion out of history, refers to them 269 times. The project is lending a long-overdue focus to the subject: it has already produced an open-access, online, fully searchable database of oaths;8 a two-volume monograph, which will be a comprehensive study of the phenomenon, is in preparation. The present publication derives from a conference and contains seventeen papers exploring the nature and function of oaths in Greek society, a set of case studies exemplifying historical or literary moments when oaths are the centre of attention, and the connections between phenomena related to Greek oaths and those 6 Cit?, d?mocratie et ?criture.

Some important distinctions are drawn, such as the division between assertory and promissory contexts; the differences between religious, rhetorical, informal, regular, and specific oaths are made clear. The picture that emerges is that oaths were import ant in political life (Rhodes, Shear, Wareh), international relations (Bolmarcich), cultural activities (Perry), and the law courts, where they could be used to reinforce claim rights (Carter) or to settle disputes (Carawan). But at the same time, we are led to see that, when it was convenient, the Greeks were able to manipulate them either by using them to make moral points, in the construction of literary tropes (Fletcher, Allan, Sommerstein, Garani), or even by ignoring them (Hornblower, Wareh, Perry). Kinzl's Companion on the Greek world in the classical period is a work of unrivalled geographical and conceptual scope.9 The papers are up to date, with excellent bibliographies, and will be of use to students and professionals. The opening essay traces the origins of the notion of a 'classical' epoch and makes a case for its coherence and usefulness. Three essays on the sources treat literary, epigraphical, and archaeological evidence with balance. Next follow seven studies of the Greek world according to area: Brock's essay on the relations between Sparta, Athens, and the wider Greek world and Brodersen's analysis of 'third Greece' are followed by papers on areas often thought of as the peripheries of the Greek world: Archibald's contri bution on the Balkan peninsula is a novel way of introducing Macedonia to the history of Greece. The next twelve contributions bring together expert studies of topics ranging from the natural environment to economic reality and from ethnicity to democracy. Chronological narrative is saved for the last four of the twenty-seven chapters. The volume demonstrates that Greek history consists of much more than political institutions and great power conflicts; it integrates literary and material evidence; it amounts to one of the most successful attempt at creating a non Athenocentric history of classical Greece. Moreover, the arrangement of the volume suggests an editorial decision to think of Greek history not just in terms of the chronological narrative but also in terms of spatial and thematic accounts, though the all-too-short editorial preface misses the opportunity systematically to explain this move. Foxhall provides us with one of the best recent discussions of the ancient economy.10 Her focus may be the 'place of the olive tree in the agricultural regimes and economies of classical . . . and archaic Greece' (1) but this excellent book has much more than this. Chapter 2, in particular, sets out the framework of Foxhall's understanding of the ancient economy as the economy of the household. But, as the author reassures us, this is not to subscribe to any kind of primitivist view. Rather, the economy of the household is understood as a very elaborate system of interdepen dence, risk avoidance, and profit-seeking strategies. Foxhall sees the production of wealthy households as domestic production, rather than subsistence production, mostly characterized by opportunism and flexibility and determined by the sociopolitical cultural context of the Greek polis. She makes an excellent case for mixed farming being the norm in classical Greece and shows convincingly that olive oil (but not olives) had the status of a 'semi-luxury' food, which is not what most of us would 9 A Companion to the Classical Greek World.

Her careful analysis of the relatively few archaeological remnants of olive presses from classical and early Hellenistic Greece shows that oil pressing was not undertaken on a large scale (compared to, say, Spain under the Roman Empire). But her biggest achievement is to demonstrate one way in which discussions of the 'economy' can move beyond the 'primitivist' versus 'modernist' debate, or indeed the emphasis on 'subsistence' or 'self-sufficiency', be that of the polis or the household. By examining olive production and consumption, Foxhall produces a convincing understanding of the ancient economy embedded in the mentalities and social structures of the Greek world. 'A full investigation of the "Greek custom" and all its ramifications . . . in the end would resemble something not very far from a full-scale social, cultural and political history of that loose cultural federation of politics that we call "ancient Greece'" (466). So states Davidson in his new book on Greek love;11 this may be a bold statement, but he achieves nothing less. This is a tour de force that takes us from the world of mythology and stellar constellations to the history of scholarship (and its obsession with sodomy) via Dover and Foucault, to an analysis of peculiar institutions throughout the Greek world. There are many strengths in the book: the writing style is simply delicious (Dover is the 'Grand Ayatollah' of studies on sex in ancient Greece [107]); there is meticulous and innovative interpretation of customs that had mostly evaded the attention of scholarship (e.g. the Cretan institution of abduction in Ephorus); and there is a breathtaking range of knowledge of the world beyond Athens (Sparta, Crete, Elis, Macedonia, Samos, Lesbos, to name a few). Some of the conclu sions reached may prove to be controversial, as, for example, the suggestion that there was such a thing as a syzygy, or same-sex wedding, in ancient Greece, which was formally recognized by the communities involved, or indeed that the origins of Greek homosexuality may well be discovered among the Aryans. Davidson, however, is very convincing in his arguments. And certainly, his claim that we need to move away from the modern obsession with penetration and look at homosexuality in its cultural context will be central to any future discussion on homosexuality in the ancient Greek world. Persian Responses12 throws light on the great variety of interaction between the Achaemenids and their empire. It examines the often problematic relationship between the Greeks and the Persians through the looking glass of classical Greek authors, but it also attempts to move beyond the limitations of Greek authors. WTiile inevitably many classicists will find the contributions on Thucydides' (Hyland), Xenophon's (Danzing), or Athenaeus' (Lenfant) treatment of the Achaem enids useful, more interesting conclusions are reached in the contributions that move beyond an emphasis on Greco-Persian relations. Lloyd examines Darius' building work in Egypt, while Maffre uses the example of Phrygian elite members participating in the administration of the empire as a case study of integration. Integration and acculturation is also the focus of Raimond's contribution on Lycian cults. Achaemenid use of local peoples is exemplified in the publication of a new document attesting to Babylonian workers at a royal site in Persia (Henkelman and Kleber). 11 The Greeks and Greek Love.

Lane Fox, meanwhile, attempts to dismantle Briant's argument that Alexander the Great was the 'last of the Achaemenids'. The two final contributions, on the reception of Persian ruins in European thought (Allen and Simpson), show us how fruitful discussions on the Achaemenid empire can be when integrated into the history of European schol arship. The last two decades or so have seen a proliferation of interest in Sparta. The Centre for Spartan and Peloponnesian studies in Nottingham is perhaps its most visible manifestation. Sparta and War is another stimulating volume within this trend.13 The papers focus on the impact of warfare on Spartan society, a subject which, surprisingly considering the importance of military affairs for Sparta, has not received adequate attention. There are three thematic units: war and society (Ducat, Figueira, Low, and Hodkinson), military and civic geography (Christien, Lupi) and military practice and policy (Humble, Millender, Ruz?, and Powell). Ducat demon strates that the Spartans had no consistent means with which to deal with those judged guilty of cowardice in battle, while Low, in an excellent contribution, shows how commemoration of the Spartan war dead depended on location: memorials outside Sparta were used as a basis for interstate relations; inside Sparta they consti tuted 'bottom-up' commemorations. Lupi suggests that the 'Pitanate lochos' in Herodotus was based on Sparta's three tribes. Millender offers an interesting investi gation of Sparta's use of mercenary forces, seeing them as an essential component of the Spartan empire-building. Finally, Powell provides an intriguing explanation of why Sparta did not destroy Athens at the end of the Peloponnesian war: Sparta was afraid that, by destroying Athens, the vast Athenian wealth might have ended up in the pockets of individual Spartans, harming, in this way, the ethos of the Spartan society. The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare is an impressive overview of current research into warfare and its place in the classical, Hellenistic, and early Roman world.14 This is the first volume of a two-volume series, the second of which will concentrate on warfare in the Roman Empire. Rather than providing a narrative of warfare, this excellent volume provides us with a thematic approach. The first part examines the historiography of ancient warfare, both in the modern period and also in ancient literature. The rest of the volume is divided into roughly chrono logical parts but, within these sections, we get thematic chapters: international relations, military forces, forms of battles (land and naval), warfare and the state, and war and society. This volume bridges the divide between approaches to warfare as primarily a social institution (e.g. the French structuralist view) and looking at the practicalities of warfare and the battlefield. Recent handbooks on warfare have already combined the two approaches (see, for example, Chaniotis' War in the Hellenistic World or van Wees' Greek Warfare. Myths and Realities), so, in some ways, it is hard to under stand Hanson's anxiety about the emphasis in recent scholarship on the social aspects of warfare. This is an essential work for anyone working not only on warfare but also 13 Sparta and War. Edited by Stephen Hodkinson and Anton Powell. Swansea, Classical Press of Wales, 2006. Pp. xxii + 310.

Sourcebooks: The second edition of Rhodes' Greek City States sourcebook,15 in improved format, makes available once again an extremely useful resource for the teaching of Greek history at all levels. The focus is on social and political institutions and practices of Greek city-states but there is also a chapter on federations and interstate relations. New chapters on women and children, and on economic life and religion, which reflect the broadening out of the academic approach to the city-state, widen the appeal of the book. Rhodes now accepts 420s dates for the Cleinias and Standards decrees (nos. 426-7). One merit of the book is the closing chapter on 'The Hellenistic and Roman Periods': this serves as a reminder to teachers and students using this book that the history of the polis is not completed without integrating evidence from the Hellenistic period, when cities reacted to the challenges of the era in sometimes surprising ways (Dyme, in Achaia, for instance, raised money by selling its citizenship [no. 471]). Within that section, a new heading ('Variations on a Theme') introduces readers to the practices linked to the enactment of, and procedures surrounding, decrees and includes a novel section on quorum and voting figures in cities other than Athens (nos. 513-5). It is also worth saying that, at the time of writing, this is the best collection of the disparate testimonia for Spartan politics, institutions, society, and decline (Dillon and Garland, Chapter 6 is also useful). There are highly useful indexes (of texts, names, and subjects) and the clear typographical distinction between ancient texts and Rhodes' interventions makes the book very user-friendly and a tool for all undergraduates of Greek history. Nagle and Burstein's sourcebook for Greek history16 is also very broad in its coverage, starting with Mycenaean documents and closing with Sallust's view of Roman expansion in the east. There are some strengths, such as the clarity of the maps and the successful integration of near-eastern material with more familiar Greek literary and epigraphical texts: a section on the 'international connections' of the Greek aristocracy combines Pedon's dedication at Priene, the inscription from Ramses IPs temple at Abu Simbel, and an ostrakon from the Negeb with passages from Strabo and Sappho. The book combines narrative with attention to social and cultural issues: a chapter on intellectual develop ments in the classical age provides a useful background to the history of Socrates. The commentaries are succinct and simple: it is a sourcebook aimed at the newcomer to Greek history. doi: 10.1017/S0017383508000594 CHRISTY CONSTANTAKOPOULOU and PETER LIDDEL 15 The Greek City States.

Matthew Fox's Cicero's Philosophy of History1 offers a dense, absorbing, literary read that gives access to work outside English-speaking tradition. His thesis is plain enough, and so his mission. Cicero was an Academic, a questioner who avoided presenting concrete resolutions to philosophical questions. Doctrine is the antithesis of real philosophy. Dialogue removes certainty (so with Plato), and facile identifica tions of personages as 'mouthpieces' of Cicero are ill-founded and have created a false impression of the man and diminished his contribution to philosophy; nor are the works read as literature. The last chapters (on reception, vital for Fox's praemunitio; and conclusion) have lessons for current educators. Fox brings on John Toland's read ing of Cicero, and its purpose, against the categorical condemnations of nineteenth century scholarship and contemporary re-jigging in the face of educational aims. Above all, he pleads for reading. Comments on historians who share Cicero's pervasive irony, on memoria and its true audience (in the future), and on rhetoric, especially in relation to history, are not to be missed. To do justice to the core case-study chapters that deal with De re publica. De oratore, De legibus, Brutus (Rome's history is one of rhetorical ineptitude), and De divinatione, would require re-reading (and longer reviewing), which this book will have. Confessedly provocative, it will be influ ential. Cicero was reaching manhood when the Social War broke out, and lived through the profound changes in Italy that Edward Bispham examines in From Asculum to Actium,2 comparing them with those that overtook Scotland in the late eighteenth century. An introduction discusses meanings (municepslmunicipium), methodology (broad-brush or miniaturist), and techniques, and announces a programme: 'Municipalization was a vehicle for bringing the new citizens of Italy into a Roman thought-world' (000). But the second century needs consideration first: in Chapter 1 the framework, in Chapters 2 and 3 Roman settlement and Roman-Italian relations (using pre-Social War sources; the inscriptions are central). Chapter 4 goes to the enfranchisements of the Social War, with discussion of the enabling laws, Chapter 5 to the effect on local political life as shown by the charter. What Bispham regards as the core of the book. Chapters 6-9, are devoted to the magistracy, titulature (quattuorvirate and duovirate), and what that meant, for it was 'more than an epiphenomenal development' (51). Threads are drawn together in Chapter 10, but appendices are inevitable - on double communities, on patrons and honorary magis trates, an annotated list of municipia, on the puzzling Urbs Salvia and Fulginiae - and an Addendum provides epigraphic texts. It is a plain fact that this book, for concepts and materials, is a prime resource for students of late republican Italy and its commu nities. We are still in the world of high culture with Denis Feeney's Caesar's Calendar,3 but there is a shock to confront: the changing horizons of the ancients - and seeing one's own shaken (I write not in 2008 but in '2008').

This book needs its subtitle: Feeney skilfully explains how the ancients negotiated their way, via Athens, Sicily, Rome, and Chris tianity, to world systems. He brings the chaos into elegant order by advancing chronologically through three pairs of chapters: the first on that synchronization (Greece and Rome, west and east); the second, turning the horizon through ninety degrees, on transitions from myth to history (foundations of the city, ages of gold and iron, with severe damage to a cosy concept); the third on counting and recording (years and anniversaries, the grids of the Fasti), where we reach the nitty-gritty of Roman achievement, with illuminating remarks on Augustan reconfiguration. Despite the Index Locorum, this book seems as valuable for overriding ideas as for detailed exposition: Roman culture's deep implication in the temporal and calendrical; and 'what look like dates are never just dates' (142). Tim Parkin and Arthur Pomeroy have undertaken a formidable task with their sourcebook Roman Social History4 The authors hold that Roman society is best explained in terms of its power structures; political implications are sketched in the opening remarks. To take the problems first, then the achievement, what is 'Roman', in space and time? WTio is the audience, and what help can it be given? Will it need a teacher? Is the book to be read through? WTiat limits of length must be imposed? WTiat translations used? Items come from all over the empire, including Egypt, encompassing the first two centuries of the Principate, reverting to the late Republic and occasionally moving on to the fourth century. The work grew from the authors' own teaching and, despite introductory comment, could be heavy for an unguided reader: 'legate' is not in the index, nor in a glossary. Other help is generous (bibliographical lists, life expectancy, metrology, maps - but the Danubian provinces have fallen between pages). The translations, rightly the authors' own, offer 320 items, some subdivided. If indigestible for a long read, the nine chapters are each highly nourishing for students set specifically to examine the family, poverty, slavery, the economy, and other staples. One of the contemporary disciplines applied in this book is criminology. Romans were as afraid of crime as we are but their unsystematic treatment of it, coupled with developments such as spread of citizenship, growing irrelevance of Rome, and split between honestiores and humiliores, makes it a complex subject. Jill Harries' Law and Crime in the Roman World 5 helpfully begins with a definition of 'crime' (an offence against the community); it has moved a long way from crimen. One main theme is that there is social as well as legal discourse - the subject of Chapter 1; another is that increasing harshness was due to judges and litigants out for vengeance as much as to emperors. Process comes next, the iudicium populi, quaestio, and cognitio, which also gets a chapter to itself. A chapter on 'The Thief in the Night' exposes the significant fact that iniuria took time to become a crime, compensation being replaced by revenge. The author's account of such transmogrifications over centuries is lucid, as are her discussions of repetundae and maiestas (Chapter 5 f.). There is room for discussion: Caesar's law of 59 BC has been elided, and trivialized imperial maiestas 4 Roman Social History. A Sourcebook. By Tim G. Parkin and Arthur J. Pomeroy.

The Bibliographical Essay is no substitute for notes for the novice student inquirer ('the Delphic Piracy Law' is very Delphic), but that series style detracts little from the value of this thoughtful book, which ends juicily with sex, violence, and murder. We know about crime and law, less about the places in which justice was asserted and the persons involved. Leanne Bablitz's scholarly Actors and Audience^ aims to remedy that. The author begins by defining her frame of reference: it excludes the Republic (Cicero might be anachronistic for the imperial age); it excludes cases taken outside Rome; Pliny's letters are used to elucidate the courtroom, not for a case study; activity in the senate is out because it shades into the political. Naturally, both public and private cases are in, and parties are all 'litigants'; perhaps less happily, 'judge' serves for panellists as well as magistrates. After an introduction on sources, Bablitz's first chapter deals with the location of legal activities, but the map {Blue Guide-typ?) does not mark some prime sites; the author's descriptions are good, but illustrations would help. Then come a reconstruction of the Roman courtroom (courtroom!) - assem bling graphic evidence for the arrangement and density of the Centumviral court - the litigant, the judge (index selectus gets a run), the audience, the advocate, and the advocate's role. Practical throughout, the author calculates the number of A4 sheets that an advocate might get through (she might allow for 'business'), and assesses the impact of the institution on all involved. Thoroughness and candour make this a book one is glad to have at hand. Roman fear of the East bolstered Roman aggres sion. Maurice Sartre's The Middle East under Rome1 surveys that area, from Rome's success to the fall of Palmyra. What area? The title of the book and its genesis are worth explaining. 'The Middle East' looms large to us; Sartre means, more modestly, 'Syria', another plastic concept. The map tells: from Cilicia to Nisibis, down to Dura-Europus and Aila on the Gulf of Aqaba. Larger-scale or supplementary mapping is needed to show the Jebel Druze, for example. It is a vast and diverse area, a worthy challenge to the author's learning and powers of exposition. That is met: start anywhere, you will be drawn in: the birth of Christ, the interrelationship of the languages of the region and their encounter with Greek. This volume is a version of the author's garlanded D'Alexandre ? Z?nobie,8 with the 1196 pages reduced by excerpting the 'Roman' sections and adding a new opening chapter. There will have been a change of perspective, but the translation is skilfully done.

It is an attractive volume, well illustrated. The author's profession as an Egyptologist, which gives the work an interesting slant for classicists, is prominent, and she writes with engaging energy. The price: several slips in classical matters (mangling in a list of dependant monarchs; Octavian as a good Roman husband; imperial genealogy, etc.). Helps for readers include a Who's WTio (involving some repetition), notes, bibliog raphy, and a list of cartouches (if a reader does not know Cleopatra's cartouche by the end of this work she or he needs brain-training). After introducing the princess and the queen, Tyldesley provides a tour of Alexandria. A chapter on the new Isis comes between Cleopatra's two great affairs, with Caesar and Antony; then death, children, and legend are sensibly treated. I should have liked still greater stress on the shared political needs of Cleopatra and Antony, but this is a book to keep as well as to enjoy, since teachers, students, and 'general readers' will all find it informative (though the young will be baffled by Whiston's 'criminal conversation'). Next comes volume 2 of The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare,1? which passes from late Republic to late Empire. Not just chronologically, however, though there is a chronological table. The enterprise focuses on developments over the last three decades, and its first three chapters (vol. 1) concentrate on evidence and its interpre tation; six twin chapters by distinguished contributors take up each of the two parts, early and late, of volume 2: international relations, military forces, war, battle, warfare and the state (the earlier scrutiny is significantly divided between Dominic Rathbone, on finance and supply, and Richard Alston on the military and politics); and war and society. The purpose of this is to facilitate comparisons between the two periods (no doubt the authors read each others' contributions). The illustrations are not lavish, but they bring home the impact of the army and its drama on society (though it is overdramatic to write of the 'collapse' of the Augustan military administration in AD 14); they even generate a wish for a chapter on the 'theatre' of war, down to Respighi's Pines. The maps are excellent, and there is a glossary, list of ancient authors, bibliography, and index of passages cited. To the barbarians. Roger Batty's Rome and the Nomads11 puts the latter at the centre, unlike other works on the huge area (rivalling the Mediterranean, as figure 0.1 shows). The author does not let the sources lure him into a Romano-centrist account focusing on (ephemeral) events; he is concerned with long-term trends and structures, and archaeology is prominent (see Bibliography). After an introduction drawing attention to terminology such as 'nomad', 'pastoral', and 'migration', Part I deals with physical conditions, with examples from the fourth century to the nineteenth century, and Part II is devoted to the period before the Roman advance. Separate peoples, including the Celts, receive individual treatment. With Part III we come to Rome's dealings with the nomads, which has five sections to itself, compared with the three each of the earlier parts: 'Immigration' ('invasion' and 'raiding' are repudiated), 'Rome and the Nomads' itself, 'Pastoralism', 'Raiders, Rebels, and Thieves', and 'Urban Development' (exiguous). 10 The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare.

This intellectual posture may be convenient for university 'History of Art' departments (e.g. Cambridge) where the art of Greece and Rome is generally excluded from the syllabus, but its lack of empirical foundation is easily exposed (most recently by Jeremy Tanner's 2006 monograph The Invention of Art History in Ancient Greece). True, we possess scant access to the writings of Xenocrates and others who were both artists and authors in the third century BC; and, despite the 'material success' of individuals such as Praxiteles and Lysippos, it may be (as Tanner maintains) that the artists of classical antiquity never achieved the 'autonomy' of a Michelangelo or Rubens. Yet the practice of 'appreciating' art qua art was demonstrably developed in Rome from the late Republic onwards: and this practice, even if it was not always done from truly 'aesthetic' motives, has left a substantial literature. In Roman Eyes,1 Jas Eisner effectively communicates his enthusiasm for Pausanias, Callistratus, the Philostrati, and other sources of 'discourse' about images in the Greco-Roman world. Most belong to the period known as the 'Second Sophistic': among them Lucian, saluted here as 'a truly wonderful and versatile writer' (59) - who may have considered a career as a sculptor, but realized that then, as in our own time, it was somewhat easier (and often more lucrative) to prattle about art than actually to make it. So Lucian et al. constitute Eisner's primary resource for establishing a measure of historical 'subjectivity' in our understanding of Roman art. In other words, what did Romans think of the images that surrounded them? How far can we reconstruct 'the viewer's share' of (say) a Pompeian wall-painting? The immediate objection, that these writers were predominantly Greek-educated individuals of non-Roman origin, may be easily discounted: the sophos theates or 'experienced eye' naturally resorted to Greek as the verbal medium of expression (and discerned, we presume, that 'Roman art' was customarily Greek handiwork). Eisner runs into more serious difficulties when attempting to locate 'the female gaze'. In his discussion of the Projecta casket, a relief-decorated box found among a hoard of late antique silverware from a house on the Esquiline, he has to argue that 'items of the toilette' are restricted to female usage - while at the same time describing the female in question as 'like the casket itself, 'a luxury ornament for her husband's possession and pleasure' (215). However, the interpretative momentum gathered in these essays (mostly published previously) impresses by its engagement with both ancient art and the ancient discourse about art. Some readers may find that the 'eloquent sophistication of high culture' (59) of second-century AD Rome has found its match in the author's own academic ambience 1 Roman Eyes.

But the definition (by Shadi Bartsch) of the author's sensibility as 'particularly attuned to the way in which viewing, desire, social constructions, and generic discourses interplay and interact' remains an accurate advertisement for the book. Interaction of the same or similar factors is evident in John R. Clarke's latest monograph, Looking at Laughter.2 By his own admission, Clarke wrote this book by chance: that is, in the course of collecting material for previous studies (notably Looking at Lovemaking, 1998), he came across numerous examples of images whose intentions could be construed as primarily, partly, or just inadvertently comic. Hence the odd title: for even if we are not presented with scenes explicitly depicting laughter 'in action', or directly connected to burlesque traditions of the ancient theatre, we can imagine the sounds of amusement occasioned, for example, by a painting that shows Pygmies enacting the Judgment of Solomon. Or can we? Clarke assembles a fascinating compendium of potentially 'laughable' images; but if laughter is (in the memorable analysis of Thomas Hobbes) essentially the 'sudden glory' of feeling fortunate by contrast to the situation of someone else, then we may be obliged to keep a more or less straight face. Take, for instance, the minor genre of Roman mosaic known as the asarotos oikos or 'unswept house' - where the artist has littered the floor with a permanent and exquisitely detailed detritus of scraps, bones, shells, and so on. Agreed, this has a 'playful' aspect, with the inclusion of mice creeping out to nibble the banqueters' waste. But surely its primary message was to attest a host's generosity (and hardly to reprimand his servants for negligence). Clarke seems on safe ground when allowing the 'apotropaic' function of various deformities and exaggerations; however, when surveying the considerable quantity of images that qualify for 'sexual humor', we may again feel that there is not so much to laugh at here. One person's 'sexual folly' is, after all, another's route to ecstasy: a great deal depends here upon Clarke's claim that 'Roman visual humor depends on reversals and the unexpected' (229), and then using literary evidence (e.g. Catullus, Martial) to imply that fellatio, cunnilingus, mulier equitans, and the like were abnormal erotic capers. (The decoration of the Suburban Baths at Pompeii thereby becomes more a checklist of sexual taboos than a pornographic medley). There must be little doubt as to the darkest humour discussed by Clarke: this lay with the so-called 'fatal charades', those ingenious spectacles of arena punishment in which condemned criminals were assigned unenviable mythical roles: Prometheus bound; Hercules and the Shirt of Fire; Orpheus strumming to wild bears (sent by Eurydice? - as Martial quipped). The wider context in which these deadly games took place is established by Katherine Welch's The Roman Amphitheatre.3 Welch gives us, indeed, a rather particular expla nation of how the mythical role-plays came about: Nero, she points out, had sponsored the public performance of Greek tragedies in Rome, and an amphitheatre in the Campus Martius where neminem occidit, ne noxiorum quidem ('he killed no one, not even criminals'; Suet. Nero 12.1). So when the Flavians came to erect the 'Colos seum' in grounds once annexed for the philhellene emperor's Domus Aurea, they 2 Looking at Laughter.

To give these executions a twist of Greek 'culture' was a droll gloss on Nero's predilections. In this brisk analysis, Welch typically refrains from moralizing about what happened inside the Roman amphitheatre. Her primary concern is to explain how this institutional space, so often taken as iconic of Roman 'civilization' at large, evolved and developed in the late Republic and early Empire. A substantial appendix collects details of known republican amphitheatres - some well-known (Pompeii), others hitherto unpublished (Abella); and there are painstaking efforts to locate the first monumental, stone-cut structure of the type - now disappeared, the Amphitheatre of Statilius Taurus, which was 'an integral part of Augustus' great building program' (110). But for those who do not already know her work, perhaps the major revelation of Welch's study will be the section entitled 'Reception of the Amphitheatre in the Greek World in the Early Imperial Period'. As Nero had (in the eyes of his detractors) corrupted Roman tradition by staging Greek pantomimes and tragedies in the amphitheatre, so the Roman dominance of cities such as Corinth and Athens was symbolized by the adaptation of the classical Greek theatres for the purpose of gladiatorial sports. We know that some Greeks reacted with anger and nausea at this abuse of dramatic space. The more nuanced conclusion must be that a certain taste was fostered - for seeing blood spilt in the orchestra, and eschewing the fiction of screams off-stage. The Colosseum is merely one of the many Roman antiquities whose history has been illuminated in recent years by Filippo Coarelli - a scholar who has mellowed from enfant terrible to senior statesman without losing his zest for archaeological enquiry. For some years now it has been the habit of advanced tourists in Rome to rely upon Coarelli's Laterza-published guides to the city and its dintorni for intelligent company. Now these guidebooks have been amalgamated into one volume and made available in English: and the result, Rome and Environs, must be trumpeted here.4 I used the soft-bound edition for a week around rainy Eastertide, and can report the following salutary features: (i) a translation made by two specialists in the field; (ii) information as up-to-date as possible, duly cautious where caution is due, yet keeping us primed with the latest theories (the entry for the Arch of Constantine is a good example of such equilibrium); (iii) clear directions, uncluttered maps and plans (including a handy diagram and glossary of Roman building techniques); and (iv) a robust cover and binding.

Religion An unusually large number of books has been posted off to me by the editors in the past eighteen months or so, almost all of them interesting and in their various ways rewarding; to my regret, I have had to leave a number aside for future notice.

Their advantage lies precisely in the range of opinions and approaches that they offer. Modestly aiming to offer a mere impression of such a vast field, and eschewing any specific intellectual agenda, Daniel Ogden has done an excellent job both in defining major topics for discussion and in commissioning a varied list of contributors, senior and junior, European and North American, classicists, archaeologists, and historians of religion. The planning of the volume can usefully be compared to that of Walter Burkert's classic of the Zurich historical approach, Griechische Religion (1977). Burkert opened his book with 60 pages on neolithic and Minoan-Mycenean religion, then analysed the key concepts and ritual institutions of archaic and classical religion (90 pages), ran through the major individualized gods one by one (70 pages), examined the dead, chthonic gods, heroes, and 'sort-crossers' in one chapter (30 pages), before devoting 70 pages to polis-religion: typologies, organization of time, social functions, the idea of'piety'. The two final chapters concerned mysteries and intellectual religion. Ogden's upper cut-off date is '776 bc', so Minoan-Mycenaean is out; but S. B. Noegel picks up another of Burkert's major themes, surveying borrowings and assimilations of myths, rites, and techniques by the Greeks from the ancient Near East. Ritual institutions are scattered across two sections, 3 and 4: S. Scullion on festivals, B. Dignas on the Realien of worship in the sanctuary (mainly on Asklepieia), J. Bremmer on sacrifice, P. Bonnechere on divination, A. Bendlin on pollution, W. D. Furley on prayers and hymns. In place of Burkert's survey of individual deities, we now have a section on 'The Powers: The Gods and the Dead' (section 2). K. Dowden stresses the complex means by which the pantheon was constructed, with case-studies of Apollo and Artemis; J. Larsen contributes a compressed version of her fine book on Greek nymphs. Heroes (G. Ekroth) and the dead (D. Felton) now have no separate section but are reckoned in transactional terms as powers to be negotiated with. In keeping with current emphasis on the diversity of Greek religion, reflecting the desire to avoid both Burkert's broad brush and the more insidious temptation to depend too much on Athens, section 5 takes four examples of local religious systems (S. Deacy on Athens, N. Richer on Sparta, F. Dunand on Alexandria, M. Jost on Arcadia). Aspects of the sociology of Greek polis-religion are discussed by C. W. Hedrick (Athens) and J. Morgan (women, again mainly Athens). The last two sections likewise diverge inter estingly from Burkert: magic (M. W. Dickie) has been added to mysteries (limited to Dionysus, by J. Guettel Cole, and Eleusis, by K. Clinton; nothing on the Great Gods; the Argive Cabiri get three brief mentions); philosophical religion is narrowed down to a rather argumentative study of Plato (F.-G. Herrmann), but this topic itself is just part of a section called 'Intersections', on religion and literature (T Harrison) and religion in art (T. H. Carpenter), which suggest something of the increase in self-consciousness about (literary) evidence and other sources since Burkert's day. L. Llewellyn-Jones provides a segue into the contemporary world with a piece on two 1 A Companion to Greek Religion. Edited by Daniel Ogden. Oxford and Maldon, MA, Blackwell Publishing, 2007.

The presentations are clearly written and for the most part easily intelligible without being at all condescending. Without wishing to be invidious, I particularly enjoyed the pieces by Bonnechere, Bremmer, Carpenter, Cole, J. Davidson (stimulating reflections on temporalities - what a relief to get away from 'cyclical conceptions of time'), Dowden, Ekroth, Harrison, and V Pirenne-Delforge (good brief re-presentation of her arguments about sexuality, Aphrodite, and 'sacred prostitution'). Despite the high overall quality of the individual contributions, I have five main criticisms. First, though Jan Bremmer, for example, does say something about recent interpretations of sacrifice, I would very much have liked to see someone attempting a sketch of the historical development of views on Greek religion since, say, Lobeck's Aglaophamus (F. Graf would have been an excellent choice). Second, though the book claims to go down to 30 BC, it in fact contains only one piece (Dunand on Alexandria) that squarely tackles Hellenistic religion, and then only in relation to one city; Tyche is mentioned just briefly by Emma Stafford in her piece on personifications. Nor is there much specifically on archaic religion, although the exclusion of Minoan-Mycenaean implies tacit agreement with Vernant's view that Greek religion in effect begins for us with the establishment of the polis as the normative Greek political unit. There is therefore too little sense of historical change: this is essentially a Companion to the religion of the classical Greek polis. I would add that there is also very little on Greek religion in Magna Graecia, Sicily, Ionia, the Euxine, and so on. Third, I miss any sustained interest in Greek religious terminology: for example, unlike 'impiety', neither eusebeia nor 'piety' appears in the index, despite the fact that L. Bruit Zaidmann recently published an entire book on the topic (2001); there are only a couple of sentences on the concept of daimon; and so on. Fourth, given the importance of 'sacred laws' in providing us with a concrete sense of ritual praxis, I rather missed a fuller treatment of them, despite the efforts of Beate Dignas in this direction. Finally, it was not a good idea to allow Herrmann to limit the topic of intellectual religion in the way he does; this piece belongs in a journal not in a companion. But all in all, Ogden has done an excellent job. The death last autumn of Jean-Pierre Vernant at the age of ninety-four prompts me to notice the re-issue by MIT Press (Zone Books) of the one-volume third edition of Myth and Thought (1985), translated by Janet Lloyd with Jeff Fort.2 This edition improved on the second edition (the two-volume Maspero edition of 1971; original edition 1965) by including a third discussion of the Hesiodic myth of the five races (a reply to Victor Goldschmidt), a second account of the speci ficity of the classical cult-statue, and a further note on the 'origins of philosophy', conceived as a tussle between Milesian physics and Eleatic paradox. One can of course never confidently predict which of the interests of such a charismatic and original Hellenist, as represented by Myth and Thought, will be rediscovered. At the moment it seems that Vernant's early post-war essays on labour and 'technological thought', which he thought his most dense, have been quite forgotten; the essays on 'the origins of philosophy' now look na?ve (the French 'pens?e positive', which means philosophical naturalism, is translated as 'positivist thought', which gives a completely misleading impression); the category of historical psychology that he inherited from 2 Myth and Thought Among the Greeks.

On the other hand the work on the psycho sociology of the three-dimensional image, which he pursued into later life, and on the organization of (civic) space, remains challenging. However, he is probably con demned to be most read, at least abroad, for the essays on the Hesiodic myth of the races, because they exemplify the L?vi-Straussian phase of Paris-School structuralism, even though Vernant himself reckoned that his piece on the Hesiodic myth of sacrifice, in La Cuisine du sacrifice (1979), was his best in this mode. Specifically in relation to religion, the brief article on the limitations of Greek anthropomorphism (of 1960, the same year as 'Le Mythe h?siodique des races'), oddly presented as 'Aspects of Personal Identity', remains insightful. The perdurability of the ideas of the School of Paris, now into the third generation, is very much in evidence in an enjoyable DEA thesis on Apollo, presented at Rennes 2 but written in Toulouse, by Philippe Monbrun.3 Its twin inspirations are the well-known j/hydria in the Vatican that shows the god sitting on a winged tripod and playing the lyre, bow, and quiver strapped behind his back; and Homer's image of the lyre in the account of Odysseus stringing his great bow at Od. 21. 406-11. How are bow, lyre, and prophecy linked? No sign here of the familiar triple-strand prehistory that sees Apollo as a fusion of a Dorian/North-west Greek, a Cretan-Minoan, and a Syro-Hittite component; the key connections between archery and foreknowledge, between the manufacture and deployment of lyre and bow are structural ('making the implicit explicit'). The method is historico-anthropological, as vaguely formulated by the former Centre de recherches compar?es (now the Centre Louis Gernet). Monbrun appeals to the history of technology, to techniques of and ideas about North American Indian, Ottoman, Japanese, and Indian archery, and about lutenry, to suggest the organic relation between stringing, testing, and sounding the lyre and the bow; to the ancient bestiary to account for the association between dolphin, serpent, mouse, lizard, and grasshopper with Apollo as archer (they all share with the flight of the arrow a distinctive undulating movement); to the parallel between Apollo's 'magical' skill - he never learns to play the lyre, just as he never learns to shoot - and his marvellous foreknowledge, which owes nothing to 'metis' but results from sheer concentration upon a point in past or future ('t?l?science'), just as in many traditions the perfect archer can hit the target without necessarily being able to descry it. Some of the ideas fall a little flat (e.g. the Pythia as a musical instrument), and the reader learns nothing about other important aspects of Apollo, not even about illness, healing, or the paean, and virtually no attempt is made to confront myth with the sociopolitical roles and pan-Hellenic claims of the oracle at Delphi. Structure is thus allowed too free a rein, and screened too sharply off from 'mere' ideology, let alone real interests; but so far as it goes this is an ingenious and original contribution. Apollo immediately evokes Delphi, which is the subject of a brief introduction in Beck's useful Wissen series (a German equivalent of 'Que sais-je?') by a classical archaeologist, Michael Maa?, formerly head of the ancient section of the Badisches Landesmuseum, Karlsruhe.4 Delphi is a tricky topic: one has to move adroitly between the 3 Les Voix d'Apollon.

Maa? does his best to be lively, and his information is generally reliable and up to date; he also provides a list of dates, an index of names, and a glossary of terms. However, I sometimes found the presentation confusing, as we switch back and forth between the topics; there is no stress upon the communi cative interaction between monuments; the absence even of rudimentary footnotes means that the book is not very suited to the most obvious target audience, under graduates. Lack of space often compels the author to be excessively brief: for example, in discussing the nature of the Pythia's inspiration, he adduces the famous image of Themis giving an oracle to Aegeus on the Berlin kylix as proof of how the oracle actually worked, without problematizing the iconographie conventions employed (16 f.). The educated visitor to the site is better served by the archaeological Guide edited by J.-F. Bommelaer (1991). Rather to my surprise, Maa? offers no information about the contents of the new museum, which is one of the highlights of any visit, and well served by O. Picard's Guide (1991). For the sake of the extremely low price, and uniformity with the series format, Beck has chosen to forego illustrations of the required quality; for anyone who can read German fluently, Maa?' earlier book, Das antike Delphi (1993, with reprint), is perhaps the better bet. A scholarly thesis by Francesca Del Neri on the evidence in the fragments of Attic comedy for three foreign deities - Sabazius, Bendis, and Cotys - introduced into Athens in the late fifth century, may also be registered here.5 The author spent some time working with Martin Hose in Munich, and the presentation and discussion of the fragments is exemplary. The work is essentially a close commentary on the relevant passages of Aristophanes' Lemniai, Cratinus' Boukoloi and Thracian Women, and Eupolis' Baptai. In each case, the relevant literary and epigraphic evidence (the latter not complete) for the cult is given in Greek, followed by as extensive a discussion as the evidence merits. There is, however, little about the cults themselves, or about the wider religious situation; the thesis is intended as a critical aid, a prolegomenon, to the historical study of these cults. This limited purpose is admirably fulfilled (though I am surprised to find Cotys not problematized) and the book itself a pleasure to use. If Del Neri writes for other initiates, Graf and Johnston's introduction to the fourth-century and later Bacchic-Orphic gold lamellae is a successful example of writing for a(n advanced) student audience.6 In international graduate teaching, it proved a stimulating introduction to this complex topic: Sarah Johnston has taken especial care to set out her material and arguments in a clear and pedagogically effective manner. The thirty-seven or thirty-eight texts so far known (two unpublished groups, from Lesbos and at Pella/Dium, will one day increase this total), are set out first (rather oddly retaining the original spelling while admitting conjectures), with bibliography and a facing translation. The readings are mainly those of Bernab?; the second text from Pherae (no. 28), only published by Robert Parker and Maria Stamatopoulou in 2007, is probably not Bacchic, but suggests an extension of the 5 / culti misterici stranieri nei frammenti d?lia commedia attica antica.

This chapter is followed by Graf's useful account of the history of scholarship, which duly highlights the role played by Domenico Comparetti in recognizing their Orphic-Bacchic character, the rise and fall of Orphism, and the way that new finds (e.g. the 'new' Pherae text) have in the past and will continue to force rethinking of supposedly settled knowledge. Of the two central chapters of the book, by Johnston, the first demonstrates the composite nature of the Orphic myth of Dionysus, invoking a creative bricoleur to explain its family resem blance to earlier myths; and the second carefully sifts the topographic clues presented by the mnemonic texts to provide a convincing account of the eschatology. Although I do not agree with all the interpretations offered, each is an important contribution to these highly complex debates. The two final chapters follow up an earlier suggestion by Graf that these texts include elements taken from Bacchic ritual (the informative becoming performative); and argue that we can usefully distinguish between hieratic and non-hieratic texts within the same order of discourse. My only real complaints are that the striking differences within the mnemonic category between the 'topo graphic' and 'cathartic' type of texts are minimized instead of problematized, so that the category 'gold tablets' is unwarrantably unified instead of being further dismantled (as it could easily be); and that the odd distribution of these texts around the margins of the world of the Greek polis is hardly discussed: gold lamellae cannot have been cheap; the texts from the two grand tombs at Thurii suggest that there might be an elective affinity between a weakly developed /&gt;o/w-culture and the desire for a super-death. Theoretical primitivism of the A. B. Cook or Jane Harrison type once took it for granted that ritual is conservative and changeless, but ever since Stanley Tambiah's article on performativity in ritual (1979), critical re-assessment has been gaining ground. The problem then becomes how to conceptualize alternative views. The collection of essays on ritual edited for the Kernos Supplementary series by Eftychia Stavrianopoulou as part of the big Heidelberg Sonderforschungsbereich Dynamics of Ritual has come up with a number of suggestions (all contributions in English).7 In this case at any rate, the German system of renewable largescale funding for joint research on a specific programme seems to have produced worthwhile results. Major themes are the dialectical relation between ritual form and ritual semantics; the processual or performative character of ritual communication; the variety of contexts against which rituals can be studied; and the open-endedness of any one mode of analysis. The whole volume is well worth consulting; perhaps the best for teaching purposes is a wide-ranging piece by Jannis Mylonopoulos (now at Columbia) on Greek sanctuaries as communicative sites, working from architectural spaces (including a telling account of the changes in banqueting accommodation in the t?menos of Demeter and Kore at Corinth from the early sixth to mid-second century bc), through the varied semiotics of votive offerings to that of ritual perfor mances (e.g. dramatized myth) and processions. But the contributions on dance as a condensed sign (F. Naerebout), the emotional content of rituals (A. Chaniotis), oath rituals as contingent choices among a determinate set of options (I. Berti), the freedom enjoyed by writers to recompose and reconstruct rituals (P. Kat?), and accla mations in imperial Egypt (T. Kruse), are all rewarding.

Rather less successful, because lacking a shared theoretical impetus, is a collection of articles on great men (not only political figures) as the meeting point of divine and human interests, issuing from another extended research programme, in this case at Besan?on, on exceptional men or heroes, and the different ways that they receive divine acknowledgement and sanction.8 Chance or destiny; myth and history; the veridicality of signs; the decline of grandeur - these are some of the themes. The most successful pieces are by J. Bo?ldian-Trevet, on Xenophon's construction of the great man (Cyrus) as rational, reflective, self controlled, and provident but also as one capable of reading divine signs correctly; L. Villard on contemporary judgements on the reasons for Philip of Macedon's political success; G. Guittard, on the value of Servius, Ad Aen. II 649 for Etrusco-Italic divinatory practice; V Fromentin on the roles of Tyche as a historical agent in Diodorus' History; and C. Van Liefferinge on the dynamic relation in theurgy between god and the accomplished practitioner, based on accurate reading of authentic but cryptic signs ?synthemata'). But, as so often with collections, the whole is rather less than the sum of its parts. Last year, I noted the appearance of the English translation of J. R. Jannot's introduction to Etruscan religion, Devins, dieux et d?mons; this book is now complemented by a well-illustrated collective volume by several hands, edited by Nancy de Grummond and Erika Simon, and beautifully produced by the University of Texas Press.9 Especially welcome is the longish contribution on the sacred architecture of Pyrgi by Giovanni Colonna, Professor of Etruscology at La Sapienza, Rome, who is inclined, a trifle overenthusiastically, to argue that this site may have been the main Etruscan sanctuary. Another central essay is that of Ingrid Krauskopf on an important but of course highly contentious topic - ideas about the afterlife: she highlights the evidence of the Tomb of the Blue Demons at Tarquinia (c.400 BC) to argue in favour of a belief in an initial journey to the underworld along a road beset by demons, followed by a sea journey, which is functionally equivalent to the half-open door; the symposium is simultaneously a defunctive banquet and a representation of the afterlife; at the same time the shedding of blood was required to fortify the soul on this last journey, and may have ensured its permanent presence with the living as an ancestor. Here the effort to reflect the complexity of the evidence has resulted in a certain breathlessness, not to say indecipherability. The shorter articles all offer competent summaries of their topics: Simon herself briefly sets out a scheme of the Etruscan pantheon; Jean Turfa provides a good account of votive religion, mainly bronzes and terracottas; also a useful appendix containing the Greek text and translation of the brontoscopic calendar copied by Nigidius Figulus and preserved by Joh.

Deecke (1877), and resumes what can be said about priestly roles. The most innovative, if necessarily speculative, piece is an attempt by I. Edlund-Berry to map ritual space and ritual boundaries in the heavens and on earth, supervised by a battery of divin ities. The book concludes with a selection of Thulin's collection of relevant Greek and Latin texts. The ever-expanding number of books, specialist and popular, on the Etruscans attests to the abiding fascination of the obscure. Etruscan religion provides an object lesson in the strengths and limitations of interpretative archaeology; but this book should help students to understand the late-Republican and early imperial concern with the Etrusca disciplina a little better. The Roman pendant to Ogden's Companion is an equally large volume edited by one of the most brilliant contemporary experts on Roman religion, J?rg R?pke.10 Since the basic model is the same, I can in this case be briefer. One difference immediately stands out: the first substantial item after the editor's introduction is a piece on the history of scholarship on Roman religion by C. R. Phillips Jr. Although I find its execution unfortunate - wayward, mannered, and slightly peevish - the point is made: Roman religion is not just 'there', it is a construction whose dominant assumptions are historically condi tioned. WTiat we know and how we know it are central themes. Analysis of individual components, games and processions, or prayer rubs alongside synthetic accounts of archaic religion and the Jewish Diaspora at Rome. The twenty-nine other contri butors comprise many well-known names, American and European. It is especially welcome to find articles by a sizeable group of younger continental scholars (admit tedly translation has not always served them well), which introduce approaches and ideas that are not current in the study of Roman religion in the English-speaking world. The book is organized into six sections: history, sources, elements, agents, identities, and 'export'. The advantage of such a division is that the same issues and materials can be revisited under different rubrics, as parts of a process, as institutions, or as structures. The student is thus invited to view any given topic from more than one point of view, through more than one authority. Not all the contributions are equally successful, but there is a vast amount of modern information and analysis here, as well as up-to-date bibliographies for further reading. Not by any means a volume for beginners, but an admirably full and ambitious reference book to which more advanced students can confidently be directed. Although not designed for the purpose, R?pke's own introduction to (mainly) republican religion fits neatly between the detailed historical treatment by Beard, North, and Price in Religions of Rome (1998) and John Scheid 's rather didactic institutional approach (English trans lation as Introduction to Roman Religion, 2003).n As the translator of this English version, I suppose I am in as good a position to judge it as anyone else. R?pke's advantage is that he was not trained as an ancient historian (though he has been a professor of Latin), but as a historian of religion with special interest in Rome, and he holds one of the few German chairs in Religionswissenschaft. His typical approach is to defamiliarize, to use strangenesses and oddities as diagnostic of another reality; he 10 A Companion to Roman Religion. Edited by J?rg R?pke.

The reader is assumed to be interested not so much in information, which is rather taken for granted, as in interpretations. Interpretation is not arbitrary or convenient but based on explicit models whose function is to provide a consciously chosen perspect ive. If there is a main thesis, it is the total inverse of Wissowan historico-nationalism: that what we know as Roman religion of the Republic is in fact simply the religion of the Roman ?lite, altered over time in accordance with, or to defend, its perceived, and changing, interests. After presenting a temporal scheme of four main periods stretching from the period of ethnogenesis to 42 BC, he offers three sections: struc tures, religion in action, and social reality. In 'Structures', he looks not at the pantheon but at statues of gods; breaks ritual down into its communicative elements: touching, display, dance, music, and so on; and emphasizes the crucial contrast between Roman relaxation about interpretation (the more the merrier) and Christian obsession with control over just that. In section two, he does the same for sacrifice, deliberately de-emphasizing paraded state occasions, but highlighting the link between eating and hierarchy; personal engagements (vows and curses); and the control of space and time (R?pke wrote his Habilitation on the Roman calendar). In the final section, he focuses on religion at Rome, and on priesthood (the translation of his three-volume index of priests at Rome is due from Oxford this year). The first German edition of 2001 stopped there; this English version contains a final chapter, on selected developments during the Principate, highlighting the process of disen gagement of religion from the sociopolitical realm; it also has quite extensive footnotes and a consolidated bibliography; references have been brought up to date and where possible adapted to an English-language public; the captions to the plates have been revised and extended. I myself enjoyed translating it, and cannot imagine anyone failing to be inspired by it - not that there are not some interpretations that on reflection appear hasty or only half-thought through. R?pke's final chapter, on shifts in the imperial period, is the subject of James Rives' well-written introductory student text in another Blackwell series, Ancient Religions.12 Rives is much more careful to provide background for the uninitiated (there are glossaries of deities and sources at the end, and six boxes with translated inscriptions and other texts, appar ently for discussion with a class; indeed, the early part of the book has an air of patient didacticism). He acknowledges from the outset that - particularly at a time such as the present when traditional grand narratives are under fire - a narrative approach is impracticable; the most he will do is to try to draw the threads together in the epilogue. Otherwise the book is strictly analytical, deliberately focused not on Rome itself but, as far as practicable, on provincial evidence and materials. Thus, after a consideration of what we might mean by the religion of the Empire (he settles for the loose 'approaches to the divine', but refuses Beard-North-Price's plural religions), Chapter 2 surveys the various regions of the Empire, with Italy in final place. Attention then turns to individual experience of the divine, through specific locations and encounters, with collective or communal religious experience in three 12 Religion in the Roman Empire.

The two following chapters, which are really the heart of the book, deal with a whole gamut of integrative pressures that Rives sees as working in favour of a 'religion of the Empire' (132 f.); and some private options, such as mysteries and magic, not in detail but in terms of what they offered the individual. The issue of Christianity, which is otherwise rather skirted, is approached mainly in terms of control, in a balanced final chapter on Roman religious authority, on which Rives has written a number of important articles. My main criticism of the book is that it tends to flatten the religion of the Empire into a timeless whole without making the effort to pick out distinctive trends; there is too much use of classical Greek and republican material; and far too little determination to confront the main problem, as I see it, namely the relation between the religion of Rome and the religious activity of the provincial populations. The roles of the imperial cult and of 'imperial deities' such as Iuppiter, Victoria, and Sol are thus down-played in favour of an 'invisible hand', namely convergent practice and experience. One senses here the constraints imposed by assumptions about the target audience. Nevertheless, the book is important as an attempt to create a textbook in an area normally, as in R?pke's case, left to an appendix because the problems are all too forbidding; Rives' synthesizing approach, and belief in a religious experience roughly generalizable over the Empire serves as a significant contrast to the approach of the second half of Beard-North-Price, volume 1, which can easily be made the focus of classroom discussion. Finally, this may be the place to note the publication of the first volume in a large-scale project by the Academia B?lgica in Rome to republish all the major, and many of the minor and unpublished, works of the Belgian savant Franz Cumont (1868-1947), with the support of the family (now de Cumont). This first volume, a reprint of the fourth edition of the Oriental Religions of the Roman Empire (1929), was intended to mark the centenary of its first appear ance in 1906.13 The aim is not in the first instance celebratory but historiographie, to invoke Cumont (who conducted a large academic correspondence) as a representative of the intellectual cross-currents of his time; his value as a witness has grown in proportion to the dwindling of his citation value. The appearance of the fifth edition also coincides with a large-scale Franco-Belgic-Italo-German revaluation of Cumont's entire category 'oriental religions', whose results are currently appearing in a series of conference proceedings. Cumont's text needs, in fact, to be read just as we read Mommsen's R?mische Geschichte or Grote's History of Greece. This task is made much easier by the highlight of this edition, the long introduction by Corinne Bonnet and Fran?oise Van Haeperen (xi-lxxiv), which sets Cumont against the French historians of the religion of the Roman Empire of the preceding generation, against Boissier, Renan, Duruy, and R?ville. They show that Cumont was simply playing a variation on wholly familiar themes (the discussion broke out in France after the defeat of 1870, but is essentially a debate about the merits of Hegel's theological history as mediated by A. A. Beugnot, and so about Christianity as a historical rather than an extra-historical phenomenon), and how difficult he found it to adjudicate between the various considerations - was the Orient baleful or beneficial? Did the oriental religions fortify Graeco-Roman paganism in the face of Christianity or cause its 13 Les Religions orientales dans le paganisme romain. By Franz Cumont.

Were they popular because they brought a new spirituality qua mystery cults? Are magic and astrology religions? For all the surface confidence of Les Religions orientales, a close reading reveals numerous cracks and incoherencies, compounded by the decision in the fourth edition to include the cult of Dionysus/Bacchus because the god was essentially oriental; the rhetorical aim was, of course, to bolster the role of the category 'mystery' - itself subjected to no scrutiny at all. This is a fine inauguration of a worthwhile project. doi: 10.1017/S0017383508000624 RICHARD GORDON General Don Fowler was an outstanding scholar and inspirational teacher. His death in 1999 at the age of just forty-six left a great sense of loss that is still felt far beyond the confines of Jesus College, Oxford, where he taught for the last nineteen years of his life. Classical Constructions. Papers in Memory of Don Fowler. Classicist and Epicurean is an affectionate and stimulating collection of papers by prominent Latinists.1 The volume begins with a previously unpublished article by Fowler - 'Laocoon's Point of View: Walking the Roman Way' - and the thirteen contributions that follow resonate with his intellectual spirit, humour, and informality. A comprehensive bibliography records the astonishing variety and scope of his research, from Virgilian acrostics to Deviant Focalization, but by readers of this journal he will be most fondly remem bered for his six years as subject reviewer for Latin literature (1986-1993). As Stephen Harrison writes 'Don's contributions here became something of an insti tution in Latin studies, and their publication was eagerly or fearfully awaited by his friends and colleagues for their jokes, learning and avowedly personal tone, commit ment to the subject, and non-avoidance of controversy' (352). Visualizing the Tragic. Drama, Myth, and Ritual in Greek Art and Literature is dedicated by its editors 'For Froma, with all our love'.2 This 'Froma-fest', or celebration of the 'Zeit-lin geist', honours the unique contribution of one of the most influential living critics of Greek drama, whose work - including such articles as 'Travesties of Gender and Genre in Aristophanes' and 'Playing the Other: Theater, Theatricality and the Feminine in Greek Drama' - has done so much to expand our view of the Greek world. This is no 'mere' celebration, however, but a serious interdisciplinary contri bution by leading scholars to 'the discourse of sight' - the way that Greek tragedy is visualized both through verbal and artistic representations (from vase painting to the modern staging of tragedy) and the impact that this has on the wider discourses of knowledge, power, and reality. The volume ends with contributions from two giants of the French classical world - Pierre Vidal-Naquet and Jean-Pierre Vernant - who both died before the publication of the book. Their recollections of Froma form a riveting and poignant diptych - Vidal-Naquet writes 'in friendly rivalry with Jean Pierre Vernant' (393); Vernant, in the full knowledge of his own mortality, revisits Zeitlin's introduction to a collection of his essays, Mortals and Immortals'. 1 Classical Constructions.

(387) The Greek Theatre and Festivals. Documentary Studies (edited by Peter Wilson) presents a very different approach to Greek drama. Its focus is on inscriptions, monuments, and other archaeological evidence as sources for the context of Greek drama. It is divided into three parts - 'Festivals and performers: some new perspect ives'; 'Festivals of Athens and Attica'; 'Beyond Athens' - and ranges widely from fifth-century Sicily to Hellenistic Cyrene. In his introduction, Wilson weighs his words carefully when locating his study within the wider social and political contexts of Greek theatre studies and it is worth quoting at length: The approach collectively exemplified in this volume advocates recognition of the specificity and complexity of the material conditions of dramatic production as they varied over time and place; and the recognition of the importance of close contact with the raw data relating to the organisa tion and operation of theatre and festivals. Attention to such information need not represent a retreat to na?ve empiricism. Analysed with the appropriate care and sophistication, the docu mentary evidence can be a more eloquent testimony to the ideological and historical complexity of its societies. Interpretation arrives at an apprehension of such complexity through a 'bottom-up' approach, from the evidence for material conditions, rather than via the 'top-down' method of some of the more abstract forms of structuralism and post-structuralism. (2-3) The contrast with Visualizing the Tragic (to which Wilson also contributed) could not be sharper. For anyone who wants an intelligent yet accessible overview of Greek and Roman drama then John Burgess' Pocket Guide is a good choice.4 It is not the work of a professional classicist, but a theatre director, designed to be accessible to those without Greek or Latin. It provides useful plot summaries, well-informed sections about the forty individual plays (though without specific references for further reading on each play), and brief details about available translations and the performance history of each play. Classicists may baulk at the inevitable generaliza tions and simplifications that such a project demands, such as the categorical statement that 'The real-life Socrates was a moral philosopher who had no interest in the natural sciences' (262), but there is an undeniable excitement in the presentation of the whole canon of classical drama from Aeschylus to Seneca, rather than in the traditional divisions into its constituent parts. The perspective of a professional director also encourages one to see the plays in a broader theatrical context - for example, in the comparison between Chekhov's Cherry Orchard and Sophocles' Electra (106-11). There is a useful section on general further reading at the end of the book, which covers each playwright and sections on 'Origins', 'Stage History', and 'Other' - the latter (rather disappointingly) not to be mistaken for 'The Other'. Momigliano and Antiquarianism is not a biography of this giant of histo riography.5 It is more a study in the history of ideas, taking as its focus Momigliano's 3 The Greek Theatre and Festivals.

The suggestion, in the light of reception studies, and the more widespread acknowl edgement of the role of archaeological material in ancient histories and the like, may seem less surprising today than it did in 1950, and the volume carefully sets out the intellectual contexts and reception of this idea. The premise for the excellent Technology and Culture in Greek and Roman Antiquity is the omnipresence of technology in the ancient world - 'you find technology everywhere' (1) - and that this ubiquity is insufficiently reflected in the scholarly attention given to technology.6 Cuomo hopes that her attempt to bring technology to the mainstream will demon strate its potential for 'invaluable insights into ancient culture' (2). The book is organized in an unconventional manner for books in this area, and is challenging and refreshing as a result: it does not examine the technology alone, but brings to the fore the nature of our sources for it, emphasizing the two elements as dual strands, feeding into each other in our understanding of what ancient technology was. It has, in other words, as strong an emphasis on the representation of technology, as on the technology itself. The book's organization is also unusual in distancing itself from what Cuomo considers two methodological culs-de-sac that have pervaded previous studies (the blocage question, and the 'mainstream' views of the marginality of technology). Furthermore, it does not give a chronological survey of different technologies. Instead, it provides five case studies that range chronologically, geographically, and in subject matter (medicine in classical Athens, warfare in Helle nistic Greece, carpentry in the early Empire, land survey in the second century AD, and architecture in late antiquity). Each chapter addresses a big question, while contributing to the overall reassessment of the cultural role of ancient technology. For the latter, Cuomo argues for the hitherto under-acknowledged importance of under standing the nature of the representation of technology in the sources that have survived. The case studies show that the descriptions of ancient technology are as rarefied and 'artful' as those of Columella and Hesiod for agriculture. Importantly, the case studies illustrate the ways in which ancient descriptions of technology were social and political on a symbolic level - technological knowledge questioned social stability and political stasis through its emphasis on transformation, change, and innovation. Cuomo acknowledges the preliminary nature of her investigations in the case studies, and gives many suggestions for important future directions: 'Let a thousand history-of-ancient-technology flowers bloom!' (166). By contrast, The Oxford Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World does what you expect a book on technology to do.7 It sets out to survey the role of technology in Greek and Roman cultures, from the eighth century BC to the fifth century AD, aimed particularly at those new to the subject. For this readership, the book provides intro ductory chapters on many aspects of ancient technology, written by an excellent line-up of authors. There are some good illustrations (e.g. Lancaster's chapter) that answer the need in us to understand 'how it all worked', and the chapter 6 Technology and Culture in Greek and Roman Antiquity.

The book is divided into eight parts. The first (in three chapters) deals with the sources for ancient technology - literary, icono graphie, and archaeological - and with the historiography of the subject. This section 'sets the stage for the consideration of individual technologies' (7). Ironically, the author chosen to tackle the written sources is Serafina Cuomo; she is thus forced into the position of doing exactly what she aims not to do in her own book, despite the content of her contribution. The second section (five chapters) is on primary or extractive technologies, such as mining, fishing, and quarrying. Section three looks at engineering and complex machines, such as hydraulic engineering, tunnels, and canals. Eight chapters make up section 4 on secondary or manufacturing processes. These include food processing, metalworking, and ceramic production. The fifth section deals with transport and the movement of goods and people. Two chapters make up the next section, on technologies of death - both of which deal with warfare and fortifications, rather than the death of individuals. The technologies of the mind - books, timekeeping, gadgets, and so forth - form the seventh section. The last section, on ancient technology in the modern world, contains one chapter on ethnoarchaeology and its potential for exploring ancient technology. The volume is useful and instructive and provides an excellent introduction to the diversity of ancient culture. Perhaps a little surprising is a lack of awareness (except, obviously, in the final chapter) of the anthropological and ethnoarchaeological work that has focused on understanding technological processes, and specific choices (such as the work of Olivier Gosselain for ceramics, or Sander van der Leeuw for innovation). As a result, the social dimensions of technology, though implicit, are almost completely absent. The Cambridge Economic History of the Greco-Roman World sets out with two aims: to summarize the state of knowledge in this vast subject, and to contribute to shaping the future research in the area.8 The book represents the first time that a single-volume economic history of the Greco-Roman world has been published, and this is attributed largely to the recent acknowledgement of the importance of archaeo logical data (including inscriptions, papyri, coins, etc.) in prompting alternative ways of looking at the ancient economy. It is also partially justified by the assumption that the major cultural achievements of classical antiquity were possible only because of the continued growth of the economy. The editors point out three 'challenges' for the twenty-first century: first, through the more systematic use of archaeological data, to find ways of documenting economic performance more accurately; second, to continue the example set by Finley and Hopkins in engaging with social sciences in order to understand better the roles of institutions and ideologies in economic devel opment; and third, to pursue comparative analyses to investigate the ultimate decline in economic good fortune. The volume provides the basis and springboard for tackling these challenges. A brief introduction sets out clearly and concisely the primi tivist- modernist-substantivist-formalist (and so forth) debates in order to contextualize the rest of the volume. This is followed by five chapters on the 'core analytical categories' that are relevant to the rest of the book. These deal with ecology, demography, household and gender, and technology. The inclusion of gender as a core category is a particularly welcome symptom of the widespread acceptance of the centrality of gender in studies of the ancient world, and is representative of the way in 8 The Cambridge Economic History of the Greco-Roman World.

A possible exception to this might be the treatment of technology, which, while representative of its field in terms of its approach (see the Oleson volume above), is also representative of it in neglecting recent anthropological approaches to technology. Thereafter, the book is organized into seven further parts, arranged chronologically. Part II covers the build-up to the classical period in Greece. Two chapters give the historical background ('Aegean Bronze Age' and 'Early Iron Age Greece'), two chapters give a wider Mediterranean view (central and western Mediterranean, and the Persian Near East). One chapter is devoted to Archaic Greece. Part III is on classical Greece, with chapters on production (agricultural and marine, labour, capital), distribution (trade), and consumption. Part IV widens the view out to the Hellenistic states, divided into three chapters: 'Hellenistic Near-East', 'Hellenistic Egypt', and 'Greece and Western Asia-Minor'. The rest of the book is devoted to Italy. Part V, 'Early Italy and the Roman Republic', includes one chapter on 'Early Roman Italy' (which should be read in conjunction with the earlier Chapter 9, the 'Iron Age in the Western Mediterranean') and one on the 'Late Republic'. The early Roman Empire is the subject of Part VI and follows the structure of Part III, with chapters on production, distribution, and consumption. A fourth chapter deals with the state and the economy. Part VII considers 'Regional Development in the Roman Empire', with chapters on 'Western Provinces', 'Eastern Mediterranean', 'Roman Egypt', and 'Frontier Zones' (Britain and North Africa). Part VIII, an epilogue, considers the transition to late antiquity. The selection of authors is excellent: individuals who have transformed the field in the past twenty years, all of whom write in a clear, succinct style. They give excellent summaries of often contested and controversial subjects, in which debate has raged in a number of languages. The book provides an essential and exciting introduction for those new to the subject and, for the not so new, the meticulously well-informed and up-to-date syntheses of the current scholarly debate will be invaluable. Thomas Schmitz's Modern Literary Theory and Ancient Texts is a translation of a work first published in German in 2002, targeted primarily at students of Classics.9 Though its style is sometimes stilted - the section entitled 'Whither now?' sounds better in German - and its tone is unashamedly didactic, it is a clear and engaging introduction to some of the most important areas of modern literary theorizing, which begins with an awareness that literary theory is prone to 'evoke strong reactions (ranging from mild irritation to utmost anger)' (3). What sets this apart from a simple introduction, however, is the way that the general theoretical position outlined in each chapter is keyed into the context of modern classical studies (for example, Bakhtin on Petronius' Satyrica, Reader-Response criticism on Ovid's Metamorphoses). One slight disap pointment is that this 'modern' introduction has only a paragraph on postcolonial theory (206-7) and fails to give any attention to the important theoretical advances that have been made (and are still being made) in the area of reception studies. This is, however, a useful book and one that can be strongly recommended to undergrad uates and even intrepid sixth-formers - though caveat lector when any author tells you that he is 'deeply aware' of his 'own prejudices and limitations' and that he considers it 'an act of honesty' towards his readers 'to be frank about these limitations instead of 9 Modern Literary Theory and Ancient Texts.

From theory explained to theory in action. In Figuratively Speaking, Sarah Spence sets out to demonstrate the important role played by figurative language in the articulation and communication of a culture's concerns and obsessions, from Roman antiquity through to 'our present, post 9/11 moment' (back cover).10 The topic is an interesting one, but the non-specialist reader needs to approach the book with some caution. It does not seem ideally suited to its target audience of 'anyone thinking about the Classical world for the first time and for all who welcome the challenge of new perspectives on Classical culture' (back cover). An accessible and often illuminating engagement with popular culture ('Rhetoric is a Jedi mind trick. Like Obi-Wan Kenobi, the orator sets out to make you see things his way' [9]) is mixed with impene trable-seeming statements: The premise of this book is that, in the western tradition, figurative speech - using language to do more than name - provides the main way that language articulates possibility. It argues for a reassertion of the fundamental importance of rhetoric and the acknowledgement that there are embedded 'tropes of possibility' for each culture that offer means of enabling - as well as, admit tedly, destroying - the potential ofthat culture. (10) It is not that the argument is uninteresting or lacking in sophistication, but that it does not show enough of the working to allow the intended reader to see how the argument holds together. On a trivial level, for example, the figure of the chiasm (sic) is explained as follows: 'The name derives from the Greek letter X, chi, since the figure works by inverting terms' (97). The reader who already knows what a chiasmus is will have no difficulty with this explanation, but the one who doesn't might be justi fiably perplexed. More important for the wider thesis of the book is the simple declaration that the use of repetition (anaphora) in the classical world was as 'a form of superficial decoration, a stylistic element added for emphasis', whilst 'in the sign systems of our culture, repetition has migrated from superficial ornamentation to deep structural principle'. This observation is used to provide 'a glimpse of what differentiates our era from all others' (19). But it is not obvious why we should accept this as a given: was repetition not always a fundamental cultural 'building block' from Homer onwards? 'Imagine a time when the world's greatest living mathema tician was a woman, indeed a physically beautiful woman, and a woman who was simultaneously the world's leading astronomer' (13): so begins Deakin's enthusiastic biography of the fifth-century AD philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician Hypatia, most famous for meeting her death at the hands of a Christian mob, appar ently instigated by the bishop and future saint Cyril of Alexandria.11 The story is a good one, explored in fictional form by Charles Kingsley in his Hypatia. Deakin's biography developed out of a paper in the American Mathematical Monthly, 'Hypatia and her Mathematics', and claims to be the first ever biography to give a serious assessment of her work as a mathematician. Unfortunately, the transformation from technical article to generally accessible book is not a success. First and most impor tantly, the discussion of Hypatia and her place within the social, political, intellectual, and religious world of fifth-century AD Alexandria is based on woefully inadequate 10 Figuratively Speaking.

To add insult to injury, the serious mathematical emphasis of the work is presented apologetically: because of the 'mathophobia' that is imagined to be suffered by the majority of the audience, Deakin has 'felt compelled to confine most of the technical details to the first of the appendixes' (15). Classical Mythology. A Very Short Introduction presents an understanding of myths 'not as fossilized entities, but as living agents' (2), with the aim of underlining the enduring relevance of myth, however we understand the term.12 This is an excellent introduction - written in an engaging style and well illustrated - in short sections and chapters, often thought-provoking and always interesting. It takes its remit as a 'very short introduc tion' seriously and does not indulge in the attempt to summarize the whole of mythology. For Morales, classical myth is 'a continual process of telling and retelling, of provoking and responding, of critiquing and revising' (115). The powerful diversity and vitality of that process is brought out through such contrasting examples as a Key Stage 2 lesson plan for a mythology project from a National Curriculum teacher's manual, Siegmund Freud's bookplate (with predictable illustration), and the lesbian subtext to a kiss shared between Xena: Warrior Princess and Gabrielle. Importantly, this short introduction gives emphasis to the Roman contribution to 'mythology'; along the way, it confronts and debunks one of the most influential popular propo nents of classical mythography in modern times: Robert Graves, along with his Greek Myths and White Goddess. Birds in the Ancient World from A to Z, part of a series that already includes 'Food', 'Sex', 'Sport', and 'Greek and Roman Dress', is clearly something of a labour of love, written by a distinguished classicist and dedicated 'to the members of the Leeds Birdwatchers Club and the local group of the RSPB'.13 In essence this is an updated version of D'Arcy Thompson's A Glossary of Greek Birds (first edition 1895; second edition 1936) that takes on board the ornithological advances that have been made in terms of naming and identification, and it is explicitly designed to be accessible by readers without ancient Greek. It contains an extensive bibliography, where Eduard Fraenkel's edition of Aeschylus' Agamemnon can be found next to an article on the 'Greenland White-fronted Goose'. Even for those without any particular ornithological interest this is a book that exerts a curious fascination. Those who have read their Catullus will want to consult the discussion on the identity of Lesbia's passer, though one feels that the 'answer' may disappoint many: 'House Sparrow is the obvious identification of Lesbia's pet, but has proved generally unacceptable because adult Sparrows do not respond to domestication, being intractable and unfriendly to strangers' - but not so, 'if removed from its nest when only a few days old' (228). From feathered friends to Winged Words. Flight in Poetry and History by Piero Boitani - whose very name sounds like that of an early aviator - is not simply a book about flying, but an eccentric, impressionistic, and exuberant celebration of the meaning and potential of flight through a 'series of personal journeys through the Western imaginaire' (ix).14 This is not a book with an obvious argument, and it is striking that the story that it does not tell is easier for the 12 Classical Mythology.

Like a metaphorical performance of flight itself, Winged Words ranges freely over a vast expanse of material: historical, mythical, and poetic (with chapters on Pegasus, Icarus, Hermes, Halcyons, Eagles, Mus?e des Beaux Arts, Night Flights, and finally, perhaps inevitably, '2001: The Mad Flight'). There is much of interest and moments of real exhilaration - it is hard not to be infected by the intellectual wanderlust that is a defining feature of the European humanist tradition. Though one may arrive at the end a little weary and a little giddy, one cannot regret the ride. It certainly sets a new standard for the airport novel. The Greek and indigenous settlements of the Black Sea area are renowned for the extraordinary wealth of their material culture. They are also as famous for the controversy that they provoke over the accuracy of Herodotus' description of the area. However, much of the archaeological and methodological material has been inaccessible to a non-Russian-reading audience. Classical Olbia and the Scythian World presents the proceedings of a conference held in 2001 on the settlement and, to a lesser extent, the region of Olbia, but the papers presented are more like those of a thoughtful introduction to this otherwise little-known (except through the work of Braund himself) area.15 The volume introduces material from recent (and less recent) excavations, with excellent (though not numerous) illustra tions, and raises some of the contentious issues in the field. These include the problems of assigning ethnicity through archaeological data, the arguments for an early non-Greek presence at the site, and the nature of Herodotus' testimony. The volume spans the period from roughly 600 BC to the Roman Empire. It provides an excellent introduction to the material and debates in this single area, and it provides a counterpoint to studies of the colonization of the central Mediterranean. The extension of traditional disciplinary boundaries is exemplified in another Blackwell companion, this time A Companion to Classical Receptions.16 The study of the ways in which 'Greek and Roman material is transmitted, translated, excerpted, interpreted, re-written, re-imaged and represented' (1) forms a working definition of the scope of reception studies in Classics. The book complements the recent A Companion to the Classical Tradition (see G&amp;R 55.1), and the first chapter attempts, through two careful case studies, to illustrate the differences (and similarities) between the two. Throughout the book, authors take individual positions and lines of enquiry that give a varied picture of complementary work in the field. The first part deals with the reception of antiquity in antiquity, and these chapters raise the dual potential of reception as a means of understanding our own 'pictures' of the past (how we have come to see the ancient world as we do), and as a means of understanding the processes of historical regeneration. Moving from ancient to modern receptions, Part II examines the more public, institutional transmission of Classics, with a particular emphasis on education. Four chapters deal with translation of different sorts in Part III, while in Part IV the twentieth-century re-working of classics on a theoretical level (feminist theory, Gide, Freud) are discussed. Parts V and VI concern specific fields in 15 Classical Olbia and the Scythian World. From the sixth century BC to the second century AD. Edited by David Braund and S. D. Kryzhitskiy.

Part VIII examines areas of radical translocation of classical material (Derek Walcott, von Gloeden). Part IX contains a chapter on the future of reception studies. Taking an indissoluble link between the future of classical studies and the future of classical receptions as its starting point, the chapter raises several potential directions that may prompt gloom or enthusiasm in readers; importantly, this volume (along with Kallendorf [ed.], A Companion to the Classical Tradition, 2007 and Martindale and Thomas [eds.], Classics and the Uses of Reception, 2006) exemplifies the recent boom in reception studies, and its potential to critique our subject and methodology. There have been two recent additions to the modern reception of the classical world: a historical crime novel and a graphic novel (neither of which genres finds space in the Companion). Betrayal. Part One is volume 3 A of the Age of Bronze series that sets out graphically to tell the story of the Trojan War.17 The story picks up at the point where the Achaean army sets sail after the sacrifice of Iphigenia. The novel uses a range of sources in order to tell this version of the story, and the graphic representation and selection of scenes would provide rich pickings for students of reception. The presentation of the story as a comic strip is gripping, and the cinematic techniques lead to some arresting highlighting of elements in the tale. Death Comes by Amphora is the unprom ising title of a murder mystery set in Athens in 461 BC.18 The plot is at times reminiscent of Samoza's The Athenian Murders (though perhaps less contorted), and the prose more mechanical: 'Two grey lines like legs stretching down from the city showed where the Long Walls were being built that would protect this area against enemy attack and ensure access to the port' (5); 'Lysania bristled.
