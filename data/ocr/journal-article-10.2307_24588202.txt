Immigration can provide an impetus for significant change in most spheres of society. Within the arts this is becoming increasingly apparent. One may anticipate with a considerable degree of optimism the impact of an immigrant sensibility on the existing indigenous cultural milieu. Some examples are already in evidence in this year's fine art graduate exhibitions. In IADT Dun Laoghaire, film production continues to flourish. Hana Dirya, who was born in Somalia and is a refugee to this country, created a short film entitled Diving Within. The film focuses on the seemingly mundane activity of swimming in the sea at Dun Laoghaire, but is, in effect, a visual essay which explores issues around integration and the politics of difference. NCAD painting student Riin Kaljurand, from Estonia, questions the social con straints inflicted on women in her statement derived in part from deconstructed Soviet magazine imagery and re-imagined in contemporary terms. Installation work employing a synthesis of film, sound and sculpture produced by Slovenian student Enya Fortuna at the Crawford College of Art and Design [CIT] delivers a Marxist meditation on labour and consumption resulting in a work of great assurance. In the Dublin Institute of Technology [DIT] Karl Leonard uses video to capture a paradox with Vis[able], a visual essay exploring the coping strategies employed by people with sight impairment. In an attempt to envision the invisible he exposes popular prejudices associated with this condition. GMIT [Letterfrack] specializes in Furniture Design. Michael Harris, from South Africa, produced a body of work that successfully fused digital technology with tradi tional carpentry skills. Harris brings a particular focus to bear on functionality and ele gance and in so doing illustrates an additional common theme to this year's coterie of graduates.

Situated in a limestone quarry in Glenarm village, Co Antrim, it enlivens and revives a shaped landscape that constitutes the type of special space that good architects have always built and should be still building today. LSAD fashion student Bridget Murphy develops this theme of enhanced emotive functionality in a collection of 'Untitled forms' based on imagery inspired by American abstract painter Franz Klein. This type of media 'borrowing' has frequently occurred in the past, often very successfully. At best it works well when synthesized conceptually and formally. At its worst it can appear as an afterthought intended to enhance the 'wow of the now' factor. In this case however the critical consensus sug gests that Murphy's work is convincingly edgy and well executed showing an assur ance and independence of spirit that is the hallmark of the Limerick Fashion School. The high achievers in the class of 2015 reflect the beginnings of a new cultural diversity within Ireland. Change is inevitable, but if we are fortunate then develop ment may flow from that change. The erosion of false distinctions between the activ ities of art and design, of which there was a strong indication in last year's graduate cohort, has been sustained in 2015. ■ Gerry Walker is a freelance writer and critic. 391 I AUTUMN 2015 I IRISH ARTS REVIEW or optimism tne impact or an immigrant sensiDinry on tne milieu.

From the technological (such as smartphone apps), wjjP to the haptic (such as folding paper money in specific ways in order to make it easier to decipher each note), the viewer learns how each person adapts to better function in society. In the 1970s photographer Allan Sekula lambasted documentary photography for the violence it inflicts on its subjects by reducing them to 'victims'. The ultimate strength in Leonard's project is that it avoids such victimisation by giving voice to the participants. Rather than employing pity to elicit sympathy the video is grounded in a sense of empowerment, achievement and agency. This is highlighted in participant Marian Deane's closing comment which wryly weaves notions of sight and power around one another. 'You have to accept your fate because if you don't you might as well lie down and die.

Amidst a notably strong degree cohort, with some very assured film and projection installations, Fortuna's work stood out by dint of its sophisticated production values. Where White Egrets Spawn was a coherent, immersive installation employing film, sound and sculptural elements to mesmeric effect. A looming, angular slide or shoot bisected the room at an angle, while a single spotlight picked out the crystalline qualities of a crumbled mound of rock salt piled against the wall. The film, epic in scale, was shot on location in and around Lake Bled in north-western Slovenia, moving between limpid, gorgeously framed landscape shots, and hypnotically choreographed scenes set in a hyper modern office interior and a bizarre underground tunnel system. The accompanying sound-scape became a sculptural presence in itself, pressing in against the viewer, taking up palpable space. Fortuna also designed a series of performances which drew lyrical links between the sculptural elements and the film. Echoing the staccato choreography used in the film, Fortuna slowly and methodically mined the pile of rock salt with a silver pick axe, before climbing the steep metal structure with exertion. Sound again was an important consideration; Fortuna's breath and stillness creating tension between spectator and per former. For all of these complex disparate elements however, the overall impression was one of thoughtfully judged restraint and meticulous design which united the ensemble Enya Fortuna is the recipient of the Best Moving Image and Solo Show (Cork Film Centre), Art Fest Prize, Development Bursary Award (Cork Institute of Technology) and the Lismore Castle Shortlist Graduate Award. ■ Sarah Kelleher is an independent arts writer and a PhD candidate with the History of Art Department in UCC.
