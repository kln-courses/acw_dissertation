Zbenovich1 The Tripolye culture of the sixth and fifth millennia B.R, which spread over the territory of what is today Ukraine and Moldova, holds a special place in the prehistoric archaeology of southeastern Europe. This major European culture of the Copper Age existed for about 1500 years and survived as a rudiment of painted pottery cultures until the beginning of the Bronze Age. Its archaeological embodiment is highly diverse, expressive, and distinctive. Forming the eastern fringe of the Balkan-Danube early farming cultures, the Tripolye culture came into close contact with the world of the nomadic steppe herders, and both influenced their culture and was, in turn, influenced by them. This article attempts to synthesize the Tripolye culture archaeology on the occasion of the recent centenary of its investigation. KEY WORDS: southeastern Europe; Copper Age; Tripolye culture; early farmers. INTRODUCTION In 1893, V. Khvoiko, an archaeologist from Kiev, started systematic excavations of several prehistoric settlements in the vicinity of the Village of Tripolye on the right bank of the Dnieper, south of Kiev. Sue years later, he reported to a Russian archaeological congress that a new archaeological culture had been discovered and named after the type-site (Khvoiko, 1901). Khvoiko and other archaeologists (E. Stern, A. Spitsin, and N. Bili yashevski), who investigated similar sites in the early twentieth century, cor rectly assessed them to have been a significant phenomenon of prehistory and an integral part of the European early farming cultures of the Copper Age. lIsrael Antiquities Authority, Main Office, P.O.B. 586, Jerusalem 91004, Israel. 199 0892-7537/96/0600-Ol99$09JO/0 O 19% Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">200 Zbenovich During the 1920s and 1930s, extensive excavations of Tripolian sites were conducted over much of the Ukraine west of the Dnieper. Among the key sites investigated were Kolomijshchina settlements I and II on the Dnieper (excavated by T. S. Passek and E. Y. Krichevski), Vladimirovka on the Bug (T S. Passek), and a settlement and several cemeteries in the village of Usatovo near Odessa (M. E Boltenko, E. E Lagodovskaya). These excavations yielded materials for studying the regional and chrono logical peculiarities of the Tripolye culture (Passek, 1949). Major fieldwork in the Dniester basin (S. N. Bibikov, T S. Passek) and the interfluve of the Dniester and the Southern Bug (M. I. Artamonov) started during the late 1940s to early 1950s and continued for many years. Many new sites of the Tripolye culture were discovered and analyzed (Passek, 1961). Throughout the 1950s to 1970s, V I. Markevich surveyed and excavated a great number of Tripolian settlements between the Prut and the Dniester and plotted over 300 sites on the archaeological map of Moldova (Markevich, 1973). Excavations continued in the Dnieper region (Kruts, 1977), in Volyn (N. A. Peleshchishin, V M. Konoplja), and near Odessa (Zbenovich, 1974; Patokova, 1979; Patokova et aL, 1989). During the 1970s and 1980s, Ukrainian and Moldavian archaeologists investigated many barrow-mounds with Tripolye culture graves (Dergachev and Man zura, 1991). Intensive work has been conducted in the Southern Bug basin and the Bug-Dnieper interfluve over the last two decades by such archae ologists as I. I. Zaets, T G. Movsha, N. M. Shmaglii, V. A. Kruts, E. V. Tsvek, S. N. Ryzhov, M. Y. Videjko, and S. A. Gusev. Today, we are aware of over 1300 settlements and cemeteries of the Tripolye culture, which encompasses an area of about 180,000 km2. The territory of the culture was bordered by the Prut and the middle and some of the upper Dniester valley in the west, the Dnieper in the east (some sites have also been found in the Dnieper left-bank region near Kiev), the upper reaches of the right-bank tributaries of the Pripyat in the north, and the Black Sea coast in the south. At the same time as the Tripolye studies, the Cucuteni culture, named after the well-known, stratified type-site (Schmidt, 1932), and sites imme diately predating it (categorized by Romanian scholars as a separate "Pre cucuteni" culture) were investigated west of the Prut in the territory of Romanian Moldova. More than 1400 settlements of these cultures have been discovered (Marinescu-Bilcu, 1974; Monah and Cucos, 1985). Tripolye and Cucuteni have a common origin, were closely interconnected and had a parallel development, and are therefore regarded as parts of a single Cucuteni-Tripolye cultural-historical unit. Western scholars are familiar with the results of the Cucuteni studies through monographs, articles, and detailed English, French, and German summaries (Marinescu-Bilcu, 1981;</page><page sequence="3">The Tripolye Culture 201 Petrescu-Dimbovita, 1987; Monah and Cucos, 1985). In contrast, knowledge of the Tripolye culture is culled mainly from "second-hand" or outdated sources, despite the wealth of literature on the subject. This article briefly describes the Tripolye culture, based on the latest archaeological discoveries, and examines controversial issues and the prob lems facing scholars of Tripolye. SOME ISSUES OF PERIODIZATION AND ABSOLUTE DATING In the last few years, the systematization and spatiotemporal classifi cation of sites has been a priority in Tripolye studies. For there to be re liable data on the development of the culture, such as the sequence in which Tripolian people settled new regions or demographic processes, there must be an objective and detailed periodization. In the late 1940s, Passek advanced a general periodization system for the Tripolian sites. She divided the culture's developmental span into three periods: early (Tripolye A), middle (B), and late (C). The two later periods were subdivided into early and late stages: BI and BII, CI/y I and CH/y II, respectively. The Greek letter, y&gt; was used to stress the specific regional features distinguishing the southern Tripolye sites from the northern ones (C) (Passek, 1949). Later, the intermediate stage BI-BII was distinguished (Vinogradova, 1983). Passek's periodization was based primarily on ty pological analysis of the ceramics, since stratified Tripolian settlements are very rare. Nevertheless, the materials from stratified sites of the Cucuteni culture confirm that Passek's system objectively reflects the Tripolye devel opmental sequence. This periodization has been universally accepted and is widely used as a basic chronological benchmark. Today, however, archaeologists investigating the Tripolye culture in various areas often do not emphasize the placement of sites within a rigid chronological framework. Instead, they frequently base the regional chronological systematization on the concept of the "site-type," a structural unit of an archaeological culture. Sites with identical assemblages have con crete temporal and regional boundaries. They are succeeded by new sites, which gradually develop assemblages dominated by the elements that were introduced in the earlier sites. A statistically recorded change in the shape and decoration of ceramics is a sensitive indicator of a culture's develop mental sequence through time. Groups of identical settlements, succeeded one by another, are usually named after the type-site that has been most thoroughly analyzed. Together, they form a regional group or variant, which may last for a long period of</page><page sequence="4">202 Zbenovich Carpathian Basin cultures Thrace NW fbnfic region |_Globular Amphorae EZERO Funnel Beakers Bodrogkereszfur Lengyel Tiszapolgar Lengyel -i Transitional period Karanovo vj Varna Lower Danube cultures Lengyel Tisza Cucuteni-Tnpolyej Horodistea Foltest.

In par ticular, for the Prut-Dniester interfluve, a comparatively well-investigated region of the Tripolye culture, 24 site-types have been defined: 6 of these types fall within the early period, 7 within the middle, and 11 within the late period (Chernysh, 1982, Table 9). In this article, I use primarily the Passek chronological system (Fig. 1), although at times I refer to the main site-types. Overall, the development of the Tripolye culture lasted for about 1500 years: early period (5900-5600 B.P.), middle period (5600-4900 B.P.; stage BI, 5600-5300 B.P., BI-BII, 5300-5100 B.P., BII, 5100-4900 B.P.), late pe riod (4900-4700/4600 B.P), and final stage (4700/4600-4400/4300 B.P). Ta ble I provides the most reliable radiocarbon dates (B.P.) for the Tripolye culture, which coincide with 14C dating for the Cucuteni culture (Monah,</page><page sequence="5">The Tripolye Culture 203 1987) and are partly confirmed by the results of archaeomagnetic dating (Telegin, 1985). THE ORIGIN OF THE TRIPOLYE CULTURE AND TERRITORIAL EXPANSION The initial formation of the Cucuteni-Tripolye cultural-historical unit is related to the more widespread process of transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic in southeastern Europe at the end of the seventh mil lennium B.P., which involves intensive population contacts and further ex pansion of the Balkan-Danube agricultural oekumene. The origins of the cultural-historical unit lie in the western part of Romanian Moldova, where the people of the Boian culture (of Lower Danube origin) came into con tact with the descendants of the Linear Pottery population. This process of integration resulted in the emergence of settlements such as Traian Dealul Viei, Erestegin, and others, which shared obvious features with the two donor cultures (Dumitrescu, 1963; Marinesku-Bilcu, 1974). Materials of this formative (I) phase of the Precucuteni culture also reflect the con tribution of Cris and Turdas, the other Moldavian and Transylvanian Late Neolithic cultures. The fully fledged Precucuteni culture spread over a wider region, as indicated by the sites of phase II: Izvoare 1-1 and Ghigoesti-Trudesti in the Carpathian foothills, Larga-Jijia on the right bank of the Prut, and others. These sites all contain similar ceramic assemblages, tools, and anthropomor phic figurines. Identical settlements have been discovered on the left bank of the Prut in Moldova, at the sites of Floreshty, Rogozhany, and others, and on the Dniester at Bernashevka. Thus, there can be no doubt that the culture's eastward expansion was early and rapid. However, the bulk of the population remained in the zone where the Precucuteni culture had been formed. Stratified sites, such as the tell of Poduri-Dealul Ghindaru (Monah, 1987), provide evidence for this long and continuous evolution. During a comparatively short span of time, the new population of the Dniester valley increased, and perhaps because of overpopulation, some groups moved farther eastward toward the Southern Bug (Fig. 2), then oc cupied by the last settlements of the local Neolithic Bug-Dniester culture, whose inhabitants were assimilated by the newcomers (Shaposhnikova and Tovkailo, 1989; Zbenovich, 1989). The abandonment of their native territory for a new habitat, their mobility, and relative isolation affected the lifeways and the material cul ture of the population of the Dniester-Southern Bug region?that is, the early Tripoiians. Hunting began to play an important role in their subsis</page><page sequence="6">204 Zbenovich Fig. 2. Key sites and expansion sequences of Tripolye culture.

Pit-dwellings, rare in the Precucuteni area, were used in the east alongside clay houses. Pottery decorated with incised spiral ornamen tation became the most characteristic feature of the early and middle Tri polye ceramic assemblage. Meanwhile, in the area between the Carpathian foothills and the Prut, a high-quality ware appeared, which was painted prior to firing, marking the beginning of the Cucuteni culture. The subsequent development of the Tripolye culture reflects a steady territorial expansion eastward (Fig. 2). At the beginning of the middle pe riod, groups settled in the Southern Bug basin and part of the Bug-Dnieper</page><page sequence="7">The Tripolye Culture 205 interfluve, finally reaching the Dnieper south of Kiev (Tsvek, 1980, 1989). At the beginning of the later period (stage CI), the Tripolians migrated as far as the latitude of Kiev and crossed to the left bank of the Dnieper (Knits, 1977). Populations originating in western regions also contributed to this pri mary flow of people. In comparison to the 60 known Precucuteni settle ments (Marinescu-Bilcu, 1974), at least 650 sites of the first stage (A) of the Cucuteni culture have been discovered (Monah and Cucos, 1985), while there are fewer than 100 contemporaneous Tripolian settlements of the BI stage. Overpopulation in the Cucuteni culture area, or "demographic ex plosion," compelled part of the people to move to less densely populated territories east of the Dniester. Makers of polychrome, white-red-and-black ceramics appeared in the Dniester basin at sites such as Polivanov Yar and Nezvysko. These people later expanded into the Bug valley. In stage BII or somewhat earlier, another wave of people from the Prut-Dniester interfluve entered the southern part of the Bug basin, where began a long-lasting local variant of the culture with painted pottery, the Vladimirovka group. At the beginning of the later period, groups moving from the middle Dniester valley northward and northeastward settled in the Volyn area (Fig. 2). These processes led to the integration and assimi lation of various Tripolian groups, and the material culture, particularly the pottery assemblage, began to assume a syncretic character. SETTLEMENTS AND DWELLINGS Although the topography of each Tripolian site varies by location, all are situated near a water source. Early-period settlements are usually found near the edge of the first river terrace, 2-7 m above the water level, or on the slopes of terraces and gullies. Sites of the middle and late periods are mostly perched on promontories of steep river banks or plateaux. A few of the settlements of these periods have been fortified with ramparts and ditches, including Polivanov Yar (Passek, 1961), Kosteshty IV (Markevich, 1981), and Mayaki (Zbenovich, 1974). Generally, the settlements of the early period covered an area of 0.5-6 ha and contained no more than 15 dwellings. Later, Tripolians also built larger settlements, which were 20-40 ha in size and contained around 200 dwellings. Some settlements in the eastern part of the Tripolye territory, such as Vesely Kut in the Bug-Dnieper interfluve, were as large as 150 ha (Tsvek, 1980). In the beginning of the late period, more of the larger set tlement types appeared. The 1970s saw the sensational discovery, through aerial photographs (Shishkin, 1973) and through excavations (Shmaglii,</page><page sequence="8">206 Zbenovich Fig. 3.

Shmaglii). l?Ploshchadka (clay platform); 2?contours of ploshchadka; 3?barrow-mound; 4?water</page><page sequence="9">The Tripolye Culture 207 1980; Knits, 1989) of some extremely large sites in the Southern Bug re gion: Talyanki (450 ha), Majdanetskoye (270 ha; Fig. 3), Dobrovody (250 ha), and Nebelivka (220 ha). These enormous settlements contained be tween 1300 and 2700 buildings, 75% of which were dwellings and the re mainder of which were structures for domestic activities (Kruts, 1989). Many of the early Tripolian settlements lacked clear-cut spatial pat terning; in others, the dwellings were arranged in several parallel rows along the river bank or in small clusters. The Bernashevka settlement on the Dniester is unique in having six dwellings forming a distinct circle, with the seventh located in the center (Zbenovich, 1989). This circular or ellip soidal arrangement, often with several concentric circles, became typical of settlements of the middle and late periods (Fig. 3). The maximum number of such circular streets is 10, which was recorded in the densely built set tlement of Petreny, containing about 500 buildings in a 30-ha area (Markevich, 1981). Two main types of dwellings are characteristic of the Tripolye culture: pit dwellings and clay houses on a wooden substructure (the ploshchadka, or platform). Among the early-period settlements, sites contained either all houses or all pit dwellings. Pit dwellings are found in subsequent periods also, primarily in settlements east of the Dniester, where dwellings with both surface and subterranean sections have been discovered. The pit dwellings were usually oval or consisted of two adjoining pits averaging 30 m2 with a depth of 1.5-3 m. In some instances, there were small round pits for poles which provided support for the roof of the dwelling. The interior of the pit dwellings contain open fires, as well as storage pits and niches. There is usually a concentration of querns, pottery, faunal remains, and numerous shells near a stone hearth. Some areas of a pit dwelling were connected with production activities (that is, flint processing). Soon after arrival at a new location, easily constructed subterranean dwellings were built by the pioneer settlers. Later, after having adapted to the new conditions, they would begin to build clay houses. Rectangular houses with floor areas of 20-50 m2 (7-10 m long and 3-5 m wide) pre dominated in early Tripolian settlements, although larger buildings (50-90 m2) are also found. The interior of the rectangular houses, usually consist ing of one or two cells, contained several stoves or open-fire hearths, spaces for everyday activities, and, occasionally, altars. In settlements of the middle and the beginning of the late period, dis tinct regional traditions of clay architecture evolved. The houses became larger, with an average floor space of 50-100 m2. Houses of 120-150 m2 were common, while others had floor spaces of 180-200 m2. The interior of the houses became more complex: in many instances, especially in the eastern regions, they were divided into three to five cells. These houses</page><page sequence="10">208 Zbenovich contained various clay features, such as stoves, couches, benches, and troughs for grinding grain, as well as round, rectangular and cross-shaped altars. Some 50 years ago, Krichevski (1940) and Passek (1949) suggested a reconstruction of a typical Tripolian house, as represented by its clay plosh chadka. According to their hypothesis, a timber substructure was placed directly on the ground, covered by a layer of clay 20-25 cm thick, and then fired. This platform formed the floor of a one-story house, with wattle and daub walls and internal partitions, and a pitched roof constructed of poles and straw. At the time, Krichevski's and Passek's reconstruction was unre servedly accepted by archaeologists. During the 1970s, the "heretical" suggestion was made that Tripolian houses had two stories (Zinkovski, 1973). This notion was first advanced by Markevich and now has many proponents. According to this idea, a Tripolian house had one or two stories with a loft connected by ladders and an earthen floor possibly covered by a layer of wet clay. Proponents of this view argue that the "platform" is the collapsed floor of the second story or loft, baked by the burning of the building. Another collapsed plat form separated the second story from the loft and was supposedly sup ported by thick adobe house walls. They suggest that the ground floor was used for domestic and manufacturing activities, while the second story served as living rooms (Zinkovski, 1973; Markevich, 1981; Chernysh, 1982; Kruts, 1989). The adherents of this view believe that although traces of fire can be seen in every Tripolian house, firing was not a part of the con struction process, but Tripolians deliberately destroyed their houses and set tlements by setting them on fire. This alternative approach to the issue of Tripolian house-building has undoubtedly played a positive role, by stimulating a more careful exami nation and analysis of building remains during excavations. However, while enriching the earlier view, it has failed to prove that the latter is untenable. Many aspects of the new ideas conflict with the archaeological facts (Koles nikov, 1993a) and need further corroboration. Specifically, the numerous clay models of Tripolian dwellings (see Fig. 12 below) extensively referred to by the supporters of the new concept, including the model from Ros sokhovatka (Fig. 12: 7), do not support the two-story idea. Likewise, there is no corroboration for the speculation that a Tripolian holocaust simulta neously destroyed hundreds of dwellings. The remains of clay houses bearing a strong resemblance to the Tri polian ploshchadki are found in many settlements dating to the early farm ing cultures of the Balkan-Danube region (Zbenovich, 1989; Tringham et al., 1992). Thus, the controversial issues of Tripolian house-building, which</page><page sequence="11">The Tripolye Culture 209 go far beyond the boundaries of a single archaeological culture, have yet to be carefully and objectively investigated. CEMETERIES AND BURIAL CUSTOMS There are very few burials known from the early and middle Tripolye (Movsha, 1960; Chernysh, 1982). These few, directly linked to the dwellings, may reflect cult concepts of regeneration and fertility (Bibikov, 1953), but they do not provide information about burial customs. No cemeteries dating to the early and middle periods have yet been found, and this lack of evi dence has given rise to the assumption that the deceased were cremated in the fields outside the settlements (Kruts, 1989). Cemeteries in the early farming cultures of southeastern Europe varied in location from inside the settlements, to their outskirts, to great distances away. These cultures were very similar to the Tripolye culture in terms of everyday life, household activities, and, apparently, religious beliefs. There fore, we can hypothesize that Tripolians may also have had cemeteries out side their settlements, although they have yet to be discovered. In any case, some aspects of the burial customs of later Tripolye cemeteries must have originated significantly earlier. The earliest known cemetery, dated to the beginning of the late period, is located near the village of Chapaevka on the southern outskirts of Kiev. The partly destroyed cemetery was adjacent to the settlement and consisted of 31 extended burials, face upward with their heads to the west. The age and sex of 22 of them have been determined; there were 15 men, 6 women, and 1 child. Clay vessels, lithics, and one clay female figurine were found near several burials (Kruts, 1977). Most of the Tripolye cemeteries dating to the final stage are concen trated in the southern and western parts of the Tripolye area and belong to the Vykhvatintsi and Usatovo groups. In some cases, such as Mayaki and Usatovo, they are adjacent to the settlements. Some 10 cemeteries have been discovered in the middle reaches of the Prut and the Dniester, most notably the well-known cemetery of Vyk hvatintsi. The excavations at Vykhvatintsi were conducted over many years, exposing about a third of its area (about 900 m) and 74 burials. The burials were flexed, usually on their left sides with their heads to the northeast. The oval and subrectangular burial pits were often covered by stone slabs and surrounded by circles of stones (cromlechs). In almost every burial, the grave goods consist primarily of ceramics with three to five vessels on average. Fine painted pottery and so-called kitchenware (vessels with a shell admixture decorated with cord imprints)</page><page sequence="12">210 Zbenovich are common. Ornaments and tools are much less frequent, with the latter found primarily in male graves. Burials of children, which make up 60% of the total, often contain anthropomorphic, clay figurines (Passek, 1961; Dergachev, 1978; Dergachev and Manzura, 1991). In the steppe areas of the northwestern Pontic region, which were oc cupied by the Usatovo group, barrow-cemeteries were widespread. Some 120 such Tripolian funeral mounds ("kurgans") have been investigated. A standard kurgan conceals several burials in rectangular or oval pits. Usually, the dead lie flexed on their left sides with their heads to the northeast or east. Monumental cromlechs are also typical of the Usatovo barrow-ceme teries. Grave goods are usually quite rich, including several vessels, orna ments, and copper objects. Two cemeteries without barrow mounds and two kurgan cemeteries are situated close to the Usatovo settlement. In ad dition, there is the usual cemetery and several kurgans near the settlement of Mayaki (Zbenovich, 1974; Patokova, 1979; Patokova et aL, 1989). Four final Tripolye cemeteries (Sofievka type) have been investigated on the northeastern edge of the Tripolye area near Kiev. Their burial cus toms differ markedly from the southern cemeteries. In Sofievka, Chernin, Krasny Khutor, and Zavalovka, there were only cremations. Approximately 40% of the 400+ burials are clay urns with burned bones, ashes, and grave goods; in most cases, the burned remains were placed in small pits. As well as small vessels and numerous lithics, cemeteries often yield numbers of stone battle axes, copper ornaments, knives, and daggers (Kruts, 1977). Although cremated human remains have been found in Cucuteni and Tripolye settlements of various periods, it is unlikely that the Sofievka-type burials originated in Tripolye. This practice may reflect a stage phenome non, characteristic of a number of southeastern European cultures at the turn of the Copper and Bronze ages. CERAMICS Pottery Vessels The ceramic assemblages of Tripolian settlements are extremely im pressive and abundant. In some instances, archaeologists have recovered up to 300 nearly complete vessels from one Tripolian house. The most typical traits of the early-period ceramics are mineral inclu sions, such as sand, quartz, crushed dry clay or sherds, and an incised de sign. Various pots, pedestaled and pedestaled-fenestrated bowls, chalices, vases, lids, spoons, and ladles were common (Fig. 4).

Fine tableware is usually orna mented with vertical, horizontal, or concentric flutes (cannelures), dots, comb imprints, grooved spirals, and stripes (Fig. 4: 8-15). Large, globular, lidded jars and pedestaled-fenestrated bowls have spi ral ornamentation, depicting a mythological serpent dragon (Fig. 4: 18-20). Vessels are often decorated with several rows of quadrangles or triangles. Clay from every other quadrangle was scooped to form a shallow depres sion (Fig. 4: 16 and 17), which was then filled with white paste for greater decorative effect. The early Tripolye culture inherited this "chessboard" pattern from the Boian culture. On some vessels, a band between two grooved parallel lines was painted with ocher after firing. The early Tripolye pottery tradition can in part be traced into the early middle period, BI stage (Fig. 5: 4, Fig. 6: 1-3). In the Prut-Dniester inter fluve, however, ceramics made of levigated clay became predominant. The surfaces of these vessels are highly smoothed, and most have spiral or me andering designs (Fig. 5: 1-3, 5; Fig. 6: 5-7). Before firing, black, red, and white paints were applied on the natural background, or black and white paints were used on a reddish coating. During the BI-BII stages, polychrome painted pottery predominated in these same regions and new motifs appeared: volutes and circles con nected by diagonal lines (Fig. 6: 4). The kitchenware was made of clay paste with a lavish admixture of crushed shells. These vessels usually have traces of vertical combing on the neck and oblique combing on the body (Fig. 5: 6). In the Southern Bug valley, while the early Tripolye ceramic tradition persisted and was perfected (Fig. 7: 6, 8, 9), the influence of the pottery making technology of the western region can also be seen. Thus, in the extensively excavated Klishchev site, high-quality pottery of the Dniester type (Fig. 7: 1-5) constitutes approximately 40% of the ceramic assemblage (Zaets and Ryzhov, 1992). The kitchenware, with a crushed-shell admixture in clay paste, is also very similar to that found in the Dniester region (Fig. 7: 7). The older traditions proved to be the most enduring in the Bug Dnieper interfluve. About 50% of the ceramic assemblage of the BI-BII stage are vessels decorated with incised spirals, concentric circles, arches, festoons, and horizontal lines, which in some instances are filled with white paste (Fig. 8: 1, 2, 4, 6), and cannelures (Fig. 8: 5). Painted pottery, both imported and locally made (Fig. 8: 3), averages 5% of the total (Tsvek, 1980). The communities which came to the Dnieper from the Bug-Dnieper interfluve during the BI-BII stage brought their ceramic traditions with them (Fig. 8: 9, 12).</page><page sequence="17">The Tripolye Culture 215 Fig. 7.

These trends also persisted in the early late period (CI stage), when sites of the Petreny group dotted a vast territory in the Prut and Dniester basins (Movsha, 1985a). These people used fine pottery decorated with black (or brown) paint, to which red paint was sometimes added (Fig. 5: 7-14, 16; Fig. 6: 8-10, 12, 15, 16). The main ornamental motifs are a negative "running wave" (Fig. 5: 13; Fig. 6: 8, 12), faces (Fig. 5: 11), volutes (Fig. 5: 10), and bands of several thin stripes framed by wider stripes (Fig. 5: 12). Human figures and depictions of animals and birds also appear on the ceramics (Fig. 6: 15, 16; Fig. 9: 1, 3, 4, 7). The kitchenware of the Petreny group is represented by pots and bowls with a shell admixture, fashioned by combing and deco rated with incisions and plastic ornamentation. Manufacture of the high-quality, monochrome painted pottery contin ued after the Petreny group was succeeded by sites of Varvarovka VIII type and others (Markevich, 1981). Ceramic assemblages of the later set tlements (Fig. 5: 15, 17-20; Fig. 9: 2, 5, 6, 9, 11) resemble those of the Petreny group, but they lack spiral motifs and S designs in the ornamen tation of their vessels. At the beginning of the late period, ceramics with red, white, and black painting are found only in a small area of the upper Dniester valley. Thus, some 90% of the ceramics from sites of the Koszylowce group (Hadaczek, 1914) are the "old" polychrome pottery (Fig. 6: 13, 14), although the kitch enware is decorated with cord imprints characteristic of final Tripolye (Fig. 6: 11). The distinctive trait of the Tripolian sites in the southern part of the Bug basin (stages BII and CI) is a pottery made of whitish kaolin clay with a fine sand admixture and an orange, straw-colored, or brownish coating. Ceramics similar in shape and ornamentation to the pottery of the Petreny group are the most common in the Vladimirovka group (stage BII) (Fig. 7: 11). There are vessels with a grooved spiral design combined with black and red paints (Fig. 7: 10), which resulted from the contacts between the people from the Dniester basin and the local Tripolian population. During this period, painted ceramics resembling those of Vladimirovka appeared in the northern part of the Bug region (Fig. 7: 12) and the Bug-Dnieper interfluve (Fig. 8: 7). The pottery of the later Nebelivka and Tomashevka groups (Movsha, 1985a; Ryzhov, 1993) is ornamented only with black paint. The main motifs are nets of thin stripes, volutes, and depictions of faces, plants, and animals (Fig. 7: 13-18). The bowls are often painted on both the outside and the inside surfaces, and wide overlapping arches are very common (Fig. 7: 16).</page><page sequence="21">The Tripolye Culture 219 Fig. 10.

At the eastern fringe of the Tripolye oekumene, in the Dnieper valley, stages BII and CI are marked by a trend toward the decomposition of the "classic" spiral design and more simply decorated kitchenware (Fig. 8: 10, 15). A new group of undecorated ceramics appeared, consisting of jugs, pots, bowls, and biconical goblets (Fig 8: 11). In the beginning of the late period, in sites such as those of the Kolomijshchina I, Chapaevka, and Lukashi groups, incised ornamentation was reduced to carelessly drawn wavy lines, loops, and short segments of straight lines surrounded by dots (Fig. 8: 16). Undecorated vessels, such as V-shaped and hemispherical bowls (Fig. 8: 13 14), jugs, and biconical goblets, became much more com mon. Painted pottery makes up only a small percentage of the total and is either predominantly of Southern Bug origin or imitates imported vessels (Fig. 8: 8). The ceramic assemblages of almost all the final Tripolye sites may be divided into two groups, each with a specific set of vessel forms and deco rative motifs. The first group, tableware, consists of vessels made of well levigated, pinkish or red-brown clay with a smoothed surface. Ornamentation is executed in black (or brown) paint, with some areas painted red (Fig. 10: 1-7, 16, 20, 21, 23). Tableware with painted ornamen tation typically makes up 1-5% of the ceramic assemblage. Only in the western region are vestiges of an earlier tradition noticeable, with up to 30% of ceramics exhibiting a monochrome black design. The second group, kitchenware, includes vessels made of paste with an admixture of finely crushed shells and a grayish smoothed surface. The kitchenware is usually decorated with horizontal and vertical rows of cord imprints, referred to as oblique net, as well as zigzags, small arches, X-de signs, and so on (Fig. 10: 8-10, 12-15, 17-19). Vertical-grooved decoration (Fig. 10: 11) is much less frequent. Bowls with an internal beveled rim decorated with cord imprints (Fig. 10: 19) are typical of the latest sites in the Prut and the Dniester basins, such as Gordineshty, Zvenyachin, and Tsviklovtsy, as well as in Volyn (Gorodsk, Listvin) and the Southern Bug valley (Sandraki II, Pechera). The pottery of Sofievka-type sites in the Dnieper valley differs mark edly from that of the other final Tripolye groups (Fig. 10: 17, 18). This pottery has an admixture of finely crushed shell, and organic and ocher inclusions, which account for its porosity and reddish tinge.

Despite these local distinctions, however, I must emphasize the unity of the final Tripolye ceramics. Figurines and Other Clay Objects Most of the approximately 2000 Tripolian clay anthropomorphic figu rines known are female statuettes (Pogozheva, 1983). These figurines are typically recovered in everyday contexts in various parts of dwellings?near hearths and stoves, in pits, and so forth. At Sabatinovka II (house 3), 16 figurines were discovered on a clay platform, 0.5 m high, adjacent to a "horned" clay chair; the ritual character of this altar or shrine is evident (Makarevich, 1969). Dozens of figurines have been found in late Tripolye cemeteries, usually accompanying the burials of children. There is no es sential difference in the statuettes found in everyday versus ritual contexts. The figurines are usually made of the same clay paste used for pottery production, but in some cases there is an admixture of flour and cereal grains. Imprints of grains are also seen on the bodies of some statuettes. Tripolian figurines are either modeled from a single lump of clay or two vertical halves are produced separately and then joined. Many of the figu rines are deliberately broken, probably during ritual ceremonies (Bibikov, 1953; Pogozheva, 1983). Early-period statuettes are typically in reclining or standing positions and are schematic, with a conic neck and head, flat body, broad hips, and heavy buttocks (Fig. 11: 1-3). These statuettes are either undecorated, or have an incised design of a serpent-dragon. Some figurines are seated on a small clay chair with a bull's head (Fig. 11: 4). Statuettes dating from the middle period and the beginning of the late period are typically standing, and are naturally proportioned with a spin dle-shaped leg, which sometimes rests on a flat base. Sitting figurines are not common (Fig. 11: 8). The head of the figure is usually a flat disk with eyeholes and a pinch of clay for the nose, although realistic "portraits" are not uncommon (Fig. 11: 6). In many figurines, paint, grooves, and relief are used to depict the clothes, footwear, adornments, and hairstyle of the woman (Fig. 11: 6, 7). Male statuettes are rare. Of particular interest is a "couple"?two statuettes apparently made for some ritual purpose (Fig. 11: 5).

They are linked with Usatovo-type sites (Fig. 11: 10, 11). The number of zoomorphic figurines is only two-fifths that of the an thropomorphic ones (Balabina, 1990). Zoomorphic figurines are usually bulls, ewes and rams, pigs, and birds (Fig. 12: 1-4, 9). Dogs, deer, foxes (Fig. 12: 5), and bears are less common. There are also zoomorphic vessels (Fig. 12: 6), sculptures of oxen harnessed to a sledge (Fig. 12: 13), and cones with a zoomorphic top (Fig. 12: 10). Models of houses are prominent among the apparent items of worship (Fig. 12: 7, 8, 11). Other clay objects include numerous loom-weights; vari ous spindle-whorls, some of which are decorated with pictograms (Fig. 12: 15); children's zoomorphic and anthropomorphic rattles (Fig. 12: 14); flat "cakes" (Fig. 12: 12); bricks (Fig. 12: 16); beads and plates (Fig. 12: 17-19); and conical tokens (Fig. 12: 20). STONE AND BONE ARTIFACTS Sites dating to all periods of the Tripolye culture yield rich assemblages of flint, schist, hard stone, bone, and antler tools. Their functions, produc tion technology, and usage have been established through microwear analy sis of approximately 11,000 items (Korobkova, 1987). Large assemblages of flint tools have been recovered from sites in the western region, where raw material is abundant. There are significantly fewer such tools in the Southern Bug and Dnieper basins. Some sites, par ticularly those of the early period, contain a great number of conical and prismatic cores, hammerstones (Fig. 13: 1), pressure-flakers and a profusion of debitage and waste. The main tool of the early period was the flake scraper (Fig. 13: 2, 3), but toward the end of the period, flint assemblages were dominated by blade-scrapers (Fig. 13: 4). Notches (Fig. 13: 9, 11), drills and borers (Fig. 13: 10), and elongated knives (Fig. 13: 12) are com mon. In all settlements, sickle-blades (Fig. 13: 6, 7), usually with an oblique gloss, make up 1-5% of the flint assemblages. At the end of the middle period, these were supplemented by long, single-edged sickles (Fig. 13: 13). Bifacial flint axes with a polished edge, which were used till the very end of the Tripolye culture, also first appeared during this period (Fig. 13: 14). Burins (Fig. 13: 8), arrowheads (Fig. 13: 17, 21), and geometrically shaped tools (Fig. 13: 5, 16) are rare. Among the excavated stone tools, schist axes (Fig. 13: 15), adzes (Fig. 13: 20), chisels (Fig. 13:19), and hoes (Fig. 13:18) are abundant.

Every extensively investigated Tripolian settlement yields dozens of bone and antler items. Deer and roe-deer antlers were fashioned into hoes (Fig. 14: 1-4, 11), hammers and hafts (Fig. 14: 6), harpoons (Fig. 14: 7), and other forms. The bone items include awls (Fig. 14: 8, 9), chisels (Fig. 14: 10), fish hooks (Fig. 14: 15), and smoothing tools (Fig. 14: 5). Also found are boar-tusk knives, drills (Fig. 14: 12), and devices for decorating pottery (Fig. 14: 13). In addition, bone was used to make stylized anthro pomorphic statuettes (Fig. 14: 16, 18) as well as daggers in the late period sites in the Upper Dniester and Prut regions (Fig. 14: 17). A well-known bull-head-shaped bone plate depicting a woman (Fig. 14: 19) was found in Verteba Cave on the Dniester (Hadaczek, 1914). Beads and necklaces made from animal bone, antler, and teeth are common (Fig. 14: 21-23). Adorn ments and stylized statuettes made of river shell are also found (Fig. 14: 14, 20). METAL ARTIFACTS Thus far, about 950 copper objects of the Tripolye culture have been recovered, most of which (60%) are from hoards at three sites: Carbuna, dating to the end of the early period; the middle period site of Gorodnitsa; and the final Tripolye site of Tsviklovtsy. The Carbuna hoard (Sergeyev, 1963) was found in a large spiral-deco rated vessel covered by a smaller one. It included 852 items: numerous ornaments of bone, seashell, and marble; 2 axes of marble and schist; and 444 metal objects, forged of pure metallurgical copper (Chernykh, 1966; Ryndina, 1971). Among the copper items are various beads and tubes (Fig. 15: 8, 9, 14, 15); oval, rectangular, and anthropomorphic plates and pen dants (Fig. 15: 7, 12, 13); bracelets (Fig. 15: 10, 11); and an ax-adze (Fig. 15: 4) and a perforated ax (Fig. 15: 5). Some 30 copper items, mostly simple tools (Fig. 15: 1-3) and ornaments (Fig. 15: 6), have also been found at early Tripolian settlements. The composition of the early Tripolye metal shows that the ore was extracted from the Chalcolithic copper mines of Thrace in southern Bulgaria (Chernykh, 1966, 1978). Subsequent stages of the Tripolye culture yield a variety of copper ob jects (numbering about 150) from settlements, including heavy perforated ax-hammers (Fig. 15: 17), ax-adzes (Fig. 15: 18, 23), flat axes and chisels (Fig. 15: 19, 25, 26), knives (Fig. 15: 16), and ornaments (Fig. 15: 20-22).

The majority of final Tripolye metal items (some 250) is from ceme teries of the Usatovo and Sofievka groups. Besides the numerous copper ornaments and several silver rings and spirals (Fig. 15: 27-30; 40-42), doz ens of daggers (Fig. 15: 32, 33), knives (Fig. 15: 34, 35), flat ax-chisels (Fig. 15: 31, 36), and tanged cylindrical gouges (Fig. 15: 37) were discovered in the graves. Some of the large, riveted daggers with midribs are of Aegean or Anatolian origin (Zbenovich, 1974; Ryndina and Kon'kova, 1982). ECONOMY The Tripolye culture coincides with the Holocene Climatic Optimum. Research on cryptogam pollen has shown that the Tripolians lived primarily in the forest-steppe zone, with a relatively warm and humid climate, fertile soils, grasslands, and large areas of broadleaf forests (Kremenetski, 1991). The environment of this zone was favorable for farming. Tripolian agriculture may be characterized as extensive slash-and-burn, with rather frequent changing of the cultivated fields. The pollen diagrams from Tripolian sites give evidence of deforestation?human impact on the natural landscape (Kremenetski, 1991). The simple wooden and antler till age implements and draught animals were used for plowing, while the stone and antler hoes were for garden cultivation. Analysis of archaeobotanical remains, especially carbonized seeds, and of grain impressions in the pot tery, figurines, and houses has revealed the plants cultivated by the Tri polians (Yanushevich, 1976; Pashkevich, 1980). In the early period, three sorts of hulled wheats were planted?einkorn (Triticum monococcwn), emmer (T. dicoccwn), and spelt (T. spelta)?as well as naked and hulled barley (Hordeum vulgare var. nudum, H. vulgare L.), millet (Panicum miliacewn L.), vetch (Vicia ervilia), and peas (Pisum sati vum L.). The relative percentages of these species varied with time and space, but among the cereals, the hulled wheats, well adapted to the local environmental conditions, were preferred. In southern regions, fruit such as apricots and plums were grown. Stock-breeding was the second important part of the Tripolian subsis tence economy (Bibikova, 1963; TSalkin, 1970). The herds were composed primarily of cattle, which made up &gt;50% of the domestic animals in the early period and up to 70% in the later periods. About 30% of the animals in the early period were pigs. However, in the settlements of Luka Vrublevetskaya and Klishchev, pigs made up 54 and 70% of the totals, respectively. On average, 20% of the herds consisted of ovicaprids, although</page><page sequence="32">230 Zbenovich much larger percentages were recovered in the late steppe settlements of Usatovo (48%) and Mayaki (68%). Domestic horses also occupied an im portant place in the fauna of these two sites (17.9 and 13.8%, respectively) (Zbenovich, 1974). Hunting was an essential source of meat in the Tripolian diet, with deer, roe deer, and wild boar as the main prey. At some early Tripolye settlements, such as Bernashevka, Luka-Vrublevetskaya, and Bernovo, the remains of wild animals made up 50-60% of the fauna, indicating that 30 35% of the meat was obtained through hunting. In the settlements of the subsequent period, the proportion of wild animals does not exceed 15-20%. Fishing and gathering were auxiliary occupations. In general, the Tripolian subsistence strategy was variable, determined by the environment, way of life, and economic traditions of the population of each particular region. Although there may have been craftspeople working to satisfy the re quirements of the whole community during the early period, nonsubsistence production (stone and bone working, spinning and weaving, pottery-mak ing) was decentralized and done on a household basis. The trend toward centralization, however, is clearly noticeable in the middle and early late periods. During that time, flint processing workshops appeared (Popova, 1980), as well as large production complexes comprising mines, settlements specializing in primary and secondary flint processing, and workshops (Va silenko, 1989). In the middle period, a stratum of specialist potters seems to have emerged. The pottery-making technology was constantly improved, and by the beginning of late Tripolye, a primitive potter's wheel was already in use and an optimal variant of the up-draft kiln was developed (Markevich, 1981; Ellis, 1984). Usually such kilns were located away from residences, in areas devoted to craft-specialists. Settlements like Zhvanets, in the mid dle reaches of the Dniester (Movsha, 1971), produced high-quality ceram ics, perhaps for barter, and were the source of supply for a large territory. In the late period, Tripolian weaving flourished. Houses in several set tlements have yielded concentrations of clay loom-weights. The bottoms of dozens of late Tripolye vessels bear impressions of several kinds of cloth, such as canvas, hessian, and others (Markevich, 1981). The nature of Tripolian metallurgy remains vague. The high techno logical level of smithing, which was certainly established by the early Tri polye period, gives reason to assume that the metals were manufactured by professionals (Ryndina, 1971). However, no traces of local metalworking facilities have yet been found. At the transition between the early and the middle periods, the Tripolye culture became part of the vast Balkan-Car pathian metallurgical province (Chernykh, 1978). The ore came from Thra</page><page sequence="33">The Tripolye Culture 231 cian and Transylvanian mines, but technologically the Tripolian items, which were produced primarily by forging, differ markedly from cast copper im plements (Ryndina, 1993). The production of copper items within the Tri polye culture is believed to have been of a limited scale because of the relatively small number of copper items from the middle and early late period, as well as the fact that no manufacturing evidence has been found in the settlements. Presumably, the Tripolians got part of the metal they used in the form of fully manufactured items (heavy axes). However, the penetrations of skilled blacksmiths and foundry workers from the Balkan Carpathian region eastward cannot be excluded. Craft specialization in metalworking has been confirmed only for final Tripolye, the transitional period from the Eneolithic to the Bronze Age. Early technological traditions using pure copper are known in the northern region (the Sofievka metallurgical center), while the output of the Usatovo center, containing a large admixture of arsenic, suggests significant Cauca sian influences (Chernykh, 1966; Zbenovich, 1974). SOME REMARKS ON CULT BELIEFS AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION There can be no doubt that the Tripolians had a rich and complex spiritual world. However, the archaeological finds which reflect this world? clay figurines, the shape and design of ceramics, and so forth?are difficult signs to decode (Tkachuk, 1993). The fertility cult, with its persisting tra ditions, symbols, and rites, formed the core of the religious beliefs of Tri polian farmers (Bibikov, 1953; Rybakov, 1965; Gimbutas, 1974). Fertile Nature was associated primarily with woman?the birth-giving Mother Goddess. This image is embodied in numerous figurines connected with cult rituals performed on altars in dwellings, in sanctuaries, or outdoors. Some vessel designs may also reflect rituals, such as those depicting dancing women (priestesses?), sometimes wearing masks, with musical instruments in their hands, and often with animals nearby (Fig. 5: 18; Fig. 9: 9, 11). There is a close semantic link between the image of a woman and a bull (Fig. 11: 4; Fig. 14: 19), which some scholars presume was the symbol of virility and the guardian of the household. Bulls' heads and horns have often been found buried in dwellings, and many clay models of houses have zoomorphic features (Fig. 12: 7, 8). In general, the ideology of the Tripolians has much in common with the religious beliefs of all farmers of prehistoric southeastern Europe, but there are two traits characteristic of the Tripolye and Cucuteni cultures, which set them apart from the others.</page><page sequence="34">232 Zbenovich First, Tripolian vessels, even early ones, occasionally bear quite realistic depictions of one or more pairs of serpents moving toward each other (Fig. 4: 18; Fig. 9: 8, 10). Some of these have subtriangular or trapezoidal pro truding wings and may be interpreted as flying serpents or dragons. In most cases, these features are found on the body or lid of large storage vessels and might have functioned as an awe-inspiring guard, an embodiment of an intimidating supernatural force. Anthropomorphic figurines have depic tions of snakes coiling around the legs and hips of a woman, reaching to her bosom (Fig. 11: 2, 3). This Tripolian dragon motif may well be the predecessor of a figure in later myths and tales: the fire-breathing, winged reptile who abducts women. The iconography of the dragon, consisting of several heads and hyperbolized eyes, emphasizing a strong ability to see and emanate light, can be correlated with some traits of the dragons of Mesopotamian and Chinese myths. A link between the dragon image and astral symbolism is also noticeable (Zbenovich, 1991). Second, the depictions of animals?dogs, bulls, deer, and birds?on Tripolian and Cucuteni ceramics is of considerable interest. The end of middle and the beginning of late periods are marked by this "animalistic" trend. Dogs are often shown running, flying or hovering above the ground, or moving up a sloping line or the arch of spiral. The lightness, dynamism, and expression of the pictures are impressive (Fig. 9: 1-4). Dogs are also found on "face urns," probably symbolizing the Great God dess (Fig. 9: 7) and linked with astral symbols (Fig. 9: 5). Several vessels show a procession of animals (Fig. 9: 6), including shaggy and clawed beasts of prey, dogs, deer, goats, and birds, perhaps the characters of some myth or legend. Although the content of such legends is difficult to reconstruct, the poetic and myth-forming nature of the Tripolian world outlook is obvious. Social and demographic interpretations of the Tripolye culture are complicated by the absence of such important sources as cemeteries and the constraint of only a small number of completely excavated settlements. The size and interior of most early Tripolye dwellings are such that they could provide living space for four or five people?that is, for a nuclear family. A typical early Tripolye settlement consisted of 7 to 10 dwellings which were inhabited by a community of 50-70 people, or an extended family consisting of several related nuclear families, who sometimes shared a dwelling. In the middle period and the beginning of the late period, the Tripolian household was made up of two to four nuclear families living in a single house. A Tripolian settlement with several dozen houses was probably populated by a clan.</page><page sequence="35">The Tripolye Culture 233 We are not yet able to define the role in the Tripolye social structure of the enormous settlements of the Southern Bug region, which had popu lations ranging from 8000 to 14,000 people (Knits, 1989). The distance be tween such settlements can be as much as 12-15 km (for example, the sites of Talyanki and Maidanetskoye), usually with no smaller sites in between. The most plausible explanation for this distribution is that such a high con centration of people reflected some external threat. However, such a threat could hardly have come from the neighboring steppes, where populations were small and heterogeneous in the early fifth millennium B.P. The role of the large settlements might also have been to check the advance of west ern Tripolian groups, who ultimately forced their predecessors out of the Southern Bug region. Some scholars have seen the massive settlements as evidence for the high social organization of the Tripolians, a chiefdom or ranked society (Ellis, 1984). An analogy is sometimes drawn between these Tripolian "proto-cities" and proto-urban structures of the prehistoric Near East (Shmaglii and Videiko, 1993). Such analogies are hardly justified, however, since models of the transition from egalitarian society to state (city-state and village-state) in the prehistoric Near East involve ecological, eco nomic, ideological, and other characteristics (Maisels, 1987) which are radically different from the archaeological realities of the late Chalcolithic in Eastern Europe. The latter does not show the common characteristics of a chiefdom, complex, or ranked society (Renfrew, 1974). Specifically, there are no public buildings, temples or craftsmen's quarters, and virtually no prestige articles, metal items, or weapons in these giant settlements. The most accurate description of the middle/late Tripolye social organi zation seems to be that of "a low-level hierarchical society" (Milisauskas and Kruk, 1986) The final Tripolye sites, however, do reflect the stratification of Tri polian society. In this context, the mounds of the Usatovo cemeteries are the most important. A rich assortment of grave goods, including metal weapons, tools, and metal adornments, has been found in its central graves. The construction of such mounds, with their large stone structures (cromlechs, embankments, and stelae), was extremely labor-consuming, and the mounds must have been intended for the elite members of the tribal and clan societies, the chiefs, while rank-and-file members of the community were buried in graves dug in the ground and with modest goods (Zbenovich, 1974). Metal weaponry and stone battle-axes found in Sofievka-type cemeteries are another hallmark of a ranked society, with its chiefs and privileged clans (Kolesnikov, 1993b). Indeed, chiefdom seems to be the most probable developmental stage for final Tripolye so ciety.</page><page sequence="36">234 Zbenovich Fig. 16.

CONNECTIONS WITH NEIGHBORING CULTURES The extensive links of the Tripolye culture with virtually all of the Cop per Age cultures of Eastern Europe (Figs. 1, 16, and 17) may be attributed to its vast territory and long duration. As far back as the early period, contacts were established with the populations of the Balkan-Danube and Carpathian regions. This is evident from the ceramics, flint tools, and other items from the Tisza, Lengyel, Vinca, and Bolgrad-Aldeni cultures found in Tripolian settlements (Zbenovich, 1989). The Vinca culture may have been the intermediary link with the remote regions of the Balkan peninsula and the Mediterranean, from which the marble and seashell items of the Carbuna treasure (Sergeyev, 1963) were brought. In the middle and late periods, links with western neighbors broadened. Numerous vessels of the Lengyel, Tiszapolgar, and especially Funnel Beaker cultures, as well as lo cally made ceramics imitating these imports, have been recovered in both western and eastern Tripolian settlements (Tsvek, 1980, 1989; Markevich,</page><page sequence="37">The Tripolye Culture 235 Fig. 17.

The role of the populations of Thrace and the Car pathian basin (the Karanovo V and VI, Bodrogkeresztur, Lengyel, and other cultures) in supplying the Tripolians with raw metal and manufac tured metal goods (Fig. 15: 18, 22, 23) was described above . In stage BI, the Tripolians, while retaining their traditional orientation toward the Balkan-Danube farming world, came into close contact with the Neolithic populations of the Dnieper and Black Sea regions, such as the Dnieper-Donets and Mariupol units and others. It was the Tripolians who brought farming and metal to their eastern neighbors, thus contribut ing to the advancement of a number of local cultures. The advent of the Copper Age in the Black Sea steppes was marked by the appearance of a distinctive Casimcea-Petrosvistunovo (or Novo danilovka) cultural group represented only by cemeteries (such as Kainary and Suvorovo), in which the graves contain a considerable number of cop per items, mostly ornaments, of Tripolian origin. Local metalworking also came into being under the impact of Tripolian technology (Ryndina, 1993). The people buried in these cemeteries were the first steppe-herders to ad</page><page sequence="38">236 Zbenovich vance so far westward. Their stone horse-head scepters have been found in the Caucasus, the Pontic region, Dobruja, Moldova, and the Balkans. The most realistic of the scepters must have been made with the partici pation of Tripolian masters (Zbenovich, 1987). At the beginning of the middle period, contacts with the people of the Srednii Stog culture, inhabiting the southern part of the forest-steppe zone (Telegin, 1986), were established. The Tripolians borrowed kitchen ware with an admixture of crushed shells (Movsha, 1961), as well as the domesticated horse from their neighbors, while the latter borrowed metal and some cult ideas. Until the final stage, Tripolian penetration into the steppe was neither deep nor extensive, and the zone of contacts was limited by the Dnieper. However, their long-distance trade connections went much farther eastward to include the northern Caucasus. Caucasian metal items first appear in the Tripolian territory at the beginning of the late period (Fig. 15: 24), and by the final stage, the Usatovo metallurgical center was oriented primarily toward Caucasian metal. Thus, for a thousand years the Tripolye culture served as a connecting link between two worlds?the farmers of the Balkan-Danube region and the steppe herders?contributing to exchanges of people, ideas, and achievements. In the final stage, the Tripolians penetrated gradually into the Dniester and Bug steppe regions, which led to direct contacts with other indigenous populations. Scholars have noted that the physical type of the Usatovo peo ple had two components ?Mediterranean (Tripolian) and Pro toeuropeoid?which is characteristic of the people of the Pit-Grave and Srednii Stog cultures (Knits, 1987; Potekhina, 1990). The Usatovo Tri polians also borrowed the grave-mound funeral rite from the steppe people. Final Tripolye vessels and clay anthropomorphic figurines frequently occur in the steppe cemeteries of the late Eneolithic (Pit-Grave, post-Mariupol, and other cultures) (Kovaleva, 1984), at the same time as typical steppe ceramics are found in Tripolian sites (Fig. 10: 10). THE PROBLEM OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE TRIPOLYE CULTURE The problem of the disintegration and disappearance of the large farming cultures of the Copper Age, including Tripolye, has yet to be solved. Each culture left the arena of history in its own way, and at its own time. The Karanovo VI-Gumelnita unit, the Varna culture, and other cul tures of Eneolithic Bulgaria suddenly disappeared during their apparent</page><page sequence="39">The Tripolye Culture 237 prime in the midsixth millennium B.P. The end of the Cucuteni culture occurred in the early fifth millennium B.P., after it had passed its zenith (later sites of the Foltesti and Horodistea type seem to be related to Tri polye rather than Cucuteni). The Tripolye culture disappeared approxi mately 300 years later, having gradually decayed and lost its characteristic traits: high-quality painted pottery, very artistic ornamentation, relatively realistic figurines, clay-wood houses, and so on. During the final stage, the Bug-Dnieper interfluve and the greater part of the middle Dnieper were no longer inhabited by Tripolians. Altogether, the Tripolian population de creased to a third of what it had been in the preceding period (Knits, 1993). The dramatic changes in the demography, ways of life, economic ac tivities, and spiritual and material culture of the Tripolians in the final stage are obvious, yet we have no satisfactory explanation for them. There is no convincing proof that the disintegration of the Tripolye culture was caused by the onslaught of the steppe people, nor could it have been brought about by the end of the Climatic Optimum (Zvelebil and Dolukhanov, 1991; Kre menetski, 1991). The process of decline began during the preceding stage, and must have been caused by immanent internal factors of the culture's subsistence economy. Even in the early period, the vast areas of land avail able to the Tripolians determined the extensive character of their farming. Their technical and technological base remained unchanged through the centuries and this ossified economic system ultimately proved unable to cope with the natural population growth. Natural resources were exhausted, especially through deforestation (Kruts, 1989). Farther eastward movement must have been checked by the population of the left-bank Dnieper area. Only a fraction of the Dniester Tripolians moved to the Black Sea steppes, changing their way of life. Having exhausted its development potential, the Tripolye culture broke apart into comparatively small enclaves, with some of the old traditions kept alive only in the Tripolian hinterland in the Prut Dniester interfluve.
