<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHANGING PATTERNS OF RITUAL ACTIVITY IN AN UNLOOTED CAVE IN CENTRAL GUATEMALA Brent K.S. Woodfill, Stanley Guenter, and Mirza Monterroso The Cave of Hun Nal Ye, located in central Guatemala , was discovered unlooted by a local landowner in 2005 and was immediately subject to investigation by the authors. The cave contained ritual remains dating to between the Terminal Pre- classic and Terminal Classic. In addition to allowing a detailed reconstruction of ritual activity in the northern highlands, its presence along the Great Western Trade Route allows archaeologists to examine hypotheses about interregional trade during the Classic period. In particular, changes in the ritual assemblage between the Early and Late Classic indicate that the cave was an important trade shrine for merchants and travelers passing between the highlands and lowlands until ca. A.D. 550, at which point it became a local shrine used to reinforce elite power. These changes are then linked to larger pat- terns occurring in other parts of the trade route, especially to Tikal and the kingdoms along the Pasión and Usumacinta rivers. La cueva de Hun Nal Ye, ubicada en la zona central de Guatemala, fue encontrada en 2005 por el dueño del terreno y fue sujeto inmediatamente de investigación por Woodfill y Monterroso. La cueva, que no había sido saqueada antes de la investi- gación, contuvo los restos de varios eventos rituales que se llevaron a cabo entre el Preclásico Terminal y el Clásico Termi- nal. Además de dar la base para una reconstrucción detallada de actividad ritual en el Altiplano del norte, su asociación con la Gran Ruta Occidental de Intercambio nos deja examinar hipótesis a sobre el intercambio regional durante la época Clásica. El material recuperado que fecha antes de 550 d.C. consiste exclusivemente de estilos exóticos - vasijas enteras de tradiciones de más adentro de las Tierras Altas y una caja grabada de piedra en el estilo del Peten central. Casi todo el asemblaje con- siste de vasijas completas dejadas como escondites en los lugares más dramáticos y restringidos de la cueva. Después de 550 d.C., el material consiste de vasijas quebradas de un estilo local y está concentrado en la entrada de la cueva, donde es posi- ble hacer una ceremonia pública enfrente de una audiencia. En base a esta evidencia y a material recuperado en otras cuevas vecinas, los autores sugieren que mercaderes llevaron material en bruto de las Tierras Altas hasta el Peten central, parando en la cueva para hacer ceremonias pidiendo permiso de paso de los dueños sobrenaturales de la región. Al principio del Clásico Tardío, en contraste, Cancuenfue establecido para controlar el movimiento de estos bienes, importando el material en bruto para fabricar productos de exportación para las Tierras Bajas. Los cambios del patrón de uso de la ruta fueron represanta- dos en el nuevo patrón de ritual, que se llevó a cabo por élites locales para fortalecer su poder político a través de actos rit- uales públicos en la entrada de la cueva. While gists tion caves from as they do Mesoamerican deserve, not receive they as are much archaeolo- ripe atten- with tion from Mesoamerican archaeolo- gists as they deserve, they are ripe with data suitable for multiple lines of inquiry. Many caves contain large, undisturbed data sets that cre- ate a window not only into ritual activity but also into ancient culture history, power relations, and economics. In the extreme northern highlands of central Guatemala (Figure 1), they have proven to be essential sources of culture-historical data - local settlements dating to before the Late Classic have been extremely elusive, due either to a loose settlement pattern, the presence of large Late Clas- sic or modern populations over ancient settle- ments, or both. One of the most important discoveries in the region for the reconstruction of ancient life has, in fact, been a single cave brought to our attention in 2005. The cave was found unlooted by local landowner Leonidas Javier in 2005, and investigations were Brent Woodfill ■ University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

Plan of the Cave of Hun Nal Ye (drawing by Mirza Monterroso). plex picture of the history of highland-lowland trade during the Classic period. A Description of the Cave The Cave of Hun Nal Ye (Figures 2 and 3) actually consists of two adjacent caves. They are located at the source of a small tributary to the Pasión River, above a small, deep pool (over 40 m) that feeds into an 8 m waterfall. Cave I is a long, restricted cave with the majority of artifacts, while Cave II (The Vault) is a single chamber located directly above it. Both are quite small (covering a total horizon- tal area of 15 m x 22 m), although the arduous and undulating path that one takes to get through Cave I makes it appear deceptively large. Cave I The entrance to Cave I is located behind a small ledge located approximately 7 m above the dry sea- son water level. A lens of smashed pots and dust covers most of the ledge floor; upon excavation, two whole, small, unslipped, and roughly-made cups (HNYV-28 and 29; Figure 4a) were discov- ered, one placed upside-down and the other right- side up on the bedrock. Several other cups of much better quality - both whole and partial - were found immediately inside the entrance (HNYV-23 to 26, Figure 4b). Both the vessels and a large accumulation of ceramics in a small pit adjacent to them were covered by a thick layer of white cal- cium carbonate.</page><page sequence="4">96 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 1, 2012 The Cave of Hun Nal Ye North-South Profile Brent Woodfill Mirza Monterroso VUPACS 2005 Figure 3.

Whole vessels cached at Hun Nal Ye Cave I entrance: (a) HNYV-29; (b) Vessels covered with calcium carbon- ate at the entrance to Hun Nal Ye (drawing by Walter Burgos, photo by Brent Woodfill). Beyond the entrance lies an undulating tunnel consisting of a series of vertical climbs with ample natural hand- and foot-holds. While these tunnels were mostly dry during the course of investigation, the water level of the pool was particularly high dur- ing the first visit to the cave (about 5 m above the dry season water level); the rise in the pool's water level created a waterfall inside the cave at the ini- tial descent, slowly flooding the tunnel system. In order to reach Chamber I, the principal focus of Precolumbian ritual activity in the cave, one must climb up the cave wall to reach a tight crawl- space which appears to have been made by the ancient Maya by removing pieces of breakdown (remnants of a collapsed ceiling). The chamber itself begins to open up nearly immediately - although the ceiling remains level, the floor is a series of travertine pools and dams that end abruptly with a meter drop to rough, uneven bedrock. Sev- eral large formations naturally channel traffic through a single, narrow path. The ancient Maya left three whole pots on this path, all within the travertine pools (HNYV-1 to 3, Figure 5). The majority of the Hun Nal Ye vessels</page><page sequence="6">98 LATI N AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 1 , 201 2 were found on the back wall of Chamber I (Figure 6) - the stone coffer and an orange-slipped ceramic lidded box (HNYV-10) were placed in a single niche located about 1.5 m above the floor, and five whole vessels, including another ceramic box, were stacked on the floor below it. An area covered by ceramics and damp organic residue was found next to this pile. At the bottom, Monterroso and Wood- fill discovered two whole vessels (HNYV-17 and HNYV-18), one placed atop the other; the bottom vessel (Figure 7a) contained part of a juvenile human pelvis. A variety of small jars and cups were placed in niches and on sloping walls near the back part of Chamber I. Chamber II is accessed by a natural doorway near the stone coffer. It, like its predecessor, con- tinues to slope downward while the ceiling remains at a stable height, although here the slope is largely composed of breakdown left behind when the ceil- ing collapsed in the distant past. There is one large, active formation on the up-slope part of the cham- ber and several whole vessels (Figure 7c) in niches near the entrance to Chamber I. This part of the cave has a small window to the outside, although it is too small for a human to pass through. A space in the breakdown below the window contains a nearly complete tapir skeleton that was cemented to the cave floor by a thick layer of calcium car- bonate. The skeleton appears to have been articu- lated in the past, but it is slightly disturbed, likely due to water action. The northernmost part of the cave is Chamber III, a low crawlspace accessible by climbing down the Chamber II slope. Two vessels (a bowl and a cup) were found placed upside-down on the floor. Cave II Cave II (The Vault) is much simpler to describe - it is a simple chamber with no dark space, a steeply sloping floor, and an inverted V-shaped ceiling highly reminiscent of a corbelled vault. A few scat- tered ceramic sherds have been identified on the floor, as well as one nearly-complete vessel (HNYV-30, Figure 7d), a Late Classic bowl with large chunk of its base missing. The Artifacts: Description and Patterns The majority of the artifactual assemblage from Hun Nal Ye (Woodfill and Monterroso 2005; Wood- fill 2007, 2010) is ceramic, although a single obsid- ian prismatic blade, part of a juvenile human pelvis, a tapir skeleton, and the stone coffer (see below) are also present. Each of the artifacts will be briefly described before an explication of the general trends found in the material data. The Stone Coffer The stone coffer (Figures 8-12) was made of a dark volcanic stone and consists of two parts - a body with four nubbin supports and a lid. It is 38 cm long, 21.7 cm wide, and 10.9 cm tall, including the 2.8 cm-thick lid. The supports are 1 .6 cm tall. The lid and the four sides of the body were carved by at least three different hands. The carving style, both in the iconography and the hieroglyphs, dates to the late phase of the Early Classic period, approx- imately the late-fifth or sixth centuries. The lid (Figure 8) depicts the moon goddess, who closely resembles the maize god but is here distinguished by her animal companion, a rabbit tucked into the crook of her arm, as well as a T1 8 1/T683b moon sign to the right of this pair.

However, these difficulties consist for the most part in determining the original pronun- ciation of individual words, and the general mes- sage of the text is understood. Glyphs 1 through 5 are a generic dedication phrase, part of the Primary Standard Sequence originally identified by Michael Coe (1973) and subsequently expanded upon by a number of scholars (Grube 1991; Houston et al. 1989; MacLeod 1990a, 1990b; Mora-Marin 2003; Reents-Budet 1994; Stuart 2005). The coffer itself is referred to twice in the inscription, first as sim- ply a "stone" in Glyph 6 and then apparently as a</page><page sequence="9">Woodfill et al.] CHANGING PATTERNS OF RITUAL ACTIVITY 1 01 Figure 7.

Glyphs 7 and 8 may be part of the proper name of the stone box. How- ever, the prefix ta- on Glyph 7 intriguingly may indicate the original contents of the box, for ta is the universal preposition of Classic Mayan, being the equivalent of the English "on/at/in/for." The meaning of the signs in Glyphs 7 and 8, though, is not transparent in this interpretation, as they appear to read haab, chi , and naah, "year," possibly "deer," and "house" respectively. Glyphs 9 and 10 are more certainly part of the proper name of the coffer and consist of the names of the Moon Goddess as well as apparently that of her rabbit companion. Most curiously, he is referred to as "10 and 20," or "30," the number of days in a lunar month. Maya lunar months varied between 29 and 30 days long and it may be that this mytholog- ical rabbit, which the Maya saw in the dark patterns on the face of the moon itself, was thought to be the patron of, and perhaps in some way responsible for, the additional day in these lunar months. Undoubt- edly this name reflects some myth now lost to us. Glyphs 1 1 and 1 2 state that the preceding names of the Moon Goddess and her rabbit were the name of the box itself, and that it belonged to the indi- vidual whose own name follows in the last four glyphs of the text. This person actually had two names, the first of which, in Glyphs 13 and 14, appears to read Yuhklaj Chan Muwaan. While the name is only written as Yuk Chan Muwaan, the -laj ending to yuk, a verb meaning "to shake," can be inferred by analogy with a similar name that appears on a looted Codex-style plate (Robicsek and Hales 1981:204, 2 A) as well as the name of the fourteenth king of Copan, K'ahk' Joplaj Chan K'awiil (Martin and Grube 2000:206). This name can be translated loosely as "Hawk who Shakes the Sky." The second name is found in Glyphs 1 5 and 16 and reads K' an K'uuch, or "Yellow Vulture." This pattern of two royal names, where one con- sists of a verbal phrase incorporating a reference to celestial phenomena and the second consists of an animal modified by a color term is a common one in ancient Maya onomastics (Colas 2004).</page><page sequence="10">102 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 1, 2012 Figure 8. Stone coffer lid: (a) Drawing (by Luis Luin); (b) (photo by Horacio Martínez). The four sides of the box proper were also carved with both iconography and hieroglyphs. There are two different templates for these carv- ings, corresponding to the size of the available panel. The two longer sides, Sides 1 and 3 (Fig- ures 9 and 11), feature two anthropomorphic deities, seated cross-legged upon thrones and fac- ing each other through a panel of six glyphs. The shorter sides (Figures 10 and 12) bear almost iden- tical imagery, but their panels consist of only sin-</page><page sequence="11">Woodfill et al.] CHANGING PATTERNS OF RITUAL ACTIVITY 1 03 Figure 9.

All four sides are bounded by vertical columns, each of which features a cou- ple of hieroglyphs. Unfortunately, while at least 44 hieroglyphs were carved upon the four sides of the stone box, these are carved at a much smaller scale than those upon the lid, and the carving is much more crude, especially those hieroglyphs on the short sides. The vast majority of the signs that form these hiero- glyphs bear no resemblance to known and deci- phered signs in Classic Maya writing, with the result that none of these short texts are actually leg- ible. Some individual glyphs, such as those in the middle of Side 3 (Figure 1 1), however, are slightly more recognizable. Glyph C 1 , for example, resem- bles the glyph WAY, while glyph C2 is that of a throne, suffixed by the syllable -na, unfortunately still an illegible collocation. Glyph C3 is the most interesting in this part of the text as it is an Emblem Glyph in which an unknown main sign is prefixed by the number 1 . This Emblem Glyph is otherwise unattested and thus does not aid in elucidating the origins of the stone box, nor where it was carved. While the epigraphic information on the sides of the coffer remains opaque, more can be said about the iconography. On each of the long sides of the box the figure seated upon a throne to the left is an elderly deity, dressed in an elaborate cos- tume including a headdress, wearing a possible cape or pectoral, and with a skirt and belt. Inter-</page><page sequence="12">1 04 LATI N AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 1 , 201 2 Figure 10.

Stone coffer panel 3: (a) Drawing (by Luis Luin); (b) (photo by Horacio Martínez). estingly, on both Side 1 and Side 3 this figure pos- sibly has jaguar paws for hands. Underneath the outstretched left hand of each of these figures is a rectangular object that matches the way the ancient Maya depicted codices. Unfortunately, the figure on the right of Side 3 is mostly eroded away, but enough remains of his face to see that it is that of the Jaguar God of the Underworld, known to be a patron of nighttime and fire (Stu- art 1998). The equivalent figure on Side 1 (Fig- ure 9) is shown in almost mirror fashion to the elderly deity across from him, except that he does not have a codex or other object beneath his out- stretched hand. Interestingly, on Side 1 the figure to the left bears the cruller above a Roman nose and scalloped "beard" that identify this character as the Fire God. It is unclear exactly what the scene represents, as the hieroglyphs between the two figures that may have explained their inter- action cannot be read. On both Sides 1 and 3 the figure to the left may be reading from the codex, or handing it to the figure on the right. The figures on the short ends of the box, as noted above, appear to be human. Each has his hair tied up in a topknot, but otherwise there is no headdress on either of them, and their costume is spare in com- parison to that of the deities on the other sides of the box. Each is seated cross-legged on a small pad, definitely not a throne, and faces left. The fig- ure on Side 2 (Figure 10) has on his or her lap an open codex, while no object is found with the fig- ure on Side 4 (Figure 12). However, this latter indi-</page><page sequence="14">1 06 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 1, 2012 Figure 12.

Interestingly, the head variant glyphs in this text all face the human individual, indicating that this text was meant to be "read" unusually from right to left. The same reading order is apparent for the interior text of six glyphs facing the human figure on Side 2. The fact that this human figure has a codex, while his counterpart on Side 4 does not, mirrors the scenes on the long sides of the box and suggests a crucial symbolism that connects all of these scenes, and reminds one of Vase K1 196, which shows the old deity, God N, apparently teaching a pair of youths from a codex. Federico Fahsen (Woodfill et al. 2006) has suggested that the box originally held a codex, and this may well have been the case. While the epigraphic information cannot be mus- tered to support this contention, the iconography can be, and it is notable that the size of the cavity within the box is consistent with the sizes of the four surviving Maya codices. No evidence of any such codex has been found in the coffer, or any- where in the cave, however, and the only material found associated with it is discussed below. In summary, the hieroglyphic text on the lid of this stone coffer, stylistically dating to the late-fifth or sixth centuries, identifies it as in some way being connected or dedicated to the Moon Goddess and her rabbit companion, and informs us that the orig- inal owner was a Maya lord who bore the two names Yuhklaj Chan Muwaan and K' an K'uuch. Unfortunately, he is not identified by an Emblem Glyph and we cannot even be certain that he was a king, although no sub-lord, especially in this period, is known to have been the recipient of such an elaborate and precious carving. The hieroglyphs and iconography on the lid indicate a lowland tra- dition, and it is likely that this object was carved far to the north of Hun Nal Ye cave, or at least was carved by a sculptor from this region. Given that hieroglyphic inscriptions are otherwise all but entirely absent from this region, especially in the Early Classic period, the former possibility seems the more likely. The sides of the box are carved in a different style than the lid, but are still within the tradition of the Early Classic lowlands. However, the hiero- glyphs are for the most part pseudoglyphic or are so crudely carved as to be illegible. The iconogra- phy, of gods and scribes exchanging codices, is suggestive as to what the box originally contained. It may well have once held a codex, and the iconog- raphy on the lid suggests that this may have even included lunar calculations, or myths associated with the moon goddess.

When the stylistic sphere of the vessel has not been definitively shown, the most likely correlate is written with a question mark. all northern highland types found in neighboring assemblages (e.g., Arnauld 1986; Ichon 1992; Smith 1952). There are subtle differences between the material recovered from the entrance and the cave interior, however. The sherds at the entrance tend to be more elaborately decorated, with trichromes, incisions, and appliques, which are largely absent in the interior of the cave. With the exception of two cached vessels at the cave entrance (discussed in the following paragraph), all of the unslipped ceramics were found in the cave interior. This corresponds to general patterns observed in disparate parts of the Maya world (e.g., Brady 1 989; Peterson 2006; Rissolo 2003; Woodfill 2007), in which more elaborate vessels are found in places where an audience could observe the ritual practi- tioner using (and often destroying) them. Since there is ample space for a small crowd to gather on the opposite shore of the pool, it is hardly surpris- ing that this pattern exists here too. One interesting connection between the two sherd concentrations is that each covered two cached whole vessels. This would appear to mean that the majority or entirety of each assemblage rep- resents a single ritual event, with vessels deposited and then ritually covered through the smashing of pots and, in the case of the Chamber I vessels, the burning of organic materials. The specifics of each assemblage were quite different from each other, however. The entrance feature was on relatively level ground and the vessels were short cups (each under 5 cm tall), so the ceramics formed a shallow lens over much of the floor. In Chamber I, on the other hand, the two pots were placed right-side up</page><page sequence="17">Woodfill et al.] CHANGING PATTERNS OF RITUAL ACTIVITY 1 09 Figure 13. Select Late Classic sherds from Hun Nal Ye (13a drawn by Luis Luin; 13b-d drawn by Walter Burgos). in a natural pit in the bedrock that was approxi- mately 40 cm deep with one atop the other. The ceramic sherds and the organic "sludge" (analysis pending) were thrown into the pit until they cov- ered all but the lip of the top vessel. Since only this matrix was recovered from the top vessel, it is impossible to tell what, if anything, it originally held, but the bottom vessel contained a partial juve- nile human pelvis. The Whole Vessels The whole vessels found in Hun Nal Ye (Table 2) represent ceramic complexes from most of the Maya highlands and span a wider period of time than the sherds, dating to between the Terminal Preclassic and the Terminal Classic. Due to at-times fuzzy chronological correlations between the dif- ferent regions represented in the sample, it is impos- sible to accurately chart the chronological relations among all of the vessels, so, for the purpose of this paper, they will be divided into two broad groups - the Terminal Preclassic/Early Classic and the Late/Terminal Classic. The Terminal Preclassic/Early Classic group likely consists of 18 of the whole vessels, a partial vessel, and the stone coffer. It represents a strong "international" tradition, with vessels associated with complexes from the Salama and Motagua Val- leys, Kaminaljuyu, and, potentially, northwestern El Salvador. The stone coffer also corresponds to this grouping and also represents this internation- alization, albeit as the solitary lowland artifact in the assemblage. The Late/Terminal Classic group, however, has exclusively local wares. All are typical northern highland-style vessels (Figure 13; e.g., Arnauld 1986; Ichon 1992; Smith 1952). Twelve vessels and the entirety of the material from the sherd con- centrations correspond to this group.

The pres- ence of calcium carbonate deposits on many of the vessels indicates that they likely fell in from Cave II, since calcium carbonate cannot come out of solution and coat a vessel underwater, and the depth of the pool, which is fed by an active underground river, makes it unlikely that it was ever dry for any significant period of time. Patterns in the Artif actual Assemblage Obviously, there was a major break in the pattern of use in this cave system around the end of the Early Classic. This is revealed not only by the shift from international to local ceramic styles but in a shift in the spatial focus of the ritual activity that occurred in the cave. The Late Preclassic/Early Classic ritual (Figure 14a) is almost entirely focused on Chamber I, although there are several small, unslipped cups that likely date to the Early Classic found at the cave entrance (HNYV-23 to 26) and in the back of Chamber III (HNYV-22). These vessels all likely originally contained organic offerings. In Chamber II, the Terminal Preclassic/Early Classic vessels are focused on two distinct clusters - the niche with the stone coffer and the down-slope edge of the travertine formations. A sin- gle whole vessel (HN Y V-6) and a partial vessel are located along opposite walls, potentially at end- points of an axis cutting through the mid-point between the two primary clusters. While this could be a random pattern, Holly Moyes (2000, 2005) has identified possible ritual circuits in several caves in Belize, which are well-known throughout colonial and modern Maya history (e.g., de Landa 1978; Gossen 1974; Haviland and Haviland 1982; Red- field and Villa Rojas 1934; Watanabe 1983). It is possible that the vessels here served a similar func- tion marking a small ritual circuit, although this chamber is small and hard to move around in. The Late and Terminal Classic (Figure 14b) exhibit a less defined pattern - ritual activity seems to be focused on the entrance but whole vessels are present in Chambers I, II, and III as well. Visitors to Chamber I also performed at least one major rit- ual in front of the majority of Early Classic ves- sels, where they left the two cached vessels and the accumulation of sherds and organic material. It is quite likely that one of the Late/Terminal Classic ritual practitioners removed the original contents of the coffer and replaced it with the femur which he or she found in situ nearby, since it was already covered with calcium carbonate when it was placed inside - any water leaking in and leaving this min- eral on the bone would have also cemented it to the box, much like the rest of the tapir skeleton was cemented to the floor of the crawlspace where it was found. It is also possible that the box was brought into the cave and left as an offering at a later date, possibly during the Late Classic, although the fact that the whole tableau includes multiple ceramic boxes and vessels dating to the Early Classic renders it improbable.</page><page sequence="19">Woodfill et al.] CHANGING PATTERNS OF RITUAL ACTIVITY 1 1 1 Figure 15. The Great Western and Eastern Trade Routes (drawing by Luis Luin). The hypothesis that this tapir femur represents a later addition to the archaeological assemblage is supported by intentional damage done to an Early Classic ceramic box (HNYV-15, see Figure 7) that is cemented to the wall. The calcium carbonate that formed around it locked the lid atop the vessel, making it impossible to remove without cutting away a sizeable portion of the cave wall. When the collection was discovered by Javier, however, a chunk had already been removed from the front side of the box allowing one to peek inside of it. The chunk was subsequently recovered on the floor of Chamber II, where it had presumably been tossed by an ancient visitor to the cave. Local vs. Nonlocal Ritual Practices Many recent ritual scholars (e.g., Bell 1992, 1997; Kertzer 1988; Rappaport 1999) propose that a pri- mary function of ritual is to create relations of</page><page sequence="20">112 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 1, 2012 power between the practitioner and the audience, and this is certainly reflected in the artifactual assemblages present in most caves (see Brady 1989; Peterson 2006; Prüfer 2002; Woodfill 2002, 2007, 2010), where the most decorated and elabo- rate material is found on natural stages at or near the entrances above spaces where crowds of peo- ple could congregate. This includes not only ceram- ics but also parts of ritual regalia such as tinklers and earflares that are often found associated with them. Dark, restricted parts of the cave, conversely, tend to contain simpler materials, including a pre- dominance of unslipped and monochrome ceram- ics (Brady 1989; Peterson 2006; Woodfill 2002, 2007, 2010), since there is typically no need for the "spectacle" (Houston 2006) of using and destroy- ing elaborate, beautifully decorated vessels. In Hun Nal Ye, however, the stone coffer and the most elaborately decorated ceramic vessels were found in a highly-restricted and difficult-to- access part of the cave. Unlike other caves (even those in the same region), there is no statistical cor- relation between decoration and context (entrance vs. interior) in the Hun Nal Ye sample, which would indicate that ritual was undertaken here for differ- ent ends. The contrast between the earlier and later ritual patterns appears to reflect a fundamentally differ- ent function of the ritual itself, one that is intended not to create a relationship with a human audience but with a supernatural one. One likely scenario is that the material was left behind by nonlocals, a pat- tern that has been found in other caves and cave- like features throughout the Maya world (Brady 1989; Brady et al. 1997; Coggins and Shane 1984; Patel 2005; Rissolo 2003; Stone 1995). While this is often tied to pilgrimage events (Adams and Brady 1994; Brady 1989; Coggins and Shane 1984; Patel 2005; Stone 1995), the small scale of the cave, its difficulty of access, and the relatively light quan- tity of material when compared to established pil- grimage centers, initially led us to believe that there was a different cultural process occurring here. Highland-lowland Trade and Classic Maya Political Economies One theoretical problem that is shared among a wide range of academics is the nature of long-dis- tance exchange in preindustrial societies (e.g., Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Polanyi 1957; Sahlins 1972; Smith 1976; Smith 2004). Although many of the objects exchanged over great distances were sumptuary goods that were given by one impor- tant member of a given society to another that could reflect personal relations (Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Freidel et al. 2002; Goodell 1985), other goods that were imported from great dis- tances were used by the majority of socioeconomic classes (Andrews 1980, 1983; Braswell 2002; Hirth 1996; Polanyi 1957). In the Maya world, there were a variety of raw materials - both sumptuary and "utilitarian" - that were limited geographically to specific regions (Braswell 1996; Demarest 2006; Demarest and Barrientos 2002; Dillon 1975; Kovacevich 2006; McAnany et al. 2002; McKil- lop 1995; Mejia Amaya and Suyuc Ley 1998; Shafer 1991 ; Smith and Kidder 1943; Taube et al. 2006). The most important geographic division was between the resource-rich Maya highlands, which contained important sources of jade, obsid- ian, iron pyrite, and basalt as well as organic mate- rials such as quetzal feathers, and the Maya lowlands, which had large quantities of chert, at least one granite source, and perishable materials such as chocolate and the pelts and feathers of a wide variety of animals. While there are an infinite number of potential routes to move materials between the highlands and lowlands, the difficult terrain present in much of the highlands combined with the lack of pack animals would have encouraged movement along two poten- tial routes (Figure 15), one along the eastern edge of the Maya world and the other through the west- ern highlands. The eastern route (Arnauld 1990; Seler 1993) follows the Motagua river and hugs the Caribbean coast before heading inland again via a variety of river systems. The western route, in con- trast (Adams 1978; Arnauld 1990; Demarest and Fahsen 2003; Hammond 1972; Woodfill 2007, 2010) followed a series of interconnected valleys down from the highlands to the Pasión River, at which point travelers could have connected to the largest river system in the Maya world, the Usumac- inta and Grijalva rivers and their tributaries. Trade Shrines Throughout the New World, traders and travelers have performed rituals as a way to reduce anxi- eties while passing through unfamiliar territory.</page><page sequence="21">Woodfill et al.] CHANGING PATTERNS OF RITUAL ACTIVITY 1 1 3 This pattern has been previously identified in anthropological (e.g., Adams and Brady 1994, 2005; de Borhegyi 1953; Kendall 1991; Nielsen 200 1 ) and archaeological (Bauer and Stanish 200 1 ; Coggins and Shane 1984; Folan 1974; Woodfill 2007, 2010) contexts. The modern Q'eqchi' often make pilgrimages to sacred places that are home to important tzuul- taq'aeb' at various times of the year (Adams and Brady 1994, 2005). These beings, literally "hill- val- leys," own different parts of land, and before any harvesting, planting, building, marketing, and trav- eling is conducted, offerings are made to them (Adams and Brady 1994, 2005:307; Garcia and Demarest 2004; Wilson 1993; see also Vogt 1976, Watanabe 1983). Trade routes are often associated with specific shrines (Crone 1987; Nielsen 2001 ; Petersen 1994). Along a major llama caravan route in the Andes, for example, travelers stop to perform rituals at a variety of shrines that are associated with resting- points (Nielsen 2001:178). The primary ritual site is located at the mid-point of the journey; rituals there involved petitioning assistance from the mal- Ikus in acquiring the goods they have set out to obtain (Nielsen 2001:180-181). These shrines are often located at political or geographical boundaries (Adams and Brady 1994, 2005; Nielsen 2001 ; Polo Sifontes 1979; Sallnow 1991:298). This is most visible in the llama caravan routes discussed above - not only is the major shrine at the highest point of the journey but small shrines called apacheras have been set up at summits, passes, and difficult parts of the route (Nielsen 2001 : 1 82). Hun Nal Ye is located near the edge of the high- lands and the mid-point of the route connecting the central Peten to the central highlands, and the elab- orately decorated stone coffer and vessels were likely attempts to set up a reciprocal relationship with the supernatural beings who controlled this swath of land, encouraging them to return their generosity with protection while passing through, much like the contemporary Maya and Andean merchants. The presence of nonlocal styles in the Terminal Preclassic/Early Classic assemblage would fit with this pattern of nonlocal use, and the fact that the vessels are stylistically associated with both the central highlands and the central lowlands strengthens the associations with the trade route. In a similar vein, the parts of the cave chosen for ritual activity (see Figure 14a) were the most impressive parts of the cave. During the Late Classic, by contrast, the ritual appears to have been performed primarily by locals. The ceramic assemblage is typical for that found in other nearby sites (Arnauld 1986; Smith 1952; Woodfill 2007, 2010) and activity appears to have been largely limited to areas visible from the cave exterior where an audience could gather to observe it (see Figure 14b). This pattern is common in cave contexts throughout the Maya world (e.g., Brady 1989; Peterson 2006; Prüfer 2002; Woodfill 2002, 2007, 2010) and is often convincingly interpreted to represent ritual events that were related to the maintenance of elite power.1 Wider Cultural-Historical Context and Implications The key to understanding this pronounced break in ritual patterns could be found in other shrines to the north of the cave as well as larger patterns in interregional politics and trade. As has been pre- viously proposed (Woodfill et al. 2006; Woodfill 2007, 2010), it appears that the ritual during these distinct phases was undertaken by different pop- ulations for different ends. In the Terminal Pre- classic/Early Classic, the Great Western Trade Route (Demarest and Fahsen 2003), one of two natural routes that appears to have connected the central Peten to the central highlands (Adams 1978; Arnauld 1990; Demarest 2006; Demarest et al. 2008; Hammond 1972), became increas- ingly important for moving highland and Pacific coastal goods into the lowlands (see Figure 12), and Hun Nal Ye appears to have been one of a series of shrines that were visited by merchants and travelers passing through. In the Late and Ter- minal Classic, however, the establishment of Can- cuen and other cities along the route and their increased militarization (Demarest 2006; Demarest and Barrientos 2002; Demarest and Fahsen 2003) led to a diminishment of long-dis- tance travel along the trade route, an apparent pop- ulation explosion, and pronounced change from internationalization to regionalization. This would have had major ramifications for ritual activities at Hun Nal Ye and other shrines in the region, as well as for the economic livelihoods of nearby settlements. The fact that the route was</page><page sequence="22">114 L ATI N AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 1 , 201 2 cut virtually in half by the establishment of Can- cuen as a production center greatly decreased the amount of long-distance traffic moving between the highlands and central lowlands, which could account for the drastic reduction in ritual at Hun Nal Ye and the Candelaria Caves, and the disap- pearance of exotic styles in the latter assemblage. Instead, the shrines became sites for local public ritual, where they were, for the first time, used in a manner analogous to temples in the Maya lowlands - stages for power-building ritual events (see Demarest 1992; Hammond 1991; McAnany 1995). This focus on ritual theater in cave contexts has been identified at a variety of other Classic period sites (e.g., Brady 1989; Brady et al. 1997; Ishihara 2007; Peterson 2006; Prüfer 2002; Rissolo 2003; Woodfill 2002, 2010), and is identified through the presence of decorated ceramics atop naturally-lit stages above where a crowd could gather to observe the events (Brady 1989). The brightly decorated smashed vessels at the cave entrance represent this pattern clearly. The absence of exotic materials dating to the Late and Terminal Classic periods fits with the pat- tern observed at other shrines throughout the region, in which evidence of interregional trade and tran- sit diminishes, and formerly "international" sacred sites become local shrines with sporadic use (Woodfill 2007, 2010). The material all belongs to a purely northern highland tradition, making it the northernmost periphery of this sphere - the Can- delaria Caves and the neighboring villages demon- strate a strong admixture of northern highland, southern lowland, and the "transversal" tradition located between them. At present, three settlements have been identi- fied near Hun Nal Ye, although no investigations have been undertaken there, so it is impossible to make any definitive statement about the local set- tlement history. However, the fact that the ritual ceased by the Terminal Classic might indicate a retraction of population back into the northern high- lands as the chaos of the collapse spread through the southern lowlands. In the Candelaria Caves and neighboring shrines north of Hun Nal Ye, the ces- sation of ritual activity appears to correspond to the abandonment of Cancuen and other major settle- ments and the reduction of the local population to small bands of squatters (Demarest 2006; Demarest and Fahsen 2003; Foias 1996; O'Mansky and Dun- ning 2004; Woodfill 2010). While the northern highlands did have a cultural renaissance during the Terminal Classic and Postclassic (Arnauld 1986; King 1974), there is no evidence that the Hun Nal Ye region shared in it. Conclusions When Hun Nal Ye was originally discovered, it was viewed as an important window into ancient Maya ritual. But since it was a pristine shrine with nearly 1,000 years of culture history contained within it, the cave has allowed us to examine questions related to trade and economics as well as change in ritual activity. Although the ceramic typology in the cave lacks the fine chronological detail that is present in many regions in the Maya world (e.g., Culbert 2006; Foias 1996; Rands 2007; Smith 1955; Willey et al. 1994), including other nearby sites currently under investigation (Bill et al. 2003; Forné et al. 2007), it is possible to paint the history of ritual activity there in broad strokes, allowing the cave data and larger interregional patterns to mutually inform each other. In the Terminal Preclassic and Early Classic, when Tikal and its allies in the central Peten began to expand and get involved in the pro- duction and exchange of prestige goods (Bachand 2010; Culbert 1996; Jones 1996; Martin 2003; Mar- tin and Grube 2000; Sabloff 2003; Willey and Matthews 1985; Woodfill and Andrieu 2012), the material in this cave was stylistically related to both ends of the interregional trade, containing cached whole vessels from the sources of highland goods - the Motagua Valley, the Salama Valley, and the Valley of Guatemala - and a stone coffer that is stylistically and iconographically linked to the central Peten, the end-point of many of the materials brought along the route. After the "Classic hiatus," in which Tikal was defeated by Calakmul, first with the help of Cara- col and again with Dos Pilas (Martin and Grube 1995, 2000), reducing its power over interregional trade, the riverine section of the trade route appears to have been taken over by Calakmul (Demarest 1997, 2006; Demarest and Fahsen 2003; Demarest et al. 2008). Soon after, however, Tikal defeated Calakmul; neither of the cities was able to solid- ify their power along the trade route again. The river was divided among local hegemonies and</page><page sequence="23">Woodfill et al.] CHANGING PATTERNS OF RITUAL ACTIVITY 1 1 5 eventually Balkanized (Demarest 1997, 2006; Demarest and Fahsen 2003, Demarest et al. 2008). By A.D. 760, Cancuen residents became the prin- cipal producers of a variety of luxury goods made from highland raw materials (Andrieu 2008, 2009; Andrieu and Forné 2010). Cancuen's role as a cen- tral point of the trade route, seeds of which date back to its founding in the seventh century (Demarest and Barrientos 2002; Demarest and Fah- sen 2003; Demarest et al. 2008), would have cut the merchants' trips in half. This change likely would have either reduced the need that they felt to perform rituals insuring safe passage since the merchants would not have strayed as far from home, or would have inspired them to seek other trade shrines that were not located as close to the end of the road. Hun Nal Ye and the Candelaria Caves, which had been so sacred to travelers in pre- vious generations, would have been ideal places to perform the status-reinforcing rituals needed by local leaders, and indeed they were major foci of such events during this latter period of use. Although cave archaeology has come a long way towards mainstream acceptance, many Mesoamerican archaeologists still dismiss caves as hitting a single note - ritual. While this is an engaging, important, and fruitful topic for research, the material encountered in caves, while the result of ritual activity, is well-suited to additional avenues of inquiry (see Brady 1992, 1994; Brady and Ris- solo 2006; Brady et al. 1998; Ishihara 2007; Ris- solo 2003). Due to the ease of access to archaeological remains and a typical lack of deep deposition, they provide a solid base for creating preliminary models of regional culture-history to be tested by future research. The discovery of Hun Nal Ye provided the spark that allowed a higher degree of collaboration between the cave project and other segments of the Cancuen Archaeological Project - ceramics, set- tlement patterns, and epigraphy. As it continues to guide research in the Pasión- Verapaz region, we hope that it also serves as an example for other archaeologists, promoting a fuller integration of ritual remains into archaeological paradigms in Mesoamerica and beyond.

Classic Maya civilization is typically conceived of as a "theater state" in which elite power is largely based on ritual performance and individual charisma (Demarest 1984, 1992; Hammond 1991; McAnany 1995; Scheie and Miller 1986; Sharer 1993;), so this should not be at all surprising.
