As the four books reviewed here demonstrate, it was also, moreover, a remarkable year for scholarship on the  relations of making and knowing in science and art. Evolutionary science turns out to be a fascinating case study  for exploring a variety of topics central to the history of British visual  culture, science, and aesthetics. in the roughly half-century that has  passed since Victorian Studies published its first Darwin issue in 1959,  studies of Darwin have catalyzed several new directions in scholarship.  The “visual turn” in the historiography of art, literature, and science  The simultaneous bicentennial of Charles Darwin’s birth and the 150th anniversary of the publi- cation of On the Origin of Species in 2009 brought a flowering of new scholarship on Darwin;  much of this work is here considered in a special review section. Spring 2010 </page> <page sequence="2"> 442 JEnniFEr TUCkEr and technology studies, for example, as well as the growth of “visual  culture” as a conceptual field within art history and the “sociological”  turn in the history of science, directed new attention to the study of  audiences, visual practices, and material artifacts of knowledge produc- tion, sometimes exposing shortcomings in historical interpretations  arrived at on the basis of textual sources alone. gillian Beer, Janet  Browne, Lynda nead, Jonathan Smith, James Secord, and others have  given us new ways to think about how visual arts, scientific observation,  and representation can serve as guides to the changing definitions of  Victorian science and art, the politics and boundaries of scientific  meaning and intellectual authority, and the changing role of publicity  and science in an age of new media. Studies of scientific illustrations  have offered new ways to think about key cultural themes of modern  British history, such as the creation of racial and ethnic hierarchies,  assumptions about gender, sex and sexuality, and human and animal  nature. investigations into the cultural significance and currency of  scientific visualizations that have acquired or lost value in the course of  their travels across different scientific and popular domains offer new  understandings about the dynamics of social trust in scientific facts as  well as the characteristics of knowledge production.1 in light of the interest—sparked by the recent anniversary of the  publication of On the Origin of Species (1859)—in Darwin’s individual  agency in the history of science and art, it is notable that several contribu- tors to books on Darwin, science, and the visual arts have emphasized the  social, cultural, and material and practical dimensions of science and  scientific understanding. For several of these authors, the achievement of  scientific knowledge is shown as more evidently a collective accomplish- ment whose significance goes far beyond what can be grasped by and  justified to an individual knower, embedded in concrete practices, insti- tutions, and material settings. The four books reviewed here offer substan- tial evidence that the visual arts influenced Darwin’s formative years as a  scientist and that his theory of evolution inspired artists of his day and  after.  Three of the reviewed works are edited collections of essays with  multiple authors, two of which were written to accompany major exhibi- tions. The authors are leading international specialists, from a variety of  disciplines, including history of science, history of art, visual anthro- pology, comparative literature, as well as studio art and creative writing.  (That only two authors overlap between them is but one indication of the   ViCTOriAn STUDiES / VOLUME 52, nO. 3 </page> <page sequence="3"> rEViEW FOrUM On CHArLES DArWin AnD DArWiniAnA 443 wide range and scope of work currently being done in this area.) Along  with recent books by Browne, Constance Clark, and Smith, the books  reviewed here open new fields of study of Darwinism and visual arts.2  Jeanette Hoorn’s edited collection of essays for Reframing  Darwin: Evolution and Art in Australia, published to accompany an exhi- bition at the ian potter Museum of Art at the University of Melbourne,  is beautifully illustrated, with over one hundred thirty reproductions,  including ink sketches, oil paintings, photos, prints, watercolors, litho- graphs, and digital prints. The exhibition and essays offer a fresh look  at how Darwin’s thinking has influenced representations of human  beings, animals, and nature from Australian colonial art until today.  Artworks ranging from popular illustration to the high art of the salon  played their part in evolutionary controversies, and the volume’s twelve  contributors consider their significance, as well as how contemporary  artists continue to grapple with the scientific, ethical, and political  implications of Darwinism. Two chapters provide new information  about Augustus Earle and Conrad Martens, the artists with whom  Darwin associated on board H.M.S. Beagle: Sarah Thomas explores  the antislavery sentiments developed in Earle’s paintings, while Eliza- beth Ellis examines the experiences of the London-born Martens, who  replaced Earle and later settled in new South Wales, becoming the  best-known artist working in the colony between 1835 and 1878. Several  chapters treat the reception of Darwinian theory in nineteenth- and  twentieth-century Australia among leading scientists and among  literary and visual artists. Hoorn writes about the Australian artist Tom  roberts’s portraits of non-European people, painted in the early 1890s,  and Ted gott examines the wider context for the 1907 reception in  Melbourne of the French academic artist Emmanuel Frémiet’s bronze  statuette, Gorilla Carrying Off a Woman. Essays by Hoorn and Danielle  Clode discuss Darwin’s observations as a naturalist in Australia and  how he drew on Australia as evidence for theories years after his initial  visit, while two fine essays consider the challenges posed by Darwin’s  reconfiguration of nature to scientific illustration: Amelia Scurry’s  examination of the marine studies made by Louisa Anne Meredith, a  British-born settler in Tasmania, and Smith’s discussion of the  contrasting norms of avian representation in John and Elizabeth  gould’s The Birds of Australia (1840-48) and Darwin’s Descent of Man  (1871). Finally, in two essays by Alex Taylor and Barbara Creed, we are  treated to a stimulating discussion of how contemporary Australian  Spring 2010 </page> <page sequence="4"> 444 JEnniFEr TUCkEr artists, including John Wolesley and Julie rrap, explore evolutionary  and “post-Darwinian” themes in their projects. phillip prodger’s Darwin’s Camera: Art and Photography in the  Theory of Evolution, illustrated with over one hundred reproductions,  mostly albumen prints, breaks new ground in the history of photog- raphy, Victorian visual culture, and Darwin studies. prodger offers an  empirically rich study that sheds light on Darwin’s innovative use of  the new medium of photography, both as evidence and illustration for  his groundbreaking theories. Although Darwin did not take up photog- raphy, he was intrigued by photographic processes and pioneered  innovative ways of using photography. Darwin’s The Expression of the  Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), for example, was one of the first  photographically illustrated scientific texts and inspired further inves- tigations by many others, including the author and photographer  Lewis Carroll and the italian anthropologist paolo Mantegazza.  Although much has been made of Darwin’s poor artistic skills, prodger  shows that Darwin responded to the demand for visual methods in  Victorian natural sciences in a variety of different ways. He roughed  out drawings for more talented hands to improve, and he was exacting  in the demands he made of the various artists he employed. Darwin’s  well-known passion for collecting natural objects extended, moreover,  to collecting prints, drawings, and photos during the key decades of  the 1860s and 1870s. prodger’s research provides new information  about Darwin’s knowledge of art history, his use of passion manuals,  and the help given to him by the individual artists (including Oscar  rejlander) who guided Darwin in his search for pictures. He unearths  a network of intriguing and hitherto unexplored connections among  photography and biology in the mid-nineteenth century. He succeeds  in showing that understanding Darwin’s place in the history of rela- tions between science and art requires a recognition of a wider range  of relevant issues than simply his dubious artistic abilities—and that  Darwin not only contributed to science but that he also “changed the  way pictures are seen and made” (xxiv). Darwin’s Camera is valuable to  historians of science and art, as well as to students of photography and  the emerging field of the history of emotions.  The Art of Evolution: Darwin, Darwinisms, and Visual Culture,  edited by Barbara Larson and Fae Brauer, contains essays by eleven  leading scholars from the fields of the history of art, literature, the  history of science, photography, museum studies, and studio art: Janet   ViCTOriAn STUDiES / VOLUME 52, nO. 3 </page> <page sequence="5"> rEViEW FOrUM On CHArLES DArWin AnD DArWiniAnA 445 Browne, prodger, Marsha Morton, robert Michael Brain, Brauer,  James krasner, Larson, pat Simpson, gavin parkinson, Sara Barnes,  and Andrew patrizio. Larson, in her introduction, observes that  Darwinism rapidly “infiltrated the Western world on a variety of levels,  significantly influencing its visual culture” (2). Yet visual responses to  Darwinian theory were not merely “illustrations” of his ideas; rather,  they responded to what were understood to be the wider implications  of Darwin’s thinking, including the fears and fantasies that his reinter- pretations of nature (including human nature) provoked.3  The Art of Evolution considers how aspects of evolutionary theo- ries were expressed or resisted in the themes of art from the nineteenth  century through the present, and how Darwin’s view of the workings of  nature challenged traditional aestheticism in ways that resonated both  in art theory and in the practice of painting. prodger investigates the  “beauty” question at the heart of Darwin’s debate with the Victorian  art critic John ruskin. Other topics explored include how the twen- tieth-century French painter Henri rousseau interpreted his animal  paintings in terms of the mutualist politics of peter kropotkin and  Elisée rèclus (Brauer); how the development of “biomechanics”  through photographs and avant-garde theater became linked with the  mechanized “new person” Bolshevik ideal in russian Darwinism  during the 1920s (Simpson); and why complex roles of nature,  Darwinism, and evolutionary theory may be found within Surrealism,  specifically in the work of Max Ernst (parkinson). Browne makes a  persuasive case for cartoons as visual statements, or active participants  in “propelling the idea of evolution” into the “ordinary world of humor,  newspapers, and demotic literature” (34). Brain investigates how  “protoplasmania” brought to Darwinism a new aesthetic grammar of  waves and energy curves that appealed to many artists and aesthetic  theorists (92), and krasner considers how the Darwinian visual  aesthetic of typing and selection operated in illustrated editions of  Thomas Hardy’s Tess of the D’Urbervilles (1891). Brauer shows that the  exhibition of Darwin’s portraits alongside those of his cousin Francis  galton at eugenics exhibitions in the early 1900s was a framing tech- nique that helped shape the public’s image of eugenics and of Darwin’s  relationship to it, while Barnes and patrizio explore in their essay how  contemporary artists are responding to Darwin’s ideas and legacies. Endless Forms: Charles Darwin, Natural Science and the Visual Arts,  edited by Diana Donald and Jane Munro, accompanied an outstanding  Spring 2010 </page> <page sequence="6"> 446 JEnniFEr TUCkEr exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum, University of Cambridge, and the  Yale Center for British Art. The book includes over three hundred beauti- fully reproduced works from the exhibition, including oil paintings, wood  engravings, watercolors, lithographs, etchings, aquatints, albumen prints,  and photographs of taxidermy mounts. Following an introduction by  Donald and an essay on Darwin and visual taste at Down House by Julius  Bryant, the remaining essays are divided into three sections: “Darwinian  Theory and the picturing of the natural World,” “The Descent of Human- kind: Animal Ancestry, Cultural Evolution and racial Theory,” and  “Darwin, Aesthetic Theory and nineteenth-Century Art Movements.” As  Donald points out in her excellent overview, “Darwinism was never a  monolithic system of belief, and . . . responses to these theories were as  various as the individuals concerned” (20). in the first section, for  example, rebecca Bedell demonstrates how for artists, as for Darwin, an  understanding of the significance of geological formations made it  possible to see nature in a new way, and nicola gauld writes perceptively  about responses to Darwinism in illustrated natural histories of the later  nineteenth century. Donald explores the theme of the “struggle for exis- tence” in Victorian animal painting and in social realist art and, in a  jointly authored essay with Jan Eric Olsén, draws new attention to the  importance of Darwinian ideas of animal coloration for artists such as  the Swedish painter Bruno Liljefors and the American Abbott Thayer. in  section 2, David Bindman examines the visualizations of the “descent of  man” in nineteenth-century art both before and after Darwin; Elizabeth  Edwards writes on photography, race, and popular Darwinism, demon- strating that photography became one of the “major public media  through which scientific ideas were performed” (167); Donald considers  Darwin’s theory of expression and issues of anthropomorphism raised by  the pictorial depiction of animals in nineteenth-century Britain; and Julia  Voss contrasts the popular visual motif of the demonic gorilla with  Darwin’s more sympathetic portrait of simian mental and moral traits in  Descent and in Expression. Munro, Jonathan Smith, and richard kendall  contribute to the third section with a set of essays exploring, in turn, the  controversy surrounding Darwin’s evolutionary views of aesthetics, the  wider cultural implications of Darwin’s theory of sexual selection, and  the connections that exist between Darwin’s theories and aspects of the  art of French impressionist painters. The four books reviewed here provide an excellent overview of  the material relations of making and knowing during the nineteenth   ViCTOriAn STUDiES / VOLUME 52, nO. 3 </page> <page sequence="7"> rEViEW FOrUM On CHArLES DArWin AnD DArWiniAnA 447 century, the significance of global networks of artists and scientists, and  the nature of the structures and forces shaping the visualization of  knowing and knowledge. Of particular interest to Victorianists may be  their shared elements: their broad conception of visual arts and culture  (including “high” art as well as cartoons, digital images, and sketches),  the breadth of sources upon which they draw, and the multiple approaches  they combine. The authors differ from each other in several interesting  ways, however, from their interpretations of popular visual culture and  the scope of the evolutionary theory, to their employment of concepts  such as artistic or scientific influence and impact. There are also different  arguments being made here about the legitimacy of “visual culture” as an  object of historical analysis. Histories of science are not usually written for the purpose of  exhibitions or with exhibitions in mind. What is particularly exciting,  then, about the exhibition-inspired collections of essays is the opportu- nity they provide to think about how new definitions of science are  created through displays of objects. Science is often presented as being  only about ideas but, as the exhibitions and essays demonstrate so well,  science is also about practices: the making of objects (in art as well as in  science), practices of theory, and practices of evidence and proof. Science  and art are not just distinct realms that have to be forced together but  rather overlapping ways of seeing and knowing. The wide number of  places from which the working objects of evolutionary science were  borrowed from other institutions says a great deal, moreover, about the  expanding global networks of science in the nineteenth century. readers will be rewarded by insights into several new directions  in the ongoing work of Darwin studies. Several authors of these works  urge further study. notably, future studies are particularly needed on the  relationship of the visual arts to other varieties of evolutionary theory  besides Darwinian theory, which itself was interpreted in widely different  ways, even by Darwin’s supporters, as Browne and Bernard Lightman,  among others, have shown.  The four books reviewed here are significant for scholars of Victo- rian studies, modern European history, history of science, and the history  of art, and will compel interest from general readers. One of the most  important accomplishments of these projects is not merely that they bring  together people from various disciplines but that they allow individual “art”  and “science” historians to use a variety of methods, required by the  demands of their complex subject. By employing an array of different tech- Spring 2010 </page> <page sequence="8"> 448 JEnniFEr TUCkEr niques, approaches, and questions, the contributors shed important new  light on Darwin’s indebtedness to the visual dimensions of science and on  the legacy of his work in visual terms for scientists, artists, and others.  Wesleyan University NOTES 1Works exploring visual art-science connections are often accompanied by an  obligatory reference to British scientist and novelist C. p. Snow’s “The Two Cultures”  (1959). As David Hollinger has argued, however, Snow created a prodigious debate, but  not for reasons that are always recognized. Snow attacked a highly particular literary  culture on moral grounds; he was not defending the need for bridging the study of visual  art and science. For more on Snow see Hollinger, “Science.”  2See especially Clark’s “‘You are Here’: Missing Links, Chains of Being, and the  Language of Cartoons,” “ignoring the Elephants: Visual images and Jazz Age Critics,”  and “Evolution for John Doe: pictures, the public, and the Scopes Trial Debate.” See also  the September 2009 Isis special issue on Darwin. 3For more discussion of this topic see also potts and Meyers, Endless Forms, vii.
