Copyright (C) by the Society for American Archaeology Research during the last several decades has widened the range of cultural domains in which the Precolumbian Maya may be understood. Aspects of Classic and Postclassic Maya behavior that were essentially unknown 50 years ago now provide rich cultural context that can and, indeed, must be considered in any attempts to understand this indigenous New World civilization. An obvious example is the dis- covery that much of the corpus of Classic inscrip- tions has to do with dynastic history; elucidation of these sources has contributed previously unsuspected information about the activities of the rulers and relationships among polities (many examples could be cited, from the early work of Proskouriakoff [1960] to the very recent work of Grube [1994]). In contrast to this, however, the domain of astronomy has been an integral part of Maya studies for more than a century (for exam- ple, the work of Forstemann [1894] on the Venus table of the Dresden Codex). That the ancient Maya were concerned with the cyclical move- ments of celestial objects and that records of such concerns may be found in their hieroglyphic writ- ings are, by now, generally accepted tenets of Maya scholarship. It is equally true, of course, that some of the published claims about Maya astronomical knowledge and practice must now be regarded as undocumented assertions. The fact that the Maya attached significance to the move- ments of some celestial bodies (for example, Venus and the Moon) does not necessarily mean that significance was accorded to any or all others (for example, Mars). This is the context of the current debate with which this paper is concerned. Scholarship concerning Precolumbian Maya astronomy has, to be sure, been underway for more than a century, but it, too, has benefited greatly from the quickened pace and expanded range of research on the written records, inscrip- 384 MORE ON THE MARS TABLE IN THE DRESDEN CODEX Harvey M.

In this field too, what can and must now be consid- ered in attempts at understanding differs appre- ciably from the situation 50 years ago. The Table on Pages 43b to 45b of the Dresden Codex A recent study by Bruce Love (1995) reexamines some scholarship on what has been called the Mars table in the Dresden Codex (Codex Dresdensis 1975). The table appears in the middle or "b" register of pages 43, 44, and 45 of the codex (Figure 1). The table's introduction, which occupies the leftmost column of page 43b, uses a "ring number" (17.12 in bar-and-dot place nota- tion, or 352 days) and a "long-reckoning" value (9.19.8.15.0, or 1,435,980 days) to derive a base date in March of A.D. 818, falling on a day 3 Lamat in the 260-day tzolkin, from an obviously fictitious or mythological 3 Lamat base date in the late fourth millennium B.C. The mythological 3 Lamat preceded the start of the current calendri- cal era, which began on a day 4 Ahau. Following the introduction is a series of multiples of 78 and 780; each numerical statement is accompanied by a day glyph demonstrating that the multiple is to be understood as 3 Lamat + 78, 3 Lamat + (2 x 78), . . ., 3 Lamat + 780, 3 Lamat + (2 x 780), . . ., etc. The reading order of this "table of multi- ples" is, in a general sense, from right to left the smallest multiple (1 x 78 days) is in the rightmost column, whereas the largest multiple (194 x 780) is in the leftmost column.l The final part of the instrument, the table proper (the rightmost part of page 44b plus page 45b), divides a 78-day period into four intervals, of 19, 19, 19, and 21 days respectively. Information about each interval appears in a column containing a hieroglyphic caption, a picture of a chimerical beast hanging from segments of a so-called sky band, and two bar-and-dot numbers indicating both how many days must be added to reach the next column (19 or 21) and the tzolkin coeff1cient (9, 2, 8, or 3) of that next column's starting day. It is well understood that the base date of this table is 3 Lamat, a canonical tzolkin date reached by adding the ring number and long-reckoning value to the mythological 3 Lamat date in the fourth millennium B.C. However, a comparative study of other instruments in the Dresden Codex has led us to the conclusion that this base date is not, in fact, the entry date for the version of the table that appears on pages 44b and 45b. Unlike the eclipse table on pages 51 through 58 (H. Bricker and V. Bricker 1983), but like the Venus table on pages 24 and 46 through 50 (Lounsbury 1983) and the seasonal table on pages 61 through 69 (V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1988), the base date mentioned at the beginning of the introduction (page 43b) is not repeated in the column adjacent to the start of the table proper (page 44b). Lounsbury (1983) has shown for the Venus table that one of the multiples in the table of multiples must be added to the base date before entering the table proper, and we have shown that for the sea- sonal table it is necessary to add the first multiple of 91 days to the base date before entering the table proper. It may be seen, then, that the appli- cation of what one might call the Lounsbury approach to all three of the instruments sharing the same structure (nonrepetition of the base date) leads directly to entry dates that are astronomi- cally consistent with iconography or other fea- tures that is, it leads to synodical stations of Venus and Mars in their respective tables and, in the seasonal table, to eclipse seasons commensu- rated with the stations of the tropical year. It is therefore reasonable to regard this approach as a general methodological principle for the interpre- tation of codical tables containing long-count dates. Thus, the base date of the Mars table is 3 Lamat, but its entry date is 3 Cimi, 78 days later than 3 Lamat. Motions of Mars Scholarly interest in the 780-day instrument stems principally from the suggestion offered long ago by an astronomer, Robert Willson, that it was some sort of "an ephemeris and table of mean motions of Mars ...." (Willson 1924:24). Some of the cyclical changes in the position and appear- ance of Mars as seen by a terrestrial observer may usefully be explained here briefly. Our treatment is a condensation of the classic exposition of these matters by Aveni (1980:82-96). When the Sun, Earth, and Mars are located along a straight line (not considering whether Mars is above or below the plane of the ecliptic) with Earth in the middle position, Mars is said to be in opposition to the Sun (position 1 in Figure 2). At this time, Mars</page><page sequence="3">386 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 4, 1997] 93x 89x 39x 140x 168x 780 780 780 780 780 +260 +180 +520 3 Lamat 8@9_ ' " *--@@@@ e0--0*- * - - - 9 * (st@@*@-- = 19 4@&gt; 6|t &gt; &lt;@ ooo 000 000 ooo ooo 15 5i 6 @ @ 69 @ 3 Lamat ge _I *- | 1 * *1-- 1 . 6@ 17 = _E 12 @9 @6$@ 000 ooo o00 Â°00 ooo 4 Ahau 4) i9 @ @ @ 0 194x 5x 4x 3x 2x 780 780 780 780 780 +260 16x 20x 780 780 +520 * 0 9x 78 8x 78 7x 78 *0w Gb oo o 10x 78  D.43b D.44b- Figure 1. The Mars table on pages 43b to 45b of the Dresden Codex (after Villacorta C. and Villacorta 1976:96, 98, rises at about sunset and sets about sunrise (the exact relationship varying with season), and it is relatively high in the sky (varying with the lati- tude of the observer) at midnight. In the days fol- lowing opposition, Mars rises earlier and earlier that is, increasingly before sunset. It is still visible in the night sky after sunset, but its nightly duration of visibility gets shorter and shorter. By the time Mars has reached the position marked 2 in Figure 2, it is above the terrestrial horizon almost entirely during daylight hours, setting just after sunset. The day on which it is last visible as an "evening star," for just a few moments in the evening twilight, is called "elast." On the following day, it has disappeared behind the Sun (Figure 2), entering into what is, for the terrestrial observer, its period of invisibility. When, during the period of invisibility, Mars, the Sun, and Earth are again located along a straight line, but this time with the Sun in the mid- dle position, Mars is in conjunction with the Sun (position 3 in Figure 2). Some days later, at posi- tion 4, Mars has come out from behind the Sun, entering its period of visibility. On this day, called either "mfirst" or "heliacal rise," Mars rises just before sunrise and is visible for just a few moments before being lost in the glare of the ris- ing Sun. This is its first day of visibility as a "morning star." As Mars rises earlier and earlier in the days that follow, it is visible for longer and longer in the morning sky. Its time of rising backs up through the night until, at opposition once again, it rises at about sunset and is visible for most of the night. The time elapsed between any two successive occurrences of a given "station" of Mars (opposi- tion to opposition, heliacal rise to heliacal rise, etc.) is known as the Martian "synodic period." Because of the eccentricity of the Martian orbit, the length of Mars's synodic period varies markedly around a mean of about 780 days; of this span, the period of invisibility lasts an aver- age of 120 days, leaving an average of 660 days during which Mars is visible during some part of the night (Aveni 1980:89, Table 6).

Mars are of relevance here apparent magnitude and retrograde motion. The brightness or "appar- ent magnitude" of Mars varies greatly throughout its synodic period. To an observer on Earth, the planet is brightest when it is at or near opposition, dimmest just before or after the period of invisi- bility.2 Martian "retrograde motion" refers to the direction of night-to-night change of location of Mars against the celestial background of the fixed stars. The normal direction of motion of Mars (and the other planets) is from west to east through the stars, but there is a period during each synodic cycle when the direction of night-to-night motion is east to west. The average duration of this "retrograde period" is about 75 days, but it varies greatly, from about 60 to more than 80 days. There is, of course, no change in the direc- tion of movement of Mars in its orbit around the Sun, but it looks that way to a terrestrial observer every time Earth in its orbit, moving faster, passes Mars, moving more slowly, in its orbit. As explained more fully by Aveni (1980:87), "the effect may be compared with that experienced by an observer in one car passing another moving in the same direction." As seen from Earth, the rate of nightly west-to-east movement of Mars (from right to left in Figure 3) slows to a stop (defining the night of "Elrst stationary," which fell on 18 May in A.D. 818), then starts up again in the opposite or retrograde direction. This continues until a second slowing and eventual stop ("second stationary," on 20 July A.D. 818), after which a rapidly accelerating motion starts again in the normal direction. The retrograde period, between first and second stationary, is centered on opposi- tion (17 June A.D. 818), which, as we have noted, is when the planet is at its brightest and when it is visible in the sky almost all night long. Previous Scholarship The original suggestion that the table on pages 43b to 45b concerned the motions of Mars was made by Willson (1924) primarily because the synodic period of Mars varies around a mean value of ca. 780 days3 and because the 78-day length of the table's modules is very close to the</page><page sequence="5">[Vol. 8, No. 4, 1997] 388 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY drought, not Mars, and the ring number is best explained in terms of the myth of the birth of the Sky Beast. In a note added in proof, Love con- cludes that the structure of the intervals between columns of the table (19, 19, 19, and then 21 days) argues against a Martian significance because it is "a numerical pattern very common in the Dresden and Madrid codices ...." (1995:360, Note 3). Stated most briefly, Love's conclusion is that although "one can never disprove a Mars con- tent" (1995:359), the case we attempted to make in 1986 in favor of a Martian association is not sufficient to overturn the interpretation of Thompson (1972:107-109), which was very sub- stantially based on the iconographic interpreta- tions of Eduard Seler (1923:549-552). Love's reexamination, coming nearly a decade after our work on the subject, is both welcome and helpful. The erroneous statement we made about the order of pages in the Codex has been corrected, for example.4 It is nevertheless the case, we believe, that Love's attempt to reinstate Thompson's views about the Dresden table does not constitute a refutation of its linkage to Mars. Several points made by Love about the table's iconography, hieroglyphic captions, and numeric or calendrical structure merit comment, in part to take into account the results of new research dur- ing the last decade. The Pictures, the Captions, and Their Relationship to Mars The Mars Beast The Mars Beast (or Sky Beast or Lightning Beast) has both zoomorphic and anthropomorphic vari- ants. The Dresden table shows it, on D.44bA5b, in its fully zoomorphic form, complete with cloven hooves (Figure 1), whereas the remaining portion of the very similar almanac or table,5 M.2a6 (Figure 4), in the Madrid Codex (Codex Tro-Cortesianus 1967) shows it in a more nearly anthropomorphic form, with human hands. Whether this chimerical beast is considered, as by Seler (1923:551), to be reptilelike or, as by Thompson (1972:108-109), to be deerlike or an aspect of Chac is not important here because it does not argue either for or against an association with Mars. VVhat may be important is what the captions are saying about the beast. Leaving for * . . conJunctlon opposition (center of retrograde) Figure 2.

Much of the subsequent scholarship on this table can be characterized as reserved or agnostic about a Martian association (e.g., Aveni 1980; Lounsbury 1978; Teeple 1931), but J. Eric S. Thompson (1950, 1972) strenuously opposed any linkage of the table with Mars. Our own examination of the table (V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1986) indicated to us that Willson had been correct, and we offered a model of how such an instrument could have been used by the ancient Maya. Much of Love's concern in his recent arti- cle is with our interpretations, some of which were supported by Justeson (1989). The principal topics about which Love (1995) expressed dis- agreement with our previous work are the identi- fication of the chimerical beast and the meaning of its somewhat different portrayal in the four columns, the content of the captions, and the sig- nificance of the ring number. He believes that the chimerical beast is a Sky or Lightning Beast hav- ing no Martian associations and that, therefore, any differences in the way it is painted do not reflect differences in the appearance of Mars. The glyphic captions, according to Love, have to do in large measure with weather, agriculture, and</page><page sequence="6">CAP - - _ _ _ _ _ 8 Apr = &gt; 23 Ap 5 0ct 18 Mayq S G R 20 Sep - q 5 Sep 20 Jul q 11 Jul *e SCO A REPORT 389 Figure 3.

Black dots represent stars in the constellations of Capricornus (CAP), Sagittarius (SGR), and Scorpius (SCO). another occasion a discussion of the appropriate decipherment of the "axe-comb" verb, as well as of Thompson's speculations about the meteoro- logical and agricultural implications of various glyphs, we can say, quite neutrally, that the cap- tions to all four pictures on D.44b-45b begin with the "axe-comb" verb, followed immediately by the beast's head-variant glyph (T794), which is most probably the subject of the verb. The beast is the protagonist of the action, and all four captions begin with the statement that "the beast did some- thing." The majority of the captions in the Madrid Codex version (M.2a) are effaced, but the lower row contains a clear example of the "axe-comb" collocation (without the verbal suffix) followed by the head variant of "God C," a generic desig- nation for 'god' read as ku in Yucatec (Ringle 1988). The message here appears to be that "the god is doing something." One implication of a comparison of the cap- tions in the two codices is that the beast is, some- times at least, spoken of as a god perhaps even Chac (although the name glyph of Chac can be found in neither set of captions). We know, how- ever, that for the authors of the codices a planet could be represented by or better, perhaps, impersonated by- anthropomorphized deities. This is what is shown for Venus, repeatedly and with textual explicitness, in the Dresden's Venus table. In the introduction on page 24 of the table, as well as on the five pages that follow, a series of gods is equated with Venus (Lounsbury 1978:779). For example, in the text immediately under the picture of the spearer on page 47, the god Lahun Chan '10 sky' (Thompson 1972:68) is said to be Venus. There is, then, no reason to deny the chimerical beast some planetary association just because it may sometimes be semantically associated with a god. Even if it sometimes acts like Chac, it may still be a Mars Beast. Brightness of Mars The question of the relationship between how Mars looked, on the one hand, and how much of the beast is shown "extruded" from the sky band, on the other, is one to which there is no certain answer. Our original suggestion that "changes in the visibility of the 'Mars beast' correspond in a general way to the changes in the brightness of the planet as the retrograde period is approached, reached, and left behind" (V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1986:57) is based on a real astronomical phenomenon. The rapidity with which Mars becomes brighter as the retrograde period is approached (a consequence of the rapidly narrow- ing distance between it and Earth) is one of the striking characteristics of its synodic cycle. Perhaps the iconographic variation refers to such changing visibility, or perhaps our suggestion was too literal and the variation has some other mean-</page><page sequence="7">lVol. 8, No. 4, 19971 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 390 Figure 4. Fragment of a Mars almanac or table on page 2a of the Madrid Codex (partially redrawn after Codex Tro- Cortesianus 1967; calendrics checked against Codice Tro-Cortesiano 1991). because the eccentric orbit of Mars causes great variation in the distance between it and Earth at this time of closest approach. The same is true when Mars, moving out from behind the Sun at the end of its period of invisibility and first becom- ing visible in the morning sky, is relatively far from Earth and relatively dim. Despite such varia- tion, however, Mars is always much brighter at opposition than at heliacal rise.7 Perhaps this is why the retrograde period, centered on opposition, is, as we believe, depicted in the Mars table rather than heliacal rise, as is the case in the Dresden's Venus table. The apparent brightness of Venus is ing. However, it is not the case, as Love (1995:357) suggests, that the variation in how much of the body is visible is a function of differ- ent artistic hands. The greatest variation in this feature is within the series (pictures 2, 3, and 4) attributed to the same hand, not between this series and picture 1, which we agree is probably the work of a different artist. Variation in the apparent brightness of Mars throughout its synodic cycle may well be relevant to the Mars table in a more general way. The max- imum apparent brightness of Mars, at opposition, is very variable (data from Hinckley ] 989)</page><page sequence="8">REPORT 391 greatest near times of heliacal set and rise, and these are the (only) two synodical stations that are signaled accurately by the Venus table. Position of Mars during Its Retrograde Loop There is another way in which the iconography of the Mars Beast on pages 44b and 45b may be related to the appearance of Mars in the sky during its retrograde loop in A.D. 818, the stated contem- porary date of the table. Retrograde movement can be perceived by a terrestrial observer as a change in the position of Mars from one night to the next with reference to the background pattern of the fixed stars. This phenomenon was discussed and shown graphically by Aveni (1980:88, Figure 36) for a Martian retrograde period in A.D. 1975-1976. A diagram drawn by us in the same way for the retrograde period of A.D. 818 (Figure 3) shows that in the months preceding retrograde, Mars was moving along quite close to the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun through the sky. As the time of retrograde approached, Mars moved below the ecliptic, increasingly so during the ret- rograde period. Its lowest position below the path of the Sun, as measured by celestial latitude, occurred on 11 July A.D. 818 (Gregorian), about a week before second stationary and the end of ret- rograde motion. After the retrograde period, Mars returned slowly to its former latitudinal position, crossing back to above the ecliptic in January A.D. 819 (beyond the plotted range of Figure 3). Not all retrograde loops take Mars downward (southward) below the ecliptic, but this one did, from ca. 1Â° above the ecliptic before retrograde to over 5Â° below the ecliptic near the end of retrograde. The total change of over 6Â° of celestial latitude (approximately seven Sun diameters) would defi- nitely have been detectable by terrestrial observers. The portrayal of the Mars Beast may well reflect the celestial phenomenon discussed above. More of the beast is visible in the second picture than in the other three, and the 19-day interval associated with that picture contains the date on which Mars reached its lowest celestial latitude, -5.31Â° (Table 1). It is possible that the pictures of the beast dangling beneath the sky band, at first to a greater and then to a lesser extent, represent Mars's deep but temporary drop below the path of the Sun. This suggestion is quite consistent with the view of Schele that the sky band as it is shown in the Maya codices represents the ecliptic "and that almost all the symbols directly attached to double-headed serpents and to skybands are plan- ets or constellations along the ecliptic" (Freidel et. al. 1993:422, Note 34). We do not suggest, of course, that the ancient Maya defined the ecliptic exactly in the sense of modern Western astron- omy, but it is highly probable they would have recognized the path of the Sun through the stars. The suggestion offered above about the iconography of Mars below the ecliptic should, if valid, apply to other examples of the Mars Beast dangling from a sky band. The only other unam- biguous such example occurs, as part of the sea- sonal table (V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1988), on page 68a of the Dresden Codex, as illustrated and discussed by Love (1995:357, Figure 7). Here the beast hangs from the center of its back, rather than from its hindquarters, in a more nearly hori- zontal posture. The eight-day interval with which this picture is associated in the stated contempo- rary version of the table begins on 16 December A.D. 949 (Gregorian), at which time Mars (not in retrograde) was about one-quarter of a degree below the ecliptic. This position is, therefore, consistent with the iconographic suggestion. Whether the same may be said of the Mars Beasts on page 2a of the Madrid Codex (Figure 4) is not, however, certain. The iconographic details, including the relationship between the beast and the sky band, are quite different from those of the Dresden table.8 Furthermore, as discussed below in the section concerned with the distance-num- ber intervals, the structure of the Madrid instru- ment cannot be determined with certainty from the only portions surviving, nor can we know for sure whether it refers to the same retrograde period (A.D. 818) dealt with by the Dresden instrument. If it does, the 156 days shown in the (partial) Madrid instrument could possibly repre- sent some of the 304 days Mars spent below the ecliptic during the synodic cycle centered on the A.D. 818 retrograde loop. We cannot, however, expect clear answers from this damaged remnant.

D.45b, in the middle row of the caption over the third picture. We are well aware that Love has, in another context (Love 1994:91-93), argued against the interpretation of these glyphs as indi- cating eclipses, but we believe that his quite extreme position on this matter cannot be accepted. The suggestion about these glyphs made originally by Meinshausen (1913) has been tested repeatedly, and it has been an extremely productive source of further understanding of both archaeoastronomical details and the general structure of the codical tables and almanacs (e.g., V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1988, 1992). One brief example is relevant here: Speaking specifically about the pair of what we and others would call eclipse glyphs above the third picture in the Mars table, Kelley (1976:43) notes that the central ele- ment of the one on the right is an Akbal sign rather than the more usual sign for the Moon. He continues (1976:43): Since akbal is normally 'night' and kin may be either 'sun' or 'day,' one is first tempted to think of an alter- nation here of 'day' and 'night'; 'night darkened' could conceivably be a reference to a stormy night or a lunar eclipse. In previous work (e.g., V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1992:73), we have said that the most likely refer- ent for a pair of eclipse glyphs, one solar and one lunar, assigned to the same interval of a table or almanac is an eclipse season, a period of ca. 36 392 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 8, No. 4, 1997] days centered on a day of lunar nodal passage within which eclipses may occur. Our expectation would be, then, that the 19-day period beginning on 18 July A.D. 818 (Gregorian), to which the third picture of the Mars table applies, contains within it part of an eclipse season. This is, in fact, the case (Table 1). The 2 Kan day (18 July) that begins the interval was a day of nodal passage, the center of an eclipse season. A solar eclipse seven days earlier was not visible in the Maya area, but a lunar eclipse (#5640 of Liu and Fiala 1992) seven days later, on 25 July A.D. 818, probably was visible (unless of course, as Kelley sug- gested, it was a dark and stormy night!). Without taking the extreme position that the glyphs in question always represent eclipses, we think it has been demonstrated that they usually do and that this is their meaning in the Mars table. Given these circumstances, it is not sufficient to say that the table has to do just with weather and agricul- ture; the eclipse cycle is present also. Signifelcance of the Ring Number One of the stated purposes of Love's article is to propose that the tzolkin day 3 Lamat, the day in 3115 B.C. produced by the subtraction of the ring number from the era base, "refers the reader back to the birth of the Sky Beast in the mythological previous era" (Love 1995:353). There is little we can say about such a proposal, except that the written mention of "birth," which was central to Lounsbury's (1980) interpretation of the Palenque inscription that Love takes as a model, is not to be found in the Mars table. We can and must say, however, that the ethnohistorical support for this general idea, which Love cites from the work of Thompson, should not be given any further con- sideration. The "fascinating, parallel 780-day table in the Chilam Balam of Kaua and the Codice Perez with days marked u syan chac 'the birth of Chac"' (Love 1995:353, citing Thompson 1950:259) does not exist in the form implied. Eleven tzolkin days are listed on page 20 of the Kaua document (Bricker and Miram 2000), in the order shown in Table 2. If one calculates the shortest distance in the tzolkin from one day to the next in the order listed, the 11 days imply a total span of 1,924 days (7.4 tzolkin lengths), or 2,080 days if the count is looped back to the 9 Edznab starting day to provide an even 8 tzolkins. This is Table 1. Concordance of Astronomical Events in A.D. 818 and 819 with the Structure, Captions, and Iconography of the Mars Table.</page><page sequence="10">Table 2.

Implementing this suggestion produces an almanac having 10 rows, which for purposes of discussion we can number I through X, and two columns, 1 and 2, starting on a day 9 Edznab. The positions of the Kaua days in the hypothetical almanac are shown in Table 2. Four of the 11 days appearing in the Kaua would not appear in the almanac, and, except for the first three, the ones that would appear do so out of order. (The results would be.slightly worse for the slightly different day list on pages 93-94 of the Codice Perez [Miram 1988].) We cannot regard this as serious evidence for a 780-day birth-of-Chac almanac in colonial Yucatan. If the significance given by Love to the 3 Lamat day in 3115 B.C. (the date of birth of the Sky Beast) cannot be seen as more than specula- tive, is there some other interpretation of this date that should be considered? It is useful here to restate part of Floyd Lounsbury's (1978:806) thoughtful treatment of the general relationship between mythological and historical time and the ring-number/long-reckoning bridges that connect them. These bridges are contrived numbersontrived in such a way as to provide, for each historical date, a base which is its like-in-kind in respect to its position in one or more pertinent calendrical or astronomical cycles. The day of the special base thus has significant attributes in common with the historical day whose chronological position is reckoned from it; and it is, moreover, the last possible one to do so before the beginning of the current era [emphasis in original]. The bridge relevant to the Mars table (the 1,841- x-780-day long reckoning) does, in fact, connect the two days with like-in-kind calendrical and astronomical cycles. The day at the mythological end of the bridge 3 Lamat 1 Uayeb, 24 August 3115 B.C. (Gregorian) was the last possible 3 Lamat day to occur before the beginning of the last possible Martian retrograde period before the beginning of the current era on 4 Ahau 8 Cumku, 11 August 3114 B.C. (Eagle 1988; Hinckley 1989). Furthermore, the Martian retrograde period of 3114 B.C., which extended from about 2 February to 13 April, overlapped temporally with an eclipse season, during which both a solar eclipse (3 April) and a lunar eclipse (17 April) occurred (Kluepfel 1986; Sax 1991). These cir- cumstances last 3 Lamat before a Martian retro- grade coinciding with an eclipse season are the same as those of the historical base date of the table, 3 Lamat 6 Zodz, 24 March A.D. 818 (Gregorian). This is exactly the sort of astronom- icaUcalendrical concordance between mythologi- cal and historical time Lounsbury identified in other codical and inscriptional contexts (although he was apparently unaware that these circum- stances applied to the Dresden Mars table).9 It is, of course, the case that no astronomical data for the year 3114 B.C. implied by the Mars table can be considered to represent an observa- tional record, and no Maya instruments can plau- sibly be interpreted as dealing in a literal fashion with the fourth millennium B.C. Qur interpreta- tion of these circumstances is that the compilers of the Dresden Codex were familiar enough with the cycles of the tzolkin, the synodic period of Mars, and eclipse seasons to be able to retrodict the commensuration of these cycles far into the past and to do so accurately. Distance-Number Intervals Love (1995:360) has suggested, based on some work of Anthony Aveni and his colleagues (Aveni et al. 1995, 1996), that the value and patterning of the distance numbers in the Mars table (19, 19, 19, 21) may offer some clue about the table's function. With this we agree, but when the actual data Aveni et al. were working with are examined,</page><page sequence="11">Sum of Frequency Distance Numbers Dresden Madrida Total 5 1 1 13 1 1 20 1 1 32 _ 1 1 26 8 42 50 39 1 1 52 43 135 178 65 12 51 63 78 lb 1 91 1 1 104 1 1 2 117 1 1 130 2 2 156 1 1 182 3 3 208 1 1 260 1 1 702 1 1 1,460 1 1 2 1,820 1 1 2,920 1 1 11,960 1 1 Total 78 237 315 aMadrid data from Vail 1996 and personal communication 1993. bThis is the Mars table discussed here. [Vol. 8, No. 4, 1997] 394 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY they do not argue against an astronomical associ- ation for the table. The papers of Aveni et al. (1995, 1996), studies of the Madrid Codex by Vail (1996, personal communication 1993) used by both Aveni and us, and our own data on the Dresden Codex show that the 19-19-19-21 series found in the Mars table is literally unique among the 315 codical instruments that are complete enough to permit diagnosis. It is, furthermore, the only instrument in the sample of 315 in which the distance numbers in all columns of the table or almanac sum to 78 (Table 3). Several of the instruments (7 of 21) with distance numbers sum- ming to more than 65 are like the Mars table in that their iconography or their captions include an astronomical referent in the form of Venus and/or eclipse glyphs, and an additional four contain sol- stice or equinox iconography. This relatively high proportion suggests that all codical instruments with high distance-number totals should be exam- ined closely for possible astronomical cycles. However that may be, the data of Table 3 suggest that D.43b-45b is not just another Chac almanac and that something more is involved here. One of the codical instruments that could not be included in the sample of 315 discussed in the preceding paragraph is the other principal occur- rence of the Mars or Sky Beast, the table or almanac on M.2a (Figure 4). All four of the lower series of distance numbers are l9s, but the tzolkin coefficients (3, 9, 2, and 8) are correct only if the fourth distance number is corrected to 21. On the basis of the few remaining traces of paint, the upper series of distance numbers and coefficients cannot be shown to differ from the lower series. The tzolkin coefficient corresponding to the fourth picture is once again an 8, and the fourth distance number is greater than 14 but less than 20, definitely not 21. Because the tzolkin coeffi- cients are the same as those of the Dresden's Mars table, it is likely that the Madrid instrument had the same starting day, but this cannot be deter- mined. The beginning of the table or almanac must have been on the now completely effaced page 1 or some now missing page even earlier in the fanfold sequence. What remains on M.2a offers the intriguing possibility that a 780-day instrument (if the sequence of tzolkin coefficients is regarded as correct) may have been shown here in a much less abbreviated form than the one in Table 3. Numerical Patterning in the Almanacs and Tables of the Dresden and Madrid Codices. the Dresden (it could have contained as many as 40 pictures). However that may be, M.2a in its present form shows us that the four subdivisions of two different periods of (most probably) 78 days have somewhat different iconographic con- tent. For example, the fourth beast of the upper series carries a torch, whereas the fourth beast of the lower series carries an axe. It is, therefore, quite reasonable to suggest, as we have done for the Mars table, that some specific iconography refers to only one small part of the total length of the instrument, not to every successive occurrence within the almanac of the time interval denoted by the column in which the picture is physically located. That this targeted relationship between pictures (or captions) and dates is a general char- acteristic of codical almanacs has been demon- strated repeatedly in contexts that involve astronomy (e.g., the seasonal almanacs on pp. lOb and c to llb and c of the Madrid Codex [V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1988:S31-S40]), as well</page><page sequence="12">REPORT 395 as contexts that do not (e.g., the "burner" almanac on page 63b of the Madrid Codex [V. Bricker 1997]). The Mars Table: A Tool for Commensuration Our final comment concerns what Love (1995:359) calls "the remarkable coincidence . . ." that 780 days is both the average length of the Martian synodic cycle and three times the length of a tzolkin. It may be a "coincidence" in the sense of a chance correspondence without mean- ing for the function of the table, but it seems to us far more likely that it is a "coincidence" in the sense of a deliberate commensuration between two cycles of consequence to the Precolumbian Maya. The importance of commensuration between and among cycles is an increasingly well-documented characteristic of codical instru- ments. As has been long understood, the Venus table of the Dresden Codex commensurates a planetary synodic period of 584 days with both the Maya vague year (haab) of 365 days and the tzolkin (Forstemann 1901:106). The fact that the total length of the table, 37,960 days, is 146 tzolkins, 104 haabs, and 65 Venus cycles is not a chance correspondence. Recently, Aveni (1992) has shown how this same Venus table can com- mensurate the Venus synodic cycle with a lunar eclipse cycle not automatically or coinciden- tally, but rather because of the intervals chosen for the table's structure. Another long understood commensuration is that between the eclipse half- year and the tzolkin within the structure of Dresden's eclipse table (H. Bricker and V. Bricker 1983; Teeple 1931). More recently, we have shown how the seasonal table on pages 61-69 of the Dresden Codex commensurates an eclipse cycle, stations of the haab, stations of the tropical year, and, of course, the tzolkin (V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1988). One more example can be found on pages 23 and 24 of the Paris Codex, where the succession of constellations near the ecliptic the celestial markers of the sidereal year are com- mensurated with the tzolkin (H. Bricker and V. Bricker 1992; Love 1994:89-102). Again in this case, the fact that the total length of the table is a multiple of the tzolkin (5 x 364 = 1820 = 7 x 260) is not a chance correspondence. The lesson learned from the research referred to in the preceding paragraph, some of it quite recent, is that commensuration was a technique or strategy of very great importance to the construc- tors of the codices. The cycles commensurated included, among others, astronomical cycles. Under these circumstances, it would be quite inappropriate to suggest that "claims of astro- nomical content" require, because they are regarded as less probable or more complex, some higher standard of scrutiny than claims based solely on iconography and mythological extrapo- lation. Occam's razor is, as Love (1995:359) sug- gests, a fine tool to apply to the study of the Maya codices, but it is by now quite clear that astron- omy, particularly with regard to the documented practice of commensuration, is a necessary ele- ment of such scholarship. Are pages 43b to 45b of the Dresden Codex concerned with, among other things, the synodic cycle of Mars? The answer is that they very prob- ably are. The designation of these pages as the Mars table remains the most appropriate practice for those who wish to understand the system of knowledge of the ancient Maya. Acknowledgments.

Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Notes 1. The same generally right-to-left reading order for a "table of multiples" is characteristic of other instruments in the Dresden Codex that deal with astronomical cycles. The smallest multiple in the series is found in the rightmost col- umn of multiples in the eclipse table (H. Bricker and V. Bricker 1983:3, Table 1), the Venus table (Lounsbury 1983:3, Table 2), and the seasonal table (V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1988:S2, Figure 1). 2. Because of the eccentricity of the Martian orbit, the brightness of the planet is not the same at each opposition. When Mars at opposition is closest to Earth (ca. 56,00(),000 km), it is only about 58 percent of the distance between the planets (ca. 97,000,000 km) that occurs during the most sep- arated oppositions (Menzel 1964:294). The brightest Martian oppositions occur, obviously, when the reflected light of the Sun has the least distance to travel from Mars to Earth. 3. The relevance of 780 days to the Martian synodic period was mentioned in passing by Forstemann (1901:91), but he did not pursue this observation. 4. In addition, one of the reviewers of this present article pointed out an arithmetical error we had made in calculating the day-count total of the fourth multiple, on page 44b of the codex. The correct total appears here in our Figure 1. 5. Tables are introduced by long-count dates in pictun, ser- pent, or ring-number notation; such Maya dates can be cor- related with dates in the Western calendar. Almanacs are introduced by tzolkin dates only; without further informa- tion, such dates can be assigned to a position in a cycle of no more than 260 days. 6. We refer here to what Love (1995:356, Figure 6) desig- nates as registers 2a and 2b of page 2. As indicated explicitly by the red frame line just below the center of the page, there are only two formal divisions of the page, not three. We fol- low the traditional terminological convention (e.g., Forstemann 1902:17-18) that assigns both rows of hanging beasts to M.2a. 7. The Martian retrograde loop in A.D. 818 was near the bright extreme of the range of variation in apparent magni- tude. At first stationary, Mars was about 28 times brighter than it had been about nine months earlier at heliacal rise; by the time of opposition, it was about 69 times brighter than at heliacal rise (Hinckley 1989). 8. The beast in the Madrid Codex is shown standing flat- footed (albeit upside-down) on the sky band rather than issu- ing or extruding from it, and it holds in its humanlike hands, not cloven hooves, either an axe or a torch. Furthermore, the Madrid beast is shown in alternating pictures (numbers one, three, five, and seven of the eight) against a background of torrential rain. The presence here of rain is taken by Love (1995:357) as support for the Lightning Beast identification first advanced by Seler, but we do not find this argument compelling. Four of the Madrid beasts, with both torch and axe, are not associated with rain, nor are any of the four beasts on D.44b-45b. The depiction of rain in the codices may sometimes be a seasonal indicator referring to the date of the picture rather than to its protagonist. In this connec- tion, it may be relevant that the Martian retrograde period of A.D. 818, extending from mid-May to late July, fell wholly or predominantly (depending on what part of the Maya area is chosen) in the rainy season. Again, however, the lack of rain in the Dresden table makes this explanation an uncom- pelling one. Chac, whose association with rain is undisputed but who plays other quite different roles as well, is some- times shown in the Dresden Codex against a background of rain, but usually he is not. Simplistic explanations about the iconographic associations of rain should probably be avoided. 9. A similar idea was very tentatively explored by Willson (1924:24), who suggested that the very last 3 Lamat before 4 Ahau 8 Cumku, the one 260 days after the mythological base date of the table, might have been a date on which "Mars was supposed to have the same 'aspect' as [on the historical date] at the beginning of the ephemeris." The suggestion is not accurate (the 3 Lamat mentioned by Willson fell about one month after the retrograde period), but Willson was unable to test his hypothesis meaningfully because he was using a cor- relation between the Maya and Western calendars that we now know to have been about 398 years in error.</page></plain_text>
