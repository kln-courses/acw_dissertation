<plain_text><page sequence="1">LACAN'S ANTIGONE: THE SUBLIME OBJECT AND THE ETHICS OF INTERPRETATION Paul Allen Miller In 1959, Jacques lacan presented Sophocles' Antigone as a model of pure desire for his seminar on The Ethics of Psychoanalysis (1986: 328-329): Antigone presents herself as a?xovouo?, the pure and simple relationship of a human being to that which it miraculously finds itself carrying, that is the rupture of signification, that which grants a person the insuperable power of being?in spite of and against everything? what he [sic] is ... Antigone all but fulfills what can be called pure desire, the pure and simple desire of death as such [i.e., ofthat which is beyond the pleasure principle]. She incarnates this desire. Lacan notes that Antigone, in her decision to defy Creon, consciously seeks death. She makes no effort to defend Polynices' actions (Lacan 1986:290,323-325). Her choice takes her beyond the realm of rational discourse and the collective norms of human satisfaction it implies (Lacan 1986: 78, 281; Zizek 1991: 25). Hers is ? position that transcends the comfortable binary oppositions that structure our daily ethical and social lives. Because her choice of death cannot be understood according to strictly rational norms, she cannot be read as representing some simple antithesis of freedom to tyranny, or the individual to the state (Lacan 1986: 281; Zizek 1992: 77-78). In fact, as she acknowledges, she had chosen death before Creon s decree against the burial of Polynices, and she defines herself to Ismene as one already belonging to the realm of the dead (lines 559-560; Lacan 1986: 315, 326). Creon is not a tyrant who forces Antigone to make an impossible choice between life and freedom; rather, he embodies the civic norms that her pursuit of a desire beyond the bounds of those desires articulated within the realm of common life both requires as a defining foil, and transcends. Her choice thus represents a pure ethical act shaped neither by a self-interested selection among communally recognized goods nor the self-loathing of conforming to a code that is recognized and despised (Zizek 1992: 77). Such an ethical choice, as Lacan acknowledges, is Kantian in its devotion to a pure concept of duty, but psychoanalytic in its predication on a highly individualized desire whose content cannot be generalized into a universal ethical maxim (Lacan 1986: 68, 365-366). Antigone's choice, her desire, is pure precisely to the degree that it rejects the claims of the Other to dictate its objects or form. For Lacan, it is the beauty of Antigone's choice of a Good beyond all recognized goods, beyond the pleasure principle, that gives her character its monumental status and makes her a model for an ethics of creation as opposed to conformity. It is for this reason that he cites Antigone's self-comparison to the ever-weeping, petrified Niobe?another princess enclosed alive in stone?as the central axis 1 PHOENIX, VOL. 61 (2007) 1-2.</page><page sequence="2">2 PHOENIX around which the play turns (lines 823-833). In this one image we see brought together the themes of beauty, monumentality, and death-in-life in a singular apotheosis of tragic transgression (Lacan 1986: 311, 315, 327). Beauty for Lacan represents the perfect moment between life and death, a moment both articulated by and beyond time and desire, a moment whose true achievement can only be imagined as the incarnation of a pure desire beyond any recognizable object. In its beauty, Sophocles' Antigone presents what Lacan defines as a "Sublime Object." Our ethical obligation as readers and analysts is to be true to this object to the precise degree that it transcends all normative categories. As Antigone does not cede on her desire, neither can we assimilate her tragedy to a pre-existing set of critical categories, even psychoanalytic ones. This is an obligation to the text, but it is simultaneously an obligation to our own desire as readers, critics, and subjects: for the encounter with the sublime object is one that must shake us to our very core if it is not to be a factitious or mechanical exercise in the application of reassuring truisms. To meet our obligation to the sublime text we must go beyond the dictates of the pleasure and reality principles, beyond good and evil to encounter pure desire: the moment in which the canons of meaning shudder before their own beyond. In many ways, this ethical obligation to beauty is met not by subjecting the text to a pre-existing theoretical model, but by the practice of old-fashioned philology. That is to say by closely attending to the play of meaning in the text and the ways in which it transcends our normative canons of the good, the true, and the beautiful; that is to say our day to day unreflective commerce with our larger Symbolic communities as defined by our profession, our ideological commitments, and our personal histories. The problem, of course, is that good, old-fashioned philology has almost never existed and what has passed for attention to the text has too often been an exercise in domesticating it to norms of intelligibility, canons of taste, and concepts of historical plausibility alien to the brute facticity of the text itself. We have submitted to Cr?ons laws rather than pursued the sublime object in all its strangeness. We have ceded on our and the text's desire in the name of utility, in the name of conformity to a reality principle that would predetermine the limits of our experience and its signification. To demonstrate how this ethical (and hence philological) obligation to the text, and its own aesthetic transcendence of the already given, could be pursued in relation to Lacan's own proof text, I propose to pursue a close reading of the Antigone's opening lines, taking as little for granted as possible while allowing the unfolding of the alien, conflicting, and at times repetitive forms of meaning that inhabit these lines to proceed with a minimum of interference. Antigone's first sentence is addressed to her sister Ismene before dawn outside the royal palace. As is typical of Thebes on the Athenian stage, already we are in a space that is explicitly beyond the norm. Athenian women of good families were not to be found running about in the street in the middle of the night (Wohl forthcoming: 2). We begin thus in a place outside the law to announce an edict of the</page><page sequence="3">THE SUBLIME OBJECT 3 new tyrannos, Creon, and to seek the support of a woman and a sibling in its transgression (1-6): *Q Koiv?v a?ra?E?,&lt;|&gt;ov 'Ia|xrjvr|?

Oh common wombmate, dear head of Ismene, Do you know what if any of the evils from Oedipus Zeus has yet to accomplish for the two of us still living? For there is nothing painful nor without ate Nor shame nor dishonor such as I have not seen in your evils and mine. The first two words after the initial vocative interjection are all but impossible to translate in anything approaching their original concision. They form a tautology whose harshness most translations smooth over (Watling 1947:126; Grene 1992: 161; Woodruff 2001: 1). Jebb's "my sister, my own sister" in no way does justice to the strange conjunction of these two words, reducing them to the recognizable sentiments of the nineteenth-century drawing room (1900: 9, ad loc). Rather than seeking to find a solution to this problem, let us linger over these words, resisting the urge for an overhasty naturalization while paying close attention to their resonance with the whole of Sophocles' closely wrought text. Koiv?v normally means something "held in common, shared." What is the shared thing, the thing held in common addressed here? On first hearing, it would appear to be the a?xa?eA^ov, a kinship term, which here appears in its lengthened form rather than the more normal ??etat&gt;o?. While conventionally translated "brother" or "sister," as Benveniste has pointed out (1966: 1.220-221), Greek uses a periphrasis for male and female siblings, unparalleled in other Indo European languages. a?xa?e^ov literally refers to one of two or more people or things that have shared the same womb or ?e?x^o?. The term thus names one of the play's central themes. Hence, Antigone will later refer to herself as one who does reverence to those who have shared the same entrails (?uoa7iA,ayxvoi)? as?eiv, 511). The less common lengthened form, am?-deXfyov, underlines the literal content of the word and prevents its rapid assimilation to a purely conventional kinship term. It is an image of one flesh, inseparable in the womb and beyond (Segal 1990: 180). Why then is koiv?v even necessary? Does it not merely repeat the idea inherent in aux?? "Oh common same-wombed one," these 1 See Gross's gloss " '(nothing) not without destruction'; since the accumulation of negatives gives the reverse of what Antigone means, K[amerbeek] reads o??(?) instead of the second ouT(e), '(nothing) painful and (nothing) which is lacking destruction' but the sense is clear in any case" (1988: 1, adloc).. For a survey of the textual difficulties, see Jebb 1900: 243-246.</page><page sequence="4">4 PHOENIX opening syllables seem to cry. What same-wombed one is not common, is strange, is unheimlich, we might well ask? Moreover, the neuter, as Griffith notes, "may suggest also their 'common brother'": Eteocles, Polynices, or Oedipus himself (1999:120, ad he.; see also Loraux 1987: 173; Butler 2000: 18). Indeed, it is same-wombedness that is at the heart of the Oedipal family romance. The self-enclosed world of the tauto-logy is precisely what opposes Antigone's obligations to family and professed love of death to the ordered realm of civic law and virtue that Creon proposes to inaugurate with his edict forbidding the burial of the rebel Polynices (Segal 1990: 179-181; Benardete 1999: 9, 97 98). Similarly, it is Oedipus' own discovery of an excessive sameness, of a strange commonality at the heart of his being, that will cast him beyond the bounds of civic life in the Antigone s belated prequel (Butler 2000: 61). In fact, words that begin with the auto- prefix have a peculiar prominence throughout the play (Benardete 1999: 2; Wohl forthcoming: 18). Not only does a?xa?s?^o? occur twice more (503 and 696) where it refers unambiguously to Polynices, but also, and perhaps most famously, Antigone herself is later referred to as auxovouoc (821), a reference to her being a law unto herself, a self-enclosed, self-legislating unity, who rejects the otherness of the law of the polis, of the Symbolic community in which intersubjective norms of human conduct are imposed and negotiated (Loraux 1987:165-167; Tyrrell and Bennett 1998:104; Lacan 1986: 328-329). But wait! Surely, I have committed the worst sort of howler. Only someone possessed of the most elementary Greek would not recognize that am?be'kfyov is not a substantive but an adjective modifying the neuter Kapa. It turns out that I have been creating difficulties where none exist?all in the name of an extraneous theoretical agenda. Yet before we deliver ourselves over to premature self-flagellation, perhaps it would be best to ask whether the words yield themselves up to common sense quite as quickly as my interlocutor might claim. Perhaps, just perhaps, the original construction is not resolved quite so easily as it appears. First, the word am?dekfyo? is always a substantive elsewhere in the play.2 Second, while it would be incorrect to say that koivo? can never mean "related by consanguinity" as Kamerbeek claims (1978: 37, ad loc), it is far from the most common meaning, and it is never used of things rather than persons, nor is it ever once used in Kamerbeek's sense elsewhere in Sophocles, even when referring to Antigone and her siblings. Thus, if we take am?SzXfyov as an adjective, and translate it literally, the result is something like that recommended by Gross in his commentary (1988: 1, ad loc), "shared ... real-sister head of Ismene." The image is grotesque. Even if with Gross we insert a parenthetical "in parents" after "shared," the result is only slightly less strange than imagining Antigone and Ismene as a two-bodied monster. Kapa, it will be quickly added, is synecdoche for the person of Ismene, like Latin caput, and hence a term of A search of the Perseus database reveals only five instances of the word altogether, three in this play.</page><page sequence="5">THE SUBLIME OBJECT 5 endearment, not a reference to an actual head. Yet the translation, "shared" or "common same-wombed person of Ismene," is every bit as much an offense to our commonsense notions of independent personhood and individuality as that of a "shared (in parents) head," and, inasmuch as the emphasis is on their being one flesh, it is hard to keep the image of the "head" as head out of one's mind. Indeed, the more one struggles to construe the grammar of this line, the more it seems to cry out for a comma after auxa?e?x|)ov, so that Kctpa stands as an appositive, rather than the substantive modified by the adjective, "Oh shared same-wombed one, head/person of Ismene." Nonetheless, before we adopt the truly old-fashioned philological expedient of an emendation, even one as unobtrusive as an extra comma, should we not ask ourselves if the crux we have ferreted out in this first line is not reflective of a deeper structure, one that stretches not only throughout this opening passage but also through the play as a whole? For the decision about whether to punctuate is always the decision to punctuate, the decision to parse the text in a certain manner, to divide it up into units of sense, even when it clearly resists just this parsing in the name of an uncanny refusal to conform to the canons of sense.3 In this case, the question of whether or not to insert a comma is in fact nothing less than the question of how to articulate the relation of shared flesh to the discrete personhood of the two sisters and by extension to their two brothers, and to Oedipus, their father/brother. In this question, we find the entire dialectic that characterizes Ismene's relation to Antigone. The essence of that relation is embodied in the tension between the koiv?v a?xct?e^ov and the principle of individuation denoted by the proper name, Ismene, in line 1. That tension represents a conflict between an order of existence of finite, separate individuals, which is explicitly announced as masculine and civic in nature within the play and which Lacan labels the Symbolic, and an order of mutual reflection and fleshly interrelation, which the play casts as feminine and domestic and which Lacan labels the Imaginary. This tension characterizes Ismene's simultaneous attempt to adhere to the norms of civic conduct through assuming the position designated for her gender by the law and her refusal to abandon Antigone even in the face of the law's condemnation and seemingly certain death (Vernant and Vidal-Naquet 1981: 1-6, 16; Oudemans and Lardinois 1987: 88, 233; Tyrrell and Bennett 1998: 76-77). The structure of this double movement is very precisely embodied in the next two lines, even as it is simultaneously interrupted. These lines, it is generally agreed, directly address Ismene concerning what sort of evil, out of those stemming from their father, Zeus has not yet brought to pass for the two of them who are 3 See for example Heidegger's repunctuation of lines 360 and 370-371 in the "Ode to Man" so as to bring the oppositions between 7ravxo7i?poc and arcopo?, and uyiitoki? and arco^i?, into sharper relief than what is found in the text as traditionally printed (1996: 60). See Gross 1988: ad loc; Lloyd-Jones and Wilson 1990: 197-198; Griffith 1999: 85; and even Loraux 2002: 28-30, who, as her introduction makes plain (vii-xiv), owes a clear debt to Lacan.</page><page sequence="6">6 PHOENIX still living.4 Nonetheless, the text, in fact, does not yield itself up to sense in quite so simple a manner. For one thing, there is a textual crux here that has vexed critics for the last three centuries. The basic problem is that these lines possess a kind of grammatical stutter, a moment in which the mechanics of language, the Real that subtends the possibility of signification, erupts into the text and denies it the ability to produce a singular, accountable meaning in conformity with the rules of a rational grammar. What we have printed above is in fact a conservative reading and follows the vulgate precisely as well as the reading of the scholia and the most recent printings of the text. A literal translation, however, verges on the illiterate if not inelegant, inasmuch as it features a double question and seems to change construction in mid-sentence (O'Brien 1978: 8), "Do you know what Zeus of the evils of Oedipus of whatever sort has not yet accomplished for the two of us who are still living?" While the textual tradition and the scholia are unanimous in their attestation of the text, the problem of having ? xi introduce or be resumed by ?rcoiov has been recognized at least since Hermann, who suggested the emendation oxi. This renders the following sense, "do you know that Zeus brings to pass the evils of Oedipus?what sort does he not??with us still living." Erfurdt follows him, arguing that the vulgate is unintelligible and that "nothing is more certain than this emendation" (1802: 245).6 Hermann's reading has the advantage of disposing of the grammatical problem as well as relieving the harshness of the hyperbaton of having Zeus so far away from the construction he governs. Yet the ?rcoiov oi&gt;%i ceases on this reading to be a meaningful part of the sentence and becomes a kind of rhetorical fragment floating in its middle. ?tcoiov here must also stand for the more properly interrogative ttoiov. This is a problem Lloyd-Jones and Wilson (1990) will later solve by inserting a dash after kolkc?v and emending ottoiov to a, 710?OV, while nonetheless retaining ? xi: "do you know what of the evils of Oedipus, Zeus?ah, what sort does he not bring to pass for us two still living?" Jebb, however, argued against Hermann contending both that the sentence is too short to bear such a construction (without ever saying how long it should be) and that the strangeness of the vulgate can be relieved by an appeal to an assumed informality of Attic speech, for which he offers neither attestation nor clear argumentation. "The ultimate question is,?how much irregularity would the spoken language of the day have tolerated in such a sentence?" (Jebb 1900: 241). He assumes that ? xi is the subject of an unstated ?axi and translates 4 Like Kamerbeek (1978: 38, ad loc), I would contend that exi may be taken with either Cc?aaiv or xet?. Indeed, I would argue for an ex commune, construction. 5It is also that printed by Loraux (2002), Griffith (1999), and Rose (1988). 6 It was Erfurdt's edition that was the basis for Hermann's (1825). How Erfurdt first became aware of Hermann's emendation is not clear from the former's note. Sch?fer in a note to his collation of the editions of Brunck and Erfurdt suggests that if ? xi is genuine it stands for oxtoov or ?xi?r|7toxe (1824: 219, ad loc). What is interesting is the assumption that ? xi cannot be ? ti. The text seems constantly to escape itself.</page><page sequence="7">THE SUBLIME OBJECT 7 "knowest thou what ill there is, of all bequeathed by Oedipus that Zeus fulfills not for us twain while we live." He thus ignores the force of cmo?ov on the strength of a presumed colloquial norm (Jebb 1900: 9). Kamerbeek likewise accepts the text as transmitted but wishes to read ? xt and ?rco?ov ob%? as "contrasted objects of xeA,ci, ranged asyndetically," yielding a literal reading along the lines of "do you know what of the evils of Oedipus Zeus / what sort not accomplishes for the two of us still living," which he argues, based on other "polar expressions ... can very well convey the idea of 'all the possible (evils)' " (1978: 36-37, ad loc). None of these various texts and translations changes the plot or even, neces sarily, our interpretation of it. As Griffith notes, "the sense is clear and emphatic ('every conceivable evil is descending on us'), and the syntactical informality is mitigated by word order" (1999: 120, ad loc). Nor is it clear that we need, or even should, choose between ? xi and oxi. They are, of course, phonetically and accentually identical. Moreover, if we recall that most ancient manuscripts were written without spaces between the words, they are even orthographically identical. The entire matter would thus literally hang on a breath, on whether an actor in performance would insert a hiatus between ? and xi or pronounce it as ?xi. The syntax and rhetorical accentuation of the line would then be reconfigured accordingly, but the irreducible plurality of the text,7 the way in which its linguistic structure resists reduction to a singular sense, would remain?a moment every bit as scandalous as Antigone and Ismene's common head. Still, line two seems to move firmly in the direction of the principium individuationis, with its verb in the second person and two proper nouns. There is a you who "knows." Zeu? is the active agent of the finite verb xeXe?, and Oi?ircou? is the origin, if not the owner, of the evils brought to pass. Yet, this opening out of the closed incestuous world of common flesh and shared being into the world of intersubjective recognition and responsibility, of articulation before the law, already contains the seeds of its own negation. Who is this Zeus? The anthropomorphic force behind the name, as Griffith notes, seems particularly attenuated in these lines (1999: 120, ad loc). Zevq is less a proper name, denoting a discrete individual with articulable motives and desires, than synecdoche for an impersonal force, even as the oft-noted hyperbaton, which shifts the name into a syntactically anomalous position (Kamerbeek 1978: 36, ad loc), foregrounds the very agency that seems to be lacking. Similarly, the phrase "the evils from Oedipus" at once names his acts (the evils he committed: parricide, incest, the curse laid upon Eteocles and Polynices), their consequences (the evils he suffered: exile, blindness, the mutual slaughter of his sons), and their origin in the curse of the Labdacids (Jebb 1900: 9, ad loc). In what sense, we must ask, are these evils Oedipus' and how are we to understand them in relation to the "we" who are "still living" and for whom they are "yet to be accomplished"? 7 On the textual tradition as a "singular plural" that inherendy defies reduction to a pristine unity, see Gurd 2005: 46-55.</page><page sequence="8">8 PHOENIX This last question gains particular poignancy when we reflect upon the force of the duals, vcpv and ?coacav, in line 3. These are the first of what Griffith notes to be "a dense cluster of duals" throughout the play used to describe "murderous brothers, disunited sisters, sister and dead brother, dying bride and groom" (1999: 121, ad loc.).s Extrapolating the conceptualization behind the duals to its logical conclusion, Antigone and Ismene are here conceived as a unit: not separate individuals, but one substance from a common womb, the womb that is the origin of Oedipus' evils (Wohl forthcoming: 15). It is Antigone's desire to assert and maintain these failed unities, to return to the oneness of the flesh and lie with her brother in the grave, that fuels the central conflict of the play embodied in the countervailing forces of a transgressive oneness and an ultimately sterile and self-destructive logic of radical separation. As Charles Segal sums up (1990:183): Even her dual form when speaking of herself and Ismene in the third line has its significance, for it repeatedly denotes the polluted fratricides ... and comes to mark a shift of allegiance on Antigone's part as she leaves the living kin for her bond to the dead. Creon's path is, of course, just the opposite: he insists on "difference" and carries it to its logical conclusion in the face of those bonds of sameness which the gods finally vindicate. Antigone is the auxoyvooxoc (875), the "self resolved," the a?xovouo?, who cannot admit the other except as the a?xct?e^ov, the same-wombed, that is as a member of a potential self-reflecting dual. The experiential reality of that dual, however, is characterized by the constant presence of axn defined paratactically in lines 4-5 as "pain," "shame," and "dishonor"?that is by the experience of a shared transgression of, and rejection by, the Symbolic law. The force of the dual is explicable but not translatable. It asserts as an unarguable grammatical fact the existence of an intermediate category between the absolute identity of the one and the fundamental difference of the many: the self-reflecting two. In the Labdacids' tale of internecine murder and incest, of the two as the transgressive one or the one as the murderous two, this archaic piece of Indo-European morphology looms large. Throughout the play, it is self-consciously manipulated to achieve maximum effect. Thus Ismene, who attempts to occupy the impossible middle position between Creon's difference and Antigone's sameness, replies to Antigone's first speech (11-14): euol ?lev o?oei? |uu0oc, 'Avxiy?vn, (Juta?v OU0' r|??? oik' ?Xyeiv?? ?Kex', s? ?xou ?uo?v ???ta|&gt;o?v eaxepTjGrpsv ?oo, ua?t Oavovxoiv rp?po: binXr\ %spi Not one story ofthose who are dear, Antigone, whether sweet or painful has come to me, outside of the fact that 8Steiners (1984: 113) assertion that the dual occurs only at the play's beginning and therefore we cannot be sure of its significance is incorrect. Compare Loraux 1987: 173-174 and Tyrrell and Bennett 1998: 44-45 and 78.</page><page sequence="9">THE SUBLIME OBJECT 9 we two were stripped of two brothers dying as a pair on one day from a double hand. The deliberate alternation between ones and twos is designed to draw attention to the dual as a fundamental textual signature of Oedipal incest and murderous strife, in contrast to both the normative individual of fifth-century Athens and the social collective of the orpoc, represented on stage by the chorus. The unambiguous connection of the grammatical dual to the incestuous story that lies at the heart of the Oedipus tale, to the axn of the Labdacids, is made explicit, however, in Ismene's next speech (49-57): oijioi- (|&gt;p?vr|aov, &amp; Kaaiyvr|xr|, 7taxf|p ?? vcpv ?%exQr\q 8uo"K?er|? x' ?rc(0?,exo, Ttpo? auxo(|&gt;c?pa)v ?|i.7rA,aKr|fiax?)v binX?q oyei? ?pa?a? a?xo? a?xoupycp %epi 87i8ixa ^TJxrip Kai yuvr|, 5i7iA,o?v e'rco?, TtXeKxa?aiv ?pxavaiai tao?axai ?iov xp?xov ?' ??e&gt;,&lt;|)?) 8?o uaav Ka6' f|(a?pav aoxoKxovoGvxe x?) xa&gt;,ai7CG)p(? ^?pov Koiv?v Kaxeipy?aavx' ?naXkr\koiv xepo?v.

Third, two brothers on one day The wretched pair by killing themselves Accomplish ? common fate with each others two hands. The duals at the end of the passage come thick and fast. But throughout these closely packed lines, tragic fate is embodied by one flesh (sister by birth, father, mother, brothers) whose division into self-reflexive twos {the two of us, two eyes, double name, two brothers, wretched pair, two hands) resists the separation of the Symbolic law, the intervention of the third as represented by Creon's notion of communally defined goods and rule-based ^iXia. These twos, these incestuous duals, in the end collapse into a self-reflecting identity (self-revealed, himself, self-working, themselves, common) that is ultimately indistinguishable from death itself (killing): uThird, two brothers on one day." This tension between Imaginary reflection and Symbolic law is also embodied precisely by Creon's and Antigone's competing notions of fyxkia as articulated in the play's opening lines (Griffith 1999: 123; Goldhill 1986: 88-103).

These are an inheritance of a complex of values that, as Benveniste has shown (1966: 1.335-353), are predicated on an originary notion of the &lt;|&gt;ita)? as being a person or thing intrinsically bound to the self?through ties of kinship, tribal and political loyalty, guest friendship, and/or companionship (Santas 1988: 8; Benardete 1999: 12-13). For this reason, the Homeric usage of fyiXoq, especially when applied to body parts, is thought to differ little from that of the possessive adjective. fyiXoq, then, is most directly contrasted with ?xOpo?, that which is "outside, other, inimical" (Nagy 1979: 242-244; Goldhill 1986: 80-83). Thus Antigone ends her first speech (line 10) by asking Ismene if she has heard what evils are now approaching their (|)iA,oi (i.e., Polynices) from their e%9poi (i.e., Creon). Konstan further observes that this use of fyiXo?, to signify that which is part of the "same," is the primary sense in Homer, where the word is used exclusively in the adjectival form. And while certain types of interpretation may have gone too far in reducing the affective dimension of such ties to the purely functional, nonetheless archaic fyiXoq cannot be translated "friend" without serious distortion. The same is true for the abstract noun ((n?ict as it is used both in archaic and classical texts where the term "friendship" would be inadequate to those aspects of it that apply to kinship, and other forms of meaning that imply a sense of one flesh whether in the literal or the metaphorical sense. In addition, however, Konstan argues that the classical period sees the emergence of fyiXoq as a noun explicitly used in contrast or coordination with kinship terms, meaning an "achieved relationship" of mutual loyalty and affection. This is &lt;J)i?,o? as "friend." Antigone defends the archaic view of (|)iAia as inextricably linked to an essential oneness, in which legal and Symbolic identity is secondary to the primal oneness of Being. For her the &lt;|)iA,oi are those who share the bonds of the flesh. She will lie fyiXr] with fyiXoc, in Polynices' grave, not because his cause was just, not because of the existence of an "achieved relationship" that they have constructed between them, but because he is who he is (Lacan 1986: 324-325; Guyomard 1992: 42, note 7). A husband, she says, or even a son, can be replaced but, with both parents in the grave, a brother is irreplaceable (lines 909-912).10 That tear in the oneness of the flesh cannot be mended. There is no possible exchange or substitution, no way to fill this gap within the domains sanctioned by the pleasure and the reality principles. "Doing this," she says, "it is a beautiful thing to die." For Creon, however, (JnAict is a fully legal and rule-bound relationship. Its purpose is to promote the civic good and it is firmly a part of the kingdom of biens On the textual controversies surrounding these lines since at least the time of Goethe, see Lacan 1986: 298; Tyrrell and Bennett 1999: 112-114; and Griffith 1999: 278, ad loc</page><page sequence="11">THE SUBLIME OBJECT 11 of which he is the foremost representative (Lacan 1986: 300-301; Oudemans and Lardinois 1987: 300-301). Dearness for Creon is a function of submission to the law. As he argues in a speech that would be later quoted with approval by Demosthenes (19.247), and which represents what many in Sophocles' audience would have considered accepted truth (182-190): Kod uei?ov' ?cm? ?tvxi xrj? auxo? rcaxpa? fyiXov voui?ei, xoGxov o??auou Aiyco. ?y? y?p, ?axco Ze?? ? 7t?v0' ?pcov ?ei, oux' ?v ai(07ir|aaiui xt|v axnv opa&gt;v axeixouaav ?axo?? ?vxi xrj? acoxnpia?, oux' ?v fyiXov Ttox' av?pa ?uauevrj y?ovoc, Oeiunv suauxcp, xo?xo yiyvaKjKcov ?xi fj?' ?axiv r\ aq&gt;?ouaa, kcu xauxn? em TtAiovxE? opurjc xo??

For I?let ever-vigilant Zeus know this?would neither be silent seeing disaster approaching the citizens, instead of safety, nor would I ever count as a friend a man bearing ill will to my land, knowing this, that when the city is safe we make friends for ourselves by sailing on a sound ship of state. Creon here represents a kind of civic-minded vision of &lt;|&gt;iXia that excludes all aspects of kinship, the flesh, and enjoyment (Griffith 1999:159, ad loc). He does not seek to traverse the veil of axr| but to avoid it (even as he ultimately falls prey to it). His position is at once that of the new constitutional order in democratic Athens (Tyrrell and Blake 1999: 46-47; Oudemans and Lardinois 1987: 161; Knox 1982: 35, 38-39) and a totalitarian insistence on the law as law, without any grounding in family, tradition, or the claims of the flesh (Steiner 1984: 37; Allen 2000: 91-92). In the end, Creon refuses to recognize the. world of his own flesh, the world of enjoyment that supports and grounds the law and his desire. And that refusal leads to the destruction of his family and himself (Benardete 1999: 74-75; Tyrrell and Bennett 1999: 90-91). By the same token, Antigone's refusal to recognize the claims of the law, her pure desire to transgress the barrier of axr|, leads her from the Symbolic death affirmed by the pleasure principle to the second death, which is its beyond. Her destruction is not the product of an error in judgment, auapxia, like that of Creon, but of a fundamental and uncompromising disposition toward Being. In her insistence on her desire to the point of death, a desire that transcends all rational calculations of Symbolically determined utility, a desire that points beyond the pleasure and reality principles, she embraces the familial axrj of the Labdacids. Like Niobe, she becomes both more and less than human, immortalized as a sublime figure of beauty in death, a figure of folly and awe. In the process, she becomes a profoundly ethical figure in her uncompromising singularity. At the</page><page sequence="12">12 PHOENIX same time, she points to the desire and obligation of the analyst to listen to the text, to be true to its indeterminacies and contradictions, its self-transcendence, its awesome foolishness. All Creon's rational calculations, while constituting the grid that makes this moment possible and necessary, can never fully account for it. They can only attempt to contain it within the constraints of a self-satisfied instrumental reason that when confronted with Tiresias' horrible truth sees only baseness, bribery, and bad faith. Creon remains blind until the awful moment when he is brought up short before the image of his son's dying body clasping the beautiful corpse of Antigone. It is here, to this unthinkable abyss, that a true ethics of psychoanalysis leads. The talking cure as conceived by Lacan takes the analysand not to the world of facile adaptation and normalization, but makes possible the direct confrontation with the destitution of desire and the consequent embrace of Being (Lacan 1986: 347): The question of the Sovereign Good has always been posed for man, but the analyst knows that this is a closed question. Not only does he not have what one demands of him, the Sovereign Good, but he knows there isn't any. Having led an analysis to its term is nothing other than to have encountered this limit where the entire problematic of desire is posed. With freedom from the Sovereign good, however, comes the possibility to realize one's desire in all its idiosyncrasies, to withdraw from an exclusively instrumentalized and utilitarian relation to the world, and to encounter a beauty that cannot be confined to immediate use. It is Antigone as sublime object who points the way to a pure desire that can transform us, like Niobe, into something fundamentally awe-full and new. One of the most disturbing things about Lacan's reading of Antigone is his appreciation of her absolute dedication to the obscene kernel of her enjoyment (jouissance). There is an asocial immediacy to absolute enjoyment, to pure desire, which while profoundly ethical?in the sense of representing an absolute dedication to the transformation of self, which the realization of a desire beyond the pleasure and reality principles requires?nonetheless also figures a rupture with the Symbolic order as we know it (Irigaray 1977: 95). It is an ethics that demands the transgression of the law as its universal maxim (Lacan 1966), that promises not the reign of the good, but a world of beautiful and yet monstrous enjoyment?the world of the death drive (Zizek 1992: 134).
