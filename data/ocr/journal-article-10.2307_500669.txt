<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PROBLEM OF ZOROASTER ARTHUR DARBY NOCK, Harvard University I. Herzfeld and the problem of Achaemenid religion.* ERNST HERZFELD was a great pioneer in Iranian archaeology, devoted to Persia, past and present, and determined to wrest the truth from its literature as from its soil. With all its learning, Zoroaster and His World is an in- tensely personal work, and the running fire of polemic against Nyberg has the passionate man- ner of an earlier age.' To be sure, it is polemic about serious issues and not about "the shadow of an ass." In it as in the whole discussion there is much valuable detail; e.g. pp. 542 ff. on haoma and viticulture, pp. 562 ff. on irrigation canals, p. 621 on canopies, pp. 660 ff. on Scylax, pp. 679 f. on orientation, pp. 816 f. on sculpture, pp. 821 ff. on heroes fighting animals (which may bear on the evidence adduced by Rostovtzeff in Artibus Asiae, iv (1930/2), pp. 103 f.; cf. Seminarium Kondakovianum, vi, pp. 161 ff. and E. H. Minns, Art of the Northern Nomads (Proc. Brit. Acad., xxviii), pp. 19 f.; also Herzfeld p. 831.) The reminder on p. 645 'The initial error is that everything Awestic must be theology' is not superfluous; the Avestic tradition is encyclo- paedic in content, religious in spirit and setting. Again, the analogies from modern Persia are interesting, though the reader must at all times remember that the advent of Islam and new ele- ments in the population have made a difference.2 Yet as a whole the book is bewildering and most disappointing. Two substantial volumes, with indeed a brief table of contents but without an index or glossary or list of books frequently quoted, call for the heroic digestion of chalken- teroi. All who have occasion to use them will be in the debt of Richard N. Frye for his clear summary as well as for his penetrating and inde- pendent criticisms in Harv. J. Asiatic Stud., x (1947), pp. 440 ff. Since ancient Persia presents what are perhaps the most important and the most puzzling prob- lems in the religious history of the Near East, and since its relations to Judaism, classical cul- ture, Christianity, and Islam affect the studies of all of us, a non-Iranist may be permitted to make a few tentative and restricted observations. If they provoke Iranists to give us enlightenment on some of the difficulties, they will have served a purpose. * Zoroaster and his World, by E. Herzfeld. 2 vols., pp. 851. Princeton University Press, 1947. Price $25.00 1 Dr. Richard N. Frye has allowed me to draw freely on his great knowledge of things Iranian. I wish to offer my warmest thanks to him and to Pro- fessors Campbell Bonner and W. S. Ferguson for their friendly aid. I trust that the Iranist will pardon the uninformed choice of transcriptions and the ab- sence of diacritical signs. 2 Thus on p. 750, apropos of Vendidad, 7.58 with its account of the worst people assembling after sunset around places of disposal of the dead, Herzfeld speaks of a modern Persian custom of taking some rakki or opium to a cemetery on summer evenings. But A. Christensen, Danske Vid. Selskab, Medd. xxvii, i (1941), p. 30 is certainly right in interpreting the pas- sage as referring to daeva worshippers; cf. A. Waag, Nirangistan, (Iran. Forsch. ii, ed. Schaeder), p. 66 on nightly meetings associated with daevas. In general, Herzfeld's main theses are more easily to be learned from his Archaeological History of Iran, pp. 39 f.</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND DISCUSSIONS 273 On several major issues Herzfeld agrees with views which seem to be gaining a large measure of acceptance. First the Yasts, though they show abundant reworking by men to whom the name and poems of Zoroaster were canonical, contain material produced in a different milieu, in which there were no Zoroastrian influences. Second, Zoroaster did not invent Ahura Mazda or the connotations of ahura or rta-asa or chsathra.3 Third, a rudimentary dualism existed independently of Zoroaster.4 Fourth, Zoroaster probably opposed a contemporary worship of Mithra; Herzfeld allows that this cult found room for ethical elements which were to Zoro- aster's purpose (cf. indeed J. H. Moulton, Early Zoroastrianism p. 67.). On the other hand, Herzfeld runs sharply against the main trend of opinion when he main- tains that the prophet belonged to western Iran rather than to eastern Iran and when he reverts to the view that Zoroaster's royal patron Vis- taspa was none other than the father of Darius and that Hutosa is the familiar Atossa. 'Reverts' is too weak a word; from phrases here and there Herzfeld constructs a skeleton biography of the prophet in his time. (This is for Herzfeld also the time of the original form of the book of Daniel, the familiar scene in Dan. 7.13 ff. representing the investiture of an heir to the throne-a sup- position which leaves one wondering whether God was supposed to retire and what the detail means and how the errors of fact listed by R. H. Pfeiffer, Introduction to the Old Testament, p. 757 came to be made.) II. Evidence of Herodotus, royal inscriptions, Vendidad What now of the evidence of Herodotus? His knowledge had limitations and he did not tell all that he knew (so in i, 95 he refers to three other versions of the tale of Cyrus). Admittedly we do not from his pages learn anything of the special devotion of the Achaemenids to Ahura Mazda- or as Herodotus would have called him, Zeus. Nevertheless the dramatic rise of this new dynasty was a fact of very general interest and the existence of a prophet so near to the throne would have been much more manifest than the king's personal belief. Herodotus had his Persian friends and knew a fair amount of Persian tradi- tion; moreover, Democedes had been an intimate of Darius (as Demaratus was of Xerxes), and the Persian court was something about which there was a good deal of knowledge. A Zoroaster such as Herzfeld postulates could hardly have escaped the attention of Herodotus and, if known, would certainly have figured in his story. After all, Herodotus was deeply interested in varieties of religious custom and in prophets and the like (e.g. Aristeas, Onomacritus, and the supposedly human Zalmoxis), as in all unusual types. He noted the differences and the recep- tivity of Persian society, and he recorded and sought to explain Persian antipathy to images and temples and altars. His silence is a major obstacle in the way of the acceptance of Herz- feld's identifications and chronology; a smaller but still considerable one is the failure of the Avesta to speak of the great Achaemenids.5 On Herzfeld's theory, should not the memory of Darius have been treasured here as was that of Asoka in Buddhist tradition? Most students would disagree with Herzfeld when he regards Darius as a monotheist; the Behistun inscription and its Babylonian copy6 disprove that. But should Darius or Xerxes or both be called Zoroastrian? For both kings Ahura Mazda was the supreme god of justice and of cosmic as well as of national order, while other deities were subsidiary and were not mentioned by name. This belief, held 3 For the Zoroastrian idea of judgment, J. H. Moul- ton (Early Zoroastrianism, pp. 144, 170) notes the popular practice of balancing a man's good and bad deeds (Hdt. i, 137 -I say 'practice' but it sounds ideal rather than actual); cf. E. Meyer, Ursprung, ii, 67, n. 5 (the Gadatas letter) and Revelation ii-iii for the balancing of good and evil. Cf. also Herzfeld, pp. 305 ff. on royal records. A. v. Gall, Basileia tou theou, p. 92, thinks that Zoro- aster used and transformed a popular idea of the end of the world. I Cf. J. H. Moulton in Hastings, Enc. Rel. Eth. viii, p. 244 for the view that dualism is essentially Magian (cf. Early Zoroastrianism, pp. 213 f.); also Lehmann in Bertholet-Lehmann, Lehrb. d. Religionsgesch., ed. 4, ii, p. 217 for the natural basis of Iranian dualism. 6 Cf. H. S. Nyberg, J. Asiat., ccxix (1931), pp. 23 f. 6 F. H. Weissbach, Veroff.

This type of belief is attested by what Herodotus tells us of the peculiar abomination of lying which Persians professed and by the term artiaioi, "just men"; further, the parallel of India shows how abstractions could attain prominence. Again, if we accept the authenticity of Ariaramna's tablet, as G. G. Cameron (History of Early Iran, p. 213) and others have done, the great-grandfather of Darius had claimed that the great god Ahura Mazda had given him the land Parsa. In other words, there would be evidence for an hereditary devotion and not a novel con- viction. I do not press this point: H. H. Schaeder, SBA, 1931, pp. 635 ff. argued that the tablet is a Bildbeischrift, made in the fourth century B.C. (with no intent to deceive). R. G. Kent, JAOS, lxvi (1946), pp. 206 ff. has given powerful support to this view and has maintained that Ariaramna's tablet, and that of Arsames9 now published in ILN, July 17, 1948, pp. 58 f., belong to a series of monuments set up by Artaxerxes II with the intention of glorifying his royal ancestors at the expense of the great Cyrus, whose namesake had proved so great a menace. If this be right, we may remark the absence of Anahita and Mithra (cf. p. 280 be- low) and the clear assertion of a dynastic view that Ahura Mazda had always been the pro- tector of the A chaemenids. To return to Darius, in spite of the great emphasis on Ahura Mazda in the Behistun text, the general style of that document is not as novel as is sometimes suggested.'0 In any event, the inscriptions are our only evidence for the religion of Darius. Herzfeld's argument from a supposed change by him of royal burial custom (p. 747), that "the dead... no longer need furnished chambers or any earthly possessions," is modern reasoning which cannot be ac- cepted without specific confirmation. Again, both Darius and Xerxes refer to rewards hereafter for virtue. This would fit but need not be thought to presuppose Zoroastrian teaching, for some notion of reward and punishment could have existed independently of that." Most emphatically we must not, with Herz- feld, pp. 166, 299, find any reference to the doc- trine of the resurrection in Herodotus, iii, 62, "If indeed the dead have risen, expect that Astyages the Mede will rise too; but if things are as afore- time, there is no risk of any trouble arising from him-(that is from Smerdis)." Herzfeld regards the name of Astyages as a mistake for Astvatrta, who plays a part as a savior in the later eschatol- ogy and "the Mede" as a faulty gloss of Herod- otus. Prexaspes is merely reassuring Cambyses that Smerdis is dead and that dead men do not push us from our stools. "If the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?" (ii Kings 7.2, cf. 19). We may, again, compare Bahman Yast ii 1 ff. (tr. E. W. West in Sacred Books of East, v, p. 195), where Zoroaster is repre- sented as asking to be made immortal and Ahura Mazda as replying that in that event Tur-i Bradarvash the Karap would become im- mortal and "the resurrection and future exist- ence are not possible." Resurrection is mentioned in Herodotus as an impossibility, just as in the Potter's Oracle.12 I Cf. E. Benveniste, Persian Religion, p. 36. 8 To use R. Pettazzoni's phrase (Actes Vye Congres Hist. Rel., Lund, p. 55); ecf. Nyberg, op. cit., pp. 10 ff. 9 For this reference and for other help I am much indebted to Professor R. G. Kent. 10 On linguistic grounds H. H. Schaeder in Die Weltreiche der Geschichte u. die Grossraumidee der Gegenwart (Breslau, 1942), p. 14 has suggested a Me- dian model for the language of Darius. Cameron, His- tory, p. 107, has a parallel for "what no king before." For an analogy in Egypt cf. P. Montet, La vie quotidi- enne en Egypte, p. 192; cf. Olmstead, Hist. Pers. Emp., pp. 122 ff., on Hammurabi's language. " W. Hinz, ZDMG, xcvi (1942), p. 334; W. Eilers, JNES, vii, 1948, pp. 106 f.; H. S. Nyberg-H. H. Schaeder, Religionen d. alten Iran, p. 365. Cf.

For Xerxes, as for Darius, the right order of the state and the right worship were intimately linked; rebels are precisely those who would worship daevas and vice versa. (So Darius said that certain rebellious peoples did not worship Ahura Mazda; cf. Hinz, op. cit., pp. 334 f. and Eilers, op. cit., p. 106). Zoroaster would have sympathized with this monarchical theory and conviction; his desire was to prepare an accept- able people, and he fulminated against a wrong type of life as well as against a wrong type of worship. Now at an earlier time ah(s)ura and d(a)eva are thought to have denoted differing-but not morally antithetic - categories of supernatural beings, and it is possible that independently of Zoroaster daeva acquired an uncomplimentary sense in Iran. Nevertheless, this is hypothetical and as far as the language of Xerxes is concerned, we cannot lightly deny the possibility, perhaps even the probability that it reflects Zoroaster's use of daeva. (Cf. the divergent views of A. Christensen, Danske Vid. Selskab Medd., xxvii, i, (1941) pp. 39 ff., Schaeder, ZDMG, xcv (1941), pp. 448 ff., and J. C. Tavadia, OLZ, xlvii (1944), col. 136 ff.) Magi influenced by this use may be responsible for the choice of words. The existence of such Magi would receive strong support if further study endorses Christensen's view that behind the present text of Vendidad i lies an early metrical form, listing the blessings and banes of various regions, the banes being "des noms de collectivites ethniques ou de cultes etrangers" (Danske Vid. Selskab, Medd., xxix, iv, 1943, p. 65). Christensen rightly emphasized the chrono- logical implications of this inference. To guess how long a particular piece of evolution in religion will have taken is hazardous-above all in a restricted area with free interplay of persons and ideas; early Christianity shows that. Yet Iran was a large area, and communications be- tween the Eastern and Western parts were not easy. If Zoroaster taught in the Eastern part, the assimilation of some of his phrases and ideas by western Magianism would probably have re- quired an appreciable period of time. This assimilation had apparently taken place by the time of Xerxes, and personally I should hardly place Zoroaster's floruit later than the middle of the seventh century. Arthur Christensen, with whose death so much wisdom went from the earth, ultimately voted for an even earlier date. So did R. G. Kent in Oriental Studies in honour of Dasturfi Saheb Cursetji Erachji Pavry, pp. 200 ff. III. Evidence of month names and Xanthus There is a supporting argument from the calendar. I do not use the names of days in the so-called Zoroastrian calendar, which Nyberg dates at latest 485 B.C., in view of St. Wikander's strong argument that they are a later addition (Feuerpriester, Acta reg. soc. human. litt. Lun- denis, xl, 1946, pp. 229 if., cf. earlier Christensen, Iran, p. 295, note 5). Nor can I discuss Hilde- gard Lewy's subtle argument (Orientalia, x, 1941, pp. 1 ff.) that these day names and the celebrations of festivals reflect a rivalry between Mazdaean cult and Mithra cult-a rivalry old but on her view able to come to life again-for it turns on evidence which I am wholly inca- pable of weighing. But the Cappadocian month names, recently discussed by K. Hanell, Bull. Soc. Roy. Lettres de Lund, 1931/2, pp. 33 ff., are in themselves decisive.'3 Their closeness to those of the Avesta, and the absence of any month named for Ma, indicate a Persian origin; they must antedate the Roman occupation and in all probability they antedate the end of Achaemenid rule. The presence among them of month-names derived from Haurvatat, Ameretat, and Vohumano points clearly to Zoroaster; they are his words, detached from the context of his thought and involving no awareness of it; frag- ments of a fine diamond, in a baroque setting. Cappadocia had this calendar just as Zela in Pontus had a temple of Anaitis with Omanos and Anadates as associates. So Cappadocia had had died before had been deprived of a great joy in that they had not seen Alexander sitting on the throne of Darius." 13 Cf. J. Marquart, Philol. Supp., x, pp. 200 ff.; L. H. Gray in Enc. Rel. Eth., iii, pp. 128 if.; Journal K. R. Cama Or.

Anadates is usually regarded as a slight corruption of a form of Ameretat and Omanos as being Vohumano; E. Benveniste (Persian Religion, pp. 63 ff.) felt the difficulty of this and suspected a textual corruption of Orados, i.e., Haurvatat, in the name Omanos. This is rather unlikely in view of the fact that we should have to suppose that twice in Strabo, p. 733, and once in Strabo, p. 512, the name of one Persian deity was cor- rupted into what looks like the name of another. These Zoroastrian abstractions were associated with human interests, Vohumano with cattle, Haurvatat with water, Ameretat with vegeta- tion, and it may well be that they are trans- formations of popular numina;14 but their com- bination indicates that in some way they are here because of Zoroaster, even as their com- bination with Anaitis and their images show the institutional metamorphosis in which alone Zoro- aster's ideas were to have substantial survival. There is one other indication of the prophet's influence somewhere near the time of Xerxes. If Xanthus the Lydian placed Zoroaster six thousand years before the crossing of Xerxes, it would prove that in the fifth century, Zoroaster was known in Western Asia Minor as a great religious figure and that some sort of 3000 year- period doctrine was also familiar; and if his statement appeared in a book called Magika, it would follow that Zoroaster was regarded as the fons et origo of Magian practice. (The variant reading 600 for 6000 may be disregarded; the context is fatal to it.) The statement is quoted from Xanthus (with no book-title) in Diog. Laert., pr., 2, in the course of an enumeration of the supposed bar- barian inventors of philosophy. This thesis is supported with the names of various authorities, but comparison with Plin., N.H., xxx 3 f. has made it likely that, so far as Persia is concerned, Hermippus is the main source - though we have to reckon with a habit which Diogenes had of in- serting material from elsewhere in what he copied from a principal source (for this cf. Schwartz, RE, v, cols. 743, 747). Diogenes names author and not book; the name Magika comes from Clem. Alex., Strom., iii, 2, 11 p. 515 P., ii, p. 200, Stiihlin. Clement here quotes a statement about Magian incest, which is supported, and an asser- tion, which Xanthus is unlikely to have made,'s that they approved the free exchange of wives. So the quotation is at best a genuine text which reached Clement in a garbled form. Such treat- ment of the words of Xanthus has been ascribed to Dionysius Scytobrachion,"6 and is apparent in the reference to the oracles of Zoroaster given by Nicolaus of Damascus in his account of the pyre of Croesus -if indeed this is as a whole based on Xanthus. What are we to make of this supposed dating of Zoroaster? If the text of Diogenes Laertius is punctuated so as to make the quotation extend to the end of the sentence, it will include a refer- ence to Alexander's conquest and must be spuri- ous. However v. Gutschmid (Kleine Schr., iii, p. 4, n. 1) is probably right in treating the state- ment quoted above as a parenthesis. On that basis, can it be genuine? Can we accept a Greek statement about Zoroaster a century earlier than any other extant one? Is not Xanthus credited with an assertion about Empedocles'7 which (pace Bidez-Cumont, i, pp. 238 ff.) he cannot have made? Hermippus-if he be the source- was uncritical and seems to have had a good deal to do with the creation of the legendary picture of the Greek lawgivers (as F. E. Adcock has argued in Camb. Hist. Journal, ii, 1927, pp. 106 ff.). His quotation of a certain Pataecus who said that he had the soul of Aesop (FHG iii, p. 39) looks like a figment, as F. Leo observed (Gr.-rbim. Biogr., p. 127), and we can hardly think better of his remark about a supposed original plagiarized by Plato in the Timaeus (Diog. Laert., viii, 85). Yet whether a disciple of Callimachus would have ascribed an imaginary 14 On the concrete associations of these abstractions cf. A. V. W. Jackson, Enc. Rel. Eth., i, pp. 384 f.; L. H. Gray, Arch. f. Rel. vii (1904), pp. 345 ff. and J. Cama Inst., 1. c.-Against Herzfeld's idea that Darius is as a throne-name derived from Vohumano, cf. Zaehner, J. R. As. Soc., 1940, p. 208, and Frye, 1.c., p. 445. In any event, such derivatives could come from Zoroastrian terms as assimilated by Magian groups. 15 Cf. L. Pearson, Early Ionian Historians, p. 117. 16 Cf. E. Schwartz, RE, v, col. 929; F.

Laert., viii, 63.</page><page sequence="6">NOTES AND DISCUSSIONS 277 statement to Xanthus is another matter-unless perhaps as apropos of the Timaeus, in the form "one of the writers says," a qualification which could easily have got lost. As to the trustworthi- ness of any other source that Diogenes might have used we naturally know nothing. In any event, as Heraclit. fr. 14 reminds us, a man living in western Asia Minor early in the fifth century could be familiar with the existence of Magi.'s The title quoted by Clement - though it is given explicitly as such- may well not be an actual book-title; v. Gutschmid's suggestion that Xanthus said what he did in a section of his Lydiaca19 is likely. But the statement about Zoroaster may itself well be genuine, written down but for a time unheeded, and rediscovered in days which took an altogether new interest in the topic. It will represent what some Magi or other Persians said or were thought to have said; some-not a communis opinio. As for the 6000 years, the coincidence with what we learn from Theopompus and from later Persian sources about 3000 year periods is too striking for us to suppose that all that is meant is a very long time. Again, the expedition of Xerxes might well stimulate the emergence and circulation of prophecies. But was it thought of in terms of 'wars and rumors of wars' as signs of the End-save perhaps by individuals? No: it can hardly have meant to the Persian Empire anything like what it meant to the Greeks; it was not comparable with the tension of the time just after the slaying of pseudo-Smerdis.20 IV. Zoroaster and the Magi It is on the interpretation of such scraps of evi- dence that our view of the earlier religious situa- tion in Persia must still depend, and we can hardly go beyond a partial suspension of un- belief. The balance of probability seems to me to indicate that Zoroaster's Gathas had been ac- cepted by some of the Magi as inspired and that their phraseology and ideas had exercised some influence on them and through them on the lan- guage of Xerxes at least. I wish to emphasize the word some, each time. We cannot postulate any single level of acceptance or any uniformity or static conservatism in the body of Magi and in those who used their ministrations; the Anahita cult and its occasional large temples and later the development of Mithraism in Asia Minor and the religious foundation established by Antiochus of Commagene show this.21 What are we to make of the crushing of omomi, then mixed with wolf's blood and thrown away, and the invocation of Hades (presumably Ahri- man) and darkness as described by Plut., Is. Osir., 46, p. 369 E, and the later Mithraic dedica- tions to the god Arimanius? (Agathias, i, 7, ii, 25 does not suggest cultus.) Ahriman as a name seems to be Zoroastrian, as a description of the Evil Spirit, in contrast with the Good Spirit. Our one outside point of contract is that the wolf as an animal of sacrifice appears as a daevic offering in A. Waag, Nirangistan (Iran. Forsch. ed. H. H. Schaeder, ii, 1941, p. 73, cf. 7). Ab- stractions do acquire worship and it is possible that Ahriman as the object of cult, was, as Zervan may have been, the product of reflection. Nevertheless Moulton (Early Zoroastrianism, p. 128, cf. p. 202) adduces the savage ritual per- formed by Amestris (Herodot., vii, 114) "to the god who is said to be under the earth" and rightly infers the existence of some power of darkness (it could be death; cf. ib. p. 132).22 Such a power is Cf. the derivative sense of magos as "impostor," and Nock in F. J. F. Jackson-K. Lake, Beginnings of Christianity, v, pp. 164 ff. 19 Kl. Schr., iv, p. 315. 20 Cf. Meyer's theory of the Jewish prophetic view of that stituation, in Marcks -v. MUller, Meister d. Politik, i, p. 19; Gall, Basileia, pp. 193 ff.; Pfeiffer, Intr., pp. 602 ff. 21 Cf. again the cult of Zeus Theos at Dura-Europos, which seems to involve an element of Ahura Mazda, for there is what looks like a painting of the god with his famous chariot (F. E. Brown, in Excavations at Dura-Europos, vii/viii, pp. 180 ff.). Symeon Meta- phrastes mentions an image of a god acclaimed as Theos Zeus in his account of the death of Acindynus and other Persian martyrs (P.G., cxvi, col. 90 A; Acta Sanctorum, Nov., i, p. 496 C); but the term theos is missing from the preferred text of the other Greek Life which is supposedly Symeon's source (Acta, l.c., p. 469 B), and neither text seems to show any knowledge of Persian religion (cf. on this Life in general Delehaye, Patrologia Orientalis, II, iv, p. 406; 'n'a pas non plus d'attestation historique'). 22 Cf. Moulton, Early Zoroastrianism, pp. 19.8 ff.; L. H. Gray, Harv. Theol. Rev., xv (1922), p. 91. J. Cama Inst., xv, pp. 176 ff.; St. Wikander, Vayu, i, pp. 207 ff.</page><page sequence="7">278 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY corresponded to Ahriman as Zoroaster's Armatay appears to have corresponded to an old earth- goddess.23 In general, my feeling is that we have to reckon with the penetration or acceptance of Zoroastrian terms and ideas as in eschatology, rather than with conversion to Zoroastrian belief. Like Mani, we are fascinated by the figure of Zoroaster. The Gathas impress us with the pregnant personal revelation of prophetic individuality, of faith and conflict and stress, of a felt intimacy with the divine, of the choice between specific evil and specific good, of judgment to come. Zoroaster had his holy wars and to us he suggests Mo- hammed; but, whatever the similarities between the two individuals, the fortunes of their teach- ings were very different. Zoroaster, who called himself a priest (Yasna 33, 6), sought to convert men to his gospel and he won adherents who constituted a community which had a difference now and was to have one in the hereafter. Whether it was large or small we cannot guess; but it existed and it had his Gathas. Large or small, it inherited no Koran, no total code of life; it left no enduring combination of church and state. We do not know its later fortunes except that certain groups, presumably priestly, treasured the Gathas; otherwise they could not have survived. Later, they were accepted by wider priestly circles24- but as texts, as part of the apparatus of worship, not as flaming words. There are no indications of simple evangelical Gatha-singing Zoroastrians in the fifth century. If you are tempted to think of Xerxes as a thorough- going believer, you must remember what his wife Amestris did (cf. p. 277 above). Certainly to argue, as has been done, that Persians might feel a greater kinship with the spirit of Jewish prophecy than with the beastly devices of the heathen is pure romanticism. They might, as Ed. Meyer suggests (in E. Marcks-K. v. Muiller, Meister d. Politik, ed. 2, i, p. 15) find Egyptian animal-worship ridiculous, but so did many Greeks. V. Evidence of Mani, Al Biruni, Agathias Certain scraps of evidence might be thought to tell against this minimizing of the continued influence of the message of Zoroaster. Mani spoke of Zoroaster as casting error out of Babylon as Jesus did out of Jerusalem, and said that Zoroaster did not write books but his disciples after his death wrote from their memories the books used today (J. Bidez-F. Cumont, Les mages hellenisis, ii, pp. 95 f.). He referred also to Buddha, another one of the three Messengers (Al Biruni, Chronology, p. 190, tr. Sachau), as not having written (Kephalaia, pp. 7 f. ed. Polotsky). A new Sogdian fragment, made avail- able by W. B. Henning, JRAS, 1944, pp. 133 ff., clarifies the situation. It gives a list of calumni- 23 P. de Menasce, Rev. hist. rel., cxxxii (1946), p. 173 and J. Dumezil, Tarpeia, pp. 58 ff., suggest that Ar- matay is a transformation of Anahita. Should we not recognize the simultaneous existence of the independ- ent parallel deities in different parts of the Iranian area? They would be like the solar deities of the Rig Veda, found as they are in an area which was not di- vided geographically in the way in which Iran was. Cf. L. H. Gray, J. Cama Inst., xv, p. 172 on Zam as a double of Armatay; his whole collection of evidence shows a wide range of supernatural figures, some but not all of whom may be ascribed to theological elabo- ration. 24 Cf. A. Christensen, L'Iran sous les Sassanides (ed. 2), p. 35, "Plus tard, ce courant religieux a gagne la Medie, dont les pretres, les mages, en sont devenus des propagandistes zeles." I should say not "les pr~tres, les mages," but "des pr~tres, des mages." So also Christensen's "propagandistes zelks" seems to me to introduce a false emphasis. The theogonie of Hdt., i, 132, was probably most often, as has usually been supposed, a Yast or some- thing of its type. A Gatha may have occasionally been used; but Schaeder's argument for this as the meaning (ZDMG, xciv, 1940, p. 407 n.) lays too much stress on the myth of Yasna, 30 and 45. Many Yasts refer to this or that supernatural being as having been created by Ahura Mazda; theogonie is appropriate. In the Acta S. Sires i4eO is used to mean "ritual act" (Bidez- Cumont, ii, p. 86, n. 2; P. Devos, Anal. Bolland., lxiv, 1946, p. 95). The Urform of Vendidad i and the so-called Gatha Haptanghaiti (Yasna 35-41) may show an early form of priestly acceptance of the legacy of Zoroaster; in the latter Zoroaster is divine and Ahura has "wives." It is noteworthy that a "fire-watcher" at Persepolis has a name related to the term yazata (Cameron, Persepolis Treasury Tablets, p. 7, n. 41); yazata appears first in the Gatha Haptanghaiti (Nyberg-Schaeder, p. 278).</page><page sequence="8">NOTES AND DISCUSSIONS 279 ators and sinners; Marten (Eve) who led Adam astray: Cain; a figure whose name is lost, who spoilt the Brahmanic religion; Zamasp who slandered Azrusc (Zoroaster) and Alexander who murdered the Magi; Kugune who spoilt the Magian religion; a certain sramana, and Asoka who slandered Budda, and Devadatta who spoilt the Buddha's religion; Iscariot (cf. Polot- sky, Kephalaia, p. 12) and Satan. Henning rightly remarks that for Mani the content of all revelations was the same25 and that he ac- counted for the deplorable fact of the differences which he saw by a theory of corruption. This cor- ruption was supposedly made possible by the failure of the prophets to set their pronounce- ment of the true doctrine down in a form safe from misrepresentation, and by the continued activity of the evil powers in sending their emis- saries. He may well have been inspired by his conception of Jesus (cf. H. H. Schaeder, Gnomon, ix, 1933, p. 354; H. J. Polotsky, RE, Supp, vi, col. 265). H. Ch. Puech in M. Gorce-R. Mortier, Hist. gin. relig., iii pp. 91 f. has a good phrase, "Bouddha et Zoroastre, qui n'interviennent jamais que dans des paralleles formels." But Mani looked around for material in support of his idea; the name of the saintly Asoka was avail- able as well as that of the hostile Devadatta, and Zamasp was the disciple traditionally supposed to have written down the Avesta after Zoroaster's death. In C. R. C. Allberry, Manichaean Psalm- book, pp. 15 f., 43, the Magians, as being re- sponsible for Mani's death, are "the brothers of the Jews, the murderers of Christ," and it might be supposed that the Sogdian text could re- flect the intensification of hostility between Manichaeans and the Magi. Yet the Kephalaia suggest26 that Mani himself placed Zoroaster later than Buddha and the Book of the Giants, as in part recovered by Henning, Bull. Sch. Orient. Stud., xi (1943), p. 73 n. 3 points to his having known the Sassanian dating of Zoroaster in historical times. It is therefore Magian tradi- tion on which he based his inference; the state- ment about Alexander is conclusive evidence for this. The error which Zoroaster cast out of Babylon is the earlier Assyrian and Median practice-just as in the account of Agathias, to which we come later (p. 280); the Magian religion follows him, though not having his doc- trine in the integrity which attaches to the spoken word. It was only in a special sense that Mani thought of Zoroaster as a protesting prophet. Again Al Biruni, Chronology, pp. 193 f., tr. Sachau, says of the ninth century reformer Baha- firid, "He differed from the Magians in most rites, but he believed in Zaradusht, and claimed for his followers all the institutes of Zara- dusht.... His followers, called the Bahafiri- diyya, keep still the institutes of their founder and strongly oppose the Zamzamis among the Magians."27 Al Biruni (p. 186) knows of element- worship antedating Zoroaster and (p. 314) of Magians before Zoroaster-for whom he has the Sassanian dating-but he regards Zoroaster as the fountain head of all Magian practice; cf. p. 189: "the Magian religion of Zaradusht," pp. 191 f., where Shapur acts against Mani: "faith- ful to the law of Zaradusht which demands the expulsion of pseudo-prophets"; p. 220.19: "when Zoroaster appeared and introduced the religion of the Magi." E. Benveniste, Les Mages (Publ. soc. et. iran., xv, 1938), p. 25, writing before Henning's new texts were available, has referred to Mani as giving evidence for a distinction being felt to exist between the Magi and "les zoroastriens proprement dits." I think this goes too far. In any event, Mani and Bahafirid alike lived in times of theological controversy and sought to 25 "Alles was ich [verkiinde] bestand (bereits) in den friiheren Generationen" (Polotsky, Manich. Homil,. p. 47). 26 P. 12, Polotsky; cf. Fr. Altheim, Weltgesch. Asiens, ii, pp. 133, 171. 27 Cf. Schachrastani, tr. Haarbriicker, i, p. 283, and St. Wikander, Feuerpriester, p. 30.

This does not prove any awareness of a contrast between the Gathas and the later portions of the Avesta. To be sure, the Gathas enjoyed a place of special honor and sacrifices, invocations and hymns;28 "a recitation of the source of sources of the religion" (Dinkard, viii 46.1, tr. E. W. West in Sacred Books of the East, xxxvii p. 169). But this did not involve any sense of contrast save in venerability; the Gathas had the sanctity of a relic. We cannot imagine any ancient equivalent of the modern Gatha Society in Bombay, with its desire to get back to Zoroaster.29 To avoid possible misunderstanding, a word should be added on Agathias, ii, 24 (Hist. gr. min. ii p. 221, ed. L. Dindorf). Agathias en- joyed the help of an interpreter expert in the vernacular of contemporary Persia (iv 30) and justly contrasted the standing of Magi under the Sassanians with that which they had in the times described by Herodotus (ii 26). He makes Zoro- aster "the son of Ormasdes" (cf. Ps. Plat., Alcib., i p. 122A: Agathias calls the god Ormisdates) responsible for the present customs of the Per- sians as distinct from their old ones. He does not venture to decide whether Zoroaster's con- temporary Hystaspes was or was not father to Darius, or when Zoroaster flourished. But he says that of old the Persians worshipped Zeus, Kronos, and the other gods talked of among the Greeks (a name which carries also the sense "pagans"), under different names, calling Zeus perhaps by the name of Belus, Heracles by that of Sandes, and Aphrodite by that of Anaitis, and the others otherwise as has been recorded by Berossus the Babylonian and Athenocles and Simacus, the authors who set down the earliest history of the Assyrians and Medes. Presumably this comes from a single inter- mediary source, which referred to Berossus and to the other, obscure figures. It is a contrast not between the Magi and Zoroaster but between the present religion of Persia, ascribed as a whole to Zoroaster, and the religion of the Medes and Assyrians. In the preceding chapters (ii, 23 f.) Agathias contrasted the Persian habit of exposing their dead with the customs of the oldest in- habitants of the land, the Assyrians, Chaldaeans, and Medes, and then went on to contrast Persian incest with the righteous resistance of Ninyas to the impure passion of Semiramis. So the cult of Bel, Sandes, Anaitis etc. is contrasted with the present doctrine of Ormisdates and Arimanes (a doctrine which Agathias compared with Mani- chaeism); to be sure, he adds that contempo- rary Persians propitiated many other deities. I infer that Bel and Sandes are not, as Bidez- Cumont, ii, p. 85 suggest, Semitic equivalents of Mazdaean names but are the gods of a region where Persians came to be-a region which had been through many changes. Interestingly enough Agathias suggested that fire worship might have originated with the Chaldaeans (ii 26). Berossus naturally wrote of Bel. He is also our authority for the official institution of the cult of Anaitis (naming, as was natural, Babylon first among the cities where images and temples were established) and he spoke of the Sac(a)ea-and a Sacaea was associated in Pontus with her cult - as Babylonian (fr. 15, p. 256 in P. Schnabel, Berossos). Did he here claim Anaitis as a Baby- lonian goddess? And did he perhaps mention Sandes in connection with the tradition that Tarsus was founded by an Assyrian king, as we read in fr. 44, p. 270 ed. Schnabel? (For Aristobul. ap. Strab. p. 672, Sardanapallus was the founder.) In any event, Agathias gives us the late conventional picture of Zoroaster's work. VI. A supposed anti-Zoroastrian reaction The appearance of Mithra and Anahita to- gether with Ahura Mazda in the royal texts of Artaxerxes II has often been regarded (as Herz- feld regards it) as the abandonment of strict Zoroastrianism and as a concession to an older unreconstructed phaseof Persian religion. Ido not 28 Cf. J. Darmesteter, Le Zend-Avesta, i, p. xcviii, 476; Vendidad xix, 38; E. Lehmann in Bertholet-Leh- mann, Lehrbuch d.

Lehre (ed. 2), p. 18 (Indo- Iranian Studies... in honour of Shams-Ul-Ullema Dastur Darab Peshotan Sanjana, p. 15). Mazdak said, asserts the Siyasatnaman, that he was come to inter- pret the law of Zoroaster which was constantly being violated: he would have been using skilful propaganda, but the source does not warrant historical inferences (cf. A. Christensen, Danske Vid. Selskab. Medd., ix, vi (1925), p. 61).</page><page sequence="10">NOTES AND DISCUSSIONS 281 think that we should allow more than a personal shift of emphasis (quite apart from the fact that Ahura Mazda remained in a class apart; Moulton, op. cit., p. 59). When Herodotus speaks (i 131) of the Persians as having learned the cult of Mithra as an addition to their old system of worship (i rLIEa Kao-L, in contrast to apXnOev), he is not referring to a development in his own time. We should compare ii, 52 ff., on the time when the gods in Greece had no names and on the importa- tion of their names from Egypt; so in ii, 49, the cult of Dionysus is spoken of as a recent intro- cution. In ii, 52 ff., Herodotus claims to have the evidence of Dodonaean tradition and what he says of Mithra may come from his Persian friends; but it almost certainly does not bear on fifth century development. The establishment of cult-images of Anaitis does not look like a concession to popular Persian ways, for the Persians, like the Indians, probably had no cult-images in early times.30 Yast 5, in spite of the opinion of many, does not, I think, prove the existence of a sculptural type at the time when it was written; to me it seems to show only that Anahita had aroused anthropomorphic, pictorial imagination in a manner for which there are some analogies in the Rig Veda but which went beyond what was attained by most objects of Persian worship. A foreign symbol was adopted for Ahura Mazda, and later the Yueh- Chi coins employ some accompanying symbols which fit Persian tradition; otherwise, as P. Gardner remarked (B. M. C. Greek and Scythian Kings of Bactria and India, p. lxvi), "There are a few set schemes according to which all the figures are arranged"; there were not familiar art-types. What Artaxerxes II did may even be, as Wikander suggests,3" an imitative reaction in face of alien cults - the establishment again, of something like a Reichskult for the main lands of the Empire -except Egypt32- analogous per- haps to the Ptolemaic institution of the cult of Sarapis. Anahita had a great popularity; in Yast v, 9, Ahura Mazda is represented as paying homage to her, and her strength in Asia Minor is remarkable; further, her cult was absorptive and many sided, and could approximate to older types of Mother-worship and acquire new rites, e.g. temple prostitution.33 But Anahita had her place from the beginning, and as a deity inti- mately linked to the royal house. The "warlike goddess who might be supposed to be Athena" in whose sanctuary Artaxerxes II received the kingly sacre and donned the garment worn by Cyrus before he became monarch cannot be anyone else (Plut., Artax., 3; Wikander, p. 68).34 This was established practice; what Artaxerxes did later was to enlarge and make ex- plicit Anahita's position, not to let in what had been previously kept out. So the king's cere- monial drunkenness and dance at the Mithra- kana can hardly have been an innovation; Mithra simply acquired more overt emphasis. Again, G. G. Cameron, Persepolis Treasure Tablets, pp. 5 ff., has shown that in the second year of Xerxes the haoma cult was practiced in the palace and the technical terms, used in the Avesta for the officiant and for the mortar wherein the haoma was prepared, were already employed. I cannot believe that there had been any official dis- countenancing of Anahita or Mithra; there had certainly been nothing like the spirit of Akh- naton. In general, I conceive the historical process as an injection, perhaps in part progres- sive, of Zoroastrian texts and phrases coupled with specially Magian principles into a pre- existent nature-worship rather than as an injec- tion of nature-worship and Magian practice into a Zoroastrian scheme. (Cf. Moulton, Early Zoroastrianism, pp. 189 f.-pages which, like 30 Dino ap. Clem. Alex. Protr. 5, p. 65 P. (i, p. 49.23 Stiihlin) in the fourth century still speaks of the Per- sians as regarding fire and water as the only images of the gods and Strabo, 732, repeats the statement of Herodotus. In spite of known exceptions, both were describing a substantive general distinction between Persian and Greek practice. In view of Herzfeld, pp. 804 f., we must allow for the possibility that the Medes had images earlier. 31 Feuerpriester, p. 189. On this book cf. R. N. Frye, Harv. J. Asiatic Studies, xi, 1948, pp. 230 ff. 32 On Persia's relative lack of interest in Egypt after the time of Xerxes, cf. A.

Nock in Jackson-Lake, op. cit., p. 169, n. 1. 34 Cf. F. H. Weissbach, RE, Supp., iv, col. 1165, 42.</page><page sequence="11">282 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY his book as a whole, are eminently worthy of being reread.) The postulated early phase sup- plies the background for Zoroaster; it may be supposed to have included a multiplicity of yazatas, objects of worship, several of whom (notably Anahita, and Mithra-both having probably wider popularity than Ahura) had be- come sharply defined figures. Even Anahita may well have been the name that won out among others representing local deities of the same type (cf. AJA, xlvii, 1943, p. 494). There can have been nothing like an Olympian pantheon; but there probably was, over a wide range, some- thing like an Iranian pattern, and this included the ethical features mentioned earlier. Zoroaster was the partly rebellious child of this tradition, and in time some of the expressions of his rebel- lion were adopted and developed to such concepts as that of dualism in creation. VII. Position of the Magi The unity and individuality of Persia lay in a sense of race and in a sense and style of rule; otherwise there was no single specific entity but an unlimited willingness to tolerate and to bor- row over a wide area of empire. We do not al- ways realize how large an area Persia comprised and the extent to which that area fell into units so placed as to make intercommunication diffi- cult and perhaps largely limited to the neces- sities of administration. So again the unity and individuality of the Magi lay in their character as a Median clan and in their functions. They had enjoyed a privileged standing in the Median kingdom,35 but they, like the Achaemenids, were called suddenly to play a part on a yet larger stage, furnished with properties taken from where they could be found. The Magi were individuals. In this or that region, as in Cappadocia (Strabo, p. 733), they might be very numerous. Yet there were no large temple-groups, like those of Babylonia and Egypt, unless perhaps at the Anaitis temples mentioned earlier - and here the size of the establishments presumably rested on a fusion of Anaitis with earlier objects of worship, e.g. Ma. Pyraitheia (fire-sanctuaries) must always have been relatively small. It would appear that there were travelling priests who ministered to Per- sians abroad (Moulton, Early Zoroastrianism, p. 88 n. 1); how early this custom existed we do not know, and it could have been a matter of individual action. Till Sassanian times there was no organization or hierarchy and there were no synods, no Persepolis Conference, no possibility of developing a general policy. The Magi started with the old functions of the priestly part of society, as in India, and were accepted in the Empire as competent to perform their traditional duties at sacrifice, to pour libations (for which Cameron, op. cit., p. 7 has produced documentary evidence), and to foretell the future.36 Their participation with the Greek manteis in Alexander's libation ceremony at Opis shows them as something like a Reichsclerus;7 yet, though their standing was far more specific than that of their associates on this occasion, they did not constitute a Reichskirche. As in- dividuals they no doubt performed some func- tions like those of the clergy in the Middle Ages. Herzfeld, p. 193, refers to the unpublished evi- dence of the Persepolis tablets for their participa- tion in administrative duties, and Cambyses left one of their number in charge of his house- hold when he went on his Egyptian expedition (Hdt., iii, 61); they were the natural guardians of the tomb of Cyrus. The tradition about the Magophonia must now be taken seriously in view of what Henning says in JRAS, 1944, pp. 133 ff. Yet Moulton's suggestion (op. cit., pp. 196 ff.), that after Gaumata's revolt and seizure of the throne on the pretense of being Smerdis the Magi set them- selves to regain power, probably attaches too much importance to the revolt. But there was development, and we may perhaps postulate a gradual rise in the importance and in the self- consciousness of the Magi-or rather of some of 35 Cf. Hdt., i, 107, 120. 36 Some, again, may have been deemed capable of receiving revelation in ecstasy; the singer in Dino ap. Athenae., p. 633 d, may well have been Magian. 37 Cf. Q. Curt., v, i, 22, which may (as Bidez-Cu- mont, i, p. 34 think) prove that the Magi had precedence over the Chaldaei; Curtius had good mate- rial on Persian religion; cf. W. W. Tarn, Alexander, ii, p. 108. Did Alexander at Opis deliberately pass over the Chaldaei because of the suspicions arising from the affairs of the Bel Temple? Arrian, Anab. vii, 17, refers to a later time, but Alexander might have had such a feeling earlier.</page><page sequence="12">NOTES AND DISCUSSIONS 283 them. Is not the language of Xerxes, with its solemn commendation of the sacred twigs (barzman)38 as well as of arta, clerical in inspira- tion and draughtsmanship? Is it not in the temper of Gaumata who destroyed certain cult places? Dino's statement (ap. Athenae. p. 652 b) that Xerxes banished foreign food and drink from the royal table is important, whether true or false.39 Dino believed it or at least asserted it. After Xerxes comes the establishment of Ana- hita and the emergence of Mithra also in royal inscriptions; and then we have the records in Plut., Artax., 3 of the priestly education of the new ruler (cf. ibid., 6 and [Plat.] Alcib. i, 122 A, which is not Plato but is Academic, and good evi- dence for what was thought, and perhaps for what was done, in the fourth century).4o After the interruption of Alexander's conquests, a new rise of Magian influence is seen. The Parthians in- herited a tradition to which they must adapt themselves. The story of Tiridates illustrates this increase of priestly power (CAH, x, pp. 502, 772), and Pliny's phrase (NHI, xxx, 2) regum regibus imperet, which looks forward to his account of the incident (16 f.), has a meaning in its exaggera- tion. Again, Strabo p. 732 records the killing of men for violation of the sanctity of fire-which is clearly an innovation since the times of Herodotus and Xenophon. However much the Vendidad may contain of earlier material, its redaction must belong to the Parthian period. It insists upon the exposure of the dead, a custom which the Achaemenids did not accept, for all their education in mageia-nor did the Parthian or, it seems, Sassanian monarchs (perhaps it really could not be thought appropriate to kings); I do not think that it could be a code compiled to satisfy an Achaemenid desire to have one in writing.41 It seems that the Persian administra- tion deserves credit for a codification of Egyp- tian law. Now the Vendidad has a section on laws and contracts (iv, 1 ff.) and Olmstead, History of the Persian Empire, pp. 130 ff. has seen in its cer- tain resemblances to Hammurabi's code. In the main, however, it is true to its original title, Videvdat, "law against demons." It might well be that a Magian code would have had a similar emphasis but it would hardly have omitted to provide for payments to Magi for assistance at sacrifice. VIII. Theological development The Magi were set apart by their functions and by their taboos (which went far beyond what was generally thought binding), and their busi- ness was religion. Many Magi, like many other Persians, were in contact with the Greeks. Is it not possible that some of them deliberately built up their position to be analogous to that ascribed to the supposedly learned clergy of Egypt, and to their old rivals the Chaldaei in Babylonia, and that they fostered the idea of a Zoroaster of six 38 Cf. L. Scherman, JAOS, lxv, 1945, p. 142, n. 23. (But see on the other side R. G. Kent, Language, xxi, 1945, pp. 223 ff.) O. M. Dalton, Treasure of the Oxus (ed. 2), p. 1, publishes an early fifth century silver statuette, showing what is thought to be an Achae- menid king carrying the sacred bundle of twigs. 39 Meyer, Meister, i, p. 34, remarks on his dropping from 484 the title "king of Babylon," and Schaeder, Weltreiche, p. 13 on his use (save in the Accadian ver- sion) of "king of the lands of many races" in place of the "king of the lands of all races" of Darius. The earlier universalist style may well be an adop- tion of Babylonian royal practice (C. F. Lehmann- Haupt, Festschrift akad. Historikerklubs in Innsbriick, 1923, pp. 69 ff.). It is welcome confirmation to find Cameron saying (Persepolis Treasury Tablets, p. 9) "Xerxes was prob- ably the particular patron of the Magi." 40 On the passage, cf. J. Kerchensteiner, Platon u. d. Orient, p. 203; she rightly remarks that the object is the impression to be made on Alcibiades -not a Per- sian story for its own sake. (So also what is said about Sparta in this dialogue may be supposed to refer to the dramatic date and not to prove anything about the date of composition.) Is Politicus, 290 d, apropos of the Egyptian king, a reflection of what was now be- lieved of the Persian king? M. Rostovtzeff, Social and Economic History of the lIellenistic World, p. 105, has argued in favor of a rise of Persian nationalism under Artaxerxes III, and there is now supplementary evidence to which Professor G. M. A. Hanfmann kindly drew my attention; S. Smith, AJ, xxii (1942), pp. 111 f. I venture to doubt whether Smith is right in thinking of this in terms of religious fanaticism; contemporary satraps minted coins with the divine title Baal Tarz. As Hanfmann remarks, Smith's article illustrates in a striking way the looseness of Persian imperial organization. 41 I say this in view of Schaeder, Weltreiche, p. 30. Herzfeld, p. 738, puts the Vendidad about the begin- ning of our era.</page><page sequence="13">984 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY thousand years ago, as fountainhead of their practice and teaching-an inspired individual whose imputed antiquity might be said to sur- pass that of Egyptian priesthood? The interest of the Academy, as of cultivated men in general, in Persian tradition is undisputed, and it was continued by Aristotle. The record of the visit of a Chaldaean is not necessarily an invention, and the statement that a Persian dedicated Silanion's statue of Plato in the Academy seems trustworthy.42 Like a Levite, a Magus was bound to fulfill cer- tain observances; unlike him, he did not have his turn in the services of the one Temple. In gen- eral he had some leisure for magic in the lower sense or for the exercise of the mythopoeic faculty (e.g. on the heavenly bodies) and of thought, long before the theological activity of Sassanian and later times, when Persian beliefs were in conflict with Judaism, Christianity, Manichaeism, and Islam.43 We may well accept the view that the beginnings of Zervanism are to be found in speculativeness encouraged by con- tacts with Babylonians and Greeks. Zervan as god of Eternity may indeed have been earlier regarded as a deity (cf. Gray, J. Cama Inst., xv, p. 126 and G. Widengren, Hochgottglaube, pp. 266 ff.) but his prominence was due to a desire to find a larger framework in which to set the moral antitheses of Zoroaster and the Magian dichotomy of objects in the visible world. We should have to date this early if we accept Ny- berg's suggestion (J. As. ccxix, 1931, p. 16, n. 1) endorsed by Sidney Smith, Isaiah Chapters XL-LV, p. 58, that Isaiah 45, 6-7 involves the concept of Zervan and is language adapted to suit Cyrus' own religious beliefs. I cannot weigh the linguistic argument, but would urge two points. First, the words in question are a descrip- tion of divine omnipotence in an absolute way, with the use of polar expression (as in Corp. Herm., v, 9 ff. and in material discussed by C. Bonner, Harv. Theol. Rev., xxxvii, 1944, pp. 338 f.). Second, it is very hard to imagine Deutero- Isaiah being acquainted with the finer points of Persian thought. (It is only at this point that the language could fit Zervan; he was not a god active in history.) If the significance of Zervan belong to a time after Zoroaster, so must also the doctrine of thousand-year periods-which made so deep an impression upon the Greeks. Zoroaster had expected an end of the world, but it is hard to see how, as Herzfeld maintains, he could have held the 9000 years theory.44 Zoroaster lived in the expectation of crisis; he was aware of the legendary past - at least of the tale of Yima. What he says about the original opposition of the Good Spirit and the Evil Spirit gives a diagnosis of the state of the world, not a scheme of history. The doctrine of the 3000 year- periods is certainly as old as the fourth century, and, if the Xanthus quotation is in substance genuine (p. 276 above), as old as the fifth. But it is surely scholastic rather than prophetic, the outcome of reflection on the original message, like patristic comment on Daniel or the Revela- tion rather than like those books. These periods are part of the World-year, divisions of the single unrepeated existence of the universe: the first, the Vorspiel or period of creation on the plane of immateriality (a concept which may well be the product of contact with Greek thought), and then the three periods in which the fortunes of good and evil went this way and that. A doctrine of four ages is not unnatural; the Mahabharata applies it to human history and so does the scheme which underlies Hesiod's (cf. JHS, xlix, 1929, pp. 115 f.). Here the time-scheme in its long projection serves to find room for various phases of cold and hot war between Zoroaster's irreconcilables, for the Magian dichotomy of living things into good and evil, for old stories of creation and the Primal Man, for Zoroaster's own emergence on the stage of history. An alternative 7000 year scheme was to emerge 42 Cf. in general J. Kerchensteiner, op. cit., e.g., pp. 55, 192 if.; A. J. Festugiere, Rev. Phil., lxxiii (1947); Fr.

On the whole subject opinion is in flux; you have only to com- pare the first edition of Christensen's L'Iran sous les Sassanides, published in 1936, with the second edition, published in 1944, to see how ap- preciably that judicious scholar found it neces- sary to modify his position. Albert Schweitzer's Quest of the historical Jesus showed how from Reimarus to Wrede scholars had been led to take different views of the Gospel story. We need some time a Quest of the historical Zoroaster. If it is written, Herzfeld will stand out as one of the great figures in the quest - but it will be mainly for the new archaeological material of various periods which he, as a second Rawlinson, has brought to light. Since these pages went to press Professor Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin has been so kind as to send me his admirable new Zoroastre. The reader will there find an illuminating treatment of the nature of Zoroaster's abstractions and of the relation of those abstractions and of his religion in general to earlier beliefs. There is moreover an important critique of some of Ny- berg's theories and an indispensable translation of the Gathas (with brief notes). Duchesne- Guillemin agrees with Kent (cf. note 38, above) in rejecting the view that Xerxes referred to the sacred twigs (pp. 131 f.). While these lines are in the press, Franz Altheim's Awestische Textgeschichte (Hallische Monographien, ix, 1949) has come to hand. It has some extremely important suggestions on the way in which thewritten text of the Avesta took shape. 46 Cf. Bidez-Cumont, i, pp. 218 f.; J. Danielou, Vi- gilae Christianae, ii (1948), pp. 1 ff. 46 Cf. in particular W. W. Jaeger, Aristotle (E. T.), p. 134, n. 2 (with the modification there made of the German original). On the belief that a new figure would come at the end of each millennium after Zoro- aster's death from his seed cf. A. v. Gall, op. cit., pp. 125 ff.</page></plain_text>
