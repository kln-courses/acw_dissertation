It may be said that the one thing which Niebuhr has uppermost in mind is to set forth such a philosophy of history; we shall attempt to catch it within the scope of this paper, and having delineated the structure in its main ele- ments, we shall criticize it from the point of view of Christian Naturalism and attempt a constructive interpretation of our own. In a real sense it is true that an investigation of Niebuhr's philosophy of history would entail the proportions of a large volume, for it is true that everything he says has some sig- nificance for this aspect of his thought. It will not be possible within the limits of this paper to do more than to select some of the most crucial elements for examination. It will probably be claimed that we have selected such features as lend them- selves to a naturalistic interpretation, that we have neglected some highly important details. In a measure the first claim will be true of any critique of Niebuhr, for he lends himself to a variety of interpretations. He is obscure and paradoxical; he resists any attempt to resolve these paradoxes. To this extent there is possible a wide difference of interpretation; Niebuhr is like a dark, unruffled pool in which a variety of things may be seen reflected, depending upon what one is prepared to find. We hope, however, that we have caught the main outline of a philosophy of history to which the author, himself, would assent. PART I NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY On Presuppositions. The natural point at which to begin a description of Niebuhr's interpretation of history is to set forth in systematic order the author's presuppositions. Every structure of thought has its foundation in peculiar materials accepted more or less unwittingly. To uncover such elements in Niebuhr, however, would be a task equal at least to the scope of our present work; for it would entail a careful scrutiny and</page><page sequence="3">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 239 analysis of both cultural and psychological elements which have influenced the thought of our author. There may be in fact no way of knowing for certain another's presuppositions; it is no part of the present work, at any rate, to psychoanalyze Niebuhr, and we shall attempt to refrain from imputing to him what he does not actually say. The natural starting point, therefore, is to set forth the author's admitted presuppositions. "The interpretation which is being attempted in these pages is based on Christian presup- positions. The Christian answer to the problem of life is as- sumed in the discussion of the problem." I What these Chris- tian presuppositions are is not so clear; but we shall be on rela- tively safe ground if we characterize Niebuhr's philosophy of history as set consciously over against two alternative inter- pretations, one attempting to find the meaning of life within the historical process, the other turning away from history to find whatever meaning there is existing entirely and exclusively in a non-spatial, non-temporal reality. Against these two alter- natives, Niebuhr finds the key to the meaning of history in the revelation of God which is in Christ. The narrow span of years at the beginning of the present era is the keystone in the arch of history. "History after Christ is an interim between the disclosure of its true meaning and the fulfillment of that meaning." 2 Were it not for this period which saw the rise of the Christian religion, mankind would have no basis for dis- covering the significance of human living. The Christian tra- dition is the norm, the later interpretations throwing more and more light on the original revelation in Christ. Christ as the disclosure of the character of God and the meaning of history . (a) completes what is incomplete in their apprehensions of meaning; (b) it clarifies obscurities which threaten the sense of meaning; and (c) it finally corrects falsifications of meaning which human egoism introduces into the sense of meaning by reason of its effort to comprehend the whole of life from an inadequate centre of comprehension.3 1 Reinhold Niebuhr, The Nature and Destiny of Man, Volume II (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1943), p. 6. 2 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 49. 3 Ibid., p. 81.</page><page sequence="4">240 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Instead of looking away from history to another order of ex- istence, instead of finding the full meaning of history within the temporal process, Niebuhr sees in Christ the foundation upon which one might stand to see the direction in which his- tory will be fulfilled. There are other aspects of Niebuhr's Biblicism which might be treated as presuppositions accepted with scriptural author- ity, aspects which our author would evidently affirm as having the status of presuppositions. We mention three: (1) that God suffers, (2) that God is both immanent and transcendent in and over the world, and (3) that God judges the whole human enter- prise. We might go further to phrase presuppositions regarding other customary Christian concepts. But we pause at this juncture to note that it is conceivable that Niebuhr is not consciously presupposing elements of orthodox Christian belief. It is conceivable, for example, that Niebuhr thinks that his treatment of super-history rests entirely upon the basis of empirical data to which we shall refer below. The present writer believes, to be sure, that Niebuhr accepts the orthodox belief in a ground called Eternity for all that exists in time, but we hesitate to credit the author with this assumption, for it is possible that he might disagree and emphasize that his whole picture rests upon an empirical basis. We intend to be faithful to Niebuhr by accepting as presup- positions, therefore, only what are clearly such. That Christ is final in revealing the mind of God and the meaning of history, that God is both immanent and transcendent in and over the world, that God judges the whole human enterprise, and that God suffers - these are the important presuppositions. These we believe the author would concede. We shall not be un- faithful if we rest our case at this point with respect to the presuppositions which lie behind his philosophy of history. Super-history. We have already said that we shall treat this feature in the sense that it is based upon empirical data rather than as a presupposition. We shall build the case for super- history, displaying as Niebuhr does the various empirical evi- dences which point to this source of meaning and which point to the possible characteristics which super-history can be</page><page sequence="5">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 241 expected to possess. All of the evidence designated is empirical data on which Niebuhr bases his philosophy of history. We wish to draw attention, therefore, to these numerous evidences; they are the important bricks out of which our author con- structs his edifice. We might further remark that we shall employ these same empirical facts later in our study, attempt- ing to interpret them from a naturalistic point of view with entirely different results. It may be held that each of the elements which we treat be- low is but a manifestation of the transcendence of man over the flux of the temporal process. It might be said that each of these elements speaks of one central fact; namely, the expression of the transcendent in man. Indeed, this is precisely what we believe to be the author's meaning. With this in view we treat super-history first, for it is evident that Niebuhr's entire phi- losophy of history is erected upon his concept of super-history and its r6le in the progress of meaning. Super-history is the foundation of man's historical existence, standing above and beyond and lending meaning and completion to the obscurities of life. How this is viewed by Niebuhr will be clear as we pro- ceed. Empirical data employed as evidence for super-history. In the following manifestations, super-history expresses itself in man, forcing man to take it into account. In all of these ways the transcendence of man over temporal existence is evidenced. 1. Man can look before and after and dream of what is not. 2. Man realizes his own finiteness. 3. Man can extricate himself from the causal forces in history sufficiently to achieve freedom. 4. All the meanings of history are fragmentary and frustrated in time. 5. Man has a sense of failure to fulfill the absolute demands of God; this sense issues from the image of God which is in him. 6. Man looks forward with anxiety to the end of history and to death. 7. History is involved in conflicts which appear on each successive cul- tural level and are never escaped. 8. The sacrificial love which was manifested in Christ points to super- history. It is possible to place different meanings upon such experiential fact; we will now endeavor to give Niebuhr's interpretation of</page><page sequence="6">242 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the data listed above. We have said that he believes all of these points to be evidence of a transcendent reality expressing itself in man. The documentary evidence will be allowed to build this case. A suprahistorical eternity is implied in history because the capacity by which man transcends temporal sequence, while yet being involved in it, implies a capacity of transcendence which is not limited by the sequence.4 For any rigorous examination of the problems of man in nature-history clearly reveals that history points beyond itself and that it does so by reason of the freedom and transcendence of the human spirit. It is never completely contained in, or satisfied by, the historical-natural process, no matter to what level this process may rise.5 Professor Tillich's analysis of the thought which transcends all con- ditioned and finite thought . .. is a precise formulation of the ultimate self- transcendence of the human spirit, revealed in its capacity to understand its own finiteness.6 In this fashion Niebuhr sees the significance of man's ability to extricate himself from the rigid involvement in causal sequence in which lower animals are immersed. Of all living organisms, man alone can rise over the domination of causality, can lift himself to a higher vista from which to look down upon the past and into the future and contemplate his own finiteness. Man alone of all the animal kingdom is able to take a little of the past and a little of the future and hold it in the present in a "partial simultaneity." This will convince the most sincere sceptic that the present moment with its causal nexus is tran- scended in the sense that man comprehends more than the present moment. Equally cogent empirical data are found among the anxieties and frustrations, the incompleteness and false absolutes, the tensions and ubiquitous conflicts, which are present on every level of cultural development. Man cannot believe that the full meaning of history can be found in these incomplete and remnant bits of significance. All of this is evidence to show that life cannot complete itself on the historical level, that these conflicts and inconsistencies are never resolved in history. And insofar as history cannot complete itself, insofar as the conflicts Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 10. 6 Ibid., p. 96. * Ibid. (footnote), p. 218.</page><page sequence="7">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 243 of history are never resolved, the concept of super-history is justified. Insofar as he is involved in history, the disclosure of life's meaning must come to him in history. Insofar as he transcends history the source of life's meaning must transcend history.7 The conception of a 'last' judgment expresses Christianity's refutation of all ideas of history, according to which it is its own redeemer and is able by its process of growth and develppment, to emancipate man from the guilt and sin of his existence, and to free him from judgment.8 On the basis of this intrinsic incoherence of history, man knows history to require super-history and a transcendent God. Of great importance to Niebuhr is man's sense of failure to achieve the demands of God, which might be otherwise stated as man's constant striving to correct his inadequacies, to surpass his accomplishments, to realize something ever more excellent than what has been achieved in the past. Others, pointing to this characteristic of man with the phrases 'divine unrest' or 'the capacity for being bored,' have found in this urge to greater fulfillment a source of creative behavior. Niebuhr interprets this unceasing striving to mean that man has an image of God within him, an image besmirched with sin, to be sure, but an image nevertheless, which is the source of this sense of failure to fulfill God's demands. This evidence of super-history man bears within him; God has placed in all men an ineradicable goodness which makes man restive in the midst of evil. Man is anxious about himself, feels the pressure of necessity against his own inadequateness. Against this background of a residual goodness, Niebuhr in- terprets the Fall of Man. This image of God, which is the source of man's sense of failure to approximate the will of God, is, in a fallen state, corrupted with evil, submerged in the evils of the historical flux. This is the core of truth at which the Biblical symbol of the Fall aims; actually there never was a Fall, but there is a fallen image of God within man which suf- fices to prove man's citizenship in super-history. Niebuhr declares against the error of Barth's denial of this point of con- tact between man and eternity; 9 the footprints of God are in this claim of a higher goodness in man.

I Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 64.</page><page sequence="8">244 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW The expression of the transcendent is further revealed in man's fear of death. Because the fear of death springs from the capacity not only to anticipate death but to imagine and to be anxious about some dimension of reality on the other side of death. Both forms of fear prove man's transcendence over nature. His mind comprehends the point in nature at which his own ex- istence in nature ends; and thereby proves that nature does not fully contain him. The fact that he fears extinction is a negative indication of a dimen- sion in the human spirit, transcending nature. The fact that he is anxious about a possible realm of meaning on the other side of death, and speculates, in the words of Hamlet's soliloquy that 'to die, to sleep' may mean 'perchance to dream,' is the positive indication of man's freedom transcending nature. The fear of death is thus the clearest embryonic expression of man's capacity as a creator of history.10 Whether or not a fear of death actually demonstrates man's transcendence over the life and death cycle of natural phe- nomena we shall have occasion to discuss in our next section. It is important to see here that to Niebuhr this contemplation of one's own end shows in itself that there is something in man which enables him to reach beyond that end and to view the destruction of his own life from some vantage point in a tran- scendent eternity. The point in Niebuhr's classification of empirical data which collects facts with regard to the conflicts present on every cul- tural level, from the primitive to the highest and most com- plex modern civilization, lends itself to a convincing interpreta- tion of an historical flux hopelessly caught in unresolved tensions which renew the possibilities of savage wars on every level. That there will be 'wars and rumors of wars' to the end of time is a statement which can hardly be refuted on the basis of available evidence. Modern technical civilization is bringing all civilizatipns and cultures, all empires and nations into closer juxtaposition to each other. The fact that this greater intimacy and contiguity prompts tragic 'world wars' rather than some simple and easy interpenetration of cultures, must dissuade us from regarding a 'universal culture' or a 'world government' as the natural and inevitable TELOS which will give meaning to the whole historical process." Significance of the above empirical data. We have listed sev- eral divisions of experiential data which, according to Niebuhr, o10 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 8. 11 Ibid., p. 314.</page><page sequence="9">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 245 demonstrate the pull of the transcendent upon man. All of these divisions are used to reveal the anomalous position of history suspended, as it were, between nature and super-history. The data set forth are open to common scientific verification, are found throughout history; they are not the possession of some esoteric group. All of this leads to Niebuhr's key state- ment, that history, full of obscurities and unfulfilled meanings, points beyond itself. History has its basis in super-history. There are elements in the 'behaviour' of history which point to this 'hid- den' source of its life. It is in that sense that history is meaningful but point- ing beyond itself.12 History. It will be useful to bring to a focus at this point what has been said with regard to history. It has been brought out in various ways that history is suspended, so to speak, between nature with its causal mechanism, and super-history with its free activity. History is the life of man both in his transcendence over nature and in his subjection to it. There is tension and stress in the life of man; he is caught in repeated contradictions; he is carried first one way and then another, pulled by the activity of super-history and by natural phe- nomena, each in turn, and often both simultaneously, being disclosed in the behavior of man. History, therefore, has meaning; history is serious, however impotent it is when taken alone. History has this tremendous job to do; namely, to carry meaning. One might mention that Niebuhr is not clear as to whether or not history will ultimately be gathered up in a final end of the temporal sequence. In some places it might seem as though he accepts the view of New Testament eschatology and sees history caught up and destroyed in a final act of God. But the author is obscure to such a degree that we would prefer to leave the matter undecided. The significant point, at any rate, is the seriousness of historical sequence, its r8le as a carrier of meaning, its pointing beyond itself to a completion and ful- fillment in super-history, the hidden source of its life. "History moves between the limits of nature and eternity." 13 12 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 67. 11 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 9.</page><page sequence="10">246 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW On the nature of super-history. The empirical data assembled thus far point inconclusively to the existence of a realm which Niebuhr calls super-history. All of the evidence has demon- strated the fact that man transcends the natural and historical flux. The effort thus far has been to show that there is a basis outside history upon which history depends. As to the nature of this super-historical realm nothing yet has been said, save that it provides the foundation for such life and meaning as we find in the historical process. In any time and place, man can note the evidence which we have reviewed, can observe his own freedom over history. It is on this basis that Niebuhr makes the charge that wherever history is taken seriously a Christ is expected. For to Niebuhr the evidence points con- clusively to the fact that history's incompleteness and irrecon- cilable conflict, man's anomalous suspension between time and eternity, his fear of death, his consciousness of failure to fulfill the demands upon him, his ability to look before and behind and to dream of what is not, and his ability to realize his own finiteness - all of this can point to one conclusion; namely, that there is another basis outside time where these incon- sistencies and incomplete gropings are caught up and fulfilled. All of these items of man's experience, if taken seriously, should lead man to expect a Christ. For the Christian, this resolution of the confusion of history, this invasion of the super-historical realm into history, is an accomplished fact. It is to Christ that Niebuhr looks for the key to the meaning of history, for in Christ God is revealed. In the person of Christ we have an insight into the nature of this super-historical realm the presence of which has been es- tablished. Christ verifies the conclusion at which we had ar- rived from an examination of history; Christ further reveals some of the characteristics of super-history. When this word of revelation (that is in Christ) is spoken, it completes incomplete knowledge insofar as human history is a realm of reality having its final basis in eternity. There are elements in the 'behaviour' of history which point to this 'hidden' source of its life. It is in that sense that history is meaningful but pointing beyond itself. Secondly, the word of revelation clarifies obscurities and contradictions in history. In that sense history is meaningful but its meaning is threatened by meaninglessness. Finally, the</page><page sequence="11">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 247 'word' of God corrects falsifications which have been introduced into the human interpretations of life's meaning by reason of man's effort to explain history from the standpoint of himself as its center. In that sense the word of revelation stands in contradiction to human culture and is 'foolishness' to the wise. But precisely because it is such foolishness, transcending human wisdom, it becomes, once accepted, the basis for a satisfactory total explana- tion of life. It becomes truly wisdom. Revelation does not remain in con- tradiction to human culture and human knowledge. By completing the in- completeness, clarifying the obscurities and correcting the falsifications of human knowledge it becomes true wisdom to 'them that are called.' 14 In this lengthy passage we see the significance of Christ. To any culture which takes history seriously, a Christ is expected; 15 but the inadequacies of human reason are such that even with superhistory revealed in the purity of Christ, man falters in his understanding of this significant event. Indeed, man fails to understand that Christ is actually that to which history directs attention, and a Christ is denied, treated as a conundrum, and crucified. A Christ is expected, but he is rejected, and only as the centuries wear on is man gradually able to see in that cataclysmic event its great meaning and importance. At this point Niebuhr assembles another group of forceful empirical data. Since the advent of Christ, there have been present in the realm of history empirical facts which were miss- ing before he appeared. This experiential data belong on a different level from facts with which we have been dealing, for these are not common property in the same sense. They are part of the experience only of that portion of mankind who ac- cept Christ as a revelation of God. Christ becomes true wis- dom to members of the inner circle of believers. For this reason we have separated the following empirical data which Niebuhr employs in the dual role of revealing the nature of super-history and of justifying committal to Christ. In addi- tion to completing history's incompleteness, correcting falsi- fications of human interpretations, clarifying obscurities and becoming true wisdom to believers, Christ has done two things which, to be sure, cannot be separated from these elements just mentioned. He has (1) symbolized the divine nature of God in history through his sacrificial love upon the Cross, and (2) 1" Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 67. 16 Ibid., p. 4.</page><page sequence="12">248 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW opened a new channel of power in which God can work upon the man who accepts Christ. (1) Under this category of sacrificial love, Niebuhr subsumes much which forces one to be more certain than ever with regard to the existence of super-history. Christ reveals the structure of super-history and dictates to man the norm by which he shall live, without regard to the impossibility of fulfilling the norm within history. Christ reveals that God is not far removed, that God is actively involved in the historical process, and against this revelation of God's nature, Christ shows man to be a sinner. Man can strive within history but fails to live ac- cording to sacrificial love. Mutual love is the highest level which history can attain. It is left for super-history to justify fully the divine 'agape.' Man, after Christ, becomes more con- vinced as to his own paradoxical and anomalous situation as a citizen of two realms of being. The agape, the sacrificial love, which is for Christian faith revealed upon the Cross, has its primary justification in an 'essential reality' which tran- scends the realities of history, namely, the character of God. It does not ex- pect an immediate or historical validation but looks towards some ultimate consummation of life and history.... (But there are) validations of agape in actual history, insofar as concern for the other actually elicits a reciprocal response.1" In revealing the nature of God, Christ with his sacrificial Cross emphasizes the truth of what has been gathered from other facts, that the conflicts of history cannot be resolved apart from the level of super-history. Christ furnishes additional proof that the destiny of man transcends history, that only in God can man find a surcease from his incompleteness. The divine 'agape' promises that there is a final supremacy of love over the forces of egoism which defy the demands of super-history. The fact that this revelation of the nature of God went down in de- feat amid the conflicting jealousies of historical interests fur- nishes evidence of the divine derivation of this Christian Cross. Had the Christ been successful in the clash of historical in- terests, it would then have been plain that here was but another side of human history which conquered in the clash of human 16 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 96.</page><page sequence="13">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 249 rivalries. But in the apparent defeat, the divine 'agape' dem- onstrates the paradoxical love of God which is not the love of man and which can be revealed within history only by a disavowal of power." "The Cross symbolizes the perfection of 'agape' which transcends all particular norms of justice and mutuality in history." 18 "The final justification for the way of 'agape' in the New Testament is never found in history." 19 To declare, as Jesus does, that the Messiah, the representative of God, must suffer, is to make vicarious suffering the final revelation of meaning in history. But it is the vicarious suffering of the representative of God, and not of some force in history, which finally clarifies the obscurities of history and disclpses the sovereignty of God over hiptory.20 It is impossible to symbolize the divine goodness in history in any other way than by complete powerlessness, or rather by a consistent refusal to use power in the rivalries of history.21 We find Niebuhr referring again and again to this divine love in the Cross of Christ, remarking time after time that in this act of God history is clearly set over against super-history and shown its divine foundation. The perfection of 'agape' as symbolized in the Cross can neither be simply reduced to the limits of history, nor yet dismissed as irrelevant because it transcends history. It transcends history as history transcends itself. It is the final norm of a human nature which has no final norm in history because it is not completely contained in history.22 In this historical appearance of Christ and in his sacrificial death upon the Cross, super-history is revealed both in its nature and as a fact. Vicarious suffering is the final revelation of meaning in history, and it is the vicarious suffering of God. To be sure, all that Niebuhr says with regard to this divine love can be said only as and by one who has accepted Christ as a final revelation of God. To the rest of men, Christ, as an historical person who went down to miserable defeat in an ap- parent act of sacrificial love, is a matter of historical fact. But to the believer the divine revelation of sacrificial love in the Cross becomes related to mutual human love as the counter- part of the relationship between super-history and history. 17 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 74.

Niebuhr finds a power present in history, a power which Chris- tians call 'grace,' which issues into individual lives bringing an electrifying release of energy to the pent-up apathy of an iso- lated personality shut within selfish interests. The Christian experience of the new life is an experience of a new selfhood. The new self is more truly a real self because the vicious circle of self-centred- ness has been broken. The self lives in and for others, in the general orienta- tion of loyalty to, and love of, God; who alone can do justice to the freedom of the self over all partial interests and values. This new self is the real self; for the self is infinitely self-transcendent; and any premature centring of it- self around its own interests, individually or collectively, destroys and cor- rupts its freedom.23 The power which lifts the individual out of his preoccupation with the interests of group or race functions further to direct his eyes to the genuine source of all life, super-history. As such, this power called 'grace' is another empirical fact - but only to the believer, as in the case of sacrificial love. This power, however, which issues into the Christian selfhood, completes the characterization of super-history, for we see here the great activity of God on the level of the historical struggle. This 'grace' further completes the incompleteness of history's anom- alous situation, for in this power of God upon the believer one sees the wisdom and truth in Christ with an impact which justifies the believer in his leap of faith. This activity of God which is included in the Christian idea of 'grace' means power, wisdom, and truth. Through 'grace' God completes what man cannot complete, gives man new meaning, new life, new ca- pacity to win over the blocking influence which history exerts upon his growth. The Christian gospel ... enters the world with the proclamation that in Christ both 'wisdom' and 'power' are available to man; which is to say that not only has the true meaning of life been disclosed but also that resources have been made availjable to fulfill that meaning.24 Grace represents on the one hand the mercy and forgiveness of God by which He completes what man cannot complete and overcomes the sinful elements in all of man's achievements. Grace is the power of God over man. 23 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 110. 24 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 98.</page><page sequence="15">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 251 Grace is on the other hand the power of God in man; it represents an accession of resources, which man does not have of himself, enabling him to become what he truly ought to be.25 This power of 'grace,' in fact, raises the believer to a new level of selfhood, the genuine level in which man reaches his true character. The real self has a height of spiritual freedom which reaches beyond race and nation and which is closer to the eternal than the more earthbound col- lective entities of man's history. Such demonic possession therefore destroys and blunts the real self (i.e. intense nationalisms) and reduces it to the dimen- sions of nature.26 And in raising man above the conflicts and destructions of historical existence, this new power of God in the believer brings a new outlook upon life, enables man to live upon a new basis, brings a new meaning and thrill to life. "Once faith is induced, it becomes truly the wisdom which makes 'sense' out of a life and history which would otherwise remain senseless." 27 This 'grace' gives one a new vantage point above history, from which to view the conflicts in a new light. "From such a vantage point history is meaningful, even if it should be im- possible to discern any unity in its continuing conflicts." 28 Recapitulation. We have outlined very briefly Niebuhr's in- terpretation of history. He admits presuppositions with regard to the finality of Christ, a God who suffers and judges the human enterprise, and a God both immanent in and transcend- ent over the realm of history. With these presuppositions he goes on to gather data from history which point to the existence and nature of super-history. It is entirely possible that he ac- cepts this realm of eternity as a presupposition, but we have chosen to avoid this issue and to assemble the empirical data as our author has done, allowing him to build the structure of super-history and to see its significance over and beyond the historical flux. The important categories in which Niebuhr seems to assemble this experiential data for super-history all testify to the pull of the transcendent upon man. They dem- onstrate how man is gripped by eternity. The empirical facts 26 Ibid., p. 98. 26 Ibid., p. 111. 27 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 206. 28 Ibid., p. 307.</page><page sequence="16">252 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW are gathered from wide areas of experience; we have grouped them under divisions such as man's fear of death and of what is beyond, man's consciousness of irreconcilable conflict and recurring frustration within history, man's ability to realize his own finiteness, his ability to take a little of the past with a little of the future and to hold these in a 'partial simultaneity,' and man's sense of failure to attain the requirements which life places upon him. All of these we have described as facts of experience to which Niebuhr gives his Christian interpreta- tion, showing how they cause one to look from the incomplete- ness of history to Christ and to see some external basis for what meaning history conveys. After building such a case for the existence of super-history, Niebuhr shows Christ to be the key to the meaning of history in two major ways, (1) that he reveals the nature of God as sacrificial love, and (2) that he opens a new channel of power between God and man which the Christian calls 'grace,' a channel bringing power, wisdom, and knowledge to the believer. These two major results of the coming of Christ with his revela- tion of God serve to verify further the existence of super-history and to acquaint us with the nature of this non-spatial, non- temporal reality. Christ reveals that which does not make sense from a purely human point of view. Although a Christ is expected, he refutes the expectation while he fulfills it, lead- ing us to think that there must be another reality from which this revelation of God issues. The sacrificial love which Christ reveals is defeated in the strife of historical interests, but it is, nevertheless, the norm by which God judges the human enter- prise; it is a command to live as a citizen of super-history with- out regard to the apparent defeat and irreconcilable conflict in which such commitment involves one. It will be helpful to remind ourselves in this summary state- ment that Niebuhr is not exceptionally clear in his treatment of questions which immediately arise with regard to super- history. One might like to know with more detail the nature of this eternity; such a desire for intellectual clarity is not met by Niebuhr. We might say that his interest is mainly a practi- cal one of depicting the conditions of salvation, and if we ask</page><page sequence="17">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 253 him for more definite descriptions of eternity, we get no reply. It is the opinion of the present writer, however, that Niebuhr has the general view of absolute idealism with regard to eter- nity. In the treatment which faces the matter most adequately, he couples eternity with the 'total simultaneity' of the divine mind. Eternity stands over time on the one hand and at the end of time on the other. It stands over time in the sense that it is the ultimate source and power of all derived and dependent existence. It is not a separate order of existence; for this reason the traditional connotation of the concept, 'supernatural,' is erroneous. The eternal is the ground and source of the temporal. The divine consciousness gives meaning to the mere succession of natural events by comprehending them simultaneously, even as human consciousness gives meaning to segments of natural sequence by comprehending them simul- taneously in memory and foresight.29 But it is yet not clear wherein his view differs from any reputa- ble supernaturalistic view of eternity. Only the innocent and illiterate can in our day be said to think of a many-storied uni- verse with eternity occupying a separate order of existence. Any credited supernaturalist would deny such naivete. It is probably close to the truth if we should merely say that Niebuhr accepts the concept of eternity along with some other ideas of the Christian tradition, such as the resurrection, eschatology, etc., without stopping to inquire into the difficul- ties involved or to attempt to answer the problems which im- mediately arise. His treatment of the resurrection is especially open to such a claim; for there is no more than a blurred picture of this important orthodox position. Due to his overwhelming interest in practical matters of sin and salvation, Niebuhr seems to accept such ideas uncritically. He esteems the religious view of scripture and wants to hold on to whatever of it that he can. In the matter of eternity the issue is one of recognizing the de- mand for a standpoint aloof from the relativism of every point in cultural history, a point on which to stand in reviewing the passing parade. If Niebuhr disavows the cognomen 'super- naturalist,' we must, on the other hand, insist upon classifying him in such a category. The unsavory connotations which are 29 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 299.</page><page sequence="18">254 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW coming to be associated with the supernaturalist position can only be avoided by altering the position itself. Testing the hypothesis. We have already had occasion to ob- serve that the Christian interpretation of history which Niebuhr gives purports to be self-justifying. He has given a philosophy of history based upon scripture. He has found in Christ the hope and fulfillment, the promise and resolution, of the his- torical meanderings in which mankind is emerged. He makes it clear - indeed we should say that this is his point of greatest emphasis - that to the believer Christ brings the good news of salvation. There is no experience which points irrefutably to the particular divine ground and end of history which Christian faith discerns in Christ and the Cross. In the realm of ethics as in the realm of truth, the revelation of Christ is foolishness, in the sense that experience does not lead us to expect or an- ticipate the answer which it makes to the ethical problem. But it is 'wisdom to them that are called' in the sense that, once accepted, it becomes an ade- quate principle for interpreting the ethical problem in history. It is the only principle of interpretation which does justice to the two factors in the human situation: man's involvement in natural process, including the imperative character of his natural impulse of survival; and his transcendence over natural process, including his uneasy conscience over the fact that the sur- vival impulse should play so dominant a role in all his ethical calculations."? History validates the Christian solution to the anomalous pre- dicament of mankind. Accepted on faith, Christ and his reve- lation become the truth for the believer, illumining events and being in turn validated by experience.3" An accession of power, furthermore, issues into the life of the believer; the individual is lifted above the egoistic frustrations in which history is in- volved and becomes a channel through which the resources of super-history may find expression. Accept Christ and super- history lays hold upon you and you experience salvation as an accession of the power of God. The individual who gives his whole being to Christ, accepting the revelation of God which is in Christ, undergoes certain definite experiences which vali- date the whole structure of the Christian hypothesis. We agree that the word 'hypothesis' is one which hardly fits the situa- 30 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 97. 31 Ibid., p. 63.</page><page sequence="19">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 255 tion, for there is none of the element of probability in the mind of one who accepts Christ in the manner described. On the other, the experiences to which the Christian can point vali- date his belief in Christ and in this sense we employ the term. The self is shattered whenever it is confronted by the power and holiness of God and becomes genuinely conscious of the real source and centre of all life. In Christian faith Christ mediates the confrontation of the self by God; for it is in Christ that the vague sense of the divine, and human life never loses this, is crystallized into a revelation of a divine mercy and judgment. In that revelation, fear of judgment and hope of mercy are so mingled that despair induces repentance and repentance hope.32 To such an individual, the Christian faith in Christ is self- justifying. For Niebuhr this offers evidence that the fruits of his philosophy of history, from a pragmatic standpoint of noting the consequences in terms of human behavior, validate the entire structure which he has created. PART II A FEW CRITICAL REMARKS It will be necessary to introduce in this category of critical remarks only a very small portion of what might be said. We shall not claim for these remarks, therefore, a complete evalua- tion of Niebuhr's philosophy of history. For there enter here problems which would break the bounds of our present task. There is, for example, the entire question of the relationship between Niebuhr's interpretation and the modern treatment of scripture. It will be clear to one acquainted with varieties of Biblical criticism that most of their discoveries are entirely neglected by our author. There seems to be no effort to dis- tinguish in the scriptures the reliable from the less reliable, no attempt to use the results of 'higher' and 'lower' criticism as a means for deriving the core of early Christian teaching and be- lief. But to criticize Niebuhr from this point of view would be a task in itself. We select, therefore, several elements of our author's inter- 32 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 109.</page><page sequence="20">256 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW pretation of history and subject them to analysis and criticism. We shall group our remarks under three main headings, (1) Nie- buhr and 'ideology,' (2) man's transcendence, and (3) the author's obscurantism, his love for paradox, his irrationalism. (1) It is apparent to the present writer that Niebuhr is acutely aware of the pitfalls which beset one who attempts to absolutize his views; he has investigated much of the literature on the subject, is acquainted with the work of Mannheim, scorns the blind 'ideology' of the Marxian interpretation of history, has surveyed the new science of Sociology of Knowl- edge. Yet, despite this awareness of danger, Niebuhr walks into the very trap which he has carefully surveyed. He has a good case against the claim of finality which men invariably make for their finite perspectives. They hide the taint of in- terest and passion which infects their knowledge; they deny the finiteness of their view. But this lash against 'ideologies' can be turned on Niebuhr with equal force. To be sure, he thinks to avoid this predicament which has ensnared others: The Christian answer to the problem of ideological taint in our knowledge is the apprehension of the truth 'in Christ.' This is a truth about life and history which fulfills what is valid and negates what is sinful in our knowl- edge of the truth. It is possible to accept this truth despite, and because of, its contradiction of all sinful truth. By such acceptance the believer is lifted in principle above the egoistic corruptions of the truth in history.33 The point at issue is another on which Niebuhr, himself, is not very certain, for in another place he affirms that even such grace as is manifested in Christian life does not lift men above the finiteness of the mind nor yet save them from the sin of claiming to have transcended it.34 It might be held in this con- text that Niebuhr is probably the best example of this state- ment that Christian grace does not save men from making such grandiose claims. It is odd, indeed, how he deals with this problem of 'ideology.' He feels the evil of claiming Biblical authority, too, in absolutizing one's views: The certain conviction of the faithful that the Bible gave them the final truth, transcending all finite perspectives and all sinful corruptions, thus 33 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 215. 34 Ibid., p. 219.</page><page sequence="21">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 257 contributed to individual spiritual arrogance, no less intolerable than the collective arrogance of the older church. This pride expressed itself despite the fact that contrary interpretations of scripture, against which the arrogance was directed, contradicted the pretension of an absolutely valid interpreta- tion.35 Further, our author lashes out against making the Bible stand behind other phases of cultural interpretation. When the Bible becomes an authoritative compendium of social, economic, political and scientific knowledge, it is used as a vehicle of the sinful sancti- fication of relative standards of knowledge and virtue which happen to be enshrined in a religious canon."' A modern scientific viewpoint of scripture would make it possi- ble to retort that Niebuhr is using the Bible in a manner for which it was never intended and is guilty along with these whom he here condemns. It is certain that the Bible was never meant to teach a philosophy of history. It may be interesting to list some of Niebuhr's paradoxical remarks relative to the present discussion of 'ideology.' No elaboration of philosophy or science can carry us beyond the truth which is contained in the gospel."' All known facts of history verify the interpretation of human destiny im- plied in New Testament eschatology.38 The Biblical symbols cannot be taken literally because it is not possible for finite minds to comprehend that which transcends and fulfills history. The finite mind can only use symbols and pointers of the character of the eternal.39 Rightly conceived, Scriptural authority is meant merely to guard the truth of the Gospel in which all truth is fulfilled and all corruptions of truth are negated. This authority is Scriptural in the sense that the Bible con- tains the history, and the culpmination in Christ, of that 'Heilsgeschichte' in which the whole human enterprise becomes fully conscious of its limits, of its transgressions of those limits, and of the divine answer to its problems.40 Statements such as these cause one to wonder how to deal with Niebuhr. He realizes the pitfalls of claiming finality for one's view; he deprecates any attempt to bolster one's views in a final manner even upon Scriptural authority. One wonders what to think of a man who seems to realize the mistakes of all manner of other absolutisms and then leaps in the precise di- 35 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 229. 36 Ibid., p. 152. 37 Ibid., p. 208. 38 Ibid., p. 319. 39 Ibid., p. 289. 40 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 152.</page><page sequence="22">258 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW rection in which he has seen great danger. Niebuhr appears to find in the Reformation and its emphasis upon 'justification by faith' a lifesaver on which he might float his own interpretation. This doctrine which appears so irrelevant to modern men. . . represents the final renunciation in the heart of Christianity of the human effort to com- plete life and history, whether with or without divine grace.41 The source of the confusion here may be the lack of any clear understanding of faith: Niebuhr seems to rob the concept of any content whatever, and yet he fills it in other places with his own particular interpretation of history. His ambition is to avoid the relativisms of every cultural setting with its special interests, problems, and meanings, and he thinks to accomplish this ambition by a queer treatment of an obscure faith. It must be emphasized that this final revelation of the divine sovereignty over life and this final disclosure of the meaning of life in terms of its depend- ence upon the divine judgment and mercy is not simply some truth of history which is comprehended by reason, to be added to the sum total of human knowledge. It must be constantly apprehended inwardly by faith, because it is a truth which transcends the human situation in each individual just as it transcended the total cultural situation historically.42 We should be tempted to deny that this scriptural event of Christ transcended either the human or cultural situation, historically. And it is very difficult to apprehend what seems to be mere emptiness - if this is what 'faith' means in the above passage. We believe that it would be more worthwhile and certainly more intelligible for Niebuhr to admit that his interpretation, too, of the Biblical narrative is another view of this crucial his- torical event which has meant many things to many people. It seems clear that nothing is to be gained, henceforth, by claiming finality for one's interpretation, however sanctified it might be by the Holy Spirit. We believe, too, that historical perspec- tives are not all of one piece, that distinctions need to be made, that whereas there is no point of view which can claim finality, there are some which account better for the facts than do others. Where Niebuhr fails to distinguish between the more and the 41 Ibid., p. 148. 42 Ibid., p. 57.</page><page sequence="23">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 259 less of partial views, it seems that he has failed to see an im- portant distinction. The role of the person is now recognized in all knowledge, and truth of all sorts cannot parade abroad without the mark of its proclaimer. The human element can- not be eliminated in knowledge; we must give up the attempt to attain some transcendent point in the universe from which to view the human panorama; we must recognize that the taint of human interest and passion is eliminated, if only partially, by a close sifting of evidence in a public investigation. From different directions peculiar biases converge upon various cul- tural data; we can check out the element of bias to an ever- increasing extent. But we renounce any ambition to divest human knowledge of its human element of interest and passion, for it is incredible that any relevant human creed could be freed from such an anthropomorphic thread. (2) With regard to man's transcendence, it is clear that Niebuhr has a very restricted view of nature. If one adheres to a modern naturalism, holding values, ideals, purposes, am- bitions, and other elevating aspects of human behavior to be a part of the natural scene of spatial and temporal forces, one will be loath to attribute to man some transcending power by which he participates in another realm of being. We believe that it is possible to explain most of the empirical data em- ployed by Niebuhr without resorting to a reality outside of space and time. The next section will be the occasion for this task. At this time we might mention that language, alone, seems to offer a better explanation for some elements of man's tran- scendence than does the super-history which Niebuhr employs. Language enables man to enter the experience of the past, to transcend the experience of any moment by holding a bit of the past and some of the future in a present 'partial simul- taneity.' The present is transcended, to be sure, but this is far from catapulting man beyond the scope of time and space. Language enables civilization to cumulate meaning and to carry its past along with it. But language is a natural phenom- enon and can be explained without recourse to super-history. Likewise, the transcendence which Niebuhr infers from man's</page><page sequence="24">260 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW fear of death seems to exhibit a falsification of empirical data. Man's fear of death would seem to be more of a dread or un- willingness felt at the aspect of breaking ties of fellowship and love among which he finds his reason for living. It is an un- willingness to part company with the social relationships which have come to focus in him to make him all that he is or hopes to be. An inarticulate unwillingness to die may, after all, ex- press man's gratitude for the social environment. It is doubt- ful if man would fear death in any other sense in a culture which displayed an utter absence of ideas of Judgment in a life beyond the grave. It may also be said that death is actu- ally welcomed by large numbers of humanity. To some life offers little to cause them to wish to keep alive the spark of life. Death is a blessing to many of the underprivileged. It will be more apparent in our next chapter how Niebuhr's appeal to the transcendent is not the only possible interpreta- tion of the facts which he offers. (3) The obscurantism of our author might provide a complete study of its own. His love for paradox can be seen at work ele- vating absurdities to some more worthy level. Human reason suffers in this treatment, and the force of Niebuhr's entire work is weakened. For if human reason at once provides the only means of communicating meaning and on the other hand can- not be trusted, we are left in a blind alley, indeed. Of course, Niebuhr has no intention of destroying the credibility of reason any farther than is necessary to discredit opposing views. He conveys meaning and makes tremendous statements. The Christian faith knows it to be impossible for man or for any of man's historical achievements to transcend the unity and tension between the natural and the eternal ip human existence.43 The limit which is applied to reason seems to be purely arbi- trary. It is not possible to give a fuller or more plausible account of what is im- plied in the Christian hope for the fulfillment of life; and it is well to remem- ber that the conditions of finiteness make a more explicit definition of the consummation impossible.44 43 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 296. 44 Ibid., p. 98.</page><page sequence="25">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 261 Just enough reason - yet only enough to bring the meaning which our author intends to convey. A complete criticism of Niebuhr's philosophy of history would take us farther afield than we are prepared to go within the limits of this paper. We shall turn, then, to our remaining task, that of grounding an entirely different interpretation of history upon the same empirical facts which we have observed in Niebuhr's appeal to experience. PART III A NATURALISTIC INTERPRETATION Our present undertaking is not an ambitious one. We shall do no more than indicate the general direction in which a naturalistic interpretation of history would be developed. We shall confine our remarks mainly to three main features of the philosophy of history which we have been discussing. The most important results which Niebuhr has accomplished can be grouped under three heads: (1) He has accounted for the progressive development of meaning in history. (2) He has struggled with the evidence for a 'bounce-back' in history, a survival of meaning in the midst of defeat, an emergence of the new from the ashes of the old. (3) He faces the problem of sacrificial love and its apparent frustrations in history, tracing it to a divine 'agape' which issues from super-history. The solution of these great problems of history Niebuhr finds in his treatment of super-history. We have seen that eternity provides the explanation for the progressive development of meaning in history and for the survival of meaning 'amid ap- parent defeat. History, because of what issues forth from super-history, is both increasingly meaningful and creative. What justifies our faith in history is super-history. Niebuhr hopes to achieve a standpoint which is not engulfed within the particular cultural situation with its particular bias, prejudice, and passion. Eternity is the device for thus extricating his philosophy from the cultural flux. We have inferred that he</page><page sequence="26">262 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW probably views this realm of eternity in the manner of Absolute Idealism as a cosmic mind which holds all the past and all the future in a 'total simultaneity.' Recourse to a cosmic mind cannot be had in a naturalistic interpretation of history. We cannot investigate or operate ex- perimentally with the cosmic whole or with any cosmic con- sciousness; the concept transcends experience both in particular and in general; we renounce an attempt to bring into discus- sion what can not, in the nature of the case, be open to investi- gation. It is dubious if the universe is one harmonious whole or if there is a cosmic consciousness which holds all in a simul- taneous present. And it is another problem as to whether this cosmic mind would make any difference to the individual human being.' The analogy between this cosmic mind and the mind which we experience is not striking, to say the least. Another privilege which we renounce is that of having re- course to an esoteric brand of knowledge not open to all human minds. All knowledge, for naturalism, is of events temporally and spatially related. Revelation as a form of knowledge is rejected. We know God only by the growth of meaning which we experience. Thus we see two particularly fundamental points of variance between the Niebuhr interpretation and one open to natural- ism. We confine all that is, all causal efficacy, to time and space and further affirm that all such efficacy is in the form of struc- tured energy in motion. A non-temporal, non-spatial, non- material activity which Niebuhr interprets super-history to be is rejected. And our method of investigating this causal ef- ficacy is confined to the public observance of relationship be- tween events. With these prefacing remarks we shall turn to our naturalistic interpretation of the empirical data which we found in Niebuhr. A Correlate to Niebuhr's Super-history. It is a matter open to public investigation that whatever have been the individual fates of nations and cultural epochs, there has been a continu- ing, though spasmodic and faltering, development of meaning, a progressive growth of mind, a widening of mental horizons in a more appreciable world. Whatever has been the fate of</page><page sequence="27">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 263 early empires, out of every period of threatened annihilation there has issued an ever-increasing community of minds; the world has become progressively more appreciable to a wider and growing community of persons. The narrow interests of tribal groups, with the accompanying rigidity of life within the demands of traditional behavior, have gradually enlarged to the community of minds which we know today; there are few places on the globe which do not participate widely in the rest of hu- man living. Interests of all peoples are rapidly coming to inter- penetrate. Although there have been epochs of decline in this respect, some with disastrous results, the larger scope of his- torical events shows a direction toward a larger and larger com- munity of minds and interpenetration of interests. It is the conviction of naturalism, as we understand it here, that there is a particular structure of events running the entire course of this human history which carries the growth of mean- ing forward into this widening interpenetration of interests to create a more appreciable world and minds more sensitive to it. The creation of this sensitive community of minds in a wider, more appreciable world is the work of that activity which we call God. Far from being the invasion of the temporal from super-history, this structure of activity is an observable reality operating upon all of us and in all of us in the direction just mentioned. It operates in a creative r6le, bringing man new perspectives, creating the consequent enlarged mind, causing the world to become more determinate, and conveying this enlarged participation of interests into a wider community of minds. Wherever we are able to point to this process at work in history, we have what we may describe as a correlate to Niebuhr's super-history. It is a striking analogy that we find in the work of this struc- ture of creative interaction and growth of mind the same sort of transcending effects to which Niebuhr has pointed as data proving the presence of super-history. It can be said that man is becoming increasingly transcendent over the causal nexus of natural phenomena, that the racial history of man has been a gradual increase in this transcendence over the moment. The 'pull of the transcendent' is seen in a new light.</page><page sequence="28">264 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Perhaps the most striking mode of activity in which this transcendence has been achieved is through the means of linguistic signs. Increasingly man is able to participate in the interests of others because he is able to share the means of com- municating these interests. Of course this structure of crea- tivity which we correlate with Niebuhr's super-history is far more than language; language is but one of the means by which it accomplishes the wider growth of mind. Attentive behavior, appreciative observance, and expressive activity all are in- volved on the human side. One can readily see how crucial all of these have been in enabling man, as Niebuhr says, to look behind and before, to hold in the present a little of the past with a little of the future, to achieve a freedom from natural phenomena which confine the rest of the animal kingdom. We might say that man, insofar as he participates in this structure of widening horizons, insofar as he is able to include himself within the circle of this enlarged community of minds, is thereby able to participate in a wider range of the appreciable world and to transcend the demands of the present moment accordingly. With the appearance of the events which marked the begin- ning of the Christian era, we note increasingly the possibilities for the growth of mind in a larger and more determinate world. For with these epoch-making and revolutionary events there has been made historically continuous a manner of life whereby God and man are able to get together in such a way that God can create the greater good in the life of man without destroy- ing the meaning and worth of the individual men through whom he works. With the advent of Christianity, there ap- peared in the world a way of living which so transforms those who participate in it that they hold all goals and ambitions subject to the working of this creativity which we call God. With this manner of living, man learns to go through experi- ences of destruction and suffering, learns to give up what other men would die fighting for, learns to hold all he is or has or ever hopes to be subject to the working of this creativity or growth of mind which he can actually observe at work about him. Man becomes committed to this source of all good and orients his life about it; he finds that he can undergo experiences</page><page sequence="29">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 265 of great havoc and remain alert to new values present in even the most revolutionizing change. In such ways, and in un- mentioned others, man learns to live the crucified life; he uni- fies his personality into a readiness to undergo whatever trans- formation may be involved in the organization of either his own person or of society about him, in order to assimilate perspec- tives and participate in the larger community which is being created. This is the way of the crucified life. It has increased the possibility of God and man working together without the destroying effects upon human personality. It is a way of life which can be experimentally shown to accomplish all that we claim for it; as it can likewise be demonstrated that it entered history out of the interrelated events which shook the old world at the beginning of the present era. Where Niebuhr points to the revelation of God which was in Christ and in the Cross 'which towers over time' and testifies to the direct and cataclysmic action of the hand of eternity upon history, we point to the working of this historically con- tinuous manner of life which issued out of the early Christian environment. Where Niebuhr speaks of a new knowledge which is revealed in this revelation of Christ, we disaffirm any new knowledge derived from a non-temporal, non-spatial order, and we point to a structure of interrelated events which we call creativity at work in the world. We are able to demonstrate experimentally that this way of life which we term the 'crucified life' entered history at that point mentioned and enabled God and man to work together in the way we have described. In this we find the significance of the Cross. We are able to find a mass of evidence in Niebuhr which lends itself to this naturalistic interpretation of history. The preservation of cultures and civilizations is frequently possible only as individuals disregard their own success and failure and refuse to inquire too scrupulously into the possibilities or probabilities of maintaining their own life in a given course of action. Thus effective collective historical action depends to a considerable degree upon the individual's contempt for, or indifference to, his own fate; an indifference which is possible only if the individual possesses an implicit or explicit faith in a dimension of existence which is deeper and higher than physical life.45 45 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 89.</page><page sequence="30">266 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW This is precisely the situation as regards the relationship be- tween man and that structure of creativity which we have just surveyed. But the orientation of the man is toward a different reality, for whereas Niebuhr is referring to the relevance of sacrificial love in a way which has no critical object deserving of such love, we have suggested that man is able to hold his goals, ambitions, all that he has, subject to that reality which is observed at work creating the growth of meaning in a more appreciable world. In other instances the phraseology of Niebuhr is relevant to our own interpretation of history. All things in history move towards both fulfillment and dissolution, towards the fuller embodiment of their essential character and towards death.46 Is this not precisely the case with this on-going process of crea- tivity which destroys the old and from the ashes brings the new into being? The lesser good is ever being destroyed to make way for the greater good - this is the condition of creation. Though one age may have to reclaim what previous ages have known and forgotten, history obviously moves towards more inclusive ends, towards more complex human relations, towards the technical enhancement of human powers and the cumulation of knowledge.... But ... the spiritual hatred and the lethal effectiveness of 'civilized' conflicts, compared with tribal warfare or battles in the animal world, are one of many examples of the new evil which arises on a new level of maturity.47 Niebuhr employs such statements to affirm his pessimism at man's ability to extricate himself from the tragic possibilities of culture. We agree that man cannot extricate himself; but we point to the growing community of minds which Niebuhr describes; we point to this enlarged sharing of experience and find in this situation undeveloped possibilities for man's emerg- ing some day from this new ferocity which cannot now be gain- said, emerging to participation in the community of minds which God has fashioned. The world has grown smaller and with this wider reach of individual and group into the experi- ences of other peoples there follows new power over the lives 4" Ibid., p. 287. 47 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 315.</page><page sequence="31">NIEBUHR'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 267 of others; but that wars should result from this condition is not an irrevocable condition nor cause to forego our trust in this process (of creativity) which is working through us creat- ing the larger interpenetration of minds. For interests are yet alien and isolated; perhaps they will always be so; but were men to surrender themselves to the working of this creativity, were men to orient their lives toward this activity which we have surveyed at work in history, wars should cease and fe- rocity be put under control. If we turn our attention from the larger scope of history to the individual lives of men who place themselves under the control of this structure of creative interaction, we find phe- nomena similar to that which Niebuhr describes under the con- cept 'grace.' In somewhat the manner we have noted in that author, we, too, find that our hypothesis of history is self- justifying in the sense that one who puts himself under its control experiences a new electrifying influx of power as if from outside himself. The Christian experience of the new life is an experience of a new selfhood. The new self is more truly a real self because the vicipus circle of self-centred- ness has been broken. The self lives in and for others, in the general orienta- tion of loyalty to, and love of, God; who alone can do justice to the freedom of the self over all partial interests and values. This new self is the real self; for the self is infinitely self-transcendent; and any premature centring of it- self around its own interests, individually or collectively, destroys and cor- rupts its freedom.48 To this we agree whole-heartedly; and we pause to point out the confusion in Niebuhr's mind with regard to the possibili- ties of man's development. Rarely does he reveal a hope that man might be 'infinitely self-transcendent' as he affirms here. But we agree with what he says and call attention to the re- markable manner in which this passage lends itself to that giving of one's self into the control of creativity which we have been discussing. Conclusion. In some such brief manner would a naturalist interpret the empirical data which Niebuhr employs to bolster belief in eternity. Whereas our author finds the dimensions of 48 Niebuhr, op. cit., p. 110.</page><page sequence="32">268 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW life and the progressive development of historical meanings resolved in a non-spatial, non-temporal realm of eternity or super-history, we find the solution in our treatment of the creativity which releases man from limited perspectives and enables him to participate in a developing structure of mean- ings which go forward in a cumulative fashion to enlarge the scope of man's experience and to provide a reliable basis for communication of interests.</page></plain_text>
