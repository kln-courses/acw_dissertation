<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthony Giddens, A Contemporary Critique of Historical Materialism. Volume 1: Power , Property and the State , London: Macmillan, 1981, ix + 294pp, £12.95 (£4.95 paperback). Anthony Giddens has written a rich, diffuse book that attempts several tasks at once. One is to purge historical materialism of functionalist and evolutionist elements. This is the least original part of his critique; as one might expect, it involves playing off the Grundrisse against textbook Marxism. (Divergent paths of develop- ment from tribal society versus the 'stages' of the Preface y discontinuity between capitalist and precapitalist society versus necessary emergence of one from the other, etc.) It is perhaps a pity that G. A. Cohen's recent defence of just these aspects of Marxism, though mentioned, is not rebutted: to that extent the critique is less contemporary than it might have been. A second task is to reinterpret historical materialism from the standpoint of the 'theory of structuration' developed in Giddens' earlier books (and conveniently summarized here).</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 605 Ontological rather than explanatory, this is more a set of guiding assumptions for theorizing than a theory in the full sense. As such it seeks to save and reconcile what is valid in the action approach and in structural analysis, while avoiding the extremes of hermeneutic sub- jectivism and misplaced scientificity. It is therefore (although Giddens seems slightly equivocal on this) as much opposed to humanistic readings of historical materialism, based on the philosophical anthropology of the young Marx, as to positivistic ones. In favour of this middle road it can be said, first, that it avoids the vague invocations of 'dialectic' so commonly resorted to for these purposes; and secondly, that if social science benefits from plausible philosophical assumptions about the nature of its subject-matter, then an ontology of the social is certainly a more appropriate starting-point than biological analogy of anthropomorphic historicism. I shall suggest below, however, that Giddens' particular ontology differs from Marx's in a way that prejudges the outcome of his critique. In th is volume Giddens focuses principally on the social structuration of time and space. Adapting Heideggerian perspectives, he intro- duces the concept of 'time-space distanciation' for the ways in which different kinds of society 'intermingle presence and absence'. This allows him to synthesize a number of hitherto separate themes. Weberian 'tradition' is seen as super- seded, in the West, by an 'everyday life' derived from Lefebvre as well as Schutz; a number of interesting ideas are imported from social geography; the notion of 'social storage capacity' leads to a Mumfordian emphasis on the city as 'power-container', which in turn is linked with a disquisition on 'surveillance' inspired by Foucault; nationalism is explained, with a dash of Freudianism and mass-society theory, by the submergence of the city-countryside division in the 'created environment' of modern urbanized living-space which accompanies the shift from city to nation-state as power-container, provoking crises of 'ontological insecurity'; Wallerstein's world-system theory, and social fault-lines along the 'time-space edges' of 'world time' are invoked to show the interweaving of exogenous and endogenous effects in social change. This and much else is brought together with considerable brilliance, dexterity and erudition, but (perhaps unavoidably, in a single book) with abbreviated and sometimes per- functory argument. This reviewer is left unsure how far the result is a real synthesis of socio- historical explanations, and how far a digestive apparatus for assimilating an impressively vast quantity of reading-matter. Be that as it may, these disparate topics are all brought to bear on historical materialism, in three main ways. First, they supply some of its notorious deficiencies (urbanism, nationalism). Secondly, they suggest alternatives to evolu- tionarv views of historical change. Thirdly, they are connected up in various ways with Marx's analysis of capitalism, which Giddens takes to be the persisting core of modern social theory. Because of its wealth of content the book invites argument on every page, but I shall take up onlv one fundamental issue - materialism. Giddens assumes rather than demonstrates that to purge Marxism of evolutionism and func- tionalism entails the rejection of economic determinism. But is this necessarily so? Certainly, without an evolutionary theory stating that modes of production form a progressive, self-propagating sequence there is no presumption in favour of economic ex- planations for historical transitions from one type of society to another. (Giddens takes advantage of this latitude to stress the importance of other factors, e.g. of urbanism and absolutism, respectively, in the neolithic revolution and the rise of capitalism.) Yet it may still be true that the key to understanding any given type of society is its mode of production. This is not for functionalist reasons, even though Marx himself often gave them; at bottom, it turns on the ontological assumptions that underlie historical materialism. For Marx as for Giddens, society is structured by patterns of relationships mediated by meaningful human action. But a social system is more than just structure. It is, first, a structured proccss, and secondly, it has substance : it exists materially. Giddens rightly insists that social systems are reproduced across time and space, but overlooks the corollary that this must include reproduction of the matter, human and non-human, in which</page><page sequence="3">606 BOOK REVIEWS their structure is embodied. This tendency towards 'abstract structuralism' in Giddens' assumptions gives his entire critique an immaterialist bias. Where Habermas at least retains labour alongside interaction, Giddens dissolves labour into a generalized notion of praxis , referring to the formal properties of action, while his classification of institutions is derived solely from the formal properties of interaction. Thus social systems contain insti-tutions for signification, domination and legitimation, but not for production. Economic institutions appear only as spheres of 'allocative domination' (property) but not as organs of society's physical reproduction. Similarly, actors are 'knowledgeable' but lack needs and wants; structures are defined by rules and resources, but do not engender interests; labour-power is not 'exploited' as other pro-ductive resources are, but in an ethical sense, by virtue of being used to another's advantage; the 'commodified time' of capitalism is regarded as a pure abstraction, separated from the substance of all social activities, rather than as a false universal concealing the reduction of diverse concrete activities to abstract labour- time; and so forth. Thus Giddens' rejection of Marx's insight into the primacy of the economic is not only a consequence of discarding evolutionism and functionalism; to some extent it would appear to be a result of uncritically adopting an ontology of the social that is narrower and more one-sided than Marx's own. Whether they are right or wrong, these critical reflections are themselves testimony to the stimulating effect of Giddens' book. It is essentially addressed to colleagues and advanced students, but it ends with the promise of a second volume, on socialism, that may well have a wider appeal. Hopefully, it will also contain fewer misprints. University of Oxford JOHN TORRANCE</page></plain_text>
