<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORTER NOTICES A NOTE ON PRE-ACHAEMENID BRONZE STANDARD-TOPS FROM WESTERN IRAN By P. R. S. Moorey Small groups of bronze objects among the incoherent flow from clandestine excavations in western Iran may occasionally be drawn together to open cultural perspectives obscured when they are only seen in isolation. It is a poor substitute for proper archaeological study of material from controlled excavations; but these random finds now constitute, and for the foreseeable future may be expected to constitute, by far the greater part of our evidence for the work of pre-Achaemenid bronze-smiths in western Iran. They demand some kind of academic stewardship, even if in the long run only one substantial argument emerges from every ten insubstantial ones suggested by their casual revelation over the years through sales' and exhibition catalogues. It is to be hoped that even the most arid kind of typological classification, if rigorously applied, will be useful in the future for rapid cross-reference to evidence from controlled excavations once it appears. If this classification may even now be made to yield broader hypotheses for testing against well-excavated evidence it may act additionally as a stimulus for further field research in specific areas. Now that certain primary points have been made clear, through a combination of typological study and controlled excavation, about the metalwork distributed under the commercial designations " Amlash " and " Luristan ", to name but the most common, it is time to call attention to another cultural element increasingly apparent from casually dispersed metalwork attributed to north-western Iran, sometimes specifically linked to Ardebil as a distribution centre.1 There is a complementary story to be told through pottery; but in this particular case certain strongly developed local ceramic characteristics obscure the long distance interconnections more readily indicated by the metalwork,2 whilst material from controlled excavations is in this respect more common. In 1934, soon after the first wave of" Luristan Bronzes " reached western Europe, Hancar wrote a paper succinctly titled " Kaukasus-Luristan ".3 The case for any direct link was even then hard to sustain; in retrospect it seems to have been viable only because of inadequate evidence from the intervening regions of north-western Iran. Now that this is more readily available there are no grounds for postulating a penetration of central western Iran from Caucasia in the later second millennium comparable to the cultural diffusion over a millennium earlier, now generally referred to as the " Yanik Tepe Culture" after Burney's pioneer researches.4 There may have been a trickle trade from metal manufacturing centres in Transcaucasia down into Luristan in the Early Iron Age; but there is very little evidence even for that. It is in north-western Iran, in northern Azerbaijan, that Transcaucasian cultural influences were felt at this time and are increasingly implied by bronze artefacts circulating through the antiquities market from this area. The following note seeks to demonstrate that as much x I am well aware that such objects are regularly sold, merely to satisfy customers, as being "Luristan" or "Amlash ", or some other currently fashionable commercial designation; also that objects may be smuggled across the Turkish and Russian frontiers for easier sale in Iran; but I am satisfied that in the last fifteen years sufficient material has been found in Iranian Azerbaijan to sustain the main purport of this note.

The standard-top illustrated in Pl. Ia and Fig. I was acquired by the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford in 1974 through the Bomford Trust Fund.5 It consists of a circular hollow loop with a border of six open loops, framing at the top what seems originally to have been a small spherical cage with a rattle in it. The central opening is filled by an openwork oval, ribbed cage with four projecting bars to secure it to the main outer hoop. The central cage is broken on one side and no longer contains a rattle. The main hoop is cast with a running open pattern of linear curves on one face, z-shaped apertures in the other. It is also broken towards the top on one face and no trace of the original rattle survives. A systematic attempt has clearly been made by the finders to remove the spherical balls of bronze probably set into these cavities. A rectangular socket is rivetted to the central lower portion of the hoop and into it, again secured by a rivet, is set a square-sectioned tang. Fig. r.

Muscarella (Ed.), Ancient Art: The Norbert Schimmell Collection (,lainz, i974), no. 137 (plate). The distinctive openwork casting of the rams recalls a bronze mouflon acquired by the Louvre in 1898 from a dealer who gave it no provenance6 (P1. Ic). In this case the animal stands on a platform, its body hollow-cast with regular vertical slits in the rib cage and a spherical metal rattle inside it. Rostovtzeff7 in a widely ranging article on Asiatic animal art described it as " Syro-Cappadocian Art "; Bossert placed it in the Hittite New Kingdom; Rutten concurred.8 Although it may indeed have been found in eastern Turkey, or sold to the dealer in this region, its cultural affinities are neither Hittite nor Neo-Hittite but rather Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age Transcaucasian. There is as yet no certain evidence for an indigenous style of hollow animal sculpture in metal in Iran; but rattles in variously cast open-work cages are known there, from Luristan northwards, in the Early Iron Age. In Luristan and south Kurdistan9 they were primarily bells designed to hang as pendants; but in the north, at cemeteries like that of Kaluraz in Gilan, there is evidence for rattles or jingles with zoomorphic decora- tion set on vertical stems.10 They are on a much smaller scale than these rattling standard-tops, for which there is no exact parallel in the published west Iranian metal repertory. Before considering their special cultural affinities two published pairs of functionally similar objects from this area require comment, as each pair has its own distinct cultural affiliations. The best known were acquired separately in Iran in the last decade of the nineteenth century, one said specifically to be from Hamadan. This is now in the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto (" Sarre's Standard "), the other in the Louvre (P1 Ib). They have recently been discussed by Cal- meyer and convincingly dated on iconographical grounds to the Old Babylonian Period."1 They have 6 Information kindly supplied by Dr. Pierre Amiet. 7 Revue des Arts Asiatiques I (3) (1924), P- 15, pl.

Neo-Assyrian palace reliefs make clear that any distinction between war and ritual standards is largely irrelevant, since exactly comparable objects are shown static in shrines and in combat fixed to the front of chariots.12 The primarily Babylonian iconography of this pair may be partially explained from scenes on cylinder seals. It has long been recognized that the best parallel to their decoration is a seal in the Newell collection showing two fighting bulls below a guilloche framing a human wheel of four revolving figures.13 The revolving men at the centre of the standard-tops hold vases from which water flows into the circular frame: meant to be seen as a flowing stream with the ducks cast on its perimeter swimming in it. In Mesopotamia " the vase with flowing streams " was held either by female deities or by nude, bearded male heroes, as on those two standard- tops. It is they who also appear with " the God of Flowing Streams " on the finest Old Babylonian seal yet published from Susa.14 It is inscribed for a devotee of Nergal. The god is juxtaposed to two men, without horns of divinity, both armed, one about to strike a crouching foe wearing boots with turned-up toecaps. The second millennium rock relief at Kurangun15 indicates that the " God with Flowing Streams " ranked conspicuously in the Elamite Pantheon. This pair of standard-tops belong to a time when Elamite culture fell strongly under Babylonian influence, and both exerted influences, only yet dimly perceived through the meagre archaeological evidence, deep into the central Zagros region where the standard-tops were probably found in the I89o's. A provincial, rather than a metropolitan, Elamite workshop is again the probable source of a pair of bronze standard-tops now in the Metropolitan Museum, New YorkG6 (Pl. IIa). The shape is similar to all the objects considered here; but whatever fitted into the central aperture of these two (slots to retain it are cast into the main hoop) is lost and they have a tang rather than a socket. As Mrs. Harper has pointed out, the central man has some broad affinity to statuettes of worshippers from the Inshushi- nak Deposit at Susa ;1 but his kilt and boots with up-turned toes are not paralleled there. His gesture of obeisance suggests that these were originally cult standard-tops. The plinth on which he stands terminates in a snake's head: a leitmotif of Elamite religion and art.18 There is some scattered evidence to suggest that boots with up-turned toes were worn in the second millennium B.c. among Elam's northern neighbours in the mountain valleys of Luristan. They appear there worn by figures painted on local pottery.19 The seated mouflon on these two standard-tops, threatened from behind by hunting dogs, is a motif used in the distinctively stylized " Luristan Bronzes " of Iron Age II-IIIB, though not exactly as rendered here. An attribution to a craftsman working in a provincial " Middle Elamite Style " in a Zagros workshop late in the Bronze Age or in Iron Age I (sometime in the second half of the second millennium B.C.), is for the moment little more than the most viable possibility. With these two pairs of second millennium standard-tops from western Iran clearly in mind it is easier to indicate more exactly how the open-cast standard-tops with rattles considered first represent a fresh cultural influence. The basic form, suggesting close functional identity, is very similar, but little else is. The openwork style of casting and the introduction of rattles may not be paralleled in south- west Asia at this time. Resort must be made to Transcaucasia for comparable objects, to the assembly of archaeological cultures now generally grouped as the " Central Transcaucasian Culture ".20 The relevant evidence is not to be found at one site but at a variety among which the cemetery at Lchashen, revealed for excavation after the installation of hydro-electric scheme brought a fall in the level of Lake Sevan, has in recent years provided the focus. Here, in the excavator's groups 3 and 4, were found massive bronze standard-tops designed to be strapped at the junction of a cart draught-pole and yoke. They are cast in the round as animals and chariots set on rods with anchor-shaped fittings at the base.21 Bronze bells and bird pendants associated with them, as also the hilts and sheaths of daggers, are 1i B.

Similar objects are known from the important site of Artik, and from earlier excavations at Kvemo-Sasireti, Redkin Lager and Samtavro.22 In almost every case they are associated with the distinctive "Amazon axes ", Deshayes Type " M ",23 which have been found far to the west through Iranian Azerbaijan and into Gilan. The same cultural context has yielded wide bronze belts made of thin sheet metal usually incised with hunt or battle scenes and animal friezes. A number of comparable belts have reached western collections in recent years as from cemeteries in north-western Iran.24 One further object reported as from a site in north-western Iran may have a place in the history of standards. This is a solid cast bronze statuette of a mouflon standing 15"3 cm. high on a base measuring 6 2 by 2 "4 cm., now in Hamburg25 (Pl. IIb). What little evidence there is for such an animal style in Early Iron I-II in this region suggests that it belongs broadly to this period, as was suggested when it was first published, not to the Sasanian period as has been the more recent suggestion. Both its form and its style are more reminiscent of Transcaucasian animal standard-tops than of anything yet certainly attributed to the Sasanian period. This is, certainly, all rather incoherent evidence upon which to base any but the most preliminary assessment, yet still it reveals the long shadow cast by the extended and widely ranging " Central Transcaucasian culture " in the extreme north-west of Iran. The chronology of this culture is much debated, but in general terms it runs a parallel course to Early Iron I and II as defined for Hasanlu (c. 1350-800 B.C.). It is only in the last two centuries of this span that iron forms a conspicuous element in metal production. The metalwork of the Talish cemeteries and of Marlik at this time has a distinct character of its own in which no strong Transcaucasian element may be detected. It appears that in the centuries preceding the Urartian penetration of Azerbaijan there may have been at least a trickle trade in Transcaucasian bronze objects primarily into an area due south of the Araxes river and not much beyond Ardebil to south or east. Whether the rattling standards discussed here were imports, or were made in Azerbaijan under direct Transcaucasian influence, such salvage operations as this note may only leave an open question. Their legacy is not without interest. The Transcaucasian rattles, pole-ends and bells were the ancestors of such trappings among the South Russian Scythians. They were widespread in the area of the river Kuban to the Carpathian Basin as early as the sixth century B.c. soon after the Scythians withdrew from the Near East through Caucasia to the Black Sea region.26 But in this, as in much else, the royal Achaemenids adopted a mainstream Near Eastern tradition rather than the equipment which would have been familiar both to the Medes and to the Persians through close association with their Scytho-Cimmerian confederates in the seventh century B.c. The Achaemenid royal standard, unrepre- sented in contemporary Persian art, is described in Greek texts.27 In the Cyropaedia (VII. 1.4) Xenophon portrays Cyrus the Great at the head of his troops about to do battle with Croesus, " Now his ensign was a golden eagle with outspread wings mounted upon a long shaft. And this continues even unto this day (time of Artaxerxes II) as the ensign of the Persian king ". Such was the royal standard described by Philostratus in an imaginary picture of Themistocles before Artaxerxes I (Imagines: Thermistocles II: 3I); such that borne before Artaxerxes II at Cunaxa (Anabasis 1.10.12). Q. Curtius Rufus (III.iii.I6), in writing of the yoke on the chariot of Darius III, says " and on it rose two golden images a cubit high of the king's ancestors, one of Ninus, the other of Belus. Between them they had consecrated a golden eagle, represented with outstretched wings ". Was it really an eagle the Greeks saw or, as is now more immediately assumed, the anthropomorphic winged disk as represented at Behistun? No surviving contemporary Achaemenid illustration is available to support the Greek 22 C. F. A.
