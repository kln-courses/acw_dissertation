We apologise for this. A draft covering the greater part of this report (especially Chapters 1-3, 5-8 and parts of 4 and 9) was completed by SH some 20 years ago. GC was invited to contribute sections now covered in Chapters 4, 9 and 10. In readying at last (2008-10) this volume for publication, GC has been able to reduce the length of the draft and endeavoured to bring the text up to date with reference to the considerable amount of work done on the Early Minoan period of Crete, principally by Stelios Andreou, Peter Day, Nicoletta Momigliano, Peter Tomkins and David Wilson, who have done much to elucidate the Early Minoan pottery and history of Knossos and who have included our material in their studies and regularly shared their views with us. We thank them warmly. We have attempted to revise the original text, so as both to make it as up-to-date as possible and at the same time not to repeat what is already well known — and now formalised in the prehistoric volume of the Knossos Pottery Handbook (2007).1 The descriptions of the pottery, however, which form the core of this volume, have not been changed to any significant degree. The Introduction and Chapters 4 and 9 are the joint work of GC and SH, Chapters 1-3, 5-8 and some of 11 are essentially by SH, Chapters 10, 12 and much of 11 are by GC. This work would not have been possible without the support and permissions of the Archaeological Service and the then Managing Committee of the British School at Athens. We should like to thank — and remember — in particular the Ephors of the Herakleion Ephoreia: fNikolaos Platon, who gave permission to examine the Early Houses, and Stylianos Alexiou, who was Ephor when the main study of the pottery took place at Knossos, and permitted us to study and publish here Early Minoan pottery in the Herakleion Museum from Arthur Evans's excavations. At the School, we thank — and remember — especially: tEdith Clay and tjoan Thornton, London Secretaries; tjane Rabnett, Athens Secretary; tMartin Robertson, Chairman of the Managing Committee — who were all in office at the time of the Early Minoan excavations and study — and fPeter Megaw, Director at the time of study. At Knossos, we were and are deeply grateful for the help of fPetros Petrakis, the School's potmender, and his wife fEleni, as well as fManolis Markoyiannakis, the School's foreman at the excavations, and his wife fOurania, and fSpyros Vasilakis, a master excavator. We thank also the School's Curators and Fellows at Knossos: Jill Carington Smith, Doniert Evely, Eleni Hatzaki, Roger Howell, Colin Macdonald, Sandy MacGillivray, Alan Peatfield and Todd Whitelaw. In preparing this volume, and for their discussion, direction and assistance in analysing this pottery and all other matters Early Minoan, and many fruitful conversations, we particularly thank: Stelios Andreou, for discussions and support over many years; Rayna Andrew for composing the book; Philip Betancourt, especially for advice on Vasiliki ware; John Cherry, for drawings of the obsidian; Pat Clarke and Jeff Clarke, for many of the drawings; Peter Day, for information, together with David Wilson, on the ware groups; f-Michael Dudley, for photographing the pottery in the Ashmolean Museum, and developing and printing the photographs from Knossos; Don Evely, for help in preparing the volume for publication, and for study of the obsidian; Paul Halstead; fReynold Higgins, for advice on the terracottas; Valasia Isaakidou, for her sections on the animal bones; Athanasia Kanta; fVictor Kenna, for study of the EM III sealing 1167; Carl Knappett; Olga Krzyszkowska, for editing the volume and constant and ever-ready support and encouragement, without which this book could not be here; Alexandra Livarda, for identifying a second olive stone (in a mud brick); Colin Macdonald, for an advance copy of his forthcoming paper; Nicoletta Momigliano, for salutary advice on late Prepalatial pottery and the Early Houses; Jennifer Moody; Ingo Pini for the photographs of sealing 1167, and the CMS Archive for drawings of it; Lefteris Platon, for excerpts from his father's notebook on his work at the Early Houses in 1957 and the photographs which he has generously allowed us to 1 Momigliano 2007 a.

There is a dip in the road, and the lowest part of this dip about 75 m w of the Theatral Area was chosen for excavation since the deepest deposits might reasonably be expected to have accumulated there. On the s side of the Royal Road (RRS) an area of about 160 sq m was opened between it and the region cleared by Evans when he excavated the House of the Frescoes in 1923 and 1926.2 To the N of the Road (RRN) an area of nearly 200 sq m was investigated next to the Armoury or Arsenal, explored by Evans in 1904 and 1922, but filled back in the 1920s with spoil from his excavations s of the Road.3 A third area was also examined on the southern outskirts of the Bronze Age city some 300 m s of the Palace to the w of House A cleared by D. G. Hogarth during the first year of the British excavations at Knossos in 1900.4 Trials here in 1956, after digging for a vineyard had destroyed walls of Bronze Age buildings, led to the discovery of complete vessels of Late Minoan I and deep Bronze Age deposits. It was felt that material from this region on the outskirts of the city might provide a useful supplement to whatever was recovered from the more central area by the Royal Road. Finally, J. D. Evans's Neolithic excavations in the Central Court began in 1957 as part of Hood's programme and were taken over by Evans in 1958,5 while the excavation of two chamber tombs at Sellopoulo was a collaboration between the Service and the School.6 The 1957-61 programme also included a number of rescue excavations, at the request of the Ephoreia. The excavations, however, of W. H. C. Frend at the early Christian basilica near the Venizeleion had begun before 1957, albeit continuing until i960.7 In the course of the 1957-61 excavations substantial deposits of pottery were found covering almost every phase of the Minoan Bronze Age recognised by Evans. RRS produced successive deposits attributable to MM IA, IB, IIA and IIB, followed by more than one phase of MM III. In RRN a large and spectacular deposit of LM IB was stratified above a fill of LM IA and earlier deposits reaching back to the beginning of EM II. The MM and LM I deposits on the Royal Road were supplemented by the discoveries in the area of Hogarth's House A. In addition, deposits of LM II, IIIA2 and IIIB, together with ones assignable to LM IIIC, were recovered in RRN below Early Iron Age (Protogeometric and Geometric), Classical, Hellenistic and Roman levels. In summary fashion, the principal excavations of 1957-61 are shown in table 0.1 and other, mostly rescue, excavations in table 0.2. The codes are those that will be found in the notebooks and other records, as well as on the boxes in the SMK, where the year indicator has often been added. The publication references are strictly for the principal publications that have appeared to date. This does not imply that these publications are completely comprehensive covering all the contexts or finds of the relevant site but, with the information in Hood and Smyth 1981 or Hood and Taylor 1981, they will be a helpful lead for where to look next. Hood conducted many other excavations at Knossos, by himself or collaboratively, between 1948 and 1951 and in 1953 and 1955-56, before the stratigraphic programme began, and again after the programme ended in 1963, 1 g66, 1973 and 1987.

The possibility of further subdivisions, notably in MM III, was already apparent. These later crystallised, leading to the differentiation of A and Β phases in MM I, II, and III and, eventually, also in LM I. LM III he divided into LM IIIA and IIIB, and he further distinguished two phases in LM IIIB: a mature phase corresponding to the 'Re-occupation Period' at Knossos, and a 'Late Revival'. In the Index volume (1936) to The Palace of Minos he added a LM IIIC period — in defiance of the logic of his own system.2 Arne Furumark regularised the division of LM IIIA and IIIB into earlier and later phases: LM IIIAi and IIIA2, and LM IIIB 1 and IIIB2.3 He also restored the logic of the system by defining what Evans had called finally LM IIIC as Sub-Minoan. But, since Vincent Desborough,4 Furumark's LM IIIB2 (which followed the scheme of Evans) has come to be known as LM IIIC. This brings it into harmony with LH (Myceneaean) IIIC for the equivalent period on the Greek mainland. In the first volume of The Palace of Minos Evans suggested the possibility of recognising earlier and later phases in EM I and EM II.5 Evans based his Minoan system on the sequence of pottery he found at Knossos. But some periods, for which material appeared to be lacking or was ill represented at Knossos, were largely or entirely defined by pottery from other parts of Crete. Thus, in the Essai, he defined EM II to a large extent in terms of material from the tholos tomb at Ayia Triada and pottery from Vasiliki, and EM III in terms of the Ayios Onouphrios deposit and the North Trench deposit at Gournia.6 (fig. 1.1 shows EM and other sites mentioned in this volume.) Later, in The Palace of Minos, MM IIB was defined to a large extent in terms of pottery from the destruction level of the First (or Early or Old) Palace at Phaistos. The deposits of pottery found in the 1900-05 excavations in the Palace at Knossos were illustrated and described in summary fashion in annual preliminary reports.7 These accounts were supplemented by two major articles by Duncan Mackenzie on the Bronze Age pottery of Knossos.8 Additional groups of Bronze Age pottery recovered by Hogarth in soundings in 1900 in the area of the city around the Palace had already been described and illustrated.9 Some deposits of pottery and individual vessels found after the main excavations ended in 1905 were recorded in successive volumes of The Palace of Minos, which appeared between 1921 and 1935.10 But there was no systematic or complete publication of any of the key deposits of Bronze Age pottery found during the excavations at Knossos until the report by John and Hilda Pendlebury on the houses assigned to MM IA, which they explored in 1930 below the Kouloures in the West Court of the Palace.11 This situation has been remedied since the 1960s by Mervyn Popham's publication of much of the surviving material of LM I—III date, and by the work undertaken by, principally, Stelios Andreou, Peter Day, Carl Knappett, Colin Macdonald, Sandy MacGillivray, Nicoletta Momigliano and David Wilson, and now Peter Tomkins, on the pottery from Early and Middle Minoan deposits kept in the Stratigraphical Museum (SMK). The definition of the various phases of Middle Minoan in particular was further confused by the fact that, in The Palace of Minos, vessels and fragments are often assigned in different volumes, and even in different parts of the same volume, to different periods. An example is the goblet with barbotine decoration from the Upper East Well (UEW) (which is EM III in date), which Evans illustrated as an 1 Evans 1906. 2 PM index, 140-1. 3 Furumark 1941. 4 Desborough 1964. 5 PM I, 70, 74-5, 78.

This somewhat confused, nebulous situation existed for many years as regards the definition of the successive Minoan periods and in time led, not unreasonably, to pleas for the abandonment of the Minoan system and its replacement by one less strictly linked to Knossos. Doro Levi and Nikolaos Platon in particular suggested a scheme based upon stages in the history of the great palaces: that is, Prepalatial, Protopalatial, Neopalatial (to which others later appended Final Palatial) and Postpalatial. But as far as this palatial system has been elaborated by them and others it has in fact only changed names, and it has been correlated with the Minoan system, so that nothing has really been done to eliminate confusions. Furthermore, the palatial terminology, apart from being cumbersome, is a good deal less satisfactory than the Minoan one: it seems likely for instance that substantial 'palaces' already existed at Knossos and some other sites in Crete during the Prepalatial, a period equated with EM I III and MM IA. Likewise, the division between an Early or Old Palace and a Late or New Palace, while reasonably clear at Phaistos, is somewhat arbitrary at Knossos.14 Evans himself certainly spoke of an early Palace (and later changes)15 in his first reports. This concept was no doubt helped by the architectural situation at Phaistos but it was, in effect, a restatement in different terms of the original basic distinction, which had been obvious before 1900, between so-called 'Kamares' (Middle Minoan light-on-dark) pottery and so-called 'Mycenaean' (Late Minoan dark-on-light) pottery. 12 PM I, 180-1, fig. 129a. 1S PM IV, 100, 102, fig. 68 (Momigliano 2007c, 84-7, 91, fig. 3-9: »)• 14 Cf.

After the campaign of 1903 for instance, the division was set well back in the Kamares period, with only the filling of the pits in the Early Keep area (latest material MM IA) assigned to the Earlier Palace: the deposit on the floor above, dating from MM II, and probably from MM IIA, was placed in the first stage of the Later Palace.16 The various destructions and rebuildings of the palaces at Knossos, Phaistos and Malia need not have been contemporary or have had the same significance or impact, even if they fell within the same archaeological period. It has indeed been suggested that the successive destructions of the palaces in Middle Minoan were caused by earthquakes that affected many parts of Crete during an era of marked seismic activity.17 If this was really the situation, it could reasonably be argued that destructions at different sites falling within the same archaeological period were likely to have been contemporary. But most of the destructions were accompanied by fire, and other explanations for them are clearly possible. Some may have been the result of earthquakes, as the major destruction which affected Knossos in LM IA almost certainly was; but it seems most unlikely that a series of destructive earthquakes could have affected wide areas of the island, starting fires wherever they caused damage, in the way that has been postulated. The Minoan terminology for the periods of the Cretan Bronze Age is reasonably neutral. The three main divisions (Early, Middle and Late) correspond, albeit very roughly, with the rise, acme and then decline of the Bronze Age civilisation of Crete, and — with rather more accuracy — with three obvious phases in the development of its pottery: a pre-Kamares (Early Minoan) stage, followed by a Kamares (Middle Minoan) stage with polychrome decoration on dark-washed surfaces, and then a post-Kamares stage (Late Minoan) when decoration in dark paint on a light ground was again in fashion. Evans's Minoan system is fluid enough that it can be corrected, adapted and amplified, without the definitions of the successive phases becoming too remote from what Evans had in mind. EM I—III, as now defined, correspond more or less to his conception of them, except that much of what is now classed as EM IIA may have been included in his idea of mature EM I. EM III is based upon what Evans at one point at any rate called EM III at Knossos. For the Middle Minoan periods the situation is more difficult, but a fixed point is provided by the Royal Pottery Stores and related deposits elsewhere in the Palace that he assigned to MM IIA. A much clearer appreciation of the character of the successive phases of the Middle Minoan period at Knossos is now available through MacGillivray's publication of the mass of material from Middle Minoan deposits (in the SMK),18 to be supplemented by the stratified deposits from our Royal Road: South (RRS) excavations in 1957-59. In The Palace of Minos Evans attached pottery, singly or in groups, from other sites in Crete to his different periods, but many of these attributions have needed considerable modification, as Andreou was among the first to show in the case of early pottery from eastern Crete.19 One large group that has been reassigned is that from the main destruction of the Early Palace at Phaistos. Evans classified some of its pottery as MM IIA;20 but it clearly belongs to a later period than the Royal Pottery Stores and allied deposits at Knossos that are consistently assigned to MM IIA;21 and, in the main, Evans designated it as MM IIB,22 clearly seeing it as belonging to the same ceramic period as the pottery from the Knossos Loomweight Basement.23 In these circumstances we are justified in retaining the Minoan system of periods devised by Evans with such modifications and changes as new discoveries and a fresh study of older material make necessary. 'Its chief merit is convenience', was Harriet Boyd Hawes's robust judgement.24 It must be emphasised, however, that the Minoan system is strictly applicable only to Knossos. At the same time Knossos appears to have been the most important centre in Crete, not only during Middle Minoan and the earlier part of Late Minoan but also, it would now seem, throughout Early Minoan and back into the Neolithic. The settlement on the Kephala hill at Knossos was probably the largest and most 16 Evans 1903, 26, fig. 13; PM I, 234-5, fig. 177; III, 23-4, fig. 12; 360. Evans assigned the knobbed pithos here to MM IIA, but the base of it may have been sunk from a floor at a somewhat higher level into a burnt deposit of the MM IIA destruction. 17 E.g. Platon 1981, vol. 1, 163, 256-7. 18 MacGillivray 1998; cf. MacGillivray 2007 (down to MM IIIA). See also Hatzaki 2007 on MM IIIB; and cf. the earlier summary sequence agreed at a workshop at Knossos in 1992 (Cadogan et al. 1993). 19 Andreou 1978. 20 E.g.

Note that PM I, 231, 234, fig. 176, although illustrated under the heading of MM IIA, is also assigned (253-4) to l'le 'mature' (i.e. MM IIB) phase of MM II. 23 MacGillivray (2007, 143, table 4.3, with references) agrees on the MM IIB date of the period 3 main destruction deposits of Phaistos. 24 Boyd Hawes et al. 1908, 2.</page><page sequence="23">8 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN flourishing in Crete, and was undoubtedly the source from which many ideas and fashions spread to the rest of the island, from the beginning of Neolithic until it suffered eclipse towards the end of the Bronze Age after the final destruction of the Palace, an event which has been variously dated by different authorities as early in LM IIIA2 c. 1375 bc, or in LM IIIA2, or on the borders of LM IIIA2 and HIB c. 1300 bc, or late in LM HIB c. 1200 bc. In addition, and perhaps in consequence of this pre-eminence, Knossos appears to have a more complex and detailed stratigraphy, and one more richly endowed with material, than any other prehistoric site in Crete. This means that it is possible to define a more complete succession of periods here in terms of changes in pottery fashions. Knossos is therefore in a position to serve as a time clock for the rest of Crete, if not for the whole Aegean, as Evans and Boyd Hawes originally hoped that it would. It is not always easy, however, to relate deposits of pottery found at other sites in Crete to the Minoan sequence of Knossos, unless diagnostic imports from the Knossos region happen to be associated with, or incorporated into, them. This fact, and the example set by Evans in allocating pottery and deposits found in other parts of Crete to his (Knossos-based) Minoan periods in a somewhat arbitrary manner, have led to much confusion. The situation has not been helped by the practice of using the Minoan terminology to mean different things in different parts of the island, expressing this by systems of overlaps, such as deeming EM III in East Crete as overlapping with MM IA at Knossos. In the interests of clarity, it is surely better to think in terms of specific, localised sequences of pottery groups for other sites or regions of the island apart from Knossos and then, if possible, show how they relate to the Knossian Minoan sequence.25 In this way, the Minoan system can be retained for chronological periods with an universal application, although these periods are of course essentially based upon, and defined in terms of, the stratification at Knossos and the sequence of pottery changes that can be discerned there. DEFINING THE MINOAN PERIODS Bronze Age pottery called 'Mycenaean', with decoration in dark paint on a light ground, as known from Rhodes and Thera in the 1860s, and from Mycenae itself after the work of Heinrich Schliemann in 1876, was recognised in Crete a little later when Minos Kalokairinos made soundings in the West Wing of the Palace at Knossos in the winter of 1878-79.26 Next, the existence of an earlier ceramic phase with designs in red and white paint on a dark washed surface was established through the recovery of pottery of this class by the villagers of Kamares from the cave of that name on Psiloritis in 1893. The pottery was brought to the Museum of the Syllogos in Herakleion where, at the invitation of the Director, Joseph Hazzidakis, it was studied that same year by John Myres and Lucio Mariani.27 Myres recognised that this 'Kamares ware' was of the same fabric as the fragments of exotic Aegean ware found in i88g-go by Petrie at Lahun (or Kahun) in Egypt, and now in the British Museum.28 A still earlier phase of the Bronze Age was reflected in some of the material from a deposit that had been discovered in 1887 at Ayios Onouphrios just north of Phaistos. The deposit, which evidently came from an important early tomb, was acquired for the Syllogos's Museum, and published by Evans in 1895.29 The basis for a triple division of the Bronze Age pottery of Crete, corresponding to what was later to be defined as Early, Middle and Late Minoan, existed in effect by the time that Evans and Mackenzie reopened excavations at Knossos in 1900. A similar tripartite division was recognised in the long Bronze Age sequence revealed at Phylakopi on Melos by the excavations of the British School from 1896 to 1899. Here an early group of pottery was seen to be followed by a 'Geometric' period, which preceded a 'Mycenaean' period. In 1902 Evans adopted the term 'Minoan' in connection with 'the 'Middle Minôan' ceramic class'30 as a substitute for 'Kamares', but 'Mycenaean' continued to be used for the later pottery with dark-on light designs and associated contexts.31 Then in 1904 he applied the term Minoan to the whole of the 25 As Andreou (1978) has done; cf. also Cadogan 1983. 26 Aposkitou 1979; Kalokairinos (ed.

In his first season in 1900, he recognised only two main periods of pottery: light-on-dark Kamares and dark-on-light Mycenaean, roughly corresponding to what were later to be Middle Minoan and Late Minoan; although F. B. Welch, describing the pottery found that year, does in fact speak of 'Proto-Mycenaean'34 (which may refer to what eventually came to be called MM III). LM I pottery was evidently included in 'Mycenaean'. This dichotomy between Kamares and Mycenaean subsequently appears in the form of a division between an Earlier and a Later Palace: a concept no doubt helped by the situation at Phaistos, where the New Palace is a more obvious entity than its counterpart at Knossos. By the end of the 1901 season, a 'good Mycenaean period' with a 'Palace Style', which included LM I as well as LM II, had been distinguished from the Late Mycenaean (of the 'Reoccupation'), which was compared with Amarna and assigned to the 14th century bc. A Late Kamares had also been distinguished from a pure or best Kamares; but 'degenerate Kamares' (i.e. MM III) was thought in fact to be of early Mycenaean date (but not older) : this went with a belief at that time that Linear A was a native script in use alongside 'Mycenaean' Linear B.35 In the 1902 report, Minoan was first introduced as a reasonable substitute for Kamares over against Mycenaean. The Royal Pottery Stores (later to be MM IIA) were described as Middle Minoan, while Late Minoan was used for the Loomweight Basement vessels (later MM IIB).36 A transitional class which included the Lily Vases (later MM HIB37) was regarded as characteristic of the earliest period of the Later Palace. The main period of the Later Palace (afterwards called LM II) is followed by the Reoccupation (afterwards assigned to LM III).38 The first report from Palaikastro also appeared in 1902. In illustrating some Early Minoan pots from the cemeteries, it calls them 'pre-Mycenaean', with a distinction between them and polychrome vessels 'of true Kamares technique'.39 This hints at the beginnings of the stylistic use of the term Kamares and the escape from keeping it tightly chronological. The term Early Minoan does not appear in the 1902 report, but in the 1903 report it was used for early (i.e. pre-Royal Pottery Stores) polychrome (Kamares) ware, as was found in the Monolithic Pillar Basement — which is now seen to have had both MM IA and IB deposits.40 Some degree of confusion, however, is apparent in this report in the use of the Minoan terminology as defined in 1902. The Hieroglyphic Deposit, for instance, is tentatively assigned to a time closely following the foundation of the Later Palace, but the 'ceramic associations' are said to be 'frankly Middle Minôan, though they may perhaps be more exactly expressed as "Middle Minôan II"'.41 A note adds that the last phase of the culture of the Earlier Palace may be described as MM I, and the first of the Later Palace as MM II.42 The idealised sections through the Early Keep43 show both floors above the walled pits as Later Palace: only the pits themselves (filled it seems as early as MM IA) are assigned to the Earlier Palace.44 Evans seems to have overlooked both the Royal Pottery Stores, which had been defined the previous year (1902) as Middle Minoan, and the Loomweight Basement vessels which were called then Late Minoan. MM II is being used here for what came to be MM III, and the following year the correction is duly made: for MM I and II read MM II and III.45 In the 1903 report, the Temple Repositories and the Magazine of the Lily Vases (both eventually to be called MM IIIB) are assigned to the First Period of the Later Palace, and this is described as 'a more or less transitional phase which may conveniently be termed Late Minôan I'.46 What was later defined as LM IA, however, appears to be included along with LM IB in the latest Palace Period (what is afterwards called LM II).47 This is followed by the Period of Partial Reoccupation (the Reoccupation Period afterwards assigned to LM III). 32 Evans 1904; cf.

By now Early Minoan seems to include the EM III Upper East Well deposit,49 but not the polychrome ware of MM IA.50 Middle Minoan begins with the floor deposits of the First Palace — which are clearly those of the MM IIA destruction level. The two jars from the Loomweight Basement51 are assigned to the same horizon as the MM IIA destruction; but a later phase of Middle Minoan is recognised and described.52 It is implied, but not exactly stated, that Late Minoan is the period of the Later Palace (inaugurated by the levelling away of earlier deposits for the existing West Wing), and the Lily Vases are set in the beginning of this period, to which sherds that appear from their description to be LM IA53 are also assigned. Evans submitted 'a preliminary scheme for classifying' the material of the Cretan Bronze Age to a meeting of the Anthropological Section of the British Association at Cambridge in 1904;54 and, by the time the report for 1904 was written, he appears to have developed his final ninefold scheme of Minoan periods, although only five of them appear in the West Court Section: EM I—III and MM II—III.55 MM III embraces the latest deposits below the pavements of the West Court and the Corridor of the Procession, together with the Knobbed Pithoi, although it is noted that Knobbed Pithoi already occur at Phaistos in MM II, while mason's marks on jambs of the West Magazines are later in style than ones in the Magazines of the Giant Knobbed Pithoi in the East Wing of the Palace.56 Evans concludes that the Later Palace, to which the cists in the Long Gallery and the West Magazines are assigned, was founded when the MM III style was already fully developed, but that the Temple Repositories and the Early Cists in the West Magazines were closed at the time of transition to LM I. He seems to be thinking of the Lily Vases and the pottery below the pavements of the West Court and the Corridor of the Procession as belonging to an earlier stage of Middle Minoan III than the Temple Repositories. In The Palace of Minos he defines two stages of MM III: IIIA and IIIB).57 The Lily Vases and the Temple Repositories are brought together again, and assigned to MM IIIB, in the Index volume.58 In his report for 1904 Evans seems to overlook that in the 1902 report he had (correctly) assigned the Loomweight Basement vases to a later period than those of the Royal Pottery Stores (MM IIA).59 He may have been influenced by Mackenzie, who in the previous year had placed the two large jars from the Loomweight Basement in the same horizon as the deposits of the MM IIA destruction.60 Likewise, he appears to be thinking in 1904 in terms of a general destruction that involved both the Loomweight Basement and the Royal Pottery Stores and 'overwhelmed the Town and Earlier Palace at Knossos during the mature polychrome period':61 this view is again made explicit two years later by Mackenzie in his second article in the Journal of Hellenic Studies?2 At the same time Evans notes that two intervening stages of habitation were visible in the West Court Section between the deposit assigned to MM II (i.e. MM IIA) and that of MM III.63 In the composite West Court Section of 1904, and following on from several test pits that year in the West Court,64 Evans identifies five periods between the Neolithic and the paving assigned to the Later Palace. His 'EM I' and 'II', however, lack clear definition, leading Warren to assign both levels to EM III, below MM IA;65 while Wilson saw a sequence of: Neolithic + EM IIA ('EM I'); EM IIA ('EM II'); EM III.66 But the bowls with high pedestals which Evans illustrates as from 'EM I' strata, although restored and perhaps somewhat distorted in his drawings, look more like Palace Well chalices than the types of pedestal bowl or cup in use in EM IIA;67 and some EM I (in today's terms) was clearly found in the 1904 test pits.68 48 Mackenzie 1903, 157. 49 Mackenzie 1903, 167, fig. 1. 50 Mackenzie 1903, 170. 51 Mackenzie 1903, 177-9, figs- 4~5&gt; 'ater t0 be called MM IIB. 52 Mackenzie 1903, 179-82. 55 Mackenzie 1903, 188. 54 PM I, vi. 55 Evans 1904, 19, fig. 7 56 Evans 1904, 13. 57 PMl, 576-9, figs. 420-1. 58 PM index, 128. 59 Evans 1902, 26. 60 Mackenzie 1903, 178-9. 61 Evans 1904, 16. 62 Mackenzie 1906. 63 Evans 1904, 16, n. 2. 64 Cf.

The excavators of Palaikastro adopted Evans's ninefold system in reporting on their 1904 season, with three phases of Middle Minoan followed by three of Late Minoan.75 Early Minoan, however, could not yet be divided; but EM II and III were recognised the following year.76 That year (1905) Evans assigned a deposit on a floor below the West Court to MM I,77 later placing it in MM IA.78 It should probably be classified, however, as MM IB in view of the spiraliform decoration on the fine polychrome jug.79 The West Court Section deposit (known as the Early Chamber beneath the West Court) that he had assigned in 1904 to 'MM II'80 he later called MM IB,81 a date that MacGillivray confirms,82 although in 1904 he saw it as belonging to the same destruction level as in the earlier rooms beneath the Room of the Olive Press, and the Kamares Magazines of the SE Palace Quarter.83 In 1905 Evans also formally proclaimed his ninefold system of Minoan periods, publishing it definitively in the 1906 Essai.M Here Sub-Neolithic is qualified as Early Minoan I, with the claim that dark-faced wares with decoration in white paint are found alongside dark-on-light wares. However, he does not mention pattern burnish, which might suggest that it had been misinterpreted as traces of white painted decoration. But a belief in the use of white paint at Knossos in the period immediately succeeding the end of the Neolithic is already affirmed by Mackenzie, who describes the stratum of painted ware which merges with the latest Neolithic and has pottery with a black glaze slip and decoration in white alongside dark-on-light.85 Later, Evans wrote of Sub-Neolithic as included in EM I, and recognised a possibility of dividing EM I into two phases, during the later of which dark-on light painted ware came into prominence.86 EM II, of which deposits with complete pots had not yet been found at Knossos, he defines in the Essai in terms of the majority of the pottery from the tholos tomb at Ayia Triada (evidently the large tholos tomb excavated in 1904)87 and Vasiliki, together with the earliest elements of the Ayios Onouphrios deposit, which he had published a decade earlier.88 EM III is similarly defined in terms of material from other parts of Crete far from Knossos: the North Trench deposit at Gournia, and a tholos tomb excavated by Xanthoudides at Koumasa in December 1904.89 Evans states that EM III sees the first beginnings of polychromy, and the period as defined in the manifesto appears to cover MM IA as well as true EM III. The Vat Room deposit, in which the latest elements are probably MM IB,90 is dated to the transition between EM III and MM I. MM I is described in the Essai as having quite elaborate polychrome decoration including spiraliform designs, and evidently covers what is now defined as MM IB.91 The same formula was adopted in the early notices of our 1957-61 excavations, where a late phase of MM IA92 (which for a time we assigned to MM IB) is now set definitively in MM IA.93 MM II of the 1906 manifesto with eggshell ware certainly embraces true MM IIA. Whether the Loomweight Basement pottery, later assigned to MM IIB,94 is considered to be included here is not clear. Evans notes that the end of this period at Knossos is marked by many traces of a general destruction, which may refer to that at the end of MM IIA (Royal Pottery Stores' horizon). 69 MacGillivray 2007, 107-08. 70 Momigliano 2007c, 96; but cf.

The Lily Vases are by implication assigned to an early phase of the period, along with the Hieroglyphic Deposit, while the Temple Repositories are placed towards the end of it. In 1904, as we have seen, the latest deposits below the paving of the West Court had been assigned to MM III, and the Lily Vases had been equated with them, coinciding with the end of the First Palace, while the Temple Repositories were set in the First Period of the Later Palace; at the same time the Later Palace was said to have been founded after the great age of polychrome pottery in MM II. This may reflect some confusion of thought, which continued into the period of the 1906 manifesto. LM I in the manifesto corresponds to what is later defined as LM IA, but the Zakros sealings (which come from a deposit of LM IB date)95 are assigned to the transition between MM III and LM I. LM II includes what was later to be defined as LM IB. The concept of LM IB was established by the time of The Palace of Minos II (ig28);96 some vessels from Palaikastro had been correctly assigned to that period five years earlier.97 The 1906 account of LM III implies two chronological phases; the period had in fact already been divided into LM III a and b in the 1904 Palaikastro report.98 In his article on the Middle Minoan pottery of Knossos, also published in 1906, Mackenzie outlines a concept of three successive destruction horizons in the Palace during Middle Minoan,99 calling the first of these MM I. It embraces material that in fact ranges from EM III to MM IB.100 The MM II of his second horizon of catastrophe mostly consists of deposits assignable to MM IIA, but includes the two large jars from the Loomweight Basement.101 For the third horizon at the end of MM III Mackenzie has a long list of deposits, including the Temple Repositories, the Lily Vases, the Knobbed Pithoi, and the latest pottery from below the paving of the West Court and that of the Corridor of the Procession. In The Palace of Minos this relatively simple picture of the history of the Middle Minoan period in the Palace at Knossos was complicated by Evans's assigning the Loomweight Basement jars etc. to a later phase in MM II — i.e. MM IIB102 — while the Knobbed Pithoi, mostly found in the eastern wing of the Palace, were firmly transferred in Evans's last writings to MM IIA103 from the MM III horizon in which Mackenzie had set them.104 At the same time, Evans assigned the Temple Repositories and the Lily Vases along with the deposits below the Corridor of the Procession to the later phase of MM III — i.e. MM IIIB. The latest elements in the fill of Kouloura 1 in the West Court were also dated to this period.105 In publishing Gournia in 1908, Boyd Hawes adopted, and argued strongly in favour of, Evans's 'new Minoan chronology'.106 A tri-partite division of the Bronze Age of Crete', she wrote, 'into large periods of time, called "Early Minoan", "Middle Minoan" and "Late Minoan", which are severally subdivided into three smaller periods that represent rise, culmination, and decline or transition, is logical and easily remembered; it is found to be so comprehensive that all Bronze Age sites in the Aegean can be brought into relation with it. For these reasons, many scholars who at first were reluctant to adopt the new terminology proposed by Dr. Evans, now use it constantly.' That same year (1908) Evans and Mackenzie made soundings in the Early Houses on the s edge of the Palace: our area B. The material from these soundings clarified the character of the EM sequence at Knossos, as Seager noted.107 Deposits of EM III pottery were recognised here above floors with EM II vessels on them,108 which were thought to belong to an early phase of EM II before the main period of Vasiliki ware, but are now assignable to EM IIB. As for the EM III pottery, he nowhere relates it to the UEW deposit, which is explicable since he assigned that to MM IA.109 The confusion and obscurity about EM III at Knossos were increased by the fact that Evans did not publish any EM III material from the Early Houses, relying upon examples of pottery from eastern Crete to illustrate the period. He may have been influenced by the view, which he shared with others among the fathers and mothers of Cretan archaeology, that in the earlier part of the Bronze Age the eastern part of Crete was in the lead, culturally speaking, and was the area where fashions began and from which they spread to the centre including Knossos. On this view, the situation only changed with the foundation of the palaces and the development of polychrome decoration in the Knossos 95 Cf. Krzyskowska 2005, 178 and n. 66 (with references). 96 E.g. PMII, 485-6, fig. 291. 97 E.g.

Indeed, according to Charbonneaux,110 the shapes and principles of decoration which prevailed throughout Crete until MM III and inspired the Kamares style were developed in eastern Crete between EM II and MM I. It seems more likely, however, that from Neolithic onwards Knossos was the prime inhabited centre on Crete, and often the source from which fashions and influences spread to the rest of the island. As we have seen, the concept of EM III in the 1906 Essai appears to embrace also MM IA. Later, Evans continued to claim111 that, at Knossos at any rate, vessels with polychrome decoration were being made before the end of EM III. It should have been clear, however, from the UEW dug already in 1901-02, and supplemented in 1908 by the EM III deposits in the Early Houses, that polychrome decoration did not occur at Knossos before MM IA. No example of it comes from the UEW, or from our deposits in our Areas B (the Early Houses) or A (Royal Road North: RRN). The supposed EM III vessel with polychrome decoration Evans acquired at Knossos before the excavations112 seems much later, and may be an import from the Mesara, while the 'Indian red' that Evans thought was peculiar to EM III occurs on later pottery at Knossos.113 In the 1930s, despite the difficulties in recognising EM III in the Knossos region at the time, Marinatos suggested, correctly it seems, that some of the pottery from Yiofyrakia southwest of Herakleion might go back to the end of Early Minoan;114 and EM III pottery has now been recognised at other sites in the area, including Archanes, Poros and Tylissos,115 where Hazzidakis thought that the pottery from the earliest deposits belonged to a single stratum.116 Zois accepted this unitary claim, assigning it to MM IA, and by preference to its earlier part.117 However, the material Hazzidakis publishes covers several periods and includes EM II as well as EM III and MM I—II,118 as he recognised. After World War II, Levi argued similarly for the existence of one relatively short period at Phaistos between the end of Final Neolithic there and the foundation of the First Palace.119 In this case there was more justification for such a minimalist view. The end of Phaistian Neolithic may, or may not, overlap with part of EM I at Knossos: cf. below p. 282; and it is still not that easy to isolate EM III in southern Crete, although it appears now to have two phases at Phaistos.120 THE EARLY MINOAN SEQUENCE REPRESENTED IN THE 1957-1961 EXCAVATIONS In the light of our excavations and of the work of others (see p. 239) in studying material from the old excavations, it has been possible for several years now to define and assign distinctive features to four main successive periods (with sub-divisions) of Early Minoan at Knossos in terms of changes of fashion in pottery: EM I, IIA, IIB and III. Our definitions of these periods are reasonably consistent with those made by Evans, Mackenzie and Pendlebury. There has inevitably been a certain shifting of boundaries, however, and it is important to bear in mind that much that we define as EM I has in the past been called Subneolithic, while some if not most of what is now included in EM IIA appears to be what Evans regarded as late EM I. Thus Evans121 implies that Vasiliki I (now classified as EM IIA)122 was to be assigned to EM I in spite of the presence of Vasiliki ware. In harmony with this, the material from the Early Houses, now defined as EM IIB, was regarded by Evans as belonging to an early stage of EM II. Our EM III material seems to correspond to what Evans called EM III in the Houses, although he assigned other EM III deposits to MM I.123 Early Minoan I This period is defined in terms of the material from the Palace Well.

D. Evans in 1970 in sounding FF (FF4) below the West Court127 was stratified above an important deposit assigned to FN IV, with features linking it closely with both the later and earlier Neolithic (so-called FN) of Phaistos.128 The relationship of Knossian EM I with Sub-Neolithic or FN in Crete is discussed later (pp. 282-5). In our excavations we came upon no deposits linking the EM I of the Palace Well with EM II. Considerable changes, however, had evidently taken place in the pottery in use at Knossos between the EM I stage represented in the material from the Well and the horizons now defined as EM IIA. We shall also discuss below (pp. 282-3, 288-9) where in the EM I—II sequence the Palace Well fill lies, and whether it is still possible — as used to be the case — to distinguish an EM IA from an EM IB. Early Minoan IIA The horizon now defined as EM IIA is very well represented by the material from the West Court House (WCH) deposits129 and corresponds to what has come to be understood as EM IIA not only at Knossos but elsewhere in Crete (even if Evans would have included much of it in a late stage of EM I). Similar deposits occur in Warren's RRS excavations (to the west of our 1957-59 excavations) and include pieces of imported sauceboats of EH II type, of obvious importance for correlations with the Greek mainland.130 In RRN our earliest, small deposit with recognisable features (Ai: Floor VI) is assignable to this EM IIA horizon, but may be slightly later than the WCH deposits.131 Early Minoan IIB EM IIB as defined at Knossos appears to overlap with the main period of Vasiliki ware. This distinctive fabric evidently originated in the eastern part of Crete where it was the dominant fine ware during EM IIB although, as might be expected, it seems already attested in earlier EM II (see pp. 131-2). In our area A two successive floor levels (V and IV) were identified sandwiched between Floors VI (deposit A2) (EM IIB) and III (deposits A6, and probably A7) (EM III). Floor V (deposit A4), the lower of the two, is certainly to be assigned to EM IIB.132 In area B we found no deposits between Neolithic and levels with pottery assignable to EM IIB, which corresponds to that published by Evans133 and is partly presented below (pp. 266-74).134 Evans, however, did assign this EM IIB group to an early phase of EM II, and Zois cited our 1332 as an example of his EM IIA Koumasa style.135 This raises the question of whether the horizon identified as EM IIA in southern and eastern Crete may not in fact overlap with the beginning of EM IIB at Knossos — as the EM III style of East Crete overlapped with EM III and MM IA at Knossos (see below, p. 223). The pottery (deposit A5) from Floor IV in area A reflects the transition at Knossos from EM IIB to EM III, with a shift in fashion from decorating the finest table ware in dark-on-light to light-on-dark. The vessel shapes, however, are still often in line with EM IIB norms but there is much that corresponds with our B3 deposit of EM III. We did, however, at one point consider calling this phase EM IIC,136 but there seems no justification for making further sub-divisions of a period on the basis of a single small deposit of this kind. In any case, in the system of Evans any further sub-division of a period like EM II should' take the form of EM IIBi and IIB2 rather than EM IIB and IIC. We note, however, that the Knossos Pottery Handbook now uses the forms: EM IIA early and late, and EM III early and late.137 Early Minoan III The character of the pottery of this phase at Knossos has been well described by Andreou and Momigliano.138 It is clearly distinguished by the predominance of the fashion for decoration of the finer table ware with designs in white-on-dark. At the same time there was a definite shift in the shapes of vessels, with a strong predilection for bowls with flaring or everted rims of our type 8/9 (see below p. 127). EM III footed goblets are virtually indistinguishable in shape and decoration from 125 Betancourt 2008a, 2010. 126 Papadatos 2008, in preparation. 12' Wilson 1985, 359-64; Tomkins 2007,44-5; Wilson 2007, 50. 128 J.

That is attested for the first time at Knossos in MM IA. Some characteristic features, however, of MM I decoration, notably barbotine and reserved strips with incised hatching, appear for the first time in EM III, in our deposits and the UEW. In many respects the EM III pottery of Knossos appears to be closer to MM IA than to EM II. Indeed, when we first came upon EM III in ig6o-6i, we were inclined to classify the pottery as belonging to an early phase of MM IA and deny the existence of an EM III period at Knossos.139 It is better, however, to retain the term as it was ultimately used by Evans. This is all the more desirable since there was clearly a substantial overlap between this Knossian EM III and East Cretan EM III (or the East Cretan EM III style), as the East Cretan EM III import 1124 in our B3 deposit makes quite clear. We were confused, as others have been, by the fact that, although Evans noted the existence of EM III deposits at Knossos, he chose to define EM III in terms of published material from East Crete — which led to suggestions that the horizon of East Cretan EM III was wholly contemporary with MM IA at Knossos. But, since the rehabilitation of EM III by Antonis Zois,140 it is certain that this was not the case — although (earlier) MM IA at Knossos certainly overlapped with (later) East Cretan EM III, as has long been recognised.141 MIDDLE MINOAN IA AND LATER MM IA is defined at Knossos as a stage when the fashion for polychrome decoration (in red combined with white on a dark ground) on pottery flourished before the adoption of the fast potter's wheel. A deep fill of rubbish with abundant fragmentary pottery of this period was excavated at RRS,142 with floor deposits above it in a sequence of MM IA, MM IB and MM IIA,143 and a later deposit assignable to MM IIIA. Small deposits of MM IIIB came from both the RRS and RRN excavations, while LM IA and IB were very well represented by material from RRN.144 The large LM IB deposit in RRN145 seems to have been associated with a shrine; an ivory carver's workshop may have been connected with this. LM II deposits with complete vessels were found in RRS and at the site of the Sanctuary of Demeter south of the Palace.146 Deposits of the latest phases of the Cretan Bronze Age, LM IIIA2, LM IIIB and LM IIIC, have been identified in both RRN and RRS.147 139 Cf.

A well found in 1958 in the ne quarter of the later Palace1 had been filled in during EM I. We present the excavation and finds in chapter 3. Royal Road: North (RRN): Area A. In the centre of our excavations on the N side of the Royal Road,2 intact EM deposits survived in ground next to later (MM III-LM I) basements. In 1961 we opened a small sounding here, which we are calling Area A. We present the excavation in chapter 4, the pottery in chapter 7 and other finds in chapter 9. No house floors with EM pottery were identified on the s side of the Royal Road (RRS), although Warren later revealed some to the w of our excavations;3 nor were there any pure EM deposits in the 1957-6 i excavations in the region of Hogarth's House A or anywhere else on the hill of Gypsades to the s of the Palace. Early Houses-. Area B. In i960 three small trenches (two of which, totalling only c. 5.2 m2, are relevant for this study) were opened in untouched deposits in the 'Early Houses' on the s edge of the later Palace, revealing a series of floors and levels attributable to EM II and III.4 We present the excavation in chapter 4, the pottery in chapter 8, other finds in chapter 9, and some of the pottery that Evans and Mackenzie found in 1908 at the Early Houses in chapter 10. table 4.2 shows how this sequence of deposits in Area B appears to correlate with the sequence in the larger sounding in Area A (RRN), and table 2.1 the relative quantities of EM pottery we recovered. The amount from the EM I Palace Well is reckoned in baskets, but the unit for the rest of the material assignable to EM II and III is a table, namely the work-table or, that is to say, the amount of pottery when it was spread for study on the standard work-table with a top measuring 1x2m making a surface area of 2 sq m. One table spread is roughly the equivalent of one full basket. It will be noted that the amount of pottery from the Palace Well (15 baskets of pure EM I material, with two baskets of later rubbish from the top of the fill in the Well) was about as much as everything put together from the EM II and III deposits in Areas A and B. Comparisons on this basis are clearly rough and approximate, but they are perhaps less misleading and easier for making a quick appraisal of the relative amounts of material involved than some other systems, such as counting the total number of sherds, or weighing the pottery, which may give an impression of precision that is largely spurious. For conversion to other systems, the average number of sherds for one table may be taken as about 500. METHODS OF STUDY, AND PRESENTATION OF THE FINDS The pottery has been considered by types and not by fabrics in the first instance. There has been no attempt to divide the types between fine wares and coarse wares. Fine and coarse wares in effect shade into each other, the size of a vessel being in general the criterion as to whether it is of fine ware without grit, or of coarse ware tempered with grit. An exception, however, is made for the very distinctive, mostly dark surfaced burnished wares found in EM II deposits, and for the motded Vasiliki ware, exotic at Knossos, even if some (or most) of it was locally made, as Betancourt has suggested.5 The vessel types are arranged on the clear and logical system adopted by Blegen and his collaborators in dealing with the pottery from Troy. That is to say, the fine tableware is considered first, beginning with drinking vessels (cups, goblets) and various kinds of food vessels (bowls). Then come pouring vessels (jugs and spouted jars), storage vessels, lids (mostly from storage vessels), cooking pots, miscellaneous vessels and large pithoi. 1 Hood and Taylor 1981, 20: 183. 2 Hood and Smyth 1981, 51: 215. 3 Warren 1972A, 1973 b, 1974 4 Hood and Taylor 1981, 13: 2. 5 Betancourt 1979.

Diameters are measured from the outside edge of the rim unless it is stated otherwise. Measurements are in centimetres, unless otherwise stated. The pottery and other finds from the excavations, which are now in the HM or SMK, are marked in ink. The more or less complete vessels and some profiles, together with most of the other finds apart from pottery, were marked with an excavation catalogue number, which consists of a code for the specific site, e.g. RR for the Royal Road (but LA for the catalogued pottery from the EM sounding), PEM (Palace Early Minoan) for the Early Houses, and PW for the Palace Well, followed by the year and a serial number. The numbers for the pottery from each area are preceded by P and form a separate series from the numbers for other artefacts. Uncatalogued pottery fragments, which were selected for eventual publication, were given provisional serial numbers by areas, with RRN and RRS being treated as separate areas: the provisional serial numbers for RRN are preceded by N, and those for RRS by S. The catalogue and provisional serial numbers for the pottery and other finds from the EM I Palace Well, since they form a homogeneous deposit, are listed in a concordance at the end of the chapter. For the EM II and III material, however, these numbers are added in brackets after the final publication number. In the pottery drawings diagonal hatching indicates red paint, and vertical hatching normally implies black paint. In a few cases, however, black paint is rendered solid black to emphasise the contrast with decoration in white. In the catalogue and descriptions a wash is to be assumed to be overall, that is inside and outside, unless we say otherwise. We include the sample numbers (as Wilson and Day sample KN 92/1 etc.) of pieces that Wilson and Day have examined petrographically: see p. 297 below.

The Palace Well contained the most substantial ceramic and faunal assemblages of this period that have yet been found at Knossos and thus gives crucial insights into this otherwise little known period in the history of the settlement. The Well may have been the main source of water for the settlement on the Kephala hill at the beginning of the EBA. It went out of use and was filled with debris before the end of EM I. Our original interpretation was that the main deposit in the well (deposit 2: see below) represented debris from a destruction by fire in/of the settlement.2 Peter Day and David Wilson, however, have argued in recent papers that the nature of the assemblage suggests communal drinking and feasting.3 In this chapter we present the evidence from the excavation and analysis of the assemblages (Valasia Isaakidou presents the faunal remains) and try to address the interpretations put forward since its excavation. The Palace Well is the earliest Bronze Age well known at Knossos. None has been found of EM II date;4 but fairly near the Well are the EM III Upper East Well (UEW) and what may have been a Neolithic well but is probably a later one cut into Neolithic levels (fig. 3.1). The potentially Neolithic well cannot be found in any publication, but is described in Mackenzie's Daybook for 1902. It seems to have been a little upslope (to the w) from the East Bastion. The fill was of mostly 'early Mycenaean' (suggesting LM I) and Neolithic sherds. Neolithic became steadily more dominant from 11m from the surface until the bottom at 14.5 m, where the sherds were all Neolithic.5 If this suggests that it was originally a Neolithic well, one must set against this the improbability that such a deep hole remained open for millennia!6 Higher up the E side, the UEW lay just to the w of the Court of the Stone Spout and was excavated in 1901 and 1902.7 We may guess that it became known as this after the discovery of the possible Neolithic well, which could have then been seen as the 'Lower East Well'. The UEW was at least 19.4 m (and possibly more than 22.5 m) deep,8 as against the 17.2 m of the Palace Well. The presence of these three wells on the E slope suggests that the Early Minoan (I and III), and possibly the Neolithic, inhabitants of the Kephala hill were aware — perhaps from water divining — that digging deep in this part of the hill could give access to subterranean aquifers. A fourth well on the E slope was dug, Evans suggests, in MM IIIB, with LM I pottery in the fill, and some LM IIIB in the upper layers.9 Other Bronze Age wells are known inside the immediate area of the Palace. One, assigned to late EM III, was immediately N of Kouloura House A,10 and another, of uncertain original date, in the sw 1 Hood and Taylor 1981, 20: 183; Wilson 2007, 49-50, fig. 2.1: 7. 2 E.g.

An EM II well is known at Vasiliki, in Space 39. It was in primary use, and was presumably dug, in EM IIB (to judge from the Vasiliki ware sherds at the bottom): Seager 1907, 112-13, fig. 1; 118-20. Cut through 8 m of rock, it had a funnel shape: 1 m wide at its mouth, it soon narrowed to 0.75 m, but reverted to i m at about 2 m down. Small notches cut in its opposite sides would enable climbing in and out. In EM III it was filled with pottery. See also Zois 1976, 23, 113, 118-19, plan 9, pi. 56P. 5 We thank Todd Whitelaw for telling us of this forgotten, and otherwise unrecorded, well. The description is in Mackenzie's notes between 27 March and 11 April 1902: DM/DB 1902, 52, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72-6, 78-g. 6 Peter Tomkins, whom we thank, suggests to us that it may have been the so-called 'Blind Well' of the Court of the Stone Spout (Hood and Taylor 1981, 21: 194), excavated in 1902. Its two boxes of pottery (SMK I.I.5 970-1) are dated by Eccles et al. (1933, 8) to MM III. 7 Hood and Taylor 1981, 21: 198 (with references esp. PM III, 254); Momigliano 1991, 155, pi. 17.

As the School was excavating at Knossos at the time, the Ephor, Professor Nikolaos Platon, generously called upon us to examine the Well. It was excavated between 23 and 28 June 1958, and 16 and 18 June 1959, under the supervision of John Hayes and f Larch Garrad.15 The code for the excavation is PW/58 or 59. The Well (which is no longer visible, but plate 2 a shows the present appearance of the ground where it lies) was deep (fig. 3.2), its bottom 17.2 m below the present surface of the ground, which appears to be at about the same level as when the Well was dug. It was cut for some distance through Neolithic deposits, and lower down through the soft white kouskouras rock of the Knossos area. At the top it was over 1.5mm diameter where the sides, consisting of Neolithic material, had collapsed; but after about 1 m it became oval, some 1.4 x 1.5 m across. At 5 m from the present surface it began to narrow with the sides somewhat irregular, until at about 12.5 m it was only 0.57 x 0.59 m across. From 13 m it again widened to a maximum of 0.83 x 0.88 m at a depth of 14.8 m. It was still 0.82 x 0.77 m across within 0.1 m of the bottom, which was flat, and 0.62 x 0.68 m across. The fill in the Well divides into three separate deposits: Deposit 3, from the surface down to about 3 m and excavated as levels 1-2, produced a good deal of earlier (Neolithic) material together with some later (Minoan) pottery, mainly Late Minoan, including LM IA and IB and some LM III. Deposit 2, starting below 3 m from the surface and excavated as levels 3-21, was entirely free from later contamination, but did produce some 80 fragments of Neolithic pottery. They include pieces of presumably FN IA16 (formerly MN) rippled ware (plate 2 b) and other sherds dating to LN-FN IB.17 The Neolithic pottery appears as isolated sherds which, on the whole, are clearly distinguishable in fabric from the pottery of EM I. (One or two MM and LM sherds, including 162-163, that were found in the baskets when the pottery was studied in the autumn of 1964 may have fallen from the surface during excavation, but are more likely to have strayed into the baskets after the pottery had been washed and while it was in store from 1959 to 1964.) This deposit appears to be a fill that was deliberately tipped into the Well after a fire and is the principal part of the Well's contents, and over 10 m deep. It began to bottom out at around 13.6 m from the surface (to judge from the first appearance of the jugs that mark deposit 1) but did not cease altogether until around 14.2 m from the surface. The fill that formed deposit 2 consisted of stones with layers of wood ash and lumps of fire-hardened clay that were identified in 2009 as pieces of clay storage bins which, most probably, had been preserved by having been burnt. Much of the pottery in the fill had been discoloured by fire. Consequently, fragments that join are often of quite different colours, suggesting that the vessels were broken at the time of the fire(s). Minor differences were noted in the character of the fill at various depths, and the pottery was kept in 25 separate levels, which ranged in thickness from about 0.15 m to 1.5 m. Deposit 2, however, had evidently been filled in one single operation, and the pottery throughout was uniform in character, with joining fragments found dispersed at different levels: fragments of lid 124, for instance, came from depths of around 9, 11,12 and 13 m. The only significant change in the make up of the group is the appearance of some body fragments of jugs towards the bottom of the deposit. Deposit 1. At a depth of about 14.2 m, and 3 m above the bottom of the Well, the soft ashy debris of deposit 2 came to an end, to be succeeded by two rather different layers that form deposit 1. The upper part of deposit 1, excavated as level 22, consisted of layers of grey clay with much green vegetable matter and specks of carbonised wood. This was apparently a deposit that had formed below the ancient water level, producing virtually no pottery. Below it was a clay deposit, excavated as levels 23-5, with lumps of kouskouras that may represent debris fallen from the sides of the Well before it went out of use. This bottom level did produce some pottery, including pithos fragments. Jug fragments were much in evidence in the Well from about 13.6 m downwards (levels 20-1). This is above the stratigraphical change (from level 21 to level 22) noticed at around 14.2 m, but may be a sign of the probably uneven tipping of deposit 2 into the Well — or of the difficulties of excavating at such a depth in the Well. While these first jug fragments may belong with deposit 2, it is quite as likely, if not more probable, that they should be grouped with deposit 1, which represents the original use of the Well. Thus, the bottom metre in the Well produced one small complete jug 89 of type 12, 15 Preliminary notices: Hood 1959, 18; 1960a, 25. 16 Cf.

Section, with excavation levels.</page><page sequence="38">EARLY MINOAN I: THE PALACE WELL 25 and the greater part of another large one 90, together with the bodies of what appear to have been four more large jugs like it. These jugs had presumably been let down for water — and been lost. In four out of five cases the bodies of the large jugs were in the Well, but their necks were missing. This suggests that, if a jug broke, the mouth and handle were pulled back to the surface still attached to the rope, and then thrown away. These jugs, and various pieces of pithoi, must represent the primary use of the Well; and deposit 1 has to be earlier, if perhaps only slightly earlier, than deposit 2. The clayey matrix of the deposit gives us probably a clue to the (maximum) depth of water in the Well (some 3 m), while the broadening of the Well at the bottom may have been intentional (in part, at least), to make it easier to scoop up the water. When we first studied the pottery from the Well, we believed that it (that is, deposits 1 and 2) should be dated to EM I early — or 'EM IA'. For many years this judgement informed our discussions and presentations of the development of EM I—II pottery.18 However, study in the late 1990s by Day and Wilson of the pottery from Poros (downstream from Knossos, at the mouth of the river Kairatos) has suggested that the Well is in general contemporary with the Poros EM I deposits, which exhibit features that used to be classed as EM IA together with what used to be EM IB. This leads to assigning the Palace Well to an advanced stage of EM I — where the other EM I deposits of Crete in general seem also to belong.19 In view of this development, and pending whatever consensus emerges once the Poros pottery has been published, we think it prudent to call the Palace Well deposit simply EM I in presenting it now, and leave until later (pp. 281-5, 288-9) discussion of its precise place in the sequence of Cretan Early Minoan deposits. This will include reviewing its relationship to the FF4 deposit below the West Court. In the recent Knossos Pottery Handbook, Peter Tomkins20 shows that it is stratigraphically later than FN IV (level FFi o in the same trench) and probably belongs to early EM I, with ceramic features that are on the whole less developed, and thus earlier, than those in the Palace Well. A few pages later, however, Wilson21 classes FF4 as part of his EM I Well Group, which characterises and unites all the Knossian pottery of EM I. POTTERY In the account that follows of the pottery from the Well, the pottery is from Deposit 2 unless stated otherwise. The jugs, and pithos fragments, from Deposit 1 are the principal exception. Fabric There is no sharp distinction between fine and coarse wares, although the beginnings of a distinctive cooking pot fabric of the kind that occurred from EM II onwards are already visible, for instance, in the baking plates of type 10 (type chart for EM I: fig. 3.3) or the unique rim 75 with an external ledge. The pottery is often tolerably well fired, and the fabric hard. This suggests that some at least of the vessels were being fired in an oven. The oven may have been the bread oven of a house, especially if pottery was homemade and not produced by specialist potters; but we cannot rule out specialist potters and dedicated pottery kilns even in EM I,22 although no EM I ovens have been found.23 On the other hand, little is yet known about Cretan non-funerary architecture of the time. Ovens were in use at a very early period in Anatolia, and what may have been a pair of ovens was identified by J. D. Evans in an EN level at Knossos.24 Ovens have now been recognised in connection with several houses of later Minoan periods; some of these later ovens appear to have been employed, not for baking bread, but as kilns for industrial purposes that include firing clay pottery25 and making lime powder for wall plaster.26 Even with the best fired vessels from the Well the clay is often grey in the break, and the firing in general appears to be uneven. Normally, the clay is orange to dusky, with a temper of chopped straw and fine grit or sand. In the larger vessels, which tend to be of coarser fabric, the straw and grit temper is more pronounced. The vessels regularly appear to have had a wash or slip, and this is often sharply different in colour (buff, green or red) from the clay of the pot to which it has been applied. 18 E.g. Hood 19710, 36-8 and fig. 14 (which distinguishes 'EM IA' goblets from the Well from those of 'EM IB' in the Pyrgos burial cave); Cadogan 1983, 508; and cf.

Different shapes of vessel have surfaces finished in very different ways so that they appear totally different. Thus what seem to be the drinking and food vessels, the fine tableware, have more or less dark, grey-black, brown or red, surfaces which are generally decorated in pattern burnish. This ware has often been called 'Pyrgos ware' but, like Wilson in the Knossos Pottery Handbook, we prefer a label that is not constrained by place and with him shall call it dark grey burnished ware or red burnished ware as appropriate.27 We agree here wholeheartedly with Haggis's wise observation on the need to avoid 'imprecise and regionally biased ware group designations',28 while allowing one exception: Vasiliki ware, which it would be otiose to rename now (even though several different groups of mottled vessels come under its umbrella). By avoiding a site-specific approach to labelling the other pottery wares that we present in this book, we hope to avoid often spurious suggestions of ceramic exchange and at the same time to make it easier for all to see what is in the deposits. However, in rejecting 'Ayios Onouphrios' etc., we do not reject the (limited) use of site-names in connection with styles of EM pottery, such as, for example, to refer to a style of painted dark-on-light fan motifs on principally jugs, as first noticed at Myrtos-Fournou Korifi.29 Calling this now 'Myrtos style' (rather than 'Myrtos ware') allows anyone to know immediately what is being discussed, without any suggestion of a specific provenance or production centre.30 By contrast, the large jugs used for drawing water from the Well, and some other types of large vessel, have dark brown or reddish surfaces which have been scored or wiped. Smaller jugs are light surfaced with simple painted decoration in red: this used to be known as 'Ayios Onouphrios' ware, after the tomb at Ayios Onouphrios near Phaistos that became the type-site, following its recognition by Evans in 1894.31 In the past there was a tendency to think of pattern burnished (Pyrgos) ware as appearing earlier in Crete than dark-on-light painted (Ayios Onouphrios) ware. Levi long ago emphasised that they were in fact contemporary.32 Much of the pottery from the Well — and especially the finer table shapes such as the chalice and the pedestal bowl (types 1 and 2) — has a stroke burnished surface. This was normally done it seems with some eye for decorative effect, and has been loosely called the Pyrgos style for some time. Much of it may now be classed as pattern burnish: a burnishing tool was used to make designs on a part of the surface which had usually been reserved without burnish, but sometimes the designs are on an already burnished surface. Designs in pattern burnish on a reserved zone are characteristic of EM I, and extremely rare in Cretan Neolithic. Pattern burnish is found on cups of type 4 and bowls of type 8 as well as on the chalices and pedestal bowls. Its most elaborate use is on small suspension pots of type 14. A slip or wash was often, if not invariably, applied to the surfaces of vessels before they were burnished; but many vessels have an unburnished slip or wash. Since what we call a wash — and we believe we are correct — is often referred to as a slip,33 we must explain how we use the two terms: A wash is a coloured coating of a vessel that is wholly paint-based, with no apparent admixture of clay. A slip, however, is and can only be clay-based, a coating of liquid or slurry-like clay. This may either be a thin 'self-slip' of the same clay as was used for the body of the vessel, which can be easily achieved by the potter's passing the vessel through her/his hands, and smearing or smoothing it, when they are wet with the muddy, clayey water she/he has been using in making the vessel. Or it can be a different clay altogether that is overlaid on some or all of the vessel, when there is often an intent to change its appearance by giving it a different colour (the White Slip pottery of Cyprus is a paradigm of this), or to make it less porous and better able to hold liquids, as is observable on, say, Middle Minoan bowls in cooking pot ware. To return to the EM I pottery of the Palace Well, a thick light slip is particularly noticeable on jugs of type 11 with painted decoration; but some of these jugs have a thin red wash. In the case of washes the paint is apt to be unevenly applied, so that the surface of the vessel presents a streaky or mottled appearance. Red slips and washes occur, and some examples of an unburnished dark wash foreshadow 27 EM I pottery at Knossos: Wilson 2007, 51-6. See also Wilson and Day 2000. 28 Haggis 2005, 48. Obvious examples would be such terms as 'Ayios Onouphrios', 'Koumasa', 'Myrtos', 'Pyrgos' and 'Salame' wares. 29 Warren 1972a, 133-4: 'Myrtos ware'. 30 Cf. Cadogan 2010, 42-3. 31 Evans 1895, 105-16, 124-6, 135-6; Brown 2001, 18. 32 Levi 1964, 5. 33 For example, Wilson (2007, 58, 64, 73; cf. Momigliano 2007c, 84) refers to red and black slipped wares which often have light-on-dark decoration. We see these as having a wash. On the other hand, Wilson (2007, 54) does use the term 'wiped and/or washed ware', especially for our type 12 large jugs, and writes of 'an added wash of diluted red to dark brown paint or slip'. The 'wash' seems then to refer only to dilute solutions of pigment rather than, in our terms, any application of paint overall or covering a large area of the vessel — an effect that was probably achieved by immersing the vessel in a vat or other receptacle containing the coloured wash.</page><page sequence="40">EARLY MINOAN I: THE PALACE WELL ll V 1 J %WI / Jh V V 777^5^ i' \ 3 M P"1 ^ J C i \ \ i j 15 try ~77 10 ». m y 14 Fig. 3.3.

There are even hints of the light-on-dark style decoration, with white paint on a dark surface, which is in evidence from the beginning of EM II and which, with the growth of the fashion for dark washed wares, largely supplanted dark-on-light decoration by the end of that period and in EM III. Surface colour and finish seem to be matters of deliberate choice. Thus a dark grey or, more rarely, light brown or red surface decorated with pattern burnish is characteristic of the fine tableware chalices and pedestal bowls of types 1 and 2. Bowls of type 8 with pattern burnish normally appear to have light brown or reddish surfaces. Smaller bowls, with a wide variety of surface colour, may also have simple pattern burnish. A light slip with painted decoration in shades of red, brown or black is virtually confined to jugs with cutaway spouts of type 11.</page><page sequence="41">28 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN SCORED WARE Scored (or wiped) ware has received several names that all describe the same practice: scored ware; scored style; wiped ware, and wiped and/or washed ware; and brushed ware.34 The large water jugs of type 12, and some large bowls (types 6 and 7), had their surfaces wiped or scraped in a way that left fine scorings over them. In EM I at Knossos, and to a lesser extent in EM II, scoring (or wiping) of this kind seems to have been used on these larger vessels for decorative appeal. The direction of the scoring is controlled; on jugs of type 12 vertical strokes on the upper parts of the bodies contrast with horizontal strokes round the bottoms, while diagonal strokes are normal on bowls of types 6 and 7. The diagonal tendency of the scoring on these bowls might even be considered as an embryonic manifestation of that feeling for torsion or spiralling movement, which is such a striking feature of subsequent Minoan art. Surfaces treated in this way were at home in many other parts of Crete during the earlier part of Early Minoan; they are variously described as wiped, brushed, combed, or scored. Fragments of such scored ware from the Lera cave on Akrotiri assigned to EM I come from jugs or bowls with horizontal handles like those from the Well;35 but this treatment of the surface is already attested at Knossos in FN when red 'wiped' ware became characteristic.36 It continued to be used, in a conservative way, for the surfaces of bowls and jars of cooking pot fabric into later EM II (e.g. EM II types 11 and 18). The Trapeza ware of Lasithi, which used to be assigned to LN in general and has recently been placed in (Knossian) FN IV,37 'often shows shallow scorings, as though from wiping while wet'.38 A similar treatment of the surface is also usual on the standard class A Red ware of FN Phaistos.39 Vagnetti draws a contrast between this scored ware from Phaistos and the heavily scored surfaces of comparable ware from Debla, where this type of scored ware is very much at home in phase I, on both jugs and bowls, and appears to have almost ceased in phase II.40 The treatment of the surfaces of the type 12 jugs from the Well seems closer to that of the Phaistos Red ware than to that of the Debla scored ware.41 This may have a chronological significance. Wiped or scored wares are attested at other sites in central Crete besides Knossos,42 but they do not seem much in evidence in eastern Crete;43 in southern Crete they are reported from Phaistos, Ayia Triada and Ayia Kyriaki.44 In western Crete, however, they appear common, notably in several caves.45 Faure lists 12 on the northern slopes of the White Mountains,46 to which one may add the Lera and Arkoudia caves on the Akrotiri peninsula.47 Faure called this ware 'Subneolithic', but emphasised that it may in fact be contemporary with Early Minoan, and may even have continued in use in this part of Crete until the beginning of the period of the New Palaces. The evidence from Debla, however, shows that the ware was on the wane there by phase II. We should also note its appearance — perhaps at the western and offshore end of a string of sites on Crete48 — on Kythera in deposit α at Kastraki (next to Kastri and part of the same occupation nexus)49 in the Orange Micaceous fabric, produced most likely in the north of that island and dated to EB II by Broodbank and Kiriatzi. They recognise, however, that most parallels in Crete are dated to EM I, although they suggest the possibility that the practice continued into EM IIA, to judge from likely evidence from Nopigeia.50 34 Betancourt 2008b, 64; Tomkins 2007, 46; Wilson 2007, 64 (recognising two fabrics: 'fine reddish brown with a reduced core and fine orange buff'). 35 Guest-Papamanoli and Lambraki 1976, 201. 36 Furness 1953, 95, 126-8; cf.J.

(2000, 202-03, 205, fig. 14: 62-3 (jugs), 64 (jar)) call it combed, suggesting that it was made with a comb or bunch of pointed reeds; cf. also 204-05, fig. 14: 67 and perhaps 68 (jar sherds): 67 has punctuated decoration made with a comb, and 68 seems similar. 43 Betancourt 1985, 31. 44 Phaistos: Todaro 2005, 36-7 (and assigned to EM IA); Ayia Triada: Todaro 2003, 75; 2005, 21.

Wilson and Day call this 'comb-pricked decoration', listing this (1994, 14: FG 68) and other vessels with this decoration from Koumasa (1994, 14-15: FG 66, FG 71) and Gournia (1994, 17: FG 89). 45 Warren and Tzedakis 1974, 324. 46 Faure 1969, 201, n. 2. 47 Guest-Papamanoli and Lambraki 1976, 198-202, 211, 238. 48 Guest-Papamanoli and Lambraki (1976, 201) suggest that these are probably Cretan imports. 49 Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 80, pi. 16: 41-6, 51. 50 Broodbank and Kiriatzi 2007 (an important reassessment of Kastri/Kastraki deposits α and β, dating α to a span from FN through EB I to advanced EB II), 250-1, n. 62 and n. 66.

How was the scoring of the surface done? Possible instruments may have been a bunch of twigs, or rough cloth, stiff brush or potter's comb. Blackman and Branigan suggested wiping with cloth or grass,55 and Alexiou use of a comb or brush.56 Guest-Papamanoli thought a brush unlikely, preferring a potter's comb, made perhaps of schist, with irregular shallow teeth.57 For Debla Warren suggested that it was done 'possibly with the firm spiky ends of a bunch of straws or with firm brushwood or with a bone or obsidian point'.58 A stiff coarse brush, used while the clay was still damp and soft, seems as likely as anything to have produced the wiping and scoring on the jugs and bowls from the Well. Outside Crete, wiped, combed or scored surfaces of this kind are found on vessels of local manufacture in other parts of the Aegean besides Kythera at about this time, for instance at LN Kephala on Kea;59 and scoring is still in evidence on some pottery of EC II/EH II from Ayia Irini on that island.60 On the Greek mainland scored surfaces appear on local wares at the beginning of EB, from the Peloponnese to Thessaly and Macedonia.61 The fashion for treating the surfaces of vessels in this way may have spread to the Aegean from the east, and could reflect the imitation of imported container vessels in the first instance. It is found, of course, on the imported Scored Ware of Troy, which was most at home in Middle and Late Troy I, but occurred, although not abundantly, in early levels of Troy II.62 The Obsidian ware of Emporio in Chios may be the same as Trojan Scored ware and was certainly exotic there:63 it occurred in small quantities in levels of (pre-Troy) periods VII and VI, which may overlap with Kephala on Kea, as well as from levels of periods V-IV and II contemporary with Troy I and perhaps the early part of Troy II. The fragment of another import (not Obsidian ware) from an Emporio VI deposit has the surface scored in a manner very reminiscent of the jugs from the Well;64 it may even come from a jug, although perhaps not a Cretan one, since no (other) Minoan imports were recognised at Emporio. The ceramica striata occurring at Poliochni in Blue levels, and abundant in Green and Red levels, also appears comparable with Trojan Scored Ware.65 The fragments of this come apparently from large globular jars with a variety of rims and a pair of wide strap handles on the belly. Trojan Scored Ware vessels may have been of a similar type.66 Blegen thought that Scored Ware found its way to Troy from somewhere in the Aegean.67 French reported similar sherds from other third millennium sites in NW Turkey,68 and indicated that such large vessels might have been of local manufacture; but their size would not militate against their being imports if they had served as containers for a foreign liquid substance, like the Palestinian jars which reached the Aegean later in the Bronze Age. Mellaart noted a coarse scored ware as characteristic of the early phase of EB in the Konya plain,69 and suggested that Trojan Scored Ware might be related to it: the shapes seem to be mostly large vessels with funnel necks and ledge handles. Scored ware is attested as early as the Late Chalcolithic (Can Hasan level 1) in the Konya region, and in EB I and II in Cilicia.70 Some pottery from EB I Tarsus71 has the surface treated in a way that is very reminiscent of EM I scored ware at Knossos. 51 Alexiou 1964, 446, pl. 523α. 52 Hood 1981, 188. 53 E.g.

Similar combing is also attested on vessels from the EB I horizon at Ras Shamra.73 In Palestine combing of the surface to form deliberate patterns became common from EB I onwards. Two-handled jars with pattern combing of this kind, but of shapes comparable to those suggested by the fragments of scored ware found at Poliochni, were being exported as containers from Palestine to Egypt during EB III contemporary with the Old Kingdom;74 and fragments of jars with similar pattern combing are also found in Syrian EB III.75 Somewhat different are some large bowls or open jars of coarse fabric with thick walls from the Well have deep lattice scoring (or gouging) on their insides: plates 6: 53, 17: 158. Scoring of this type, which is found on the insides of tubs and other large open vessels in Crete from EM II onwards, was evidently not decorative; signs of wear on the inside surface of 158 suggests that the fragments from the Well with scoring of this kind belonged to vessels used perhaps for grinding. For this and other possible uses, including as beehives for honey, see below (p. 59 and n. 288). LIGHT GREY WARE Rim 109 which appears to have belonged to a suspension pot is indistinguishable in fabric from the light grey ware so well known in EM IIA. It occurs, however, occasionally in other EM I contexts at Knossos.76 For more on this ware, see pp. 247-52. Shapes The pottery is fragmentary except for the small water jug 89 of type 12 from deposit 1 at the bottom of the Well. Although very few complete profiles could be restored, we could establish the shapes and the range of types represented by the fragments with a fair degree of accuracy. Thus, fig. 3.3 gives a reasonable idea of the range of pottery used domestically at Knossos in EM I. The vessels tend to be large, although a few small, almost miniature pieces occur, like juglet 95. The two commonest shapes in fine pattern burnish ware are the chalice (type 1) and the large pedestal bowl (type 2) which were, perhaps, the standard drinking cup and food vessel at the time. Chalices of type 1 were rare, if not entirely unknown, in the Neolithic. It is perhaps significant that no chalice was recognised in the abundant FN pottery of Phaistos. At the same time fragments of tall pedestals of rather different shapes were identified by Furness in deposits of all phases of Neolithic from Evans's excavations at Knossos.77 Some of these fragments may be rims of bowls, as she noted; but the diameters, if correctly estimated, and the poverty of the burnish on the insides of the pieces, are consistent with the idea that most of them at any rate come from pedestals. The bell-shaped pedestals that Furness assigns to EN I onwards are paralleled on Saliagos, and in the Halafian of the Levant.78 The chalices of type 1 may be ancestors at a long remove of the eggcup footed goblets of EM II and III and MM I (fig. 5.1: 2); and Evans noted how the 'numerous cups with low pedestals' of EM II 'fit on to an E. M. I type'.79 The possibility of a derivation of the clay footed goblet from small metal cups of the same size and shape introduced for wine drinking is discussed below (p. 103).80 Some type 1 chalices and some of the pedestal bowls of type 2 may have been provided with lids (types 17 and 18), as suggested in fig. 3.8A. A large handled bowl or cup (type 4) seems to occur, but is distinctly rare, as is its EM II successor, the cup with an exaggerated handle. Bowls of types 5-9 may be decorated with pattern burnish or have their surfaces wiped. The bases of these bowls are often differentiated by a carination; but bases, whether carinated or not, are almost always rounded. 72 Hennessy 1967, 31-2, 72-3. 73 Schaeffer 1962, 452, fig. 41C; 472-3. 74 Hennessy 1967, 72. 75 Schaeffer 1962, 428-9, figs. 16, 18; cf.

Jugs have pinched-in mouths (type 12) or cutaway spouts (type 11). The large water jugs from the bottom of the Well have pinched-in mouths, and large jugs in general appear to be of this type 12; but small and medium sized jugs with painted decoration (type 11 ) normally have cutaway spouts. The two suspension pots (type 14) of which large fragments were recovered are both of fine pattern burnish ware. Little lids of type 15 evidently belonged to suspension pots like these. No fragments of cylindrical pyxides were noted from the Well. Examples from Ayia Fotia (Siteia), where they have been called 'spool pyxides', belong to the Cycladic school/style of potting found there and at sites on or near the coast in north-central Crete.81 They may now even validate the old, but disputed date in EM I for the example with incised decoration from the Patema ossuary at Palaikastro.82 Store jars with collar necks and apparently globular bodies (type 13), and large thick-walled pithoi, were evidently in use at the time of the Palace Well. Other EM I pithoi are now known from Knossos, Kalo Chorio and Aphrodite's Kephali.83 The vessels grouped together under type 19, if they were not plates or dishes or vessel stands, may have served as lids for pithoi and store jars. Open trough-like spouts, common in every subsequent Minoan period, are found on bowls, and there is one nozzle spout. Bases of small vessels, such as suspension pots of type 14, may have little lug-like pellet feet (e.g. 154) of a kind that continued to occur in EM II and into MM I. Handles are normally circular or thick oval in section. There is no example of a pushed-through handle of the type that has been regarded as characteristic for the Aegean EBA, although sporadic examples of such handles are found from later periods in Crete,84 including one from the early EM IIA WCH.85 Feet of tripod cooking pots, which appear in EM II and are common in all subsequent Minoan periods, are conspicuously absent from the Palace Well. While we used to believe that tripod cooking pots were not used at Knossos, nor probably in Crete as a whole, in EM I, implying a significant change in ways of cooking when they did arrive in EM II,86 we now know of examples from Ayia Fotia (Siteia);87 but the floruit of that cemetery, if principally late EM I, seems to have continued into EM II (see below p. 116). TYPE 1. CHALICES 1-6 Chalices are very common.88 The rims are normally incurving in contrast to the straight or slightly outcurving rims of the larger pedestal bowls of type 2. The rim diameter is large, from about 16 to 30, but in most cases between 18 and 22. Only two complete profiles are preserved to show the height: 1 is 22 high with a rim diameter of 22-24, 2 χ8·5 high with a diameter of 20. The rims tend to be rather pointed, but not unduly thickened. Lids of type 17 of similar fabric to our chalices may have been used with them, as we suggest in fig. 3.8A. A chalice comparable to those from the Well in shape and size came from the upper level β89 of what Tomkins calls House Κ below the Central Court of the Palace, assigning the material to his Stratum IB of EM I.90 Evans had placed it at the very end of Neolithic, and Mackenzie in 'Sub-Neolithic' (i.e. EM I).91 Evans noted finding 'other fragmentary specimens' of this type 'in a similar medium' beneath the pavement on the Ν border of the Central Court in 1913.92 Fragments of similar chalices, however, which he had previously illustrated as 'Sub-Neolithic',93 were described as Late Neolithic.94 81 E.g.

MacGillivray (1984, 73) 76—7, n. 5) at one time thought it might be an EC IIIB import, but later referred it to a class of cylindrical pyxides with burnished surfaces, such as those in the Vat Room Deposit (Momigliano 1991, 171, 175, pis. 23, 26: 50-5), now placed in MM IB (MacGillivray 2007, 107-08). Clay analysis suggests that the Knossian examples are likely to have been made in Crete (MacGillivray et al. 1988, calling it 'Dark-faced Incised Ware'). The idea that the cylindrical pyxis developed first in the Cyclades during the Grotta-Pelos phase of EC I (Doumas 1977, 16; Broodbank 2000, 168-9, %· 49a; cf. also Momigliano 1991, 171) is supported by the Cycladic-style finds from Ayia Fotia and other north coast sites.

Type 1 chalices 1, 6; type 2 pedestal bowls 7-8, 10, 12; type 3 pedestal (?) dish 19; pedestals 20-22, 24. Scale 1:3. There is no indication that the chalices of type 1 from the Well or similar vessels from other contexts at Rnossos had lugs or handles of any kind. The absence of lugs or handles distinguishes our type 1 chalices from the larger pedestal bowls of type 2. It also distinguishes them from the chalices at Pyrgos which, in other respects including size, appear to correspond to our type 1 rather than type 2. The shapes of these Pyrgos chalices appear more sophisticated, and their stems are thinner at the top at the junction with the bowl; in compensation perhaps for this, the top of the stem just below the bowl is often strengthened with a ring or bulb. Such a ring or bulb at the junction of the stem and the bowl</page><page sequence="46">EARLY MINOAN I: THE PALACE WELL 33 we took originally to suggest that they are later in EM I, and even a hallmark of 'EM IB'. The use of grooved decoration in place of, or in combination with, pattern burnish (as seen on several of the Pyrgos chalices) also appeared to be a relatively late feature. There is no hint of a ring or bulb on any of the chalices or pedestal bowls of types 1 and 2 from the Well. At the same time there is not a great deal of evidence for pedestals with rings or bulbs in the material from the old excavations at Knossos (cf. pp. 282, 289). Evans published a high-footed goblet with a marked ring around the waist,95 coming from the lower level a in the Central Court which he assigned to LN, and Tomkins places in FN IV:96 it has incised decoration and is relatively small (only 7-8 high to judge from the scale). Evans's drawing is a restoration but, if correct, would certainly justify his comparison with Egyptian Early Dynastic copper goblets of the same size and shape;97 and Xanthoudides thought that these chalices might be imitations of metal prototypes.98 The closest among the chalices illustrated from Pyrgos to those from the Well in shape is only 15 high and has pattern burnish; the handles below the rim on this resemble the handles on the large pedestal bowls of type 2 from the Well.99 Evans observed that the fine texture of the Pyrgos chalices also suggested 'metallic influences, which towards the close of this Period may certainly be taken into account'.100 A chalice from Malia somewhat resembles those from the Well in shape and size (Ht rest. 18.5) and, like them, has no lugs or handles; but the straight narrow stem is more reminiscent of stems assigned to EM IIA, and there is no pattern burnish decoration. Its associations seem relatively late.101 A chalice comparable in shape to the Malia one but smaller (Ht 15) from Vasiliki must also be EM IIA.102 Evans set it in the same horizon as the chalices from Pyrgos,103 but it corresponds to a type of chalice in dark grey burnished ware represented by fragments from the WCH, where they are grouped under goblets.104 Renfrew, noting that this Vasiliki (not Gournia!) chalice should be placed at the beginning of EM II, observes that it differs from the Pyrgos chalices, and cites parallels from the Cyclades.105 This, however, and other vessels which are like it in shape and come from the same horizon in the Cyclades, are of a rather different type, with bowls that are relatively wide and shallow compared with those of EM chalices.106 The only fragment of a chalice from Debla comes from phase I and could have belonged to a vessel like those from the Well.107 There are other hints that chalices and pedestal bowls were at home in parts of western Crete in EM I. A rim from one of four chalices in the Lera cave has pattern burnish decoration of a zigzag above parallel lines, exactly like a motif standard on fragments from the Well;108 and a goblet from the Platyvola cave appears to have pattern burnish inside and outside the bowl.109 In southern Crete chalices and pedestal bowls appear at home at Phaistos in the horizon(s) immediately after the end of FN there, with swellings at the tops of stems and grooved decoration. Todaro suggests that pedestal bowls in dark grey burnished ware appeared in what she defines as EM IA and pattern burnished chalices in her EM IB.110 Her EM IA examples include a tall foot/pedestal with painted horizontal red lines on the foot over burnishing.111 Similarly, chalices were not uncommon it seems at Ayia Kyriaki: fragments in various fabrics include plain, dark burnished, grey burnished and red slipped and burnished wares, besides pattern burnished ware; but the illustrations suggest that they all had a rib around the waist.112 No chalices of any kind, however, were preserved enough in the early deposit of Lebena T. II to be catalogued, although there were five pedestal bases among loose sherds, which may include chalices,113 albeit very few when compared to the rest of the pottery. None seems to have been recorded from any of the Mesara tombs. 95 PM II, 10-11, fig. 3 m.

The insides of the pedestals, which are not smoothed or burnished, often show the horizontal fingermarks of the potter; and these are so regular that on small fragments they could be taken for the marks of the fast wheel. Hazzidakis thought that the bowl of a chalice from Arkalochori showed the marks of the wheel, although still in a primitive state:120 there would appear to be no question of the fast wheel, however, in Crete in this early period. The clay is fine. Exposed surfaces are occasionally light grey, but normally dark grey in colour, verging to black in the burnished parts: in a number of cases light brown, more rarely shades of dark brown, once or twice red-brown, but not it seems true red. The surface of a vessel can vary in colour, ranging through shades of light and dark brown with dusky patches; but some of these variations were evidently caused by unequal exposure to fire of pieces of a vessel after it had broken. Of the three joining rim fragments of 3, one is dark grey, another dark brown, and the third light brown (plate 3). The chalice from which these came may have originally had a dark grey surface, like plate 3: 3A. The insides of the bowls of the chalices are more or less well burnished all over. The outsides are burnished for decorative effect: a band of solid burnish around the rim above a reserved zone with thin horizontal stripes of pattern burnish, normally five or six, but sometimes as many as seven or eight. The lower parts of the bowls and the stems are burnished with vertical strokes, sometimes to give an overall burnish, but usually with gaps between the strokes leaving reserved strips, it seems as a deliberate decorative effect, e.g. plate 3: 21. On rim 4 with a light brown surface the wide burnishing strokes have their edges furred (plate 3). The effect, which is similar to that of MM III tortoiseshell ripple, appears deliberate, created perhaps by burnishing the surface while the clay was wet or, less probably, by scraping it to make reserved strips after it had been burnished. Rim 5121 (D. c. 17) which may have belonged to a chalice is exceptional (plate 3). In fabric and finish it resembles the bowls of type 4 (below). The inside is wiped, while the light and reddish brown to dusky outside, is well smoothed with vertical strokes of pattern burnish as found on bowls of types 4 and 5. Another unique rim 6 (D. 18) (fig. 3.4, plate 17), which may have belonged to a chalice, is of coarse fabric: the surface is shades of brown, wiped inside and out. 1 fig. 3.4, plate 2.

LARGE PEDESTAL BOWLS 7-18 There are many fragments of these bowls, which were clearly a standard type in EM I culinary/ consuming practices.122 No fragments, however, have been identified in FF4.123 They evidently have pedestals like the chalices of type 1; but unfortunately no pedestal would join a bowl, and no complete profile was recovered: the total heights of this type cannot therefore be estimated. Rims range in diameter from about 28 to 40 with some, it would seem, as much as 50 or more. A good many of the rims seem to have a diameter of c. 35. The rims of these large pedestal bowls are normally straight or slightly outcurving in contrast to the incurving rims characteristic of the chalices of type 1. The tops of the rims are in general simple, being (a) rounded, or (b) flattened, like 7 (fig. 3.4; D. 22),124 or sometimes (c) slightly thickened and everted, like 8. One or two large rims, which may be from vessels of this type, have (d) a wide rib round the outside, like 9 (plate 4)125 and 10 (fig. 3.4; D. 30). 10 is of unusually coarse fabric, more like that of the thick-walled dishes of types 6 and 7; its surface is reddish, wiped inside and outside instead of being burnished. Small vertical round section handles set just below the rim appear to have been common, and may have been the rule, on bowls of this type, like 11 (plate 4). Some handles are very small and approximate to horizontally perforated lugs, like 12 (fig. 3.4, plate 4; D. 30). It looks as if each bowl had only one handle, like 11 and 13-13A (plate 4), or a pair of handles set close together, like 14 (plate 4), rather than handles set on opposite sides of the rim. Rim 15 (plate 4)126 has a pair of string-holes, and three other fragments preserve a single hole just below the rim, including plate 4: 16-17. These are probably for rivets for mending the vessels, since in every case they appear to flank an old break:127 large vessels of fine ware like this were no doubt difficult to make and prized. Their superior fabric and the degree of standardisation in shape and decoration suggest that they, like the chalices of type 1, may have been the work of specialist potters, and not manufactured by each family as it had occasion.128 In fabric and finish the pedestal bowls of type 2 resemble the chalices of type 1 but, in view of their larger size, the fabric is apt to be somewhat coarser. On the outside they are decorated with pattern burnish on a similar system to the chalices of type 1. Some, like the chalices, have a zone of horizontal stripes of pattern burnish below the rim, but there are usually about 10 stripes instead of the five or six normal on the chalices. Bowls of type 2, however, are often adorned with a characteristic wavy band of pattern burnish immediately below the burnished section of rim, between it and the zone of horizontal stripes, as on 8, 14-15 and 17-18 (plates 4-5). Large pedestal bowls of this kind do not appear much in evidence after the Palace Well.129 Some fragments of rims with handles and simple vertical pattern burnish from a sounding on the w side of the Central Court at Phaistos look quite similar.130 These are illustrated alongside FN material that was apparently found with them. 8 FIG. 3.4, plate 4. 1/2 rim and stump of handle pres. brown surface, well burnished inside; the outside with Ht pres. 11.

DISH 19 Two rim scraps of fine grey-brown burnished ware resemble one with an indication of what appears to be a flat base from FF4.131 No evidence for the existence of flat bases was noted from the Well, however; and two small shallow dishes from the deposit below Mochlos T. V usually assigned to EM I have pedestals.132 It is possible then that our rims come from vessels of this type rather than from flat-bottomed dishes. 122 Wilson and Day (2000, 59-60) suggest that they would have been parts of sets with the chalices, and may have been like kraters for mixing drink rather than for more solid food. See also Wilson 2007, 54. 123 Wilson 1985, 364.

Rim. D. 15. Fine fabric. Grey brown clay with surface the same colour; underside well burnished; upper inside decorated with pattern burnish. PEDESTALS 20-27 Fragments of these are extremely common. Their diameter at the base ranges from c. 9 to 25, e.g. 20. Most of the smaller pedestals no doubt belong to chalices of type 1, the larger to bowls of type 2. Pedestals are normally burnished on the outside. The straight vertical stroke burnishing is often partial, with gaps left between the areas of burnish, evidently with decorative intent. On some of the large pedestals the burnishing appears to have been slight and superficial. One or two fragments from what seem to be the bottom edges of large pedestals have no traces of burnishing at all: these may be from pedestals belonging to some other shape than the chalices and bowls of types 1 and 2. A few scraps from the edges of small pedestals show a distinct bead, e.g. 21 (fig. 3.4; D. base 12). 22 (fig. 3.4, plate 5) from a large pedestal (D. base c. 20), of fine orange clay with a paler orange surface and vertical pattern burnish, has a rib round the edge. 23, probably from another large pedestal, has a white slip, smoothed or burnished on the outside (plate 5). One fragment of soft orange-buff clay is apparently from a pedestal, but has traces of burnishing inside, while the outside shows slight traces of a red wash which seems not to have been burnished. We list three pedestals: 20 FIG. 3.4. D. base 24. Surface shades of light and dark brown, burnished outside. 24 FIG. 3.4, plate 5. D. base 15.

Levels 7, 8, 10, etc. A pedestal fragment with a line of burnish along the bottom and groups of vertical stripes of pattern burnish rising from, or descending to, it as on 27 (plate 3) was found in a later deposit in Vano LXIV at Phaistos.133 type 4. deep cups or bowls with incurving rim and single large vertical handle 28-30 These are evidently rare. They are interesting as possible ancestors of the cups with exaggerated handles that are characteristic, although they never appear to have been common, in EM II (our EM II type 1A: pp. 102, 248 (1186) and 267-8 (1301) below). It is not even entirely certain that the fragments from the Well assigned to this type come from bowls with only one handle rather than two opposite handles, since two-handled cups or bowls occur in contexts of EM I and II. Only handles 28-29 seem assignable to this type of bowl (plate 5); but rim 30 (plate 5), and a rounded base of orange clay, are also likely to come from bowls with such handles. Bases may also have been carinated. The two handles are circular in section, and comparatively large; they evidently rose higher than the bowl rim; their clay is orange or greenish with a paler slip of the same colour. Some of the bowls of this type appear to have been decorated with pattern burnish, e.g. 29 (fig. 3.5); but others may have had painted decoration, since one of the two fragments of rim with handles bears traces of a patch of thin black paint on the outside of the rim. The simple rim fragment 30 assigned to this type similarly has a patch of thick matt red paint on the outside. A Minoan chalice from Ayia Fotia (Siteia) is a pedestalled version of this type.134 A cup or bowl with a single handle from Pyrgos has a rounded base as assumed for type 4, but the handle is exaggeratedly large as on EM II vessels of this type, and the top of it is set below the rim instead of to it.135 A cup from Chania-Kastelli with rounded base and a single large handle, whose top is level with the rim, is grouped as EM I.136 EM II cups or bowls with a single large handle have flat bases.137 TYPE 5. BOWLS WITH INCURVING RIM AND ONE OR MORE SMALL vertical handles 31-39 Only rim fragments survive, with diameters on average of c. 18-20. Four or five of these have parts of vertical handles set just below the rim. The bowls to which they belong may have had two handles, and some at least of them appear to have had open trough spouts. Three small fragments of rims from bowls of this or a related type have vertically perforated lugs set on the rim, e.g. 32 (plate 16) and 33 (fig. 3.5). 153 Levi 1958A, 218, fig. 34. 134 See n. 119. 135 Xanthoudides 1918a, 147, fig. 7: 28; 149. 136 Tzedakis 1972, 635, pi. 595P. 137 E.g.

Some of these bowls may have had carinated bases rather than simple rounded bases as shown on 31 in fig. 3.5. Fabric There is considerable variation in the fabric of these bowls, some being of fine, others of rather coarse ware. The inside surfaces are not smoothed or burnished, but look as if they had been wiped with the fingers or a cloth. The outsides normally and, occasionally, all or part of the insides as well have a slip or wash, in most cases a shade of grey or brown or orange, but sometimes green as on 35 (plate 5). The outside slip often laps over the top of the rim inside, where its colour may be in marked contrast to the colour of the clay of the rest of the inside of the vessel, e.g. 36.138 The outsides — but never, it seems, the insides — of these bowls are normally smoothed, and the smoothed surface is characteristically decorated with thin strokes of vertical pattern burnish descending from a burnished band round the rim, e.g. 31 and 34. Rim 37 (fig. 3.5, plate 6) with a vertical handle is exceptional: of fine orange clay with a white, slightly greenish slip on the outside, it has a dark purplish wash all over the inside, and is decorated outside with vertical stripes of the same dark purplish paint. Two-handled bowls like 31 but with simple painted decoration are attested at Kyparissi and Pyrgos, and in the lower stratum of Lebena T. II.139 An upright bowl rim from Debla with a lug set to it resembles 3 2.140 Bowls with vertically perforated lugs like this on or just below the rim appear to be at home in Crete in FN and EM I—II contexts. Some bowls from Partira have a single lug of this kind,141 and two bowls from Kyparissi a pair of such lugs, one each side of the rim.142 A pair of neat vertically perforated lugs appear in this position on the rim of a shallow spouted bowl from Fournou Korifi II.143 TYPE 6. BOWLS OF COARSE WARE WITH WIPED SURFACE AND INCURVING RIM 40-44 A number of rims and fragments are assignable to this type, but no complete profiles. The rims seem to range in diameter from 20 to 40 or more; they are sometimes thickened, e.g. 40 (fig. 3.5, plate 6; D. 46), 41 (fig. 3.5, plate 6; D. 40) and 42 (plate 6). The fabric is coarse, the clay shades of dark grey brown to black, lighter brown or reddish. The insides of these bowls are wiped, and the outsides, except for a reserved zone round the top of the rim, wiped or scraped with bold diagonal strokes, which seems to be decorative in intent. In effect, the fabric of these bowls is embryo cooking pot ware, and the bowls of this type and type 7 may be the ancestors of the bowls and jars of cooking pot fabric with wiped outside surfaces that are common in EM II. 41 in particular is in fabric akin to the cooking pot ware of EM II: it is of coarse very gritty reddish clay with a red wash, diagonally wiped outside. Rims 43-44 (plate 6) assignable to this type are not wiped outside but have bold diagonal incisions. These do not seem to be Neolithic strays but, together with the miniature jug 88 (plate 9), are the only examples of true incised decoration from the Well: this rarity agrees with the marked decline in the fashion for it at the end of the Neolithic at Knossos.144 TYPE 7. BOWLS WITH RIM THICKENED INTERNALLY, AND HORIZONTAL OR VERTICAL HANDLES 45-59 A good many rims may be grouped under this heading (fig. 3.5). They vary in size and in the angles at which they are set. In diameter they seem to range from about 26 to 50, with many around 30, as 45-46; but the larger rims 47-58 evidently have a diameter of 40 to 50 or more. Three or four rims of this type have horizontal handles set well below them, e.g. 45; but there are at least two with vertical handles. There is no evidence for the kind of base which went with these bowl rims; some bases may have been carinated, e.g. 59 (plate 6). Several of the smaller rims are of good fabric with their surfaces smoothed if not burnished. But most rims of this type belong to vessels of rather coarse ware. The surface often has clear traces of a wash or slip, in shades of grey or brown, or even red, and is normally wiped outside: the wiping is usually diagonal as on the rims of type 5. The somewhat anomalous rim 51 grouped here has pattern burnish outside. 138 Wilson ancJ £)ay sample KN 92/15. 139 Kyparissi: Alexiou 1951, 27g, pi. 13.2: 3; Pyrgos: Xanthoudides 1918a, 145, fig. 6: 16; 149; Lebena: Alexiou and Warren 2004, 111-12, fig. 31, pi. 105: 501. 140 Warren and Tzedakis 1974, 322-3, fig. 18 bottom left: not well stratified and so assigned between Phases I and III. 141 Type A in Mortzos's classification of the Partira bowls: Mortzos 1972, 389-go, pis. 8-24, 40.

DEEP BOWLS WITH HORIZONTAL HANDLES AND CARINATED BASE 60-64 Bowl 60 (fig. 3.6), of which several non-joining fragments survive, appears to have had two opposite handles, an open trough spout between them, and a carinated base. Rims assignable to this type range in general from c. 20 to 25 in diameter; but one rim at least seems as little as c. 16-18. Some of the five or six open spouts found in the Well may belong to bowls like this. Nearly all of the smaller carinated bases from the Well are burnished or have pattern burnish inside, and are evidently from bowls of this or a similar type. There is considerable variation in fabric. In some cases fine straw impressions and grit show clearly in the break and in those parts of the surface that are not burnished. The insides and outsides are burnished overall, or decorated with thin stripes of pattern burnish: outside, vertical or diagonal lines, which may descend from a band of burnishing round the top of the rim, e.g. 61 (plate 7); inside, irregular zones filled with parallel lines, the lines in one zone running at a different angle from those in the next, as on the base of 63. 64, with several fragments preserved, has thin matt paint, in shades of brown and red, slapped irregularly all over inside and outside.

BAKING PLATES 70-73 A number of fragments belong to early representatives of this type of cooking dish which is not attested in Crete in the Neolithic, but was in continuous use throughout the Minoan era.147 In diameter these EM I examples are large, over 40 or 50 across. The rims are always thickened, and the sides tail away to become very thin towards the middle. Fragments from the bases of these baking plates have never yet been identified in any Minoan period. May it be that only the rims were made in clay, and some perishable material was used to form the sides and bases? Or might the surviving rims have lined the edges of holes in the ground, as suggested by MacGillivray in the case of somewhat comparable vessels from the Early Cycladic settlement on Mount Kynthos on Delos?148 Their diameters seem to range from 43 to c. 60; and MacGillivray notes that they all appear to have been made in the ground and designed to remain in place in the floor. No Cretan baking plates, however, have been observed in association with a hollow in the ground in this manner. The rims of baking plates from the Well are of two kinds, with the outside either (a) differentiated, as 70-71,149 or (b) undifferentiated, as 72-72C (see fig. 3.6 and plate 8).150 One or two fragments of rims of class a are bent inwards like the cigarette-rest of an ashtray or a spout in reverse. This feature may be a spit rest. It is standard on baking plates at Myrtos-Pyrgos in period III (MM IIB), and still occurs on ones dating from the end of the Bronze Age or later.151 The Well baking plates are not exactly similar to those from FF4;152 but 72 has the rectangular section that Wilson contrasts with the rounded section of EM IIA baking plates.153 The fabric of the baking plates from the Well is virtually true cooking pot ware: coarse, gritty clay, in shades of dull brown or reddish; the grit abundant and large in size despite the thinness of the walls of the vessels; the surface has a brown to reddish wash, more or less smooth inside, characteristically rough below the rim zone outside. The fabric appears to be rather finer with rims of class b than with those of class a.154 73 may be grouped here. 147 Down to LM IIIC at least, as for instance at Karphi (Seiradaki i960, 9-10, pi. 2g) and Palaikastro-Kastri (Sackett et al. 1965, 285, 290 fig. np-s, pi. 78d).

JUGS WITH CUTAWAY SPOUT 77-88 These are much less in evidence and appear to have been generally smaller in size than the jugs of type 12. Bodies are evidently more or less rounded, and bases rounded or roughly flattened, although the small carinated base 86 (plate g) with red wash outside may have belonged to a jug of this kind. Handles are set to the rim, rather than to the neck below it as often in EM II and at Troy from period I onwards.155 No complete profile was found, but there are six or seven distinctive cutaway spouts like 77 (fig. 3.7), all except one with traces of painted decoration; the exception 78 is of light grey-brown clay with a plain burnished surface (plate 9). One uncatalogued fragment is clearly an import from the Mesara,156 and so very probably is 85 (plate g).157 Most of the jugs of this type were evidently decorated with painted designs. Indeed, it looks as if painted decoration with stripes in dark-on-light was virtually confined to jugs of type 11 : the only similar piece from a different shape was bowl rim 74 (plate 5), which may have been an import. Dark-on-light painted decoration similarly appears to be restricted to jugs in the FF4 deposit.158 On the other hand, the number of sherds from the Well with this decoration is very small; apart from 74, there are only the spouts, necks or substantial fragments of a dozen or more jugs (plate g). There is much variation in the fabric of type 11 painted jugs. The clay is in general orange and contains some grit. The outside was usually given a paler slip, buff as a rule, but sometimes greenish white or even reddish; it was normally well smoothed or burnished before decoration was applied. The paint for the decoration is matt or has only a slight lustre and ranges from bright red through shades of light and dark brown to black. The impression of variety in the colour of the paint may have been heightened by the effects of the fire in which the pottery (except for the water jars of type 12 found at the bottom of the Well) had been involved; but both the black and the bright red of some of the decoration appear to have been deliberate. The evidence from Knossos does not seem to indicate the existence of an earlier phase of dark-on-light with decoration in red followed by one with a vogue for decoration in brown.159 The designs in dark-on-light on pottery from the Well are extremely simple: horizontal stripes round the spouts and necks: 83 (plate 9); on the bodies, horizontal stripes: 85, or vertical stripes in groups as 84 (plate 9)160 and, most characteristically, diagonal stripes crossing to make a lattice. In three cases there is a solid blob inside the inverted triangle formed on the shoulder of the vessel by the diagonal lines which cross below the spout opposite the handle: 81 (plate 9). This scheme of decoration is exactly matched on a jug from Pyrgos.161 Blobs also occur in the EM I repertory at Kyparissi, where one fragment has several blobs incorporated into a linear scheme of decoration.162 In the zone under the handle there may be a single diagonal stripe as 85, or two crossing diagonals as 82 (plate 9).163 Crossing diagonals also occur in the handle zone on a squat jar from Kyparissi.164 155 Hood 1981, 188. 156 Wilson and Day 1994, 69, pi. lie: sample KN 92/38. 157 Wilson and Day 1994, 69, pi. 11 f: sample KN 92/34. 158 Wiison 1985, 361. 159 As Schachermeyr (1962, 118) suggested, distinguishing a 'Lebena' phase of EM I with decoration in red followed by an 'Ayios Onouphrios' phase with brownish decoration.

One handle is painted solid black on the top side.165 The lower parts of the bodies of the dark-on-light jugs from the Well were, sometimes at any rate, painted solid, e.g. 86 (plate 9). This system is paralleled on a suspension pot from Ayia Fotia (Ierapetra).166 The dark-on-light decoration on jugs from FF4 appears to be similar, but the wider painted bands noted on some fragments167 do not seem to be matched from the Well. The one jug neck from FF4 has horizontal banding like the Well necks.168 Horizontal stripes were still the standard scheme of decoration on jug necks at Knossos in EM IIA early.169 At Fournou Korifi this seems to have remained the usual way of decorating jug necks, when they were decorated at all, into period II (EM IIB).170 It is curious that only one of the jugs with decoration in dark-on-light from Kyparissi has stripes round the neck like this;171 the necks of the others are adorned with groups of diagonal or vertical lines. An unique fragment with painted decoration is from a miniature jug: 88 (plate g). It may have been a toy imitating a jug of this or another type. It is roughly made of orange clay without a slip. The surface was decorated with rude incisions, and then painted with horizontal stripes in red. The shapes and the normally yellowish surface colour of the jugs of type 11, taken in conjunction with their size, strongly suggest that they were copies in the first instance of similar jugs made out of gourds.172 The original gourd-jugs may have been decorated with comparable designs in red or black paint, but ultimately this type of decoration is probably based upon reproductions of the string nets or slings in which gourds were carried.173 Jugs of this type have been compared in the past with those of Troy I, but any resemblances are of a very general nature. Cutaway spouts characteristic of jugs of our type 11 occur on some Troy I jugs; but such spouts were never dominant at Troy or other sites of the Trojan cultural region, like Thermi or Emporio. At Emporio rare examples of cutaway spouts occur as early as period VII;174 and the jugs of (the pre-Troy) periods VII-VI are indeed in some respects more akin to those of EM I Crete, in terms of a relatively close dependence on gourd prototypes, although reflecting an entirely different tradition of adaptation of gourd forms to clay.175 TYPE 12. JUGS WITH GLOBULAR BODY AND PINCHED-IN SPOUT 89-IOO 'Or the pitcher be broken at the fountain' (Ecclesiastes 12.6) In deposit 1 at the bottom of the Well were parts of several jugs of type 12 that had been used for drawing water. Coming from the original use level of the Well, these are among its earliest pots and older than the burnt pottery of the fill (deposit 2) — but how much older, of course we cannot tell. These jugs have a wide, more or less flat mouth, with a roughly trefoil spout formed by pinching the sides of the rim together. Handles are circular or thick oval in section, set more or less to the rim (plate 11: 96-98). Bases are rounded or roughly flattened; some may have been carinated. Jugs of this type tend to be large compared with those of type 11. But miniature jug 95 (plate g) has a mouth and spout like this, although it bears painted decoration of the kind normally associated with jugs of type 11. The small jug 89 is complete, as is the large jug 90, except for bits of its body and most of the mouth and spout. There are also four complete bodies of similar large jugs, but no trace of their handles, necks or mouths, e.g. plate xo: 91-92. These jugs presumably broke when in use to draw water. Their body pieces fell in, but the necks and handles were pulled up and thrown away up on top. One of the bodies is 24 in diameter; the other three and the body of 90 are even larger (D. body 27-30). These large water jugs are all well made, with thin walls, although the grit used to temper the clay is upon occasion large and shows in the surface. They are also fired hard; but some jugs of this type were of softish fabric. The outside surfaces of jugs of type 12 normally at least appear to have been treated with a wash, in shades of grey to black, dark or light brown, or reddish. Before the wash was applied, the bodies of the jugs were wiped or scraped all over. On the upper parts of the six jug bodies from the bottom of the Well the wiping/scraping is vertical, or once at least (89) diagonal, but 166 Cf. a handle from FF4 covered in red paint (Wilson 1985, 361, pi. 56 right: middle row right). 166 Boyd Hawes et al. 1908, 56 fig. 38: 3; assigned by Evans [PMI, 63, fig. 27) and Pendlebury (1939, 51, pi. 9-2d) to EM I. 167 Wilson 1985, 361, pi. 56 right. 168 Wilson 1985, 361-2, fig. 42, pi. 56: FF8. 169 Wilson 1985, 321; 2007, 61-2, fig. 2.8. 170 E.g.

The contrast in the direction of the scraping on the upper and lower parts of the bodies appears to have been deliberate and no doubt had decorative intent. The necks of the jugs of this type were evidently left smooth in contrast to the scraped bodies, e.g. 93-94 (plate 11). This wiping or scraping of the surface continues a Neolithic practice (see p. 28 above). Knossos provides other examples of this type.176 The upper part of a jug from Platyvola looks comparable to type 12, but may be later than the Well examples, to judge from the position of the top of the handle, which joins the neck below the rim, and the boldness of the scoring.177 Two small, almost miniature jugs from Kyparissi with rounded bases and handles to the rim approximate to this type: one has a combed surface, the other a red wash178 (but other jugs from there with combed surfaces have cutaway spouts like our type 11).179 A rim fragment from Miamou reconstructed as part of a square mouth180 may have been a pinched-in spout;181 if so, it may be from a jug. 89 plate 10.

Upper surface of handle has irregular black wash. 98 Dusky orange clay with whiteish slip. Stripe in thin brown paint runs down top of handle. Two handles with warts on the top near the junction with the rim appear to come from large jugs, perhaps of type 12. Warts of this kind may be rare in Neolithic Knossos, but there appears to be one example of FN III date;182 and they are known at FN Phaistos.183 Such warts are reminiscent of metal rivets. On later Minoan vessels that are generally thought to be imitations of metal originals, there is often a clay 'rivet' in this position. It is of course possible that metal vessels were available as early as EM I in Crete, even if they were not made there. Xanthoudides thought that some vessels from the Pyrgos cave clearly reflected metal prototypes.184 99 fig. 3.7. Rim frag, with complete handle. Small, conical, nipple-like wart on top of handle.

Most of the jugs from Debla II have round section handles like 99 surmounted by similar small warts (pellets): Warren and Tzedakis 1974, 324-7, figs. 19: P7-10, 20: P12-13.

A large high wart resembling 100 appears on a cup handle from Kyparissi (Alexiou 1951, 279, pi. 14.1: 10). Bold warts also occur on some handles from Pyrgos (Xanthoudides 19180, 153, fig. 10: 81; 155; 157, fig. 12: 85), and there is a large, apparently flat-topped wart on the handle of a jug with painted decoration from Arkalochori (Hazzidakis 1913, 39, fig. 4r; 42). TYPE 13. COLLAR-NECKED JARS 101-104 Several rim fragments appear to be from jars of this type rather than from jugs of type 12. The rims evidently range in diameter from c. 12 to 22. All have a wash outside. Handles on the swelling of the body were presumably horizontal as on later examples of the type. Neolithic jars of an equivalent type normally have vertical handles, and this tradition is maintained in Phaistos FN.185 The type 176 Wilson and Day 2000, 40-1, pis. 8-9. 177 Alexiou 1964, 446, pi. 523α: ΈΜ II'. 178 Alexiou 1951, 278, pis. 13.1: 7, 14.2: 8. 179 Alexiou 1951, 278, pi. 13.1: 5-6. 180 Taramelli 1897, 303, fig. 14. 181 Vagnetti and Belli 1978, 135. 182 Stratum IIA Group (Tomkins 2007, 39-40, fig. 1.12: 26, calling it a 'horned handle'). 183 Vagnetti 1973a, 71, 76, fig. 6g: 22. 184 Xanthoudides 1918a, 156: 79; 157, 159: 82.

SUSPENSION POTS 105-III 105-106 are considerable parts of two suspension pots, both of somewhat squat globular shape, with at least two and perhaps four lugs, each lug having a single vertical, string-hole perforation. Both pots are of fine fabric with careful lattice pattern burnish on their shoulders. Their rims are missing, but the small collar rims 107 and 108 (fig. 3.8) evidently belong to suspension pots like these. It seems that other suspension pots in use at Knossos at the time of the Well had high rims and tall lids to fit, such as rim 109 and lid 114, like examples from Palaikastro-Ayios Nikolaos.188 The little jars of this type, much in evidence at the beginning of the EBA in Crete, are often called pyxides; but suspension pot is the traditional name for them, and is what Evans and Xanthoudides used, followed by Pendlebury and, more recently, Mortzos.189 The term 'pyxis' was originally confined to the more or less cylindrical boxes resembling later Greek ones of clay and marble that are still called by that name. This cylindrical (or spool) pyxis is totally different in shape, and clearly has a different ancestry,190 from the suspension pot, even if jars of both types were used for cosmetics. We believe that, to avoid confusion, we should keep the original name for the type 14 jars, even if it is somewhat misleading since, as Pendlebury noted,191 the lugs were probably not in fact intended for suspending the vessels but simply for fastening their lids. A suspension pot from Pyrgos with a dusky surface and four perforated lugs is like 105 in body shape and has a tall rim like 109 in profile,192 but most EM suspension pots have only two perforated lugs. One from the WCH is like 105 in shape,193 and one from Trapeza in light grey ware has two lugs and is close to type 14 in general.194 Some from Partira and elsewhere that have been assigned to FN, but which may be EM I in date,195 similarly have only two lugs. One from Partira has a low neck;196 the others illustrated from there, the Eileithyia cave and Palaikastro-Ayios Nikolaos all have tall necks.197 Suspension pots with a pair of lugs, each with a double or triple perforation, are known at Gournia and elsewhere.198 Small jars of various types akin to Cretan suspension pots and with two or four perforated lugs occur in the EBA in the Cyclades and on the Greek mainland; compare also the Trojan shape C27, found throughout early Troy I, and Emporio type 44.199 Fragments of small closed vessels of fine grey-brown ware with pattern burnish from the Well may come from suspension pots or larger jars of similar shape (plate 8 a). An unique tall rim 109 appears to have belonged to a suspension pot. In light grey ware (see p. 250), it is an import from the Mesara,200 joining an uncatalogued dark-on-light jug fragment and, most probably, 85 as evidence for the importing of pottery from there already in EM I. It is interesting to find this ware in the Well, since it is generally regarded as characteristic of EM IIA; but this is not the only instance of its occurring in an EM I context at Knossos.201 105 fig. 3.8, plate 12.

Fine sandy clay; inside, shades of light and dark brown to reddish; outside, shades of light and dark brown, well smoothed or burnished, with careful pattern burnish of two horizontal zones of lattice separated by one of chevrons.

In recent publications, Todaro (2001) uses pyxis (pisside) for what we call suspension pot, and Betancourt (2008A) pyxis for both cylindrical pyxides and suspension pots, as Galanaki (2006, 230, pi. 4) does also. Wilson and Day, however, have called 109 a suspension pot (1994, 11: FG48), while another EM I fragment from Knossos is a pyxis (1994, 10: FG 42; cf. Wilson 2007, 56 for date). 191 H. W.

SUSPENSION POT LID 112 Scrap H8 (fig. 3.8, plate 13) is evidently from the lid for a small suspension pot of type 14. This lid must have had at least two, and perhaps more likely four, string-hole lugs, of which only one is preserved. It is of soft grey-brown clay with burnishing only on the outside. Suspension pot lids of this type are very much at home in Early Minoan Crete. They have two or, more often, four perforated lugs, corresponding to the number of lugs on the body of the pot to which they belong.202 A small lid of type 15 with central knob, exactly like Troy shape D 11, from Pyrgos has four lugs;203 but an elegant lid from Partira, assignable to this type (rather than type 16), and the suspension pot to which it belongs have two lugs, as do other suspension pots from Partira and Palaikastro-Ayios Nikolaos and their lids.204 Lids of this type are akin to Troy shape D x 1, of the early subperiod of Troy I.205 These Trojan lids have four lugs, as do the small jars from Troy comparable with Cretan suspension pots.206 TYPE 16. FLANGED LIDS 113-117 Fragments of some 10 or more lids are assignable to this type. The lids seem to range in diameter from as little as 6, suitable for a suspension pot of type 14, to c. 22 or more. There is also considerable variation in the ratio of height to diameter: e.g., contrast 113207 and 114 (fig. 3.8, plate 13). Most, if not all, of these lids appear to have had either two or four string-holes through the flange. There is often a bulge in the flange at the point where the string-hole was made. In some cases this bulge approximates to a definite lug, e.g. 113. The outsides of the lids are more or less well burnished, black and shades of grey or brown in colour; the insides are untreated or at best smoothed. 117 fig. 3.8. Two sections of an applied strip. D. body type 16. Irregularly made and uneven; coarse orange clay; 24 +. Probably part of the flange torn from a large lid of pale greenish slip; unburnished. Lids of this general type are attested in the Aegean from very early times. The type itself may ultimately derive from the repertory of the Halaf culture of the Near East.208 Flanged lids are found during the Neolithic on the Greek mainland, and during the EBA in the Trojan area and the Cyclades.209 The earliest lid recognised from Emporio is of this type, from pre-Troy I period VI.210 A fragment from FN I (formerly MN) Knossos is drawn as if from a lid of this type, but is described as a vessel support.211 There is a miniature flanged lid without lugs or string-holes from FN Phaistos.212 Some lids from Eileithyia and Palaikastro-Ayios Nikolaos that have also been assigned to FN appear to correspond more to this type than to type 15, but have pairs of perforated lugs as 113.213 Flanged lids of this type appear to have flourished in Crete from EM I and into IIA. A fragment of a type 16 lid from Fournou Korifi is assigned to period I;214 no lids of this type appear in period II. Remains of several flanged lids were noted at Ayia Kyriaki, one of them from the pre-tomb soil.215 Flanged lids with flat or slightly domed tops and string-holes are illustrated from the early level in Lebena T. II.216 Such lids are not apparently represented in the Mesara tombs, however, except at Koutsokera.217 A flanged lid from Trapeza has four string-holes: Pendlebury thought it might date from as late as EM III, but it was clearly for a suspension pot and not for a cylindrical pyxis as he suggested, and his Cycladic parallel from Phylakopi is hardly valid.

One obvious difference between the two groups of lids is the way in which the rims of types 15 and 16 are more or less upright, while those of types 17 and 18 tend to slope. This, and other differences between the two groups, may reflect the fact that lids of types 15 and 16 were made to cap jars with more or less upright necks, while the cover lids of types 17 and 18 were perhaps for use with chalices and pedestal bowls of types 1 and 2, as we suggest in fig. 3.8A. TYPE 17. COVER LIDS WITH HOLLOW CYLINDRICAL HANDLE 118-123 Some 15 rim fragments together with two or three hollow cylindrical handles belong to lids of this type.219 These lids seem to range from c. 14 to 20 in diameter, several being between 18 and 20. Most, if not all, of them appear to have had two or more probably three or four low oblong warts on the carination (plate 13: 121-123). A cover akin to this type from Pyrgos has three such warts.220 The fabric varies, but is in general fine, with the surface ranging from black to dark grey, light grey and shades of brown, especially light brown; the surface of one fragment is reddish. The top surface of the lid is always more or less well burnished: 119 of exceptionally fine fabric has rough lattice pattern burnish on top. The burnishing normally extends round the inside of the rim; apart from this, the under surface is left unburnished, although it is evenly finished or smoothed, like the insides of the pedestals of chalices of type 1. The three fragments of cylindrical handles assignable to lids of this type are all of fine fabric, and one of them has a grey-brown burnished outside surface; the other two show no trace of burnishing. 118 Probably Wilson and Day sample KN 92/2. 119 plate 13. Rim frag, of lid with carination and part of wart pres. Very fine fabric; dark grey burnished surface outside; rough pattern burnish lattice on flat top surface.

Orange clay with buff slip, smoothed inside. Wilson and Day sample 92/28. A plain cover lid very like 120 in shape, but without warts around the top of the rim, comes from Ayia Triada Tholos T. A (Banti 1931, 166-7, %• ll: 4°63) TYPE 18. LARGE COVER LIDS WITH HOLLOW CYLINDRICAL HANDLE 124 As type 17, but larger, and with bold grooved decoration of concentric circles. Considerable parts of one lid of this type were found, together with scraps of two others somewhat smaller. In view of their size and fine burnished finish, it seems possible that these lids were used to cover pedestal bowls of type 2. 124 FIG. 3.9, plate 13. About 1/2 pres., including stumps of what appear to be two out of probably four warts on carination. Handle missing. D. 32. Coarse clay with white grit; clay predominantly orange, but vessel much discoloured by fire, leaving surfaces of frags, various shades of dark and light brown, with some black and red. Top well burnished and decorated with incised concentric circles; incisions for the most part bold, groove-like, with U-shaped sections. Inside lightly wiped except around edge of rim, which has poor burnish. Wilson and Day sample KN 92/3. Cover lids as large as 124 were noted at Trapeza, but are of a rather different shape and were dated to EM III-MM I.221 Two other lids from Trapeza, reminiscent of 124 in shape and with similar grooved decoration, but smaller in size, were assigned to EM III;222 and one from die Ayios Charalambos cave (which is across the Lasithi plain from Trapeza) has recently been dated to EM II-MM IA.223 The fragment of a lid of fine black burnished ware with comparable grooves from Debla III dated to EM IIA might come from a cover of this type.224 Cover lids akin to our types 17 and 18 have been found in many parts of Crete, but mostly in the centre and east of the island. They seem to fall into three main groups: (1) with a differentiated rim, more or less corresponding to our types 17 and 18; (2) with a flange round the top of the rim, like type 16; (3) flat lids. The common feature for all these lids is the central hollow cylindrical handle. Some have small vertical loop handles in place of the solid warts which appear round the top of the rim on examples from the Well.225 219 Wilson (2007, 54) highlights this type, and proposes diameters of 30 or more for the largest examples. 220 Xanthoudides 1918a, 152, 157 fig. 12: 87. 221 H.

An unpublished fragment from MM IIA levels in RRS appears to be of that date; it is of fine cooking pot ware with a red wash, and has a rudimentary flange like the lids of group 2.226 A knob handle that comes presumably from a lid akin to our types 17 and 18 was found in Neolithic Stratum III at Knossos.227 Flanged cover lids of group 2 seem the most common. They are somewhat reminiscent of the 'frying pans' of the Keros-Syros group, with which Hazzidakis compared them, taking them to be lids.228 Some of the cover lids from Trapeza fall into our group 1 and resemble lids of our types 17 and 18, but others are flanged, as are all of those illustrated from Mochlos, and those from Marathokephalo and Koumasa.229 There has been much discussion as to whether these vessels with hollow cylindrical handles were really lids. Seager thought it unlikely, because clay vessels could not be identified to go with them: 'of the many recovered, — often two or three from one grave, — none was ever found with a vessel to which it could possibly have belonged'.230 Evans similarly interpreted them as pedestalled dishes or pans, prototypes perhaps 'of the typical Minoan "kernoi"';231 and Davaras has suggested that two examples which he recovered from a pit in the North Room of T. I at Gournia are really fruitstands, since the pit contained no vessel for which they might have served as lids, and the hollow cylindrical projections are too large for handles but convincing as feet.232 Branigan and Platon believe that these vessels may have been used for cult like the Cycladic frying pans often considered related to them.233 Recently, Langford Verstegen has seen them as stands or offering stands,234 with which Serpetsidaki tends to concur for one in dark grey burnished ware from Kyparissi.235 Hazzidakis, however, was sure they were lids; and Xanthoudides felt that they might have served as covers for cooking pots, noting that comparable lids were used for cooking pots of the traditional type (χύτρα) in the mountain villages of Crete before the spread of the fashion for foreign ones (τσουκάλια) imported from France and elsewhere.236 Pendlebury suggested that those from Trapeza might have been lids for bowls of similar fabric of which examples were found with them, or for vessels of some perishable material such as wood or gourds; and he aptly compared them with mediaeval Moorish covers that had central handles of the same kind.237 The weight of authority therefore appears to favour the idea that these vessels were lids. But the WCH has produced several vessels of dark coarse burnished ware in shape akin to our type 17: all the cylindrical handles and other fragments of these have traces of burning outside, and one piece inside as well.238 Even if these vessels were basically meant for lids, they could have been used upside down as dishes: the same may have been true of their possible relatives, the mysterious frying pans of the Cyclades. In view of their size and comparable fabric, the cover lids of our type 17 may have been used with chalices of type 1 (fig. 3.8A), while the larger type 18 covers could have belonged with pedestal bowls of type 2. TYPE 19. FLAT LIDS OR PLATES 125-129 There are several fragments of these. They may have been used as dishes and/or lids for jars and pithoi. In diameter they seem to range from c. 15 to 24, but 125 is only 12 and the unusually thin 128 (fig. 3.9, plate 14) seems to be nearly 30. 226 A rather similar lid from Archanes-Fourni, Burial Building 8, may — or may not — be of comparable date: Sakellarakis and Sakellaraki (1997, 392-3, fig. 345) assign it to EM III. The MM pithos lid from Vrokastro (Hall 1914, 103, 115, fig. 57C; cited by H. W. Pendlebury et al. 1936, 54) is of a different type with a solid knob handle. 227 J. D.

There is a flanged cover lid from Sphoungaras (Hall 1912, 49 50, fig. 22F), and a flat cover lid from Pyrgos (Xanthoudides igi8«, 152, 157, fig. 12: 86). What seem to have been flat lids of this type were found in deposits of Vasiliki I and also at Gournia (Boyd Hawes et al. 1908, 50, 53, 56, fig. 37: 3, described as flat dishes on low feet). 230 Seager 1912, 18.

The fabric tends to be coarse and rather soft, although some examples are comparatively well fired. The surfaces are shades of grey or brown and reddish, never burnished, but in some cases smoothed. Normally the surfaces are treated alike on both sides but, where any differences in the treatment are observable, the inside (concave) surface appears less carefully finished, e.g. 126. This may suggest that the objects were intended as lids. Some type 1 a dishes of class C Fine Burnished ware of FN Phaistos are similar in shape to 125-127.239 125 fig. 3.9, plate 13. About 1/2 pres.

Two or three fragments evidently come from thick discs, flat on one side and humped on the other, e.g. 129 (fig. 3.9, plate 13). These are of coarse fabric, and light in weight; the clay is porous, with abundant straw temper, and orange, or greenish with a white slip, and a well smoothed surface on both sides. Thick flat discs, somewhat akin to 129 in profile but mostly with a cross painted on one or both faces, in a Fournou Korifi I deposit have been interpreted as potter's turn-tables.240 A large thick disc 239 Vagnetti 1973a, 64, fig. 62: 1-2, 4; cf. Pernier 1935, 99, pi. 11 second row from bottom: relatively small, and some of them with a pair of holes through the edge (Pernier thought that these might have had a ritual use). 240 Warren 1972a, 213-15, 224, 245, fig. 98, pis. 75-6; cf.

LARGE FLAT LIDS OR DISHES WITH THICK WALLS 130-132 These may have served as pithos lids. The few fragments of rims assignable to the type have a diameter of 40 or more. The rims are normally thickened with a rib round the outside as on 130 (fig. 3.9, plate 14; D. 43),243 but are sometimes simple like 131 (fig. 3.9, plate 14; D. 47). The fabric is coarse, the surface shades of grey-brown and reddish, wiped on both sides but very much more marked inside — which may indicate that these vessels were used as lids. A rim from FN Phaistos resembles 130 in profile but is of fine burnished ware.244 TYPE 21. LARGE STORAGE JARS (piTHOl) 133-149 A good many remains of these came from the Well, and notably from deposit 1. Some must have been very large, since fragments of them are as much as 3.6 thick. These thick-walled fragments are of coarse gritty clay with abundant straw impressions showing in the surface. In general, pithoi are of coarse fabric, the clay containing large lumps of grit. But some large storage jars that might qualify as pithoi are thin-walled and of relatively fine fabric like the base 134; the surface in this case had been wiped inside and outside before applying a wash to the outside. Other pithoi seem to have had their surfaces wiped in this way; and the outside surfaces normally appear to have had a wash applied to them either overall, or in some cases only partially, as on the neck of 133. Sometimes the surface was merely splashed with paint. The rims of pithoi are, it seems, normally thickened. Many of the large rims grouped here are hammer-headed in profile owing to thickening on the inside as well as outside, e.g. 133; cf. 136-140. Handles and lugs Small strap handles set vertically like those on 133 seem not uncommon. Part of one large strap handle of thin oval section has a red wash. 149 (plate 15) from a large pithos has a vertically perforated lug set on a horizontal rib like those that surround 133. Bases These are often, it seems, carinated and rounded, like many bases of smaller pots, e.g. 63. Base 134 of this type had a hole made before firing at the bottom. But fragments from the edges of bases of pithoi or large jars suggest that some may have been flat, although no certain example of a flat base was noted. Decoration (1) Wiping of the surface, and (2) the application of washes, whether partial or overall, in red or dark paint, were no doubt decorative in intent. Similarly, splashing the insides of 133 and 134 with paint appears deliberate. (3) Relief: these pithoi are the first known from Crete with rope and raised band decoration.245 Varieties include: (a) Ribs, wide and rather low with a sharp edge, are evidently not uncommon, as on 133. They normally seem to run horizontally round the body of the jar, and are sometimes set close together as on the modern pithoi of the Kalamata area. The ribs on 141A (plate 15) are reminiscent of those on pithoi from Chalcolithic Byblos.246 Part of a curving rib is preserved on 142, which has the stump of a small strap handle (plate 15). (b) Warts. A large disc-shaped wart 145 appears to have been applied to a pithos (plate 15). (4) Incision, grooving and channelling. Some fragments have bold incised, grooved or channelled decoration made before firing. Most characteristic are rough herringbone designs or rows of 241 Alexiou 1951, 286; Xanthoudides 1918a, 162. 242 Crowfoot 1938.

The unique 148 (plate 15), also from deposit 1, of very gritty orange clay with a plain orange surface,247 has a low wide flat band with boldly incised hatching, like Late Minoan pithoi; but the fragment seems to be EM and in context. Several fragments, all apparently coming from one very large pithos, are decorated with bold U-shaped channels, arranged as horizontal bands of lattice (144); and there are fragments of other pithoi with similar decoration.

The tradition of pithos making that appears to have been established at Knossos at the beginning of EM I may not have changed much later in Early Minoan.249 These pithoi are quite different in appearance from those of Aphrodite's Kephali with their raised mouldings (without incisions) that may have been derived from the Cyclades, while their shape is like a large version of the collared jars (that are found for instance in the 'Cycladic' repertoire of Ayia Fotia [Siteia]).250 They may also be different from the pithoi reported from Petras Kephala, although warts ('knobs') are reported from there and, significantly, interiors with splashed paint,251 to compare with 133-134. 133 fig. 3.10, plate 14. Upper body frag, of pithos, with vertical collar neck and hammer-headed rim. Ht pres. 55. D. apparently very large, perhaps as much as 68 (in fig. 3.10 rest, as 55). Decorated with wide horizontal ribs set close together. One small vertical strap handle pres., springing from adjacent ribs. Hard, well fired fabric. Coarse orange clay with abundant grit showing in surface, which is roughly smoothed outside. Uneven rather thin wash, red shading to purple-brown, round outside of neck and continuing on inside of rim. Neck and body vigorously wiped inside, and splashed with red paint: cf. 134. A pithos that sounds as if it may have been somewhat comparable comes from Debla I, described as having a thickened rim and deep collar, and a reddish wash with rough scorings on the body (Warren and Tzedakis 1974, 313-4, 321, 323: P3). The upper part of a pithos with a rim apparently of this general type is illustrated from Fournou Korifi I (Warren 1972a, 107, pi. 37 A: P67); one or two amphora rims and a pithos rim of Fournou Korifi II are also comparable (Warren 1972a, 159, fig. 43: P74-75; 199, fig. 83: P630). Rims with a hammer-headed profile of this kind do not seem to be much in evidence, however, at Trapeza. For the rim cf. also a pithos rim from Judeideh (Braidwood and Braidwood i960, 234, fig. 174: 26) of Amuq F, which may overlap with the beginning of EM I. 134 fig. 3.10, plate 14. Carinated base of pithos or large store vessel. Ht pres. 33.5. D. at carination c. 29.2. At bottom, hole (D. c. 2) apparently made before firing, and perhaps for attaching a spout or nozzle. One non-joining frag, from side has a rivet-hole made after firing. Fairly thin walled. Hard fabric, orange clay with grit. Surface vigorously wiped inside and outside. Outside painted with uneven streaky purple-brown to black wash; inside splashed with same paint, here dark purplish red. Many bases of pithoi and amphorai from Fournou Korifi have a hole near the bottom like 134 (Warren 1972a, 109, 146: nine out of 22 amphora bases, and 14 out of 31 pithos bases). Other examples from Crete include: Trapeza: H. W. Pendlebury et al 1936, 88: 909, assigned to EM; Knossos, house below Kouloura 3: Pendlebury and Pendlebury 1930, 65-6, fig. 6. Such holes no doubt served the same purpose as the spouts sometimes found in this position near the bases of pithoi and were for dispensing the liquids in them (e.g. Seager 1916, 17, pi. 16.4b). For pithoi with holes or spouts near the base from other parts of Greece and Anatolia during the earlier part of the Bronze Age, see Hood 1981, 199. 135 fig. 3.11, plate 14.

Palace Well (EM I). Base types: 1, rounded; 2, carinated; 3, pointed; 4, flat; 5, lug (or pellet) feet; 6, ring; 7, pedestal. black wash both sides; the outside is decorated with parallel lines of pattern burnish (but two small warts on the outside surface are just blisters from over-firing). One fragmentary nozzle (as fig. 5.7: bi) is 152 (plate 17); one of its two joining fragments has been discoloured by fire. There are no signs of the distinctive cutaway teapot spouts (fig. 5.7: C1-C2) well attested in EM IIA.252 HANDLES These are normally round or thick oval in section. Most no doubt belong to jugs, but some may come from bowls of types 7-9. 99-100, evidently from jugs, have warts near the junction with the rim. Several wide strap handles with burnished surfaces seem Neolithic; but some small strap handles and one large one come from EM I pithoi. PERFORATED LUGS These are not common, but they occur in all sizes and are associated with a wide variety of vessel types. Three are from bowls (e.g. plate 16: 32, and fig. 3.5: 33), others from large store jars or pithoi. The smaller ones mostly belong to suspension pots of type 14 or their lids (type 15), e.g. 110-111 (plate 12). All these lugs are of a simple type with a single vertical perforation; no example of a lug with a double perforation was noted, and these may not have been made in Crete before EM II. bases (fig. 3.12) 153-157 Rounded More or less rounded or roughly flattened bases are common, especially on jugs of types 11 and 12. Many fragments of such bases, apparently from jugs of type 12, come from the lower part of the Well. It has long been axiomatic that bases in EM I are in general rounded.253 The Well evidence confirms this. The prevalence of rounded bases in EM I is a marked contrast to the fashion for flat ones in EM II — and to the Neolithic tradition of Knossos.234 Differentiated by a carination, but slightly rounded Bases of this kind seem especially popular on bowls of types 8 and g, but not confined to them. Some jugs seem to have had bases like this. Several bowls or cups assignable to EM I (or IIA at latest) have bases of this shallow rounded type separated by a sharp carination from the rest of the vessel. These include a bowl from Pyrgos with inward leaning sides and a pair of vertical handles like 31 (fig. 3-5);255 a bowl from Eileithyia;256 and cups with outward curving sides from Kyparissi and Lebena T. II lower.257 Such bases are also found on some small cup-like bowls (bicchieri) from Phaistos FN.258 Some of what Xanthoudides259 thought were the earliest cylindrical pyxides from Pyrgos have bases like this. Rather more elaborate forms of such bases occur on comparable EC pyxides.260 252 E.g. Koumasa: Zois 1967a, 714-16, pi. 18. 253 E.g. PMI, 63; Zois 1967a, 712, 728. 254 At Phaistos FN bases are mostly flat, but some are rounded. Rounded bases are a feature of Trapeza ware (H. W. Pendlebury et al. 1936, 29-30, fig. 7) — which Tomkins (2007, 20, table 1.6; 44) assigns to FN IV. 255 Xanthoudides 1918a, 153, fig. 10: 81; 155. 256 Marinatos 1929a, 96, fig. 1 below. 257 Alexiou 1951, 279, pi. 14.2: 3; Alexiou and Warren 2004, 69, fig. 21, pi. 41C: 74 — cf. too, for the pulling out of the body towards the rim, the mugs: 84, fig. 24, pi. 58A: 219-20. 258 Vagnetti 1973a, 67, 71, fig. 66: 5. 259 Xanthoudides 1918a, 143, fig. 7: 30-1, 34-5; 151, fig. 9: 73. 260 E.g.

Bowls with bases like this and resembling 63 in shape, but without spouts or handles, occur in Ras Shamra III2 (iiib), the horizon of Northern Ubaid which seems to correspond to Late Chalcolithic in Cilicia.261 Similar bowls are attested in Egypt in Dynasty I.262 Bases of the kind found on these bowls also occur on spouted bowl jars from Arad II assignable to EB II, which falls within Egyptian Dynasty I.263 Pointed The only example of a pointed base 153 may come from a bowl (fig. 3.11, plate 16). Its outside surface is light red-brown, burnished; the inside is smoothed if not burnished. Flat No certain example of a flat or concave base was recognised, but some large store jars or pithoi may have had flat bases (see above). Flat with lug (or pellet) feet264 Only two possible fragments were noted. The more convincing of these is 154 from a jug or small jar (fig. 3.11, plate 16). Its inside surface is scored; the outside has a wash in shades of red and brown. Zois notes lug (pellet) feet on vessels he assigns to EM I from Kyparissi and Pyrgos.265 He suggests, however, that they did not occur on jugs with painted decoration until EM II; but they are found on jugs in Debla I and are well represented in Debla II,266 and are found on Minoan pyxides at Ayia Fotia (Siteia).267 A cup with painted decoration in dark-on-light from Kyparissi even has four tall wide feet that are like those of some EM tripod cooking pots.268 For pellet feet in EM II, see p. 118, 131. Ring Three fragments seem to come from one or perhaps two wide ring bases belonging to large open bowls (fig. 3.11, plate 17: 155). The clay of these fragments is gritty, reddish and well fired, with a greyish white or greenish wash inside and outside. Similar in fabric, and possibly from the same vessel, is 156 (fig. 3.11, plate 17), the rim of a very large shallow bowl (D. c. 60) of coarse gritty grey clay, much worn but with traces of a thick greenish slip inside, and outside diagonally wiped below the rim. Thickened rim 157 has been restored with base 155 on fig. 3.11, but may in fact come from a very large pedestal, as suggested on plate 17. Pedestal bases These are common, and occur in all sizes (pp. 30-6). Most apparently belong to chalices or bowls of types x and 2, but some may come from other shapes, the smallest perhaps from suspension pots of type 14. miscellaneous 160-163 160 fig. 3.11, plate 8. Frag, of flat object with large hole. Coarse, very crumbly greenish clay, with abundant large grey grit, and orange slip. Three fragments of a markedly different fabric from the rest of the pottery found in the Well appear to be later (perhaps EM II) strays rather than imports, although the possibility of pottery travelling over long distances by sea in early times must be kept in mind; the recognition of what appears to have been a wheelmade vessel imported from Syria found by Schliemann in an early level of Troy I is highly suggestive in this connection.269 The clay of these fragments is soft and orange; they have a slightly lustrous red wash. Apart from 161, the fragments of this fabric include a scrap of rim with a bead, and the base of a small jug or jar, which has no red wash inside. 161 fig. 3.11. Frag, of small pedestal foot.

The extreme simplicity of this painted decoration corresponds to what has been observed in the past as characteristic of EM I, and makes a striking contrast to the more elaborate decoration of EM IIA.270 Decoration is virtually confined to groups of rather thin parallel lines. Necks of jugs are regularly covered with multiple horizontal lines, as was still usual in EM IIA at Rnossos to judge from the WCH.271 Groups of horizontal, vertical or diagonal lines adorn jug bodies. Groups of diagonal lines may cross to form a lattice, as on 86-87, a°d this type of lattice also occurs in pattern burnish on the remarkable suspension pot 105; but there are no examples of the dense lattice pattern in clearly defined areas found in EM IIA. The crossing lines of 82 and 85 occur elsewhere in EM I and continue into EM II.272 The solitary spot on 81 (one of three examples from the Well) has a very close parallel at Pyrgos. Washes were evidently applied over all or part of the vessels with decorative intent, and the deliberate splashing of the outsides or insides of vessels (see pp. 41, 52) may be ancestral to the trickle ornament which is such a conspicuous feature of domestic pottery in all subsequent Minoan periods. Trickle or splash ornament of this kind was already standard in Crete by EM IIA, being found on pithoi from the WCH273 and Fournou Korifi I — and abundant there in period II.274 It also occurs on fragments of large vessels from the West Yerogalaro ridge at Prosymna in the Argolid. Blegen, while noting the resemblance to MM trickle ornament, assigned these to an early phase of Neolithic,275 but the assemblage, of which they were part, seems to be LN. BURNISH, INCLUDING PATTERN BURNISH One of the most characteristic features of EM I pottery is the deliberate use of burnishing in various ways to give a decorative effect. This is achieved most simply by means of contrasted areas of vertical and horizontal stroke burnishing. The term 'pattern burnish' is confined to those cases where designs have been made with the burnishing instrument on an unburnished, or on an already smoothed or burnished area of surface, as seen on the suspension pots of type 14 and the chalices and pedestal bowls of types 1 and 2. Pattern burnish occurs on various shapes from the Well, mostly on chalices and pedestalled bowls with dark surfaces, but also on suspension pots and some vessels with light surfaces.276 By EM IIA it would seem that the shapes which have pattern burnish are more restricted, while those bearing painted decoration in dark on light are far more numerous than they had been in EM I, when dark on light decoration seems to have been virtually confined to jugs of type 11. The designs that occur in pattern burnish from the Well are mostly very simple: groups of parallel lines, wavy bands or zigzags, more rarely lattice. Wavy bands characteristically occur below the rims of some pedestal bowls of type 2. The most elaborate examples of pattern burnish, including lattice, are on suspension pots of type 14 (plate 12). Fine lattice pattern burnish is also found on a two handled bowl from Kyparissi.277 The groups of parallel chevrons that appear on goblets at Pyrgos278 and Knossos (1228) are not found in the Well, but this design does occur in pattern burnish in the EBA of Palestine. The spirals on chalice 1182279 and a chalice from Arkalochori280 probably both date to EM I: these vessels may be from the same (Knossian) workshop (see p. 246). One example of true pattern burnish from Evans's excavations at Knossos may come from a deposit assignable to EN.281 Other examples recovered from possible LN contexts during the old excavations were illustrated by Furness.282 The 'very few sherds with simple pattern burnish' found in 'LN' levels 2'° E.g.

D. Evans's 1957-60 excavations,283 now assigned to FN,284 appear to have been similar, with thick parallel stripes of pattern burnish unlike that from the Well but resembling that on some Final Neolithic pottery from Phaistos.285 Pattern burnish is at home from very early times in the Levant, and is also attested in what may be a relatively early horizon in the eastern Aegean and the Troad, as well as in EN in Thessaly.286 INCISION, GROOVING AND CHANNELLING Decoration of this type is normally bold, and virtually confined to large storage jars and pithoi where it appears not uncommon (see pp. 52-3). Bold channelling is also found on the large lids of type 18. True incision occurs on bowl rims 43-44 (plate 6), but really fine incision only on a fragment of a miniature jug 88 (plate 9). The comparative rarity of true incised decoration might be regarded as merely the natural development of a tendency manifest in the latest Neolithic phase (Stratum I) at Knossos.287 Bold lattice work, gouged, incised or scored on the insides of some large bowls or open jars (e.g. plate 6: 53, plate 17: 158), was evidently not decoration but had a functional purpose. This kind of lattice scoring continued into MM I, if not later. In MM it may have been used as a device for ensuring the proper firing of thick-walled vessels, but in earlier periods such scoring could indicate that the vessel was used for grinding (or as husking trays), as the signs of possible wear at the bottom of the scoring on 158 would suggest. Another likely explanation is that they served as, or were designed to be, bee skips (hives), as is probably the case for tubs (lekanai) like those already frequent in Myrtos Pyrgos II and III. The incisions helped the honey to stick.288 RELIEF (a) Ribs are common on pithoi; they are usually straight and horizontal, e.g. 133; but one at least curves (plate 15: 142). (b) Warts. Low oblong warts appear as regular features on lids of types 17 and 18. Three large solid warts as 159 (fig. 3.11, plate 16) with a red wash evidently come from one or more jars; they had been applied while the clay was wet and had subsequently come away from the surface. Handles 99-100 (fig. 3.7), both apparently from jugs, have warts on them. OTHER ARTEFACTS Plaster Two scraps of wall plaster found in level 18 (deposit 2) have been analysed and discussed by Cameron et al. One fragment is of mud plaster and may have been a backing for a finer, white lime plaster289 — of which there are indications on the other fragment, which is probably of mud mixed with lime with, perhaps, a lime-washed surface.290 It is possible, however, that the 'lime' is only calcareous earth. Cameron et al. note also that, if there was a lime wash, this marks a departure from the mud (only) plaster of Neolithic Knossos, and thus EM I saw the beginning of the Minoans' practice of putting lime plaster over coats of clay to prepare them for painting. The main purpose, however, of EM painted plasters was 'architectural rather than decorative,'291 to provide a finish that was 'smooth, hard and somewhat impervious'. 283 J. D.

Vitelli (2007, 102-03, 216-17, fig, 16; 272-7, figs. 44-6) calls them 'Coarse Urf (= Urfirnis) gouged bowls'. They begin in Lerna I (EN), although the earliest are not gouged but have a pebble temper (214-15, fig. 15), and are a feature of Lerna II (MN). She has published similar bowls from the Franchthi cave (Vitelli 1993, 156, 186-7, 396-7, fig. 40g-h, pi. 3c), to be dated somewhere in Franchthi Ceramic Phases 2.1-2.2. Cf. Felsch 1971, 9, on internal scoring as a feature of MN in the Peloponnese; also Ayioryitika (Petrakis 2002, 42~S&gt; figs- 26: 96; 27: 97-101; 28: 102-05; 77, citing 'the so-called husking bowl or bowl with interior scoring'), Asea (Holmberg 1944, 44-6, fig. 45) and Nemea (Blegen 1975, 264, fig. 5m; 270, pi. 68: 13-16). Vitelli (1993, 185-7; 2007, 102-03) discusses their use, noting that the scoring could be as much for adhesion as for abrasion: but if they were bee skips, that means Lerna II had a lot a hives.

Clay A fragment of a spindlewhorl 164 is probably Neolithic, as may be two small discs 165-165A that appear to have been deliberately cut from potsherds. Such discs are common at Knossos from Stratum VII (MN) onwards,292 where they appear to be examples of deliberate fragmentation.293 For other EM occurrences, see a fuller discussion with more parallels for 1153-1154 below (p. 227) 164 (level 5, small find a) fig. 3.13, plate 18.

Hood 1982, 627-9, pi- x31: n_14 We may include here the burnt fragments of what we believe to unbaked clay bins that were fired to a considerable extent in the fire(s) that burnt so much of the pottery in the Well. Forty-one fragments come from levels 5 and 6, near the top of deposit 2, together with pieces of burnt mud brick or daub. The fabric of these pieces is like that of badly (kiln-)fired oatmeal or pithos wares — or a paximadi (rusk). After the (accidental) firing, their colour ranges from buff to light brown to grey and dark grey, and one piece is orange. They are covered on both sides with a smoothed skim of mud, and many of them have been wiped, almost certainly with grasses. In several cases the effect is like that of a paler slip, with a thin surface layer of clay being quite distinct from the body of the fragment. But other pieces look self-smoothed by the potter's wet, clayey hands. On one piece this slip is dark brown, which probably reflects the effects of the fire(s) rather than deliberate colouring of the surface. The interior of these pieces may be granular, and is often fractured, showing inclusions of lumps of apparently carbonised vegetal matter, small stones (gravel) and bits of kouskouras; there are no signs, however, of bones or sherds, in contrast to the mud brick pieces. It is just possible that these pieces and the mud brick fragments are in fact all of the same mixed material, which has reacted differently in the heat; but we think it more likely that they are different. The grass marks and wiping tie in well with the wiping of the jugs from the Well. The key features in interpreting the shape and functions of these remnants are: (1) finished surfaces on both sides; (2) a typical thickness of 2.5-3.5; (3) their having rims; and (4) the signs of a curve on many of the fragments. To us it suggests that they are (household) furniture of a considerable diameter. The best bet, we believe, is that they are the remains of flat-topped bins or tubs, since their apparent rims preclude their being domed ovens. If they were bins, they were slightly smaller than the clay bins (D. typically 80) that are such a feature of LH IIIC Lefkandi.294 The following rim fragments are shown in fig. 3.14 and plate ig (where 166A-166D are shown on the inside, and 166E on the outside). 166A D. ?

The approximately 26 pieces of mud brick or daub are generally of a pink to brown homogeneous clay, originally fairly muddy, and now ashy in appearance, and fired so that have become slightly porous. They have a remarkable range of inclusions: vegetal matter including probably a small olive stone (plate 19: 166F);295 burnt bone; small sherds, one of them possibly Neolithic; small stones including small lumps of, presumably, kouskouras. These inclusions need further study. The larger pieces have partial indications of flat and/or smoothed surfaces. What is presumably part of a brick has two faces and is 7.1 thick. The largest piece measures c. 11.5 x 8.9 x 10. 166G (fig. 3.14) is curved (D. c. 32) and has two faces: might it be from a cover for a pithos? 166H (plate ig), with maximum dimensions 6.5 x 4.5 x 2.9, is of either accidentally or badly fired unbaked clay. The clay is an earthy brown to dark brown with many vegetal inclusions and some bits of quartzite.

Obsidian Doniert Evely Some decades ago Robin Torrence studied the obsidian from Hood's excavations, with the help of John Cherry, who drew the more interesting pieces. Torrence has now given her notes and data, which were also part of her research into the obtaining and distribution of obsidian in the prehistoric Aegean,296 together with the drawings to Hood for my use in this and the publications of the other excavations.297 Hood, Cadogan and I thank her warmly, and Cherry for allowing us to present some of his drawings (fig. 9.2): their quality is self-evident. With Torrence's encouragement and permission, I have made ample use of her records, but wish to stress that she is not responsible for what is said here. What follows is a summary of what will be part of a comprehensive account of the obsidian from Hood's excavations for publication elsewhere. Torrence identified 48 fragments of obsidian from the Well: 33 prismatic blades and 15 flakes and chunks. About 35 of these fragments are from deposit 2, and four (two blades, a flake and a chip) from deposit 1. The obsidian is in every case opaque, and probably from Melos, like that from the Neolithic levels. None is of the transparent glassy type that may originate from Yiali. No cores proper were recorded and only one crested blade; even the true flakes accounted for but 13 pieces (3 being chips and chunks). First series blades occasionally turn up, but were considered serviceable and may carry retouch/ wear damage. Thus, although there can be little doubt that obsidian was being processed on site at Knossos in EM I, yet the material disposed of down the Well is weighted towards the primary desired end-product of the Bronze Age knapper, namely the prismatic blade. Their knapping seems to be by indirect pressure, although the tool responsible is not clear. An antler tine, or bone or wood fragment, perhaps remain the more likely candidates, but D'Annibale has suggested a metal-tipped tool for LN/ EM blades at Petras.298 Of the blades measured, the examples fall at the upper limit of the typical EM Cretan example (with a length of up to 5 or so).299 Thus, any Cycladic influence on them in terms of size is not readily discernable.300 One-third of the blades carry clear, and at times quite heavy, patterns of retouch: discriminating between this and wear/use-damage has not been much pursued at present, as it requires specialist knowledge and equipment. Nonetheless, some of the medial blade segments clearly have been retouched. For the flakes, as might be expected, one primary (completely cortical) flake is heavily outnumbered by secondary (some cortex: 7) and tertiary (no cortex: 5) flakes. One secondary piece has retouch/ wear-damage on one edge. 296 Torrence 1986.

Deposits 1 and 2 yielded in total 139 recordable specimens, representing 146 Maximum Anatomical Units (MaxAU) and 142 Minimum Anatomical Units (MinAU). The assemblages were hand-collected during excavation. Even though very small skeletal elements (e.g., foot bones, unfused ends) are most likely to have been missed due to low visibility,306 the small size of some of the specimens suggests that considerable effort was made to collect all visible material. Thus, it may be cautiously suggested that the assemblages recovered are fairly representative of the material originally deposited. In both deposits specimens were identified of all four major farmyard animals (table 3.1) commonly present at Knossos,307 while the assemblage from deposit 2 also included a dog bone. Some specimens bore butchery marks (table 3.2), and some long bone fragments were of the 'end-and-shaft' type common in material broken to extract marrow (table 3.3; 'cylinders' are more typical of attrition by dogs; shaft splinters are common results of both human and canine activity).308 The range of species, butchery marks and high levels of bone fragmentation (there were no complete long bones; see table 3.3) indicate that these assemblages are by-products of animal carcass processing for human consumption. Moreover, all parts of the skeleton (head — trunk — limbs — feet) were represented, including both meaty parts, which would have been discarded after consumption, and non-meaty parts (e.g., phalanges), which would have been discarded in the initial stages of carcass dressing (tables 3.5 and 3.6). This suggests limited, if any, spatio-temporal segregation of the different stages of carcass processing.309 Table 3.1. Palace Well. Species/taxon representation in deposits 1 and 2.

First, a high proportion of specimens in both deposits bore carnivore (mostly) or rodent (rarely) gnawing marks (table 3.4), implying that at least part of the assemblage had been exposed on the surface after human consumption and discard and prior to its deposition in the Well. The absence or rarity of vulnerable anatomical zones, such as proximal humerus and distal femur (table 3.5 and 3.6), is also compatible with loss due to scavenger attrition.311 Secondly, a number of specimens, belonging to both meaty (legs) and non-meaty (feet) parts and of all species/taxa, exhibited uniform discolouration caused by burning, with colours ranging from dark brown to grey/white (calcined). The colours and uniformity of burning on individual specimens are compatible with exposure to high temperatures, subsequent to stripping of surrounding soft tissues. Moreover, a pig's second phalanx from deposit 2 (level 5) was both burnt and gnawed by a rodent, and therefore burnt after discard. The above evidence is compatible both with accidental (e.g. cooking accidents, conflagration) and deliberate burning (e.g. of refuse), but not with the effects of cooking or roasting of meat on the bone.312 Finally, all long bones were fragmented (an effect both of human processing and scavenger attrition) (table 3.3.), no matching/paired or articulating skeletal elements could be identified, and the individual animals that contributed to the assemblages were represented by few of their body parts. 311 Cf. Brain 1981, 23, fig. 18. 312 Charring of bone from cooking/roasting would result only in localised charring of bone.</page><page sequence="78">EARLY MINOAN I: THE PALACE WELL Table 3.5. Palace Well.

In any case, the small number of bones in deposit 1 and their poor state of preservation is compatible with slow accumulation of debris as would be expected for the period during which the Well was in use, and presumably care would have been taken to avoid rubbish being discarded in the water. Another explanation for the presence of these few bones is that they are derived from the Neolithic strata through which the Well was cut and became incorporated into deposit 1 from the collapsing sides. As regards deposit 2, the above taphonomic observations allow us to draw some important conclusions regarding the nature and formation of the assemblage. The admixture of burnt/unburnt and gnawed/ungnawed specimens,314 the absence of matching/articulating skeletal elements, and the presence of all parts of the skeleton within the same deposit are compatible with at least secondary deposition and suggest that these assemblages consist of various components which, prior to their arrival in the Well, had followed different pre- and post-depositional pathways. Given the presence of Neolithic sherds (see above) in deposit 2, it is not impossible that at least some of the bones derive from the FN deposits through which the upper part of the Well was cut. Overall, the assemblage bears the hallmarks of generalised, slowly accumulated debris, typically encountered in settlement contexts.315 Does the taphonomy of the bones provide support for deposit 2 containing material from a fire destruction or a feasting event? As regards the first proposition, only a small minority of the bones are burnt, in contrast with material examined from LBA conflagrations at the Palace of Nestor at Pylos,316 and at Assiros Toumba in northern Greece.317 At best, therefore, the bones are only partly derived from a burnt destruction or are derived from a very patchy conflagration and, in the latter case, bone from food preparation had been discarded within a building to which both dogs and rodents had access. On the other hand, those bones that are burnt could have been exposed to fire in a number of different events and processes. Secondly, might the faunal remains be derived from the feasting event(s) inferred by Day and Wilson from their study of the Palace Well pottery, on the basis of the state of preservation, stylistic homogeneity, highly elaborate nature and large size of a number of consumption and serving/ presentation vessels?318 The bones offer no indication that primary butchery waste (e.g. heads and feet) was discarded separately from consumption debris (e.g. bones from meaty upper limbs), as sometimes occurs in ceremonial acts of consumption. Nor is there any hint of the 'wasteful' pattern of consumption that sometimes serves to distinguish 'feasts' from more run-of-the-mill commensality. The presence of cattle bones certainly indicates butchery of very large carcasses that could have been consumed at a very large commensal event, but they could alternatively have been distributed around the settlement for piecemeal consumption at a domestic level; the very sparse anatomical representation of individual animals is certainly compatible with dispersed consumption. More critically, the taphonomic characteristics of the faunal assemblage point to material that had accumulated gradually, potentially from a range of processing, consumption and discard events, prior to final deposition in the well. Although ceramic cross-joins throughout deposit 2 clearly indicate that the pottery in the main fill of the Well, together with the associated bones, was dumped in a single operation, the bones appear to represent gradually accumulated refuse of mixed origin. There are no hints, in the form of articulating or paired body parts or joins between specimens, that the bone refuse includes material rapidly buried from specific carcass-processing or consumption events. Given the apparently mixed origins of the bone material, there are no grounds for treating it as refuse from the same consumption event(s) as are represented by the ceramics in the Palace Well. In other words, the bones offer no indication that any feasting event(s) represented by the elaborate tableware involved consumption of meat, let alone allowing speculation as to the types of animals consumed, how they were butchered and cooked, or the number of participants they might have fed. It is also worth noting that, although less amenable to taphonomic analysis than the bones, the ceramic assemblage comprises a more or 313 This observation is based on statistical (chi-square) tests comparing the frequency of gnawed and burnt specimens between the two deposits. It should be noted, however, that the results of the significance tests may only reflect the very small size of each individual assemblage. 314 Burnt bones with unburnt were recorded in levels 5, 8, 12,17, 20 and 21 and gnawed with ungnawed in levels 3, 5, g, i6, 17, 20, 23. 315 Cf.

Moreover, despite multiple joins, the sherds recovered from the Well do not make up complete vessels and it is evident that burning occurred after breakage. The ceramic assemblage as a whole, therefore, is also not incompatible with a mixed origin and, although this does not affect arguments based on the size and elaboration of serving vessels, it does preclude further inferences from the composition of the assemblage as a whole or from its association with other material such as animal bones. Molluscs Rena Veropoulidou Level 16 (deposit 2) produced two cockle shells (Cerastoderma glaucum Poiret 1789). One was water worn when it was gathered from an estuary (the Kairatos at Poros?), and is naturally pierced; the other, a fragment, was gathered alive, whether for food or by chance.319 Olives and Vines Jane M. Renfrew OLIVES An olive stone (small find 5) was found in level 5, which is near the top of the pure EM I deposit 2 (fig. 3.2). There is no reason to suppose that it is a later stray. It is quite small: L. 0.85, W. 0.52. Another small olive stone can probably be seen in a mud brick from level 5 or 6 (plate 19: 166F). Crete has been famed since prehistoric times for its olives and olive oil. According to an ancient myth, Athena came from Crete and gave Cretans the sacred olive: certainly it was a staple for the Minoans. The earliest traces of olives in Crete occur in the pollen diagrams from Tersana on the Akrotiri peninsula in levels dating to Middle Neolithic, and by LN the pollen is abundant enough to suggest local cultivation, which appears to peak in the EBA levels.320 It is thus not surprising to find palaeoethnobotanical evidence for olives in EM contexts. Besides these stones from the Palace Well, an olive stone is known from Fournou Korifi,321 where there may also have been olive prunings,322 and two from Lebena T. II;323 and there are less well-dated stones from Debla.324 The Palace Well stone confirms the picture that olives were used in EM Crete. While it has been suggested that not enough finds of olive stones have been made from EM contexts to infer that olive cultivation was of importance then,325 one should remember that many excavations (including the three presented in this volume) took place before systematic flotation of soil samples for seeds was standard practice. The finds of olive stones have truly been subject to chance. Corroboration of the EBA cultivation of the olive comes from a study of the charcoal found in the EBA levels at Akrotiri on Santorini, where go°/o was olive wood — possibly prunings used for firewood.326 It is not clear whether the olive, Olea europaea L., was native to the Aegean area.327 The remarkable finds of fossilised olive leaves preserved in successive volcanic deposits on Santorini show that they were present in the Pleistocene vegetation of the Aegean c. 60,000 years ago.328 There is fascinating evidence for the early extraction of oil, probably from wild olives, at several underwater sites off the Carmel coast of Israel. Most notable is installation No. 6 at Kfar Samir, where crushed olive stones and soft olive pulp were found in a circular pit buried under layers of sand. They were associated with woven mats, stone basins, concave mortars and grinding and chopping tools. Dates obtained from these olive stones range from 5530 to 4367 cal. bc.329 It is difficult to distinguish between wild and cultivated olives on the basis of size of the stones. In Crete today there are two main types of olives in cultivation: Chondroelia (also known as Throumbes) 319 For the EM IIA shells from the WCH, and discussion of other EM shells, see Reese 1987. 320 Rackham and Moody 1996, 125. See also Bottema and Sarpaki 2003. 321 Warren 1972a, 23; J. M. Renfrew 1972, 316-17, fig. 126. Pace Hansen (1988, 45 and n. 38), the olive stones from the Spring Chamber at Knossos (PM11, 135) are most unlikely to be EM. 322 Rackham 1972. 323 They are slightly larger than the Knossos stones (Alexiou and Warren 2004, 16, 138). 324 Warren and Tzedakis 1974, 336. 325 Runnels and Hansen 1986, 301. 326 Asouti 2003, 474. 327 Bottema and Sarpaki (2003, 744) note that it 'did not occur in Crete by origin'. 328 Some of them in the collection of Professor Evangelos Velitzelos are admirably illustrated in Talianis and Theodorides n.d., 13, 17. 329 Galili et al. 1997.</page><page sequence="81">68 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1 957-1 961: EARLY MINOAN with large fruits and stones, used both for eating and for the extraction of oil, and Psiloelia (also called Koroneiki) with very small fruits and stones, used mainly in oil production.330 So distinguishing wild and cultivated olives on the basis of the size of the stones is not reliable. What were olives used for apart from food and cooking in the EBA? There are numerous finds of clay lamps using wicks submerged in flammable liquid, probably olive oil, found in EM and MM tombs and also in EM settlements such as Koumasa, Fournou Korifi and Mochlos,331 although there are no actual finds of olive oil from EM Crete comparable to the jug of oil and two pottery lamps in an EC tomb on Naxos.332 By MM times stone and clay lamps were in widespread use. We cannot be sure that they were fuelled with olive oil, but it seems most likely. The production of olive oil happens in three stages: the crushing of the fruits to form a pulp; the pressing of the pulp to extract the oil on a large flat surface often in a large spouted trough with a vessel below to receive the liquid; and finally the separation of the oil from water. This final stage took place automatically with oil being less dense than water and floating on top of it. Archaeological finds of vessels with a spout a little above the base may have been used to draw off the water so that only oil remained in the vessel. The spouted tubs at Fournou Korifi would have been as suitable for pressing olives as pressing grapes;333 but these tubs do not appear in large numbers until the Neopalatial period, when at least 32 examples of spouted tubs (lekanes) and stone olive presses have been found.334 Blitzer gives a useful list of the MM and LM sites yielding olive stones,335 most notably Kommos, and reminds us of the remarkable find in the well at the Palace of Zakros of a conical cup filled with olive fruits looking remarkably fresh, having been waterlogged since Minoan times. The recording of olives on Linear A tablets336 shows that olive cultivation was well established in the economy of Neopalatial Crete, and the tablets from Ayia Triada indicate that olives were probably used to pay labourers.337 In the Linear B tablets olive oil was used as payment for labour and for cult offerings,338 while oil from wild olives may have been used in perfumery.339 Large quantities of olive oil were stored in the enormous pithoi in the Minoan palaces. Those at Knossos may have held up to 82,000 litres of oil, the produce of between 16,000 and 32,000 trees planted in some 320 hectares.340 It should be noted that olive trees usually fruit every other year, and that the oil has good keeping qualities. Thus there can be little doubt that olives were cultivated in Crete from at least the EM period, if not earlier, and that they became an increasingly important part of Minoan economy during the Bronze Age. VINES 166H (plate ig) seems to be part of a mud brick (see above) with the impression of a vine leaf. Other vine leaf impressions from pots being stood on the leaves during manufacture, and found at Knossos, are one of EM IIA date from the WCH,341 1155 from late EM IIB deposit A3 (pp. 227-8, plate 19), and 1364-1365 (plate 19) of less certain date but possibly EM III or, if not, then MM IA (p. 279). Impressions of vine leaves on the bases of pots are quite common finds for the EBA Aegean. It seems that vine leaves were used with the smooth upper surface of the leaf on the ground and the underside uppermost, so that the impressions left on the base of the pots show the veins of the leaf clearly. The pots stood on these upturned leaves either while they were being coiled by hand, before the introduction of the potter's wheel, or at any rate when they were drying before firing. In the case of large pots several leaves were often used for this purpose, as was found at Markiani, on Amorgos, and Dhaskalio, on Keros (see below). These impressions are of interest not only from the technological point of view in the manufacture of handmade pots, but also because they imply that vines were growing close to the place of manufacture and vine leaves were readily available. Sometimes this is the only evidence that grapes were being grown in the district. Occasionally the pots are carefully placed on the centre of the leaves so that the resulting impression makes a symmetrical 'decoration' on the pot base, as is the case of some of the impressions from Chalandriani on Syros (see below). It has been suggested that vine leaf impressions indicate that the pots were used for the storage or consumption of wine. 330 Rackham and Moody 1996, 81. 331 Blitzer 1993, 166. 332 Stefanos 1906. 333 Warren 1972a, 139 and 191, fig. 75: P532-P533. 334 Riley 2004, 3, table 1. 335 Blitzer 1993, 164-5. 336 GORILA passim. 357 Was 1973. 338 Ventris and Chadwick 1973, 13, 217-19. 339 Melena 1983. 34° Warren 1985.

It is difficult to distinguish between truly wild vines and feral forms since spontaneous crossing between wild plants and cultivars occurs easily when vineyards are established close to natural stands of the sylvestris forms. The earliest palaeothnobotanical finds of grapes in Greece come from the late Palaeolithic/Mesolithic levels of the Franchthi cave in the Argolid dating to around 11,000 bc. In the Early Neolithic the pips of the sylvestris form occur at Argissa, Achilleion and Sesklo, and in Middle Neolithic at Sesklo and Sitagroi. The Late Neolithic (4300-2800 bc) seems to have been a period of greater concentration on the collection of wild fruits including grapes: they are known from the Franchthi cave; Arapi, Dimini, Sesklo and Pefkakia in Thessaly; and Dimitra, Dikili Tash and Sitagroi in east Macedonia. The latter finds are the best documented, and it is likely that wild grapes were being used to make wine at Dikili Tash; and cultivated grapes may be present at Dimitra at this time and at Sitagroi a little later. The earliest finds of grapes in Crete are known from Fournou Korifi and Phaistos. At Fournou Korifi two deposits were found containing remains of grapes: the first consisted of carbonised grape pips; the second larger find was of pips, loose stalks and empty grape skins inside a pithos — which seems to suggest that these grapes were being used in winemaking. In both deposits the pips were mainly small and gave the impression of coming from unripe fruit, although some were larger and more rounded and appear to have come from fully ripened grapes.356 The find from Phaistos was of pips and stalks, the pip also being rather small.357 Grapes seem to be the least well adapted of the major crops in Crete, coming late into leaf and the first to drop their leaves in the autumn. Most of the varieties grown today in Crete are peculiar to the island and differ from one region to another and have adapted to the island conditions surprisingly well.358 Winemaking was clearly a most significant development. Early indications for this occur at Fournou Korifi, where it may have been retsinated,359 and EH Ayios Kosmas. With the appearance of cultivated grapes it became possible to manufacture quantities of a luxury item from quite modest raw materials. The wine stored well and could be extensively traded in sealed pottery vessels. That this was a highly regarded commodity is underlined by the appearance in the archaeological record of exotic drinking vessels made from precious materials.360 THE EARLY MINOAN I PALACE WELL AT KNOSSOS The EM I Palace Well is the best evidence we have for society at Knossos at the beginning of the Bronze Age, both as a technical and social undertaking, and from its fill in deposits 1 and 2 that comprises the abandoned (deposit 1) and discarded (deposit 2) debris of the life of the settlement of which it was part. 342 Warren 1972a, 239, 254, fig. 107, pi. 83D: 232; J.

There must have been a master well-digger in, or available to, the community, who supervised the operation, and whose reputation would rest on whether or not he found water — for the benefit of, presumably, the whole EM I community on the Kephala hill. It must have become, at once or soon, a major improvement to communal life, especially as it seems that it held, at times at least, a considerable amount of water, perhaps as much as 2 tonnes. It also demanded social responsibility from all who used it, to ensure that it was not polluted by, for instance, throwing animal carcasses or other rubbish into it. The few bones in deposit 1 are not necessarily evidence of such antisocial behaviour, but may well be strays from upper layers, as Valasia Isaakidou suggests above. The small number of other artefacts from the Well, mainly from deposits 2 (upper and lower levels, but not in the middle levels) and 3, fill out the picture of life in the settlement. Even if spindlewhorl 164 and clay discs 165-166 are Neolithic, we still have three bone tools 167-169, a stone quern 170 and some pounders and rubbers 171-176, and a lump of Naxian emery 179, which could have been used for grinding or polishing by abrasion. There is also a quantity of blades and a tranchet arrowhead in Melian obsidian. The probable pot boilers 177-178 represent a way of cooking/heating food that seems rare — or, more likely, has been litde noticed by archaeologists — in Minoan Crete. They add to the type 10 baking plates from the Well as evidence of how different types of food were prepared and cooked at EM I Knossos. We did not find, however, any feet from tripod cooking vessels, a development that does not appear at Knossos until the WCH (and even then they are rare),361 although one (at least) is known from the Ayia Fotia cemetery.362 The recently recognised fragments of unbaked clay bins 166A-166E (that were preserved by having been burnt) form, with the Well itself and the two scraps of wall plaster (possibly lime plaster), the only architectural evidence we have of the EM I Kephala settlement. If the clay objects are bins, they add to the storage capacity of the community as identified first in the pithoi (type 21); but it is as impossible to quantify how much extra storage they could have provided as it is to know how much the pithoi did. At Aphrodite's Kephali, however, the pithoi could hold up to 165 kg.363 Round bins are fairly rare in Bronze Age Crete364 — or few have been recognised. It is clear that these fragments deserve farther study, especially from an archaeobotanical view. The animal bones point to a mixed diet as far as meats are concerned — and may suggest packs of dogs, in view of the amount of gnawing, as well of course as the rodents. The pottery of deposits 1 and 2 has a wide range of shapes embodying a full range of culinary and dining functions. The jugs of deposit 1 represent the original use of the Well as a water source. Then it became a dumping ground (as deposit 2) for broken pottery in many varieties (much of which had been burnt) mixed with animal bones (some of which had been burnt and/or gnawed); all of these may have been tipped into the Well in a single event. We may then presume that somewhere between the possibly fairly long episode of deposit 1 and the possibly short episode of deposit 2 some major event(s), possibly disaster(s), took place in the Kephala settlement. For a start the inhabitants lost their water supply. We cannot say why, or if it was a natural disaster, or somehow a human act. Even if other water sources were available, the (perhaps sudden) unavailability of the Well must have been a blow. Furthermore, there is sufficient evidence of burning to support the idea that we proposed a while ago,365 that there had been a destructive fire in the settlement. This could have been linked directly to the Well's going out of use, or there may have been a period — how long we cannot tell — of abandonment between these two suggested episodes. If food remnants were lying around, it is easy to picture dogs scavenging in the ruins. But other or additional explanations are possible, at least for the composition of the fill of deposit 2 but not, probably, for how it reached the Well, let alone for the Well's ceasing to be a water supply. In several articles over the last decade, Day and Wilson have proposed that the number of high quality chalices, pedestalled bowls and jugs are the debris, ritually discarded, of large-scale collective/communal feasting at Knossos, on one or more occasions. At this/these prestigious event(s), the chalices would have been passed from person to person (since they hold too much for one person, they are intended 361 Wilson 1985, 341-2. 362 Betancourt 20084, 70-1, fig. 5.32; Davaras and Betancourt 2004, 24-5, fig. 42: 17.20 ('Cycladic marble-tempered pottery'). 363 Betancourt 2c&gt;o8i, 78-83, figs. 5.47-5.50; 2010. 364 Cf. Christakis 2008. 365 See n. 2.</page><page sequence="84">EARLY MINOAN I: THE PALACE WELL 71 for sharing), the drink poured from the (small) jugs that are a new shape in EM I, and other nourishment (liquid or solid) served from the pedestalled bowls and perhaps prepared/mixed in the carinated bowls (of type g).366 It is significant that these vessels are EM I shapes that also occur in prestigious burial deposits such as the Pyrgos cave, suggesting special, ritual usage. The picture that analysis of the faunal remains is, as we see from Isaakidou's discussion, less clear: the meats come from different sources at, presumably different times, and do not support the idea of one large feast, and certainly not one centred on eating one type of animal alone; and the bones seem to have been left around for varying lengths of time. To sum up then: Was drinking the focus of any event(s)? On present evidence, that seems to be the case; but we do not have the evidence to compare the proportions of drinking vessels (or indeed serving and eating vessels) to the rest of the ceramic repertoire.367 Was such drinking in some way a ritualised event? In view of the types, size and quality of the pottery, that is more likely than its being an event for just one ordinary 'household'. (If it was the household of a 'chief', that becomes another matter.) Could there have been many such events? There seems to have been at least one; and there may have been more. What of the burning? Does it suggest several fires? It is hard to tell. While it seems more likely that there was just one fire that burnt the already broken crockery before it was dumped in the Well, the animal bones were both burnt and unburnt, which could perhaps point to fires on various occasions or to a fire restricted to part of settlement, such as a chief's house, when a fire could have been followed by ransacking. Is there evidence for a ritual happening? Breaking the pottery and/or putting it in a fire before depositing it in the Well may, singly or together, have been such. However, we may well then have to include in a proposed ritual breakage, or series of breakages, the smashing of the pithoi and other vessels used to store the food and drink. This is prima facie unlikely, but it is quite compatible with destruction of the settlement by (external) human agency. Are other explanations possible? Yes. The rest of the pottery in deposit 2, including the pithoi and bins, suggests that we may instead be looking at the debris of a household, or group of households, that contain both evidence for daily life (including the animal bones) and evidence of ceremonial drinking events. If it was the household of the leader of the community, this makes excellent sense. It is also possible that the pottery was all in store when the fire occurred — but this suggestion may be less satisfactory for explaining how the chalices and pedestalled bowls were already broken before the fire(s). Could it have been a fire from a natural disaster or hostile human agency? Yes, this is as possible as a ritual bonfire, if not more so. Is there any evidence to suggest that the secondary deposition of the pottery and other debris in the disused Well was a ritual happening? There is no direct evidence. Such a case would depend only on extrapolating from the numbers and types of drinking and feasting vessels and the fact that so many were broken before the fire(s). The alternative is that the Well had become a convenient dumping place. In short: — feasting is likely, but concentrated on drinking (to judge from the faunal evidence); — subsequent ritual breakage and burning are possible, but not necessary, explanations; — ritual deposition is less likely, especially in view of the other debris of the daily life of the settlement that occurred in deposit 2; — and the breakages and burning (which both happened beyond any doubt) need not have been part of any ritual events, but may be the first of many destructions with fire that occurred at Bronze Age Knossos.

ROYAL ROAD: NORTH In 1961 as the last stage of operations in RRN,1 and as a result of a small trial the year before that produced deposit A7 (below) and appeared to promise more early levels, a larger trial was opened in trench LA near the centre of the area of excavation, with Hugh Sackett as trench supervisor.2 This sounding (figs. 2.1, 4.1-4.4, plates 1, 20), measuring 2.75 m N-s x 2.45 m E-w, was taken down to a depth of 2 m below the level of Floor I, which had the LM IB destruction deposit including the debris of an ivory worker's shop.3 By contrast, in the w part of the RRN excavation to the w of the N-s wall uu, the floors of the LM IB destruction were at a much greater depth, being in a basement. Here the rock was reached at between 6.65 m and 6.74 m above datum, and the earliest deposits above it were assignable to MM III. The LM IB floors were for the most part only some 0.5 m above this (c. 7.25 m above datum).4 To the E of wall uu (plate 20 a), however, Floor I with the LM IB destruction deposit was over 2 m higher (9.28 m above datum). We expected that a sounding here might reveal deposits of earlier Middle Minoan, as in the excavations on the opposite side of the Royal Road (RRS) ;5 but no deposit of any phase of MM was identified. Floor II, only o. 1 m below the LM IB Floor I, had evidently gone out of use in LM IA.6 A pit had been filled with debris in LM IA, and then sealed by the LM IB floor (plate 20 a-b). Mismarked Boxes in the SMK In June 2009 Cadogan noticed mistakes in marking the boxes for Area A in the SMK, which have led to some confusion. A mismarking of the boxes has meant that the correlations for EM II and III in the Knossos Pottery Handbook are one step out of order with the stratigraphic sequence of the excavation. Thus, where Momigliano mentions 'Floor II' of Area A,7 assigning it to EM III late, this should read Floor III (deposit A6, and also perhaps A7). The real Floor II, whence the problem originated, is the LM IA level beneath the LM IB destruction deposit in trench LA (plate 20 a-b). Likewise, the 'Floor III' which she assigns to EM III early8 is really Floor IV (deposit A5), the earlier EM III floor in Area A,9 and the EM IIB level she mentions as being beneath it is our Floor V (A4), and not 'Floor IV'. Finally, 'Floor VI', the small deposit of late EM IIA that Wilson mentions,10 should probably read as Floor VII (Ai), which we see as being probably a little later than the WCH (p. 286); while our Floor VI (A2) is the first EM IIB deposit in Area A.

The Early Minoan Floors and Deposits The sounding below the LM I Floors I and II in trench LA in Area A produced a long Early Minoan stratigraphic sequence (figs. 4.2-4.4; table 4.2 for correlation with the sequence in Area B): five successive floors or occupation surfaces (Floors III—VII) and eight associated deposits (A7-A0) in a depth of c. 1.25 m. The deposits overlaid a scatter of Neolithic sherds that did not seem to amount to occupation debris (see below on Ao). There was also a ninth separate deposit (A8) a little to the se of the sounding.</page><page sequence="89">THE EARLY MINOAN II —III EXCAVATIONS Table 4.2. Areas A and B.

Most probably we have here house remains, as is especially evident in Floor VI. The two EM III surfaces (Floors III and IV) were preserved only at the N end of the sounding (fig. 4.2, plate 20 b). These were stratified above Floor V (deposit A4) assignable to EM IIB, which lay above Floor VI (deposit A2), which is earlier in EM IIB (while deposit A3 may represent Floor VI perhaps mixed with Floor V (table 4.2). Floor VI in turn was above Floor VII, which went out of use in EM IIA. Since some of these floors relate to several deposits (which were studied individually), when we present the finds we shall do this primarily by the deposits which, we believe, will make the components of the sequence as clear as we can manage. Floor III (levels LA103, LA102: deposit A6) of EM III was identified at c. 0.2 m below Floor I (LM IB) and some 0.1 m below Floor II (LM IA). No traces of walls were noted in association with this occupation surface, but the layer of hard yellow clay or kouskouras which marked it seemed like a floor. Feature a|i, consisting of a single course of stones set in a circle, was identified in the nw corner of the sounding resting on top of the yellow clay here (plate 20 b). A very small amount of pottery, about 1/4 table, comes from above Floor III. But the material descibed under A7, which occupied over 11/4 tables and had been excavated the previous year (i960) in the N part of the sounding in trench LA, is EM III in character and seems assignable to this horizon. Deposit A7 is in two parts: A7.2: level LA51; and, below it, A7.1: level LA54. Floor IV (deposit A5: levels LAgg-LAggA) lay some 0.35-0.40 m below Floor III (figs. 4.2, 4.4). On the E side of the sounding it was marked by an area of white plaster measuring c. 1.6 m n-s x 1.2 m E-w. A badly defined patch of red clay to the N of this plaster may have been the remains of dissolved mud brick. The material above this surface, covering about one table, was still EM III. No certain traces of walls were observed in conjunction with Floors III and IV. But short stretches of wall, only preserved one course thick in the nw and ne corners of the sounding (visible in fig. 4.4 and plate 20 a in the N section of the sounding) appeared to belong with Floor V (deposit A4: levels LA104 LA104A), with pottery covering about 1/2 table and assignable to a late stage in EM IIB.</page><page sequence="90">KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1 957-1 961: EARLY MINOAN Fig. 4.2.

Area A. n section of sounding. Floor VI (deposit A2: levels LA106, LA108, LA 1056), above which classic EM IIB pottery covering about two tables was found, lay some 0.4-0.5 m below the surface of Floor V. It was associated with a stretch of wall απ c. 0.35 m wide and preserved to a height of c. 0.3 m with two courses. Wall απ ran n-s along the length of the sounding, and appeared to be the outside wall of a house, with part of a room on the w side (plate 20 c) and what seems to have been an open space (or yard) on the Ε (fig. 4.3, PLATE 20 d). The wall had an opening for a doorway 1 m wide. A stone with a socket for a wooden doorpost was in position by the wall on the w side of the opening and just to the Ν of it (plate 20 c, e).u The wooden door, that is to say, made in one piece with the doorpost, would have opened inwards, and would have been protected from the weather by the width of the wall, if the space to the Ε was open ground. The floor of the room w of wall απ had been carefully made with a layer of clay, greenish to red in colour, c. 0.06-0.07 m thick above a strew of small cobble-like stones. The layer of clay was traced rising upwards as a vertical (mud plaster) facing against the upper course preserved of απ on the Ε side of the room (plate 20 e). The floor of the room was c. 0.2 m higher than the surface (which may have been open ground) to the Ε of wall απ during the time it was in use. This surface, like Floors V-III above it, had a slight slope down towards the E. On top of it was an extensive patch of red clay, which may have been decayed mud brick, together with some stones that might have fallen from wall απ when it was finally destroyed (plate 20 d). Wall απ appears to be at right angles to the earliest wall(s) that Evans found in his Armoury/Arsenal excavation,12 which was adjacent to the RRN excavation to the Ε. Indeed, the early walls in the Armoury site are shown by Mackenzie13 as continuing to the w — which could suggest a quite substantial building (if it was one building) and/or open space continuing that to the Ε of wall απ. It would imply that occupation here immediately to the Ν of the Kephala hill was quite extensive — and even substantial — by early EM IIB. 11 Other EM stone door sockets include: Knossos (SMK E.III.2 663 — see p. 243: 24); Alykomouri (Haggis 1993, 21, 25, fig. 8, pi. 5.2: 155); Fournou Korifi II (Warren 1972a, 218 19 and pi. 71: 61-62, 66). 12 Hood and Smyth 1981, 51 no. 213, with references. 13 DM/DB 1904, 88 (Palmer 1963, pi. 25, where walls are shown continuing to the w; and, re-drawn, Boardman 1963, 68, fig. 14).</page><page sequence="92">8o KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN Deposit A3 (Floor VI mixed [?] with Floor V: levels LA105-LA105A) comes from the upper part of the deposit above Floor VI. It may be contemporary with A2 below it, and the pottery certainly looks earlier than that of A4 above it; but, in view of a possibility of contamination from A4, it was studied separately from A2. Floor VII (deposit Ai: levels LA114, LA116-LA117; LA111, LA113; and LA109-LA110, which may be mixed with material from deposit A2) was only reached in excavation on the E side of the sounding to the E of wall an at a depth of 0.20-0.25 m below the surface associated with Floor VI (plate 20 c). A hearth was identified in the northern part of the sounding (fig. 4.4); but whether the space here was open ground or inside a building was not clear. The material incorporated in the make-up of Floor VI to the w of wall an seemed to be of the same character as that from below the surface of Floor VI to the E of the wall, and was included for analysis with it. All this pottery, covering about one table, seems assignable to EM IIA. A trial (deposit Ao: level LAi 15) was opened below the part of Floor VII that was exposed in the se corner of the sounding (fig. 4.2, plate 20 c bottom right). Measuring c. 1.3 m N-s x 1.4 m E-w, it was taken down to a depth of c. 0.4 m below the surface of Floor VII (7.18 m above datum) without reaching another occupation surface or the natural rock. This deposit seemed to consist of washed down soil rather than occupation debris. The few sherds are generally Neolithic, but two certainly Early Minoan. Deposit A8 (level LA94) is somewhat separate from this sequence. It is from the lowest levels reached in the space between the later walls ay and ar| to the se of the main EM sounding (fig. 4.1). The deposit excavated was c. 1.4 m N-s x 1 m E-w, and 0.20-0.25 m deep. It may be a fill incorporating material of different dates, the latest apparently being EM II and stylistically probably between deposits Ai and A2: this should set it in later EM IlA. Group Ag, finally, is not a deposit at all but a collection of EM fragments of interest from later Minoan levels in RRS and RRN, with one from the Hogarth's Houses excavation on Lower Gypsades (see pp. 190-2). The code for this Early Minoan sounding is LA/61 (and LA/60 for levels LA51 and LA54), covering deposits A0-A8; but some non-ceramic finds were catalogued with RR/61 numbers. prepalatial occupation in royal road: north This small sounding has produced a sequence of apparently domestic occupation from EM IIA to EM III on the N slope of the Kephala hill. Although little architecture was preserved, its domestic nature is clear, as is the habit of rebuilding at the same spot over several centuries. A small mixed group of other artefacts (pp. 227-9) can be mirrored at better preserved settlements such as Myrtos Fournou Korifi. Obsidian was quite plentiful, especially in the EM II deposits; and, although no workshop space could be identified, it was probably worked somewhere nearby. The animal bones reveal the typical farmyard animals of Knossos, but also dog and badger (pp. 229-33). AREA B. THE EARLY HOUSES TO THE SOUTH OF THE PALACE Following the discovery in 1957 by Nikolaos Platon, then Ephor of Crete, of a red plastered floor and wall (plate 21 b-c) and pottery dating to EM II-MM IA during conservation work in the part of the Palace site known as the Early Houses (figs. 2.1, 10.1: 27, plates 1, 21 a), the School was invited to examine the Houses in more detail, with a view to learning more of the Prepalatial sequence and history of Knossos. This excavation took place in 1960. The Early Houses to the s of the Palace are a group of much eroded EM II—III — and probably MM IA — buildings and deposits that antedate the Old Palace, and were set into and onto Neolithic levels (figs. 4.5-4.8). The name 'Early Houses' was coined by Duncan Mackenzie, who identified two sets of buildings: one he dated to EM II; and a substantial building above it he dated to MM I, calling it the 'MM I House'. Following Momigliano and Wilson, who conducted a further excavation in and around the Early Houses in 1993, Mackenzie's MM I House is now known as the South Front House (SFH) — a name that we follow — and is dated to EM III.14 This name, however, cannot apply to the EM IIB structures beneath the SFH; and Early Houses remains the best general name for the buildings at this site. 14 Momigliano and Wilson 1996, 6, 54.</page><page sequence="93">THE EARLY MINOAN II —III EXCAVATIONS 81 The Early Houses lie immediately downhill to the s from the later Palace and face Gypsades hill and the Caravanserai across the Vlychia stream.15 They are bounded to the N by the (later) South Corridor and to the w by the cutting for the South House (plate 21 a-b, d), which doubtless destroyed other Prepalatial structures. To the s the ground falls quickly away to the Vlychia stream; immediately to the E are the so-called Early Paving and the s entrance (South Porch) of the Palace.16 The present extent of the Early Houses is c. 12.5 m n-s x g m E-w. Hidden beneath the South Porch is the circular sunken building known as the Hypogaeum, whose fill contained MM IA and later pottery.17 The cobble paving known as the Early Paving that lies between the Hypogaeum and the Early Houses,18 measuring c. 6.4 m N-S x 9.4 m E-w as preserved, is the remains of a yard of MM IB, or later, date. The excavations in 1993 showed that it was laid over a deep MM IB fill and is most probably earlier than the South Facade of the Palace.19 The Early Paving did not exist at the same time as the Hypogaeum, and so could not have linked it with the Early Houses. (This does not exclude the possibility of an earlier connecting open area, whether paved or not.) The History of Excavations and Interventions around the Early Houses Since there have been at least seven excavation campaigns at the Early Houses, and a campaign of cleaning and conservation in 1957 before the current conservation of the Palace and its surrounds, it may be helpful to review the history of all of these before presenting the work in 1960. 1907-08 After excavating the South Fagade and Early Paving in 1907,20 Mackenzie moved westwards in 1908 and tackled the Neopalatial South House21 and the Early Houses.22 He and Evans appear to have concluded that there were EM II (on the whole)23 and MM I deposits here, and buildings, which became the 'Early Houses', assignable to those phases. They included a substantial building which Mackenzie called the 'M.M.I.House',24 now known as the South Front House (SFH). The EM II deposits appear to have included a floor deposit, or deposits, with whole and nearly whole vessels, which Evans discussed briefly.25 We present this pottery again, as far as we can, below (pp. 266-74), while Wilson and Day have published the EM IIB sherds from the Early Houses, which they suggest come from fills.26 These deposits of 1907-08, together with those that we excavated and those that Momigliano and Wilson excavated in 1993, have led to Wilson's definition of an EM IIB South Front Group of pottery at Knossos.27 1957 During conservation work in December 1957, the Ephor Nikolaos Platon came upon two red plaster floors. The upper of these (which became floor 5 in our trench A) met a wall on the n (our wall a) that also had red plaster, and was above another floor with pottery resting on it (which became our floor 4). He reported also finding Vasiliki ware and a calcite figurine.28 Through the kindness of Lefteris Platon, who has given us copies of his photographs and notebook entry,29 we can include here a fuller account of what his father found and present his photographs from 1957 (plate 21 b-f), while Wilson is publishing EM I—IIB pottery from his conservation work around the Palace, including some pottery from the Early Houses and from N of the South House.30 The upper red floor (5) belongs with wall a, Platon wrote in his notebook, which also had a red plaster facing. Both are part of a house datable to 'MM IA', which is equivalent to, but perhaps not 15 Hood and Taylor 1981, 13 no. 2, with the name EARLY HOUSES.

One has the impression that Platon based his date upon the pottery collected during the cleaning. He also noted 'a large number' of MM IA sherds and among them some datable to ΈΜ III' '(light on dark καί dark on light)', as well as 'some jugs and a teapot'. ΈΜ III' refers probably to what we should now assign to EM IIB: in 1957 the notion of light-on-dark pottery occurring in EM IIB was barely conceivable. And his 'MM IA' is more than likely to be what we are now calling EM III. The calcite figurine, 'triangular and of Naqada type', came from 'inside the wall of the central room', while one small, narrow compartment 'μορφής αποθέτου' produced a lot of 'MM IA' sherds and small vessels. The compartment is likely to be the nearly rectangular space (some 2.8 m long) in the middle of fig. 4.5, to the Ε of our trench Β and wall γ, and s of the eastwards continuation of our wall β.31 plate 21 d shows the room with floor 5 (and presumably floor 4 below) ending more or less where our trench A stopped on the e, and almost on the line of N-s wall MW 13 (which should be the Ε wall of a long, narrow room — see below). The pottery included ΈΜ III light on dark'. Platon also mentions Vasiliki ware found a little to the Ε of the room with the red plaster 'during the cleaning of a wall (or paving of a kalterimïï)\ which can refer only to wall MW 14, which is shown in the foreground of plate 21 d.52 Platon also cleaned the Early Paving, possibly revealing more of it than had been found in 1908. i960 Platon's discoveries led to a small excavation by Hood in 1960. The aim was to elucidate the date(s) and building sequence of the Early Houses as part of the stratigraphical and chronological re-evaluation of Evans's sequence at Knossos. Three other small tests were also opened. The final account of this work follows below. 1969 In 1969 J. D. Evans opened trench Ζ in the cutting by the Ε side of the South House, finding Neolithic levels, the latest of which dates to LN I.33 This area was clearly outside the main area of Neolithic inhabitation, and what appeared to be rubbish was found resting on the natural kouskouras,34 outside, and below the level of, the Early Houses. Trench Ζ included part of a small tunnel cut into the kouskouraJ35 that probably led to an underground chamber, and was sealed by several redepositions of mixed MN-LN I material. 1987 In 1987 Hood directed excavations in the Palace by the South Front near the Hypogaeum. They produced valuable information for the history of the Palace,36 but no Prepalatial evidence. 1993: KARETSOU In 1993 Karetsou made soundings in the area of the Early Houses, as part of the restoration programme of the Palace and surrounding buildings.37 She notes: (1) more ΈΝ' next to J. D. Evans's trench Z; (2) a Protopalatial stone drain to the s of this, at a spot where there had already been 'unrecorded excavations', which could refer to our trenches D and/or Ε (see below); (3) a possible E-w fortification wall by the South House, about which, she reports, no further information could be obtained:38 this must be wall β, which we examined in i960 in trenches D and Ε and discuss below; (4) foundation deposits not noticed by Arthur Evans in the bedrock to the s of the South House: see below under trench F (p. 93); 31 For a relatively recent photograph, see Momigliano and Wilson 1996, pi. 3d. 32 For wall MW 14, see Momigliano and Wilson 1996, 54 and pi. 3d (for its appearance in 1993). 33 Tomkins, pers. comm. 34 J.

We recommend reading their excellent report to help understanding of our account below, where we include details of, and from, their trenches (using the prefix MW for their trench numbers, wall names etc.) as appropriate.43 It is worth summarising the architectural and stratigraphic Prepalatial sequence which they reconstructed, combining the 1908, i960 and 1993 results:44 1 Neolithic. 2 EM cuttings into the Neolithic levels: of uncertain date, but not later than EM IIB. 3 EM IIB: while the i960 excavation identified four phases within EM IIB, the 1993 MW excavation found the three latest of these.45 These four phases are: A: our deposit Bi (see below). B: a lower EM IIB floor. C: an upper EM IIB floor. D: an EM IIB pit. 4 EM III: a fill followed by three building phases (the fill and first two building phases occurring only to the s of, and thus outside, our two main trenches),46 and that in turn by the occupation of the South Front House: A: the fill in MW trench V. B: building phase 1. C: building phase 2. D: building phase 3 — the building of the South Front House, later called the SFH Foundation Trench Group and assigned to EM III early.47 E: the occupation of the SFH, later assigned to the UEW Group of EM III late,48 and including our deposit B3.49 (1999) Although not work in the field, the publication in 1999 by Wilson and Day of EM IIB pottery in the SMK — if mostly sherds — from the Early Houses50 marks another important step in understanding the Prepalatial settlement at Rnossos. Apart from their exhaustive analysis of the pottery and its ware groups, they propose that the large EM IIB deposits that Evans and Mackenzie found (and kept) were a secondary deposition, namely a fill that was laid down over the latest EM IIB floor levels and building remains to make a terrace that might be datable to EM IIB, or (subsequently?) to be a levelling fill in the construction in EM III of the SFH. They also suggest that the latest EM IIB pottery at the site (from our pit C, partly excavated by us in 1 g6o, partly by Momigliano and Wilson in 1993) may be perhaps even later than the fill/pottery they publish.51 If so, one could argue that the 39 The 'thick EM III fill' matches what Momigliano (1991, 201) suggested for what is almost certainly the same deposit, noting that Mackenzie talked of the area 'covered' by what he called MM I pottery. 40 Wilson and Day 1999, 4 and n. 11. 41 A.

The general lack of whole vessels in the deposit and absence of signs of destruction by fire are, Wilson and Day believe, strong arguments for secondary deposition, with the pottery having been brought (as sherds) from elsewhere to be a hard core. This is an attractive idea, but it raises the question of whether the whole vessels that Evans and Mackenzie found here (see pp. 266-74) — and some of them come from the same boxes in the SMK as the sherds they publish — can really be part of the suggested fill or belonged with floor levels beneath it.52 If the entry in Mackenzie's daybook is not completely clear on this,53 Evans writes that these whole vessels are from house floors.54 They form an impressive assemblage. The i960 Excavations The excavations lasted from 20 to 27July i960.55 Cadogan was trench supervisor and fSpyros Vasilakis senior workman, assisted by "fGrigoris Kritzalakis. The plans were drawn by Edward Bird, excavation architect that year. The code for this excavation is PEM/60 (= Palace Early Minoan/ig6o). The three main trenches of this small excavation produced principally Neolithic, EM IIB and EM III occupation remains. The first accounts, however, do not mention the EM III finds;56 and in 1962 Hood specifically excluded the presence of EM III 'as this was defined by Evans (our italics)',57 albeit noting the presence of a pre-polychrome phase that could qualify as EM III. Study of the pottery, however, in 1964-65 led to a restatement in late 1965 of the results of the i960 campaign: at last, deposit B3 could be identified as definitively EM III with nothing at all — specifically, no polychrome — that had to be exclusively MM IA.58 There were two principal trenches, A and Β (fig. 4.5).59 Trench A, measuring c. 1.75 m n-s χ c. 1.8 m Ε—w, was bounded: — on the N, by the modern retaining wall of the South Corridor, but with Minoan wall α (MW wall 12) next to and beneath this modern wall on its s side; — on the e, by MW trench II with a baulk of c. 0.2 m between the Ε line of trench A and the w line of MW trench II,60 with the consequence that MW wall 13 is outside trench A; — on the s, by wall β (MW wall 1); — and on the w, stopping c. 1.75 m short of the cutting for the South House. Trench B, immediately s of trench A and on the far side of wall β, measuring c. 1.85 m n-s χ c. 1.95 m (max.) E-w, was bounded: — on the N, by wall β (and trench A beyond it to the n); — on the E, by wall γ (MW wall 3); — to the s, the ground drops away; — and on the W, stopping c. 0.10-20 m short of MW wall 15 (which is just visible on the left in PLATE 12 f). Trenches A and Β revealed: — surfaces assignable to Neolithic (two or more deposits) ; — EM IIB levels in two principal deposits: Bi and B2, the lower Bi lying on what appeared to be Neolithic debris, with many small stones; — the EM III deposit B3 in a room with well preserved wall and floor plaster that was part of the SFH. Two pink/red plaster floors (originally exposed in 1957) sealed the EM III deposit above and below. As in Area A on the nw side of the Kephala hill, no EM I level was observable; but here, unlike Area A, there was also no EM IIA level. The Neolithic levels were not excavated. 52 Wilson and Day (1999, 4, n. 16) believe they are from the same (fill) deposit as the sherds. 53 DM/DB for 05.06.1908, quoted by Momigliano and Wilson (1996, 6). 54 PM I, 71, 74. 55 Not 1961, as in Hood and Taylor 1981, 13: 2. 56 Hood 1961, 27; 1962^, 265-6. 57 Hood 1962c, 93. 58 Hood 1966.

Trench C was c. 1.5 m square, and set towards the N end of a narrow space between the continuation of wall a (MW wall lb) to the N, MW wall 2 to the E, and MW wall 5 to the w.

During excavation we believed that it was a hearth (calling it 'hearth H') that had been in use with floors 2 and 3; but when more of it was found in 1993 in the NW corner of MW trench II,62 it became certain that this was a pit that cut through, or formed a hole in, both the EM IIB fill that Mackenzie and Evans found immediately below the EM III SFH remains, and also floors 2 and 3 (as the MW excavations confirmed). The contents of pit C are then among the latest, if not the latest, surviving EM IIB remains from the area of the Early Houses. The pit was filled with alternating bands of red 61 Momigliano 1991, 198-204; 2007c, 83-94. The evidence is not strong enough to include the SFH in the House C/RRS Fill Group of MM IA: Momigliano and Wilson 1996, 48, n. 47; Momigliano 2007 c, 94-6. 62 Momigliano and Wilson 1996, 11, fig. 6, 28, fig. 17, pi. 4.</page><page sequence="99">THE EARLY MINOAN II —III EXCAVATIONS 87 and grey ashey earth, with some charcoal and stones. We removed its lower part as levels Ag and Ai 1. The upper part was excavated with levels A6 and A7. Following the work in 1993, we see now that what the i960 excavations found as pit C, and the 1993 excavations found more of, is the s part of a large pit, 1 m or more deep, and c. 2.5 m wide on its s side; but its full dimensions cannot be known, since most of it is covered by the South Corridor of the Palace. Since the top of the pit as found in 1993 was above the levels of both our floor 4 and our floor 5, it is clear that the builders of the SFH cut into the latest EM IIB levels, and then sealed them (in trench A at any rate) beneath floor 4. In 1993 the pit produced a substantial deposit of late EM IIB pottery, as well as a stone pounder, three unfired clay loomweights and three pieces of mudplaster, one of them painted red.63 Our next level in descending order beneath floor 4 was a red-brown occupation deposit c. 0.2 m deep, excavated as level A6, over an upper EM IIB floor 3. This floor was a thin layer of kouskouras sloping to the sw and s — as all pre-EM III levels did, while EM III floors 4 and 5 were level and horizontal. We could not find any walls to associate with floor 3. This level is the upper EM IIB occupation level in MW trench II.64 Below floor 3 was a similar occupation level, excavated as levels A7, A8 and A10, over another kouskouras floor 2, which was only 0.01 m thick and excavated as level Ai2a (with no sherds). Immediately above floor 2 was a similarly thin level (A 12) of hard, clayey reddish-white earth, which was presumably a re-lay, or the topping, of floor 2. This lower occupation deposit was 0.22-0.34 m deep, and overlay the kouskouras layers of deposit Bi. It is the lower EM IIB level in MW trench II.65 Cut through these kouskouras layers in the w of trench A was a foundation trench (pit B) running N s, 0.42 m wide and 0.53 m deep at the N section, narrowing to the s, and turning away there to the E, where it was 0.15 m wide and c. 0.3 m deep. This trench had a fill of heavy red clayey earth, with small stones and flecks of charcoal and kouskouras, and EM II sherds. It had been dug for wall 8, of which three courses were preserved in the w side of trench A (plate 22 b). Wall 8, which continues into trench B, belongs with the lower EM IIB occupation deposit (as is clear in the sections in figs. 4.8-4.9), and is the only EM II house wall that we could find beneath the SFH (but see below). Running roughly N-s, it is loosely constructed of small to medium-sized rough stones, and survives to a maximum height of c. 0.37 m. Only the stones on its E face were visible. Wall 8 continued beneath wall (3 (MW wall 1) of the SFH into trench B (plate 22 b-c), for a total extant length of at least 3 m. Pit B, the foundation trench of wall 8, was dug into a hard dark yellow layer beneath floor 2 with many small stones and lumps of kouskouras, which was excavated as level A13. The pottery from this level, which in effect is the top of pit B, together with that from level A14 in the lower part of the pit, together with the corresponding levels Bio and B9 in trench B, are all presented here as deposit Bi. Deposit B2 consists of the other, later EM IIB layers sealed beneath floor 4, that is to say: (1) levels An and Ag of pit C (which we had originally thought to be (part of) a hearth and saw consequently as belonging with floors 2 and 3, rather than being later); (2) level A6 of floor 3; and (3) levels A12, A10, A8-A7 of floor 2. However, although they were all studied together as one deposit, where relevant and possible we give the level numbers of the pieces of pottery and other finds — which should help any efforts to distinguish earlier and later pottery in this B2 deposit. Finally in trench A, we made a small test (1.25 m N-s x 0.40 m E-w) against the E section of the trench to the s of Pit C, finding a layer (level A15) with much kouskouras. This lay above floor 1, of disturbed kouskouras sloping sharply to the w. Level A15 produced only Neolithic pottery and probably represents fallen Neolithic debris, including perhaps building debris, that had crumbled in the long interval until the EM II occupation. Floor 1 is most probably a Neolithic surface. Beneath floor 1 was a dark use layer that has to be Neolithic. Trench B In eroded ground, that must have been disturbed in igo8 and perhaps again in ig57, the two upper EM IIB levels of trench B barely survived (plate 22 c), as the sections (figs. 4.6, 4.8) show. Floor 2 of trench A, however, continued under wall P across all of trench B. Below it was the same early EM IIB deposit with wall 8 and its foundation trench (pit B) continuing from trench A, and thus part of deposit Bi. 63 Momigliano and Wilson 1996, 30-43, figs. 19-26, pi. 8; Wilson 2007, 70-6.

Area B. Trench B: n section. Pit B was excavated here as levels Bg-Bio; and level B6 (above Bg) was probably also part of the same deposit and would be comparable to level A13 (but, however, has not been included in the pottery analysis in case of possible contamination). Between levels Bg and Bio in pit B was a thin layer of crumbly kouskouras. In this trench the pit/foundation trench was 0.4 m deep and 0.4 m wide where it cut the Neolithic kouskouras level B7,66 which seems comparable to level A15. While wall 8 is the only EM IIB wall that we found, there may have been one more at least that Mackenzie found in the area of trench B, which no longer exists;67 and perhaps there were others. Below level B7 were other Neolithic occupation layers: level B868 was a fairly hard dark grey layer with charcoal, which is comparable to the lowest level A16 in the other trench; while below it was another level with white to yellow and grey kouskouras. It is probable that, as in trench A, we have here Neolithic occupation debris. Although most of the pottery from trench B was included for study with deposit B2, none of it is included in the pottery statistics and, when pieces from trench B are described, we say so. Trenches A and B: Neolithic-Early Minoan II The Neolithic-EM II sequence of phases (Neolithic: phase 1; EM IIB: phases 2-5) in trenches A and B may be summarised as: 1 Neolithic use: trenches A and B, below floor 1. 2 Above trenches A and B floor 1, and below trenches A and B floor 2; includes the foundation trench (pit B) of wall 8. 3 Above trenches A and B floor 2, and below trench A floor 3; includes wall 8. 4 Above trench A floor 3. 5 Pit C in ne corner of trench A. There may of course be subdivisions in phase 1 (Neolithic), and further excavation could be worthwhile. As for the EM IIB phases,69 we should emphasise that our deposit Bi represents phase 2, but our study of deposit B2 combined phases 3-5. The igg3 excavation separated them, and also found a 66 Tomkins (pers. comm.) assigns the pottery to LN I—II. 67 Momigliano and Wilson 1996, 5, fig. 3; 9. 68 Its 'tiny, reworked' sherds seems pure LN I (Tomkins, pers. comm.). 69 The relevant pottery from the 1960 tests is now assigned to the South Front Group of EM IIB (Wilson 2007, 70: 2).</page><page sequence="101">THE EARLY MINOAN II—HI EXCAVATIONS 89 phase of EM cuttings into the Neolithic,70 which we did not find unless, as seems reasonable, we include the large pit B in this category. EARLY MINOAN III Trench A The 1957 conservation revealed what would become, in trench A in i960, important features of the South Front House: principally, the red plaster floor floor 5, bounded to the N by wall a (MW wall 12), which is faced with mud plaster, preserved in i960 to a height of at least c. 0.68 m above floor 5, and with a red (plastered ?) surface apparent in 1957 (plate 21 c-d). Above and behind wall a is the modern terrace wall.71 Both walls are visible in plate 22 b on the right, and wall a and its plaster facing show in the E and N sections of trench A (figs. 4.6-4.7, plate 22 a-b). Wall a, of medium-sized roughly shaped stones, runs E-w and survives to a height of at least o.g-i.o m. This is clearly the interior of a room that certainly extended to the w of trench A, where the continuations of floors 5 and 4 were noted during the 1993 campaign, when it could be confirmed that floor 5 (and, almost certainly, floor 4) connected wall a to the N with wall (3 to the s to form this room (plate 22 b).'72 We do not know, however, how long the room is from E to w, since no w wall survives: it would have been destroyed when the big cutting was made for the South House. To the E, it is likely that a wall, which still survived in 1993 as a stump (MW wall 13) and did not appear at all in trench A, originally formed the E side of the room, connecting walls a and (3.73 We are fairly confident that this is correct, since the two red plaster floors 4 and 5 did not appear to the E of the line of MW wall 13 in MW trench II,74 suggesting that this was a different space/room, separated from the room in trench A by MW wall 13. We suggest then that we have a long, narrow room or passage preserved between walls a (n) and P (s) and, in all probability, MW 13 (e). It measures c. 1.75 m N-s and perhaps some 5 m E-w. We also do not know if wall a is an external wall: if so, and it is not improbable, it would have been the N wall of the SFH. Wall P, running E-w, is c. 0.55-0.60 m wide and survives to a maximum height of 1 m. It is made of medium-sized roughly shaped stones with a filling of smaller stones. On the E side of trench A a recent disturbance (probably grubbing along wall P) was found to have cut floor 5, and apparently floor 4 also, so that it/they did not meet wall P: the disturbance appears in the section as the top (and, we believe, discrete top) of pit A (fig. 4.6). A little pottery from clearing the ground above floor 5 is datable to MM I A, but hardly seems enough to draw conclusions about continuity of use of the SFH into MM IA, as we have already noted (p. 86 and n. 61). There is a case, however, for phasing in the SFH on architectural grounds (see below). Beneath floor 5, and forming its bedding, was the sherd and stone fill of the EM III B3 deposit, 0.05-10 m thick, and resting on a similar plaster floor 4. This sealed assemblage, which has become an important deposit for characterising EM III at Knossos,75 was dug mostly as level A3. There was, however, a slight chance of contamination of this level since part of pit A, the foundation trench of wall p, was removed with it. So a further tranche, 0.3 m wide, was opened on the w side of the trench as level A3a (plate 22 b), where there could be no possibility of contamination. In describing deposit B3 below, we say whether pieces are from level A3 or level A3a. In neither level was any polychrome pottery found (although in level A3 a footed goblet 1052 has a counterpart in the MM IA rubbish deposit of RRS — see p. 215). In retrospect, level A3 seems completely homogeneous and datable to EM III, together with level A3a. Recently, the combined levels have been assigned to the Upper East Well Group of EM III late.76 Floor 5 was removed as levels A2 and A2a. It appeared to have three separate layers of red plaster with white plaster beneath each, where the floor had been relaid — a mille-feuille effect when seen in section. These three layers were in all no deeper than 0.05 m. In places there may have been four layers. In the level A3a extension of the trench to the w, there was a thin scatter of charcoal above the bottom layer. On the n side of the trench the floor met the mudplaster facing of wall a. Floor 4 (at the bottom of the B3 deposit) was equally distinctive in being exactly like floor 5 (above the deposit) in appearance and red plaster construction. This argues for their being fairly close in date and, since both floors belonged with wall a (fig. 4.6), shows that there was in fact a second building 70 Momigliano and Wilson 1996, 27, 52. 71 This appears as a broken line on the s side of SOUTH CORRIDOR in the plan in Hood and Taylor 1981. 72 Momigliano and Wilson 1996, 54, n. 52; Cadogan (personal experience). 73 In 3009 wall MW 13 was no longer visible.

While it is possible that floor 4 belongs with an earlier phase, or predecessor, of wall α (whose existence we have no way of telling), two thin vertical lines of white plaster seemed to be a double edge (or skirting) to floor 4, where it met wall a. They are likely to be a facing (with a second skim of plaster) to the wall. Floor 4 to a great extent overlay the upper EM IIB occupation level A6, which is part of deposit B2 (see above). Floors 4 and 5 were not found in MW trench II. A red floor or red floors, strikingly similar to floors 4 and 5, was/were, however, found some 10 m to the se of our trench Β in MW trenches IV and V. Momigliano and Wilson date it/them to their EM III building phase 1 rather than phase 377 (which is that of the construction of the SFH, including our floor 4). The gap in time between their phases, however, may have been fairly short, as we suspect it was between the laying of floor 4 and the laying of floor 5 in trench A. We may also wonder whether there may have been a terrace wall here, which could have the effect of amalgamating or truncating the proposed sequence of phases. Their excavation section, however, gives no support for this tentative suggestion, since any possible terrace walls do not go down far enough that one can say that they belong with the red floor(s) that Momigliano and Wilson found.78 That leaves the foundation trench (pit A) of wall β (plate 22 a), which appeared in both trench A and MW trench II, where it is the foundation trench of MW wall 1/ib).79 It is key evidence in reconstructing the building history, but not easy to interpret. What makes it especially difficult is that, as already suggested, there seems to have been grubbing along the Ν face of wall β in 1957 and/or 1908. This grubbing seems to have cut through the floors and against the wall in a wedge-shape cutting, which narrowed sharply towards the w and tailed out at about the w edge/sw corner of level Aga (plate 22 b). It is easy to see why it stopped there: it is extremely close to the steep drop into the cutting of the South House, and there is considerable danger of falling in. As for the historical and ceramic importance of the trench, its contents in MW trench II (where there was some quantity of finds) are taken by Momigliano as the eponymous deposit — the SFH Foundation Trench Group — that constitutes EM III early, while our B3 deposit is an important, well stratified component in defining the Upper East Well Group of EM III late.80 In excavating our trench A some of the recent disturbance/grubbing that formed the top of pit A was removed initially in level A3. When this was realised, the rest of the pit was excavated as level A4: a fine dark fill that became steadily harder towards the bottom, which was partly formed by a white kouskouras block at the Ε end of the trench. At that end the pit was 0.3 m wide (and had a maximum depth of 0.52 m, which probably includes recent disruption) tapering to 0.075 m at the w end of the trench, where it was impossible to excavate it fully. As far we could observe in trench A, pit A was dug into both of the EM IIB occupation layers, making it later than them. At the Ε end, as in the adjacent w part of MW trench II, it did not cut into Neolithic levels and was resting on the occupation level immediately above (EM IIB) floor 2.81 But floors 4 and 5, and the B3 deposit between them, were cut at this end (in 1957/1908), which would have removed the evidence to connect them here with wall β. By contrast, at the w end of the trench where the (by now mainly or wholly 1957/1908) pit tapers out, it appeared to just cut floor 4, as plate 22 b suggests. But the further small investigation in 1993 (by Cadogan, during Momigliano and Wilson's excavation) in the small patch of ground between the w edge of level A3a and the South House cutting, combined with a comparison of the relative levels of the floors and top of the ancient part of pit A, led the group to conclude that floor 4 did originally cover pit A and did connect walls a and β to form the narrow room, as floor 5 did again a little later. If this reconstruction is sound, the corollary is that, with two floors (4 and 5) connecting walls α and β, there was a second phase in the life of this part of the SFH. The construction of this second phase is dated by deposit B3; how long it continued we cannot tell, possibly into MM IA. The alternative view has to be either that pit A and deposit B3 belong together or that pit A is even later than B3. Either way, one or other scenario would thus date the construction of wall β and (at least this part of) the SFH to late in EM III, and floor 5 would be the first floor to connect with wall β. This would still leave the need to provide a context for the earlier red floor 4 that is so similar to floor 5: it would still probably connect with wall α but would be, as it were, left hanging on its s side. However, the red floor(s) in MW trenches IV and V shows that making red floors had some history, or had become a tradition, at this site. One need hardly add that, if the suggested alternative view is 77 Momigliano and Wilson 1996, 7-8, figs. 4-5; 11, fig. 6; 47 8, fig. 28. 78 Momigliano and Wilson 1996, 11, fig. 6. 59 Momigliano and Wilson 1996,8, fig. 5; 11, fig. 6; 28, fig. 17; 43-6. 80 Momigliano 2007c, 81-3. 81 Cf. Momigliano and Wilson 1996, 43.</page><page sequence="103">THE EARLY MINOAN II —III EXCAVATIONS 91 correct, the EM III ceramic sequence at this site would differ to some extent from that recently proposed, which is based on seeing the pottery from the equivalent, or continuation, of pit A to the Ε (in MW trench II, the eponymous foundation trench of Momigliano's SFH Foundation Trench Group) as earlier, stratigraphically and stylistically, than our deposit B3. We prefer, however, to stick with the first reconstruction as it makes sense of floor 4 as much as of floor 5 and produces, at the Ν end of the surviving remains of the SFH (which are perhaps the Ν end of the building), clearly two building phases. The earlier of these is the same as Momigliano and Wilson's EM III building phase 3 (see above). The later phase, the laying of floor 5, allows us to add now a building phase 4. For the extent of the SFH, Momigliano and Wilson offer an attractive suggestion, projecting the levels of floors 4 and 5 to the s82 — while we know already that it also extended to the w of trench A. These red floors, even if they are first known a little earlier in MW trenches IV and V, suggest that it was a building of some grandeur,83 as do the finds in deposit Β 3 provided, that is, that they were rubbish from on the spot that was used for this hard core filling (and not material brought from somewhere else at Knossos). Besides its rich assemblage of pottery, the deposit also included a piece of a serpentine vessel 1176, and a (fired) clay jar stopper 1167 with several partial impressions of a seal depicting parading lions. The original seal was probably made of ivory. This is valuable evidence, even as a discard, from a settlement context for dating the early seals of Crete and sealing practices at Prepalatial Knossos. Trench Β In trench Β the EM III levels connected with walls β and α were missing. Wall γ (MW wall 3) runs nne-ssw, and is 0.65-70 m wide and has a maximum height of 0.85 m and a length of 1.4 m. It is made of medium-sized stones and is not bonded into wall β. It seemed to have been rebuilt and partly altered in the last century. Just outside the trench to the w, MW wall 15 runs N-s is c. 0.6m wide, and has a maximum height of 1.25 m and maximum length of o.go m. It is formed (now) of large rough stones on top and smaller ones below (which may be a sign of rebuilding: cf. wall γ). While neither wall γ nor wall MW 15 are bonded into wall β, we assume that they both somehow once formed part of the South Front House.84 Trenches A and B: EM III We propose then an EM III sequence of phases in the construction and use of the South Front House of at least as follows, continuing the sequence above (for Neolithic-EM IIB): 6 Building of walls α and β and laying of floor 4 — EM III. 7 Laying of floor 5 — EM III. 8 Use of floor 5. Trenches A and B: other finds Obsidian was plentiful in both trenches in all levels except Neolithic in trenches A and B. A piece of white lime plaster with blue paint from level Bi (p. 234) may have fallen from the Palace: Mackenzie noted a few fragments of fresco.85 OTHER TRIALS We made three other small trials (trenches D, Ε and F) (fig. 4.9) in i960 near, and inside, the South House. Trenches D and Ε Trench D measured c. ι.χ χ 1.25 m, and trench Ε c. 1 x 2 m. Their purpose was to examine the massive more or less E-w wall (which we called wall β), over 2 m thick, that lies immediately s of the South House, and especially to look for dating evidence.86 Trench D was opened immediately to the sw by w of the Pillar Basement of the South House, between an E-w wall that we called α (the ν edge of the trench) and wall β (the s edge of the trench) (plate 22 e). Trench Ε was set against wall β from the s (plate 22 /). 82 Momigliano and Wilson ι gg6, 11, fig. 6. 83 Cf. Wilson 1994, 38. 84 Cf.

The first level excavated in trench D revealed that the bottom of wall β had been reached before we ever began: the wall stopped at the natural kouskouras (plate 22 d-e). In the Ν part of the trench level D2 was then excavated and also soon reached kouskouras. The kouskouras is, on average, c. 0.5 m below the present surface. Level D2 also revealed in the Ν part of the trench the s face of wall a, 0.4 m high at its Ε end in trench D and c. 0.55 m high at its w end in the trench D.87 This wall β (not to be confused with the wall β of the SFH above; the same applies to wall γ below) is composed of large, occasionally colossal roughly dressed blocks, with a fill of small stones between. It is 2.1 m wide and 0.95 m high. No specific dating evidence could be obtained:88 burrowing beneath it (level D3) produced five Neolithic sherds. While it is possible that it had been built and was destroyed before the South House was built, Driessen has suggested that it could have been a terrace wall for the platform of the House or even supported a road terrace.89 Alexiou, however, includes this wall in his likely evidence for defence and war in Minoan Crete.90 And this must be the wall that Karetsou (re-)investigated in 199391 — see above. Trench D having proved essentially abortive, trench Ε was begun on the s side of wall β. Immediately, wall γ was found parallel with wall β — and possibly forming its footings (plate 22 f). It extended 0.55 m out from wall β at the Ε end of the trench and was 0.9 m high, and 0.6 m out and was 0.8 m high at the w end of the trench. It is composed mainly of rough large stones, with a few small stones between. In the bottom course was a well-dressed block, c. 0.3 m square. Wall γ was clearly bonded into wall β. Karetsou found the Protopalatial stone drain she reports (see above) to be running e-w due s of the Neolithic trench Z. It is likely that the 'unrecorded excavations' she mentions are, or include, one or other or both of our trenches D and E. Trench Ε produced an unusual, and probably EM, clay foot, perhaps from a vessel: 1148. The bottom level E4 of this trial, with light earth and much kouskouras which seemed to be the beginning of the natural rock, produced two scraps of pottery: one light brown burnished and perhaps Neolithic, the other a plain orange flaring bowl and perhaps Early Minoan. 87 In Driessen 2003, 29, fig. 1.1, wall a is the wall near the bottom left corner of the plan, immediately north of the big wall (our wall β). 88 Macdonald (pers. comm.) comments that it is perhaps comparable to a series of MM III walls found around the Palace site. 89 Driessen 2003, 30. 90 Alexiou 1980, 17. 91 With the assistance of Maria Kladou. Work was (principally) to the w of wall β.</page><page sequence="105">THE EARLY MINOAN II—III EXCAVATIONS 93 Trench F Trench F was a small trial, c. 0.65 m square, in the sw corner of the Pillar Basement of the South House (plate 22 d-e).92 It revealed the bottoms of the w and s walls of the Basement just below the present surface level. As in trench D, stratigraphy was virtually non-existent. In 1993 Karetsou cleaned here comprehensively down to the kouskouras or the Neolithic levels, finding fragments of handleless cups, possibly MM III, set into hollows in the kouskouras.93 NEOLITHIC AND PREPALATIAL OCCUPATION AT THE EARLY HOUSES AND SOUTH FRONT HOUSE Neolithic The Neolithic debris noted in our trenches A and B, and J. D. Evans's trench Z, seems to be outside the (main) Neolithic inhabited area.94 If, however, trenches A and B do show occupation levels and floors of houses rather than surfaces in an open space, such buildings are then probably right on the edge of the Neolithic settlement (although the precise chronology here needs clarifying). The rubbish noted in trench Z was, presumably, tipped outside the area with houses. Early Minoan I Come EM I, there seems to have been at the least a lack of growth, and perhaps even a retrenchment, around the core settlement on the Kephala hill.95 There is hardly anything in the stratigraphy or the pottery from any of the investigations of the Early Houses to suggest that this part of the hill was in use in EM I or EM IIA.96 Early Minoan IIB The situation changed in EM IIB, when settled life returned to this part of the hill. The late EM IIA fill to the N of the South House found by Karetsou in 1993 (see p. 83 above) may represent a levelling operation immediately prior to the EM IIB developments. While there appear to be two principal occupation layers resting on floors, we are short of walls to go with them; nor do we have any floor of superior quality comparable to the EM III red floors, on which the whole pottery found in 1908 could once have been standing. On the other hand if there was considerable filling or dumping here in EM IIB, it might have comprised principally the 1908 pottery, perhaps coming from an EM IIB building at the site which now no longer exists. Alternatively, one might argue instead that this was a fill for building the South Front House;97 the mixture of EM IIB and EM III pottery in the E part of the foundation trench for MW wall i/ib in MW trench II would support the idea. However, in our trench A, and in the w part of MW trench II,98 the EM III seems virtually pure, which makes this idea harder to accept, at least in this part of the site. Later even than the likely fill of the 1908 excavations is pit C in trench A. Finally, it is hard to avoid seeing at least the whole vessels from 1908 as coming from a floor deposit of EM IIB (of which we have no further evidence),99 rather than from a fill. Early Minoan III The first evidence for construction in EM III was found outside our trenches, in MW trenches IV and V. Soon after this came the construction of the substantial South Front House, which appears to have had (at least) two building phases, as we believe we can see in trench A. How long it lasted in use is uncertain, perhaps into MM I A. 92 Driessen 2003, 29, fig. 1.1; 33. The excavation, which would be just outside the bottom left corner of Mountjoy 2003, pi. 2a, is not mentioned in that report. EM and MM pottery from the South House and its surrounds includes an EM IIB type 2 goblet (Knappett (2003, 41-3, fig. 3.1: 1), an EM III-MM IA jug (Knappett 2003, 42,47-8, fig. 3.3: 41) and EM III fragments found on the surface in 1902 (Knappett 2003, 42, 48-9, fig. 3.3: 46-9). 93 Karetsou and Macdonald, pers. comm.

Cooking pot ware Fine Ware In all Minoan periods most of the small clay vessels, and even some quite large ones, are of fine ware. The clay of this standard fine ware is well levigated and has no marked traces of straw or grit temper; it is normally orange or buff in the break, and the surface is usually a paler colour than the core, often if not invariably due to wet smoothing (self-slip smoothing) rather than to the application of a true slip, except in cases where it is coated with a dark wash. At the beginning of EM II fine vessels with dark grey or grey-brown burnished surfaces continuing the EM I tradition are still relatively common. But from then onwards the fine ware approximates to that characteristic of the rest of the Cretan Bronze Age. Even in EM I, if the pottery from the Palace Well is a guide, the dichotomy is apparent that continued through Early and Middle Minoan between dark surfaced and light surfaced wares. The fine table ware from the Palace Well (the chalices and food vessels of EM I types 1 and 2, and the suspension pots of EM I type 14) has dark burnished surfaces with decoration in pattern burnish in reserved areas. The light surfaced wares from the Well are also sometimes decorated with pattern burnish or, especially the jugs with cutaway spouts of EM I type 1 x, with dark-on-light painted decoration in red, shades of brown, or black. During EM II red and black washed wares came to replace dark burnished wares as representatives of the dark surfaced wares. With more intensive firing to secure a harder fabric, the clay may have tended to bake a light colour, orange or buff, instead of shades of grey or grey-brown; and a wash would then become necessary to obtain a dark surface. Pattern burnish would have been an unsuitable technique for decorating the new washed surfaces, although these were often fairly well burnished. Pattern burnish was therefore almost entirely replaced from an early stage of EM II at Rnossos (marking the change from EM IIA early to EM IIA late)1 by decoration in white paint or, to a limited extent, by incised decoration. Evans did indeed hint that decoration in white, whether on washed or burnished surfaces, was already in use at Knossos in EM I;2 and, for instance, a well marked class of pottery with white painted decoration on a red washed surface occurs in the early level of Lebena T. II.3 Side by side with this use of white paint on a dark surface in early EM II, there was also a comparative rise, followed by an eventual decline, in the popularity of light surfaced wares with decoration in red, brown or black paint, continuing the tradition of EM I. The fashion for dark surfaced ware with a red, brown or black wash, and decoration in white, became increasingly strong during the course of EM II and was well established by EM III. 1 Cf.

On larger vessels like bowls the burnishing can be very superficial (scribble burnish). Where these burnished vessels had painted decoration, the paint was normally if not invariably applied after the surface had been burnished and before firing. This type of encrusted decoration, as it is called, is different from the technique employed for decorating the earliest Neolithic painted pottery of mainland Greece, where burnishing took place after the vessel had been decorated. Much later, encrusted ware is found in the Rachmani horizon assigned to the end of Neolithic or Chalcolithic in Thessaly, and in the Neolithic of the Balkans. Buff burnished ware with painted decoration, characteristically in red, but also in shades of brown and black, is much in evidence in Crete during EM II. The standard footed goblets of type 2 from deposits A2 and Bi for instance are mostly of this fabric. But even in deposit B3 EM III jugs with cutaway necks of type 15 are regularly of buff burnished ware. In all stages of EM II, if not later, some bowls, especially it would seem those with flaring rims of type 8, have orange or buff surfaces with very fine stroke burnishing but no decoration. White burnished ware This rare fabric is in effect a variety of buff ware, but the vessels have a thick white slip, which is very well burnished. Light grey ware This is another rare and distinctive fabric.6 The clay is exceedingly fine, and light silvery grey throughout, with well burnished exposed surfaces. The best known shape in this fabric is the suspension pot (type 20), which often has elaborate incised or grooved decoration. There are also large jars of comparable shape and decoration in this fabric.7 DARK-SURFACED WARES Dark grey burnished ware8 This fabric continues the tradition of the fine grey-brown burnished ware of EM I. At the beginning of EM II, to judge from deposit Ai, many smaller vessels, notably goblets and chalices of various kinds, were still being made in dark grey burnished ware.9 Fragments of this fabric occurred in A2, but not in A3-A5; and there were a few scraps in Bi and B2. The fabric tends to be rather soft and is apt to flake. The clay is sandy, but without obvious grit; either grey throughout or more commonly red-brown to orange in the break. Outside surfaces are burnished, usually so well that the stroke marks of the burnishing implement are hardly or not at all visible, and the surfaces feel smooth and soapy as if polished. Often they have a mottled appearance. The shapes for which this fabric was used would seem to be largely goblets or small bowls of various kinds, if the evidence from our deposits is reliable. In many details the shapes in this fabric from Ai are unlike those which occur in later EM II deposits. Red burnished ware This variety of fine burnished ware occurs alongside dark grey burnished ware, but is not so common.10 Like dark grey burnished ware, it is best represented in Ai, although it occurs in A2. Only scraps of red burnished ware were found in Bi and B2, but there is more of it than of dark grey burnished ware. The fabric of red burnished ware seems more diverse than that of dark grey burnished ware, and the range of shapes and sizes less restricted. The clay is normally orange, and tends to be rather soft, which distinguishes red burnished ware from varieties of red washed ware with burnished surfaces. Most if not all red burnished ware vessels have a slip or wash, in red or orange shading to light brown, well burnished. 4 See also Wilson 2007, 61, 65-9. 5 For discussion of the terms 'slip' and 'wash', see above p. 26. 6 See pp. 30, 247-52. See also Wilson 2007, 61, 69; Wilson and Day 1994, 4-22, calling it 'fine grey ware'. 7 E.g.

Wilson 2007, 61.</page><page sequence="109">THE EARLY MINOAN II POTTERY 97 On some larger vessels in this fabric the burnishing tends to be superficial or partial (scribble burnish) with the stroke marks isolated and clearly visible; but some pieces have exceptionally fine red burnished surfaces, and are the equivalents of the finest dark grey burnished ware. The fragments of this distinctive fine red burnished ware come from various shapes, open and closed, but all evidently of small size. The burnishing on them is even and thorough, so that surfaces appear as if polished; but the stroke marks of the burnishing implement can be detected. Branigan's 'Salame' ware may be a southern equivalent of our red burnished ware: at Ayia Kyriaki fragments of this accounted for 1.4% of the pottery, as against dark burnished ware with pattern burnish (Branigan's 'Pyrgos' ware), or without it, which accounted for 2°/o.n Light brown burnished ware The surfaces of some vessels in red burnished ware shade in places to light brown. Other pieces, such as lid 196 (Ai), have a burnished surface that is entirely or predominantly light brown. Dark (red and black) washed wares These correspond to Wilson's red/black slipped ware.12 Several of the wares defined by Blackman and Branigan at Ayia Kyriaki appear to fall within this category, notably 'red/brown slipped ware', 'red-wash ware', 'dark-wash ware', and 'Urfinis ware'.13 Vessels with an overall dark wash were already being made in EM I, as in the Palace Well (p. 58); and there are fragments in Ai. During the course of EM II dark washes became increasingly fashionable on fine ware although, throughout this period and later, some of the finest decorated vessels remained light surfaced without a wash. The growth of dark washed ware at the expense of light surfaced buff ware can be traced most easily in the footed goblets of type 2. The fabric of dark washed ware is basically the same as that of the fine light surfaced buff ware. The clay is well levigated, orange or buff in the break. The wash may be red or black, or intermediary shades of red-brown and purple-brown, and it often shades or mottles from one colour to another on the same pot. This variation in surface colour is more noticeable in EM II than in EM III and must reflect the rather haphazard firing of the pottery. Nothing suggests that it was deliberately induced for decorative effect like the mottling on classic Vasiliki ware. But the choice as to whether the wash should appear after firing as red or black appears to have been deliberate, although the result of firing was perhaps not always what had been intended. The washed surfaces are decorated in white paint (light-on-dark) in place of the red, shades of brown, or black paint used to decorate the light surfaced wares (dark-on-light). The dark washed surfaces were sometimes smoothed or burnished after the wash had been applied: such burnishing would appear to have been more common, although not universal, at the beginning of EM II than later. In several cases the burnishing of the dark washed surface is very fine and thorough; but, even when the wash is burnished in this way, the surface of the vessel still looks different from the slipped surfaces of the grey and red burnished wares. Normally, however, surfaces with dark washes were left unburnished. The lustrous character of the wash was no doubt regarded as a substitute for burnishing as far as appearances were concerned. At the same time improved firing may have meant that burnishing was less necessary for making vessels efficient as containers of liquids. The lustrous character of the wash is already clear on some EM II vessels — and no doubt was yet more obvious at the time they were made. As firing improved, the lustrous character of the wash becomes more marked, and more resistant to wear. In EM III the wash often has a distinct metallic sheen. Vasiliki ware This distinctive fabric is in effect a variety of dark washed ware that has long been considered a hallmark of EM II. Its distribution in our excavations at Knossos agrees with this. Some fragments come from EM III levels; the highest proportion occurs in EM IIB deposits; and some scraps come from deposit Ai.14 It is entirely absent, however, from the WCH. Even at the type site of Vasiliki it seems rare in period I. Similarly at Fournou Korifi, where it abounds in period II, there are only two sherds in a period I deposit.15 11 Blackman and Branigan 1982, 29, 33, table l. 12 Wilson 2007, 58, 64-5. 13 Blackman and Branigan 1982, 35. 14 Wilson (2007, 6g, 76) agrees oil its rare occurrence in late EM IIA. 15 Warren 1972a, 21, 108.</page><page sequence="110">9» KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN Vasiliki ware was defined first by Seager.16 Betancourt, in a detailed study,17 notes that it is simply a version of the red slipped and burnished ware found alongside it in the same range of shapes in eastern Crete.18 According to his definition, the essential feature of the fabric is the mottling of the surface, which is invariably burnished. Betancourt studied the material from our excavations which we had classified as Vasiliki ware, and excluded a few pieces (228, 421, 423, 1048) from this class. A note of this has been added to each description. In standard Vasiliki ware the clay is well refined, usually a pale shade of orange in colour, and often rather dusky in the break: this no doubt reflects somewhat inadequate firing, as a result of which the fabric is apt to be soft. The exposed surfaces (inside and outside for goblets or bowls, outside only for closed shapes like jugs) have a wash which, after firing, appears orange-red or light brown mottling to shades of dark brown and black. The wash does not seem to have been lustrous, but the washed surfaces were well smoothed or stroke burnished so that they have a lustrous appearance and are soapy to feel. The marks of the burnishing tool may be, but are not always, visible. Blackman and Branigan claim that they found no evidence of actual burnishing on Vasiliki ware from Ayia Kyriaki.19 Similarly on some of our fragments from Knossos, which in other respects would appear to be assignable to this fabric, the washed surfaces do not seem to have been smoothed or burnished. 1048 is a good example of an unburnished wash from the EM III B3 deposit, and most fragments of this kind are probably from relatively late products; but two possible fragments come from Bi, which is EM IIB. None of these, however, would qualify as Vasiliki ware according to Betancourt's definition, and he has rejected 1048. Even in small scraps Vasiliki ware, with its soft fabric, pale orange clay and distinctive mottling, is usually quite easy to distinguish from standard dark washed ware. Furthermore, the majority of dark washed ware vessels at Knossos in EM II—III has painted decoration in white, while standard Vasiliki ware was rarely painted — although Seager notes a few examples with added white or dark bands,20 and Betancourt observes that some pieces, which presumably date from late in the tradition, have the same white painted decoration as is typical of EM III in eastern Crete.21 A basically red surfaced mottled ware has been noted in some parts of Crete in contexts assigned to EM I or FN. 'Class F' ware at Phaistos is of this kind: Vagnetti argues that its mottling was deliberately induced, as with Vasiliki ware,22 and that it was the forebear of the red mottled ware in the early deposit in Lebena T. II.23 Marinatos similarly suggested that a ware from the Eileithyia cave, apparendy comparable to Phaistos F ware, might have been ancestral to Vasiliki ware;24 the mottling he thought was in some cases certainly deliberate. A similar basically red mottled ware is characteristic of bowls with Kum Tepe IB internally thickened rims from the horizon of periods VII-VI at Emporio in Chios.25 This horizon overlaps with EC I, and therefore probably with EM I and FN in Crete. Finally, even the mottled surfaces of the much older EN Variegated or Rainbow ware on the Greek mainland might have been deliberate.26 The mottling of Vasiliki ware was clearly decorative and deliberate. Various suggestions have been made as to how it was achieved. Betancourt is probably right in concluding that more than one method was employed, and there was a family of techniques, some highly deliberate, others more or less accidental.27 A tradition of mottled surfaces could have persisted in parts of Crete from the end of Neolithic into EM II, which might be one factor in the development of Vasiliki ware. But the shapes of the Vasiliki ware vessels and some of the features that seem peculiar to them suggest that they may have been made, in the first instance at any rate, as deliberate imitations of metal vessels. Evans, Pendlebury and Branigan have stressed the metallic antecedents of the ware.28 At Knossos features that seem confined to Vasiliki ware include 'rivets' on the tops of rims of bowls or goblets (e.g. 288), bead rims on jars (e.g. 289), and ring bases, e.g. 823. These features could be interpreted as metallic, and suit the idea that Vasiliki ware may have been developed in an attempt to reproduce the look of copper vessels. Many Vasiliki ware vessels come from Vasiliki itself, and over 100 from Fournou Korifi, while sherds of this ware abound on the surface of early settlement sites in the region.

The other 11 sites, which are scattered through the rest of the island, have an average of only just over four pieces each. The distribution suggests that Vasiliki ware developed originally, and continued to flourish, in eastern Crete, especially in the region of the isthmus of Ierapetra as far at least as Priniatikos Pyrgos west of Vasiliki.30 It was almost certainly made, however, at more than one centre in this area: one of these was probably Malia, on about the western limits of this area,31 and Betancourt has suggested others in the region of Fournou Korifi and Gournia (Sphoungaras).32 It was widely exported to other parts of Crete and much imitated locally. In the Mesara, for instance, it is found in the circular tombs;33 Betancourt suggests that there may have been a workshop near Lebena, and another/others in the Mesara itself.34 In western Crete Vasiliki ware is said to be very common in the Platyvola cave and at Chania-Kastelli, and the existence of a local workshop for it has been inferred; but only one piece from each of these sites is included in Betancourt's lists.35 In the Lera cave it was thought to have been imported from the east of the island.36 At Trapeza Pendlebury, and Blackman and Branigan at Ayia Kyriaki, felt able to distinguish between imported Vasiliki ware and imitations.37 Banti evidently regarded it as locally made at Ayia Triada, and Pendlebury agreed.38 Some (or, if Betancourt is right, most) of what has been grouped as Vasiliki ware from our excavations may have been made in the Knossos region. After a study of this material Betancourt formed the impression that it was all of local manufacture with a few exceptions such as 420 imported from eastern Crete.39 He has suggested that there was at least one workshop in the Knossos region making mottled pottery with several distinctive local features, such as small rivet-like pellets on or near the rims (e.g. 288), which set off the local cups and bowls from those found elsewhere.40 Such pellets do occur on rims in other fabrics than Vasiliki ware in our EM IIB deposits, e.g. 279, 787, 865 (but none in Ai or the WCH). On the other hand, pellets or excrescences of one kind or another are found in various fabrics including Vasiliki ware at Fournou Korifi II.41 Coarse Ware Coarse ware is essentially the same as the fine ware used for the great mass of the smaller vessels, but with lumps of grit added to the clay to temper it. Large bowls of type 10 were normally made of coarse ware, as were some jars of type 17 and some pithoi. Coarse ware vessels are usually light surfaced, but sometimes have a dark wash.42 Cooking Pot Ware This is really a specialised variety of coarse ware, and was already on the way to becoming differentiated from ordinary coarse ware back in EM I, where pieces of embryo cooking pot ware come from the Palace Well. By the start of EM II a distinctive cooking pot ware had emerged,43 which continued in use during all subsequent Minoan periods and into the Iron Age. In Middle and Late Minoan times this fabric tends to a very large extent, if not exclusively, to be used for cooking vessels with or without tripod legs. In EM II, however, it was also used extensively 29 Betancourt 1979, 32-51. In the Kavousi area it is rather rarer: Haggis 2005, 49. 30 See now Day et al. 2005, esp. 178-83. 31 Pelon and Schmitt 2003. Cf. Van Effenterre and Van Effenterre 1969, 9; Betancourt 1979, 28. 32 Betancourt 1979, 27-8. 33 These include eight from Ayia Triada listed by Betancourt (1979, 38-40, 42), a teapot and two cups from Porti (Xanthoudides 1924, 60-1, pis. 6, 35: 5067, 36b: 5100, 5668), and a goblet and spouted bowl from Platanos (Xanthoudides i924&gt; 95» P1- 1: 6892'&gt; 96» pl- 5la; 6894). Betancourt (1979, 34, 40, 42, 46-7, 49) also lists nine vessels from Lebena, which Alexiou and Warren (2004, 13-14, 18, 21, 123, 171-3) see as mostly locally made.

Certain shapes current in EM II are almost always made in cooking pot ware, including tripod cooking vessels of type 23, large open plates or dishes and baking plates of types 12-14, the distinctive large open bowls of type 11, deep bowls and jars of type 18, and the EM IIA horned stands of type 24. The fabric is generally coarse. The clay is gritty (although the grit may be quite fine) and normally reddish, or shades of light and dark brown. With thicker walled vessels the clay is not always fired an even colour throughout, but may appear dusky in the break. Surfaces may have a slip or wash, red or a shade of brown, and are quite often well smoothed or burnished. At the beginning of EM II the surfaces, especially of the large bowls and bowl-jars of types 11 and 18, are still as a rule more or less boldly wiped or scored with a bunch of twigs, as in EM I; but this wiping seems virtually confined to cooking pot ware vessels, and the practice was evidently on the wane. Fragments with a wiped surface occur in Ai, and are not uncommon in A2 and Bi but rare or non-existent in the latest EM II deposits, with the virtual disappearance of the bowls and jars of types 11 and 18 (which characteristically had wiped surfaces). Some cooking pot ware vessels, especially large spouted jars of type 17, had painted decoration in white. Subsequently, white decoration is found on cooking pot ware until LM IB and into LM III. But after the end of EM II jars of type 17 were normally made of ordinary coarse ware; and it is largely for this reason it would seem that the use of white paint to decorate cooking pot ware is more prominent in EM II than in succeeding periods.

CUPS WITH LARGE LOOP HANDLE Large handles in general appear to be an early feature in Minoan pottery.44 The Kyparissi pottery illustrates this well: many vessels there of various shapes, including jugs and bowls, are distinguished by the size of their handles. Cups of type 1A with flat bases are evidently descended from the large handled cups with rounded bases whose existence was inferred in the Palace Well material (see p. 36); and some round-based cups come from Pyrgos.45 Cups of type 1A with large handles have long been regarded as characteristic of EM II, but they do not in fact appear to have been common. Only four are reported from the WCH,46 to which we can add from Knossos: 1186 in light grey ware from a 1928 test pit w of the North Lustral Area (E.I.9 622); an EM IIA dark-on-light cup with a round bottom from Warren's excavations in RRS;47 and 1301, shown by Evans with EM IIB pottery that he found in the Early Houses48 — but it may be earlier than the other vessels in the photograph (see pp. 267-8).49 One of coarse plain ware comes from Ayia Kyriaki,50 and two small cups from Koumasa approximate perhaps to this type rather than to type IB.51 A large-handled cup in Vasiliki ware from Vasiliki IIP2 should be EM IIB. A cup of similar shape with a large handle rising above the rim from Sphoungaras is assigned to EM II.53 Some cups from Fournou Korifi II approximate to this type,54 but others have smaller handles akin to type 1B. Type 1A, Pendlebury's 'cup with high swung handle', is well represented at Trapeza;55 but most cups there have smaller handles like type 1B. A small cup from Drakones with a relatively large handle like type 1A was assigned to MM I.56 At Vasiliki cups of type 1A were called dipper cups. The large handle would have kept the hand dry when ladling,57 as would have been case too with LM/LH III dippers (FS 236) (where the handle is at a much steeper angle). TYPE IB. CUPS WITH VERTICAL HANDLE This type merges into type 1A. It seems rare at Knossos in EM II (and is not shown in fig. 5.1), but is well represented in eastern Crete. Seager noted that this shape first appeared in early EM II and continued into EM III.58 Such cups were common in Fournou Korifi II.59 Many were found at Trapeza, and several at Ayia Kyriaki, some of which may be later than EM II.60 None was noted in the EM II deposits in our Area A. Three rims, however, with strap handles assignable to cups of this type come from B2 (pp. 201-2: 913), but they are of Vasiliki ware and may be imports from eastern Crete or local Knossian versions of the ware. TYPES 2 AND 3. FOOTED GOBLETS AND GOBLETS The rim fragments of these are indistinguishable, and they are considered together under type 2 below. Simple goblets of type 3 seem curiously rare during Early Minoan II. None appears in Ai, and none either in the WCH. Our EM IIB deposits produced possible fragments of about eight simple goblet bases (over 1/2 of them from B2), as against over 90 of the distinctive eggcup bases of footed goblets of type 3. EM III is a sharp contrast: in B3 the bases of simple type 3 goblets actually outnumber the fragments of eggcup feet from type 2 goblets. TYPE 2. FOOTED GOBLETS Ht c. 7-10. Rims attributable to this type or type 3 appear to range in diameter from c. 5 to 12. They are usually more or less pointed, but some flattened rims occur. In one or two cases the goblet was 44 Cf.

The foot tends to be higher, and the goblet larger and broader (with the diameter of the rim wider in relation to the height) than for the equivalent goblets of EM III and MM IA. Over time the diameter of the rim seems to suffer a gradual diminution from an average of c. 10 in Ax to c. 7.5-9 in A3 and 6-9 in A4. Meanwhile, the feet decrease in size and height until they approach the low type of eggcup foot that is standard in EM III-MMIA. Feet in Ai appear to be distinctly larger than ones in later levels: both higher and wider, with an average diameter of c. 7. But large eggcup feet still occur in A3 where, out of 24 examples, three have a diameter of just over 6. However, 21 feet from A3 and all seven from A2 seem to range between c. 4 and 5.2 in diameter. Some eggcup feet from A2 are high and solid, reminiscent of the solid pedestals assigned to EM I or IIA (cf. pp. 33, 253-4); but others are already quite low like many in EM III and MM IA. Pendlebury suggested that footed goblets of our type 2 (his eggcups or pedestalled cups) might be descended from the chalices of EM I.61 But in Fournou Korifi I and the WCH early varieties of footed goblets of our type 2 appear alongside what are clearly chalices of EM I descent. These later versions have tall stems, and bowls which often tend to a conical shape; they are different from the early footed goblets found with them, and there seem to be no real intermediary forms linking them to the footed goblets of our type 2. What may be two of the earliest examples of Minoan footed (or stemmed) goblets, of dark burnished ware from Pyrgos, have exceptionally low feet like those standard on such goblets in EM IIB.62 An important feature which distinguishes the goblets of type 2 from the chalices of EM I is their relatively small size. Other contemporary descendants of EM I chalices are also small.63 In general the goblet appears to represent not only a new but a distinctly smaller type of drinking vessel. Perhaps this innovation marks the introduction of a stronger kind of drink to be consumed in smaller and/or individual vessels, namely wine. Although wine is now reported from EM I Aphrodite's Kephali, from gas chromotography analysis of residues in pithoi,64 and Vagnetti has suggested that the introduction of wine drinking should be referred back to the time of FN at Phaistos on the grounds that pouring vessels with narrow necks already existed then65 (narrow-necked and easily sealed vessels were required to keep wine from turning into vinegar), it may be that wine production and consumption did not begin to be frequent until EM II, leading to the appearance of cups of convenient shapes and sizes for imbibing it.66 If EM II was the time that it became widespread — and the earliest substantive evidence for wine being made from grapes in Crete dates to EM II at Fournou Korifi,67 where there is also the possibility that it was retsinated68 — the footed goblets of our type 2 may have been copied from a similar type of goblet at home in the area from which the knowledge of making wine was derived. The possibility of a metal prototype for the shape is not to be excluded: two silver goblets of this type from a rich grave on Amorgos are assignable to EC II.69 Some footed vessels of the goblet shape appear to have had spouts and handles (e.g. 1181) — but these may nevertheless have been used for drinking, like the spouted cups found later in Crete, notably in MM IB and IIA. The spouted and footed sauceboats of EH II were evidently the standard type of drinking vessel of the time in mainland Greece and on some of the islands.70 Fabric and decoration From the earlier levels, notably in Ai, come a few goblet rims of dark grey burnished ware. But most of the footed goblets of type 2 are of fine buff burnished ware with decoration in dark-on-light, or of dark washed ware with decoration in light-on-dark. It is interesting to see the way in which, in the sequence of deposits in Area A, light surfaced goblets are gradually replaced by those with a dark wash: light surfaced goblet rims outnumber dark wash rims by 2:1 in A2, but are in a minority of 1:5 61 H. W. Pendlebury et al. 1936, 59, 85. Cf. PMI, 58; Hood 1971a, 38. Likewise, Wilson (1985, 297-9, 357) pointed to chalices like those at Pyrgos as their more immediate ancestors. See also Wilson 2007, 58, 65, for the contrast between the stemmed goblets of EM IIA early and the footed goblets (eggcups) starting in EM IIA late. 62 Xanthoudides 1918a, 157, fig. 12, 159: 89-90. 63 E.g. from Sphoungaras: Hall 1912, 47, fig. 21D (Betancourt 1979, 26, fig. 8D; 45: 'a conical cup on a very tall pedestal'), of Vasiliki ware, only c. 6-7 high to judge from the scale; cf.

Areas A and B. Decoration on EM II goblet feet of type 2: 1-3, dark-on-light; 4-5, light-on-dark. in A3, and virtually absent from A4. In Bi, light surfaced rims are already in a minority of 2:3, dropping to 1:3 in B2. Light surfaced goblets are normally of fine buff ware. The outsides have vertical stroke burnishing, which to some extent seems meant to be decorative. The insides are usually less well burnished, and may be merely smoothed. Decoration, when it occurs, is typically in red paint, but sometimes in red brown, or shades of brown, or even black. Sometimes, the outside is smoothed rather than burnished. Often it is pared, as is common on MM IA goblets. The rims with this less careful outside finish tend to be those which are undecorated. When there is a dark wash, it may cover all the cup, including the foot, and also continue under the base; or the wash may cover all the outside of the goblet, but only extend round the top of the rim inside. Sometimes the underneath of the base is left plain. The wash may range from red or black through shades of purple-brown and dark and light brown. Any decoration is in creamy (yellowish) white paint. Some fragments of goblets of Vasiliki ware appear atypical in various ways. Their rim sections tend to be thicker than those of goblets of other fabrics. Small rivet-like warts sometimes occur on or below their rims and may be an indication, as they are not found elsewhere on the island, of local, Knossian manufacture (see p. 99 and n. 40). But even so, the Vasiliki ware of Knossos appears rather set apart from other contemporary fabrics at the site. Goblets normally seem to have had painted decoration, whether in dark-on-light or light-on-dark (figs. 5.2-5.3, tables 5.1-5.2). Some light surfaced goblets may have been plain, and those of Vasiliki ware were always, it seems, undecorated. In general, the motifs and systems of decoration which are found in dark-on-light are repeated in light-on-dark, although there is perhaps a tendency for the designs in light-on-dark to be more varied and elaborate. There is a greater variety in decoration, with a wider range of motifs, on EM II goblets than on those of EM III, when a degree of standardisation seems to have set in. Designs include horizontal stripes and bands on or below the rim, diagonal and sometimes vertical stripes on the body, rows of loops depending from the rim, and chevrons. 426 (A3) seems to have been decorated with stylised rosettes in white paint identical with those found in MM IA. It comes from a late EM II deposit, like the unique fragment 924 (B2) with a zone of incised jabs. The feet (fig. 5.4, table 5.3) of light surfaced goblets of type 2 are often painted solid: e.g. 1309 1315 from Evans's excavations in Area B; or they have a band round the neck of the foot, which may be combined with a thin stripe round its edge, e.g. 294 (fig. 7.6). There is a curious series of marks painted on the underneath of some bases of goblets of types 2 and 3 (fig. 5.5, table 5.4). These marks occur both in dark-on-light and light-on-dark.71 The marks (see also below p. 275) include: a circle round the edge of the underside of the base; short lines or dashes, single or in groups, often forming a triangle; and solid spots in various arrangements. Their purpose is not clear. Their occurrence is sporadic, and their repertory too limited, to suit the idea that they are owner's marks. Perhaps they were potter's marks, as a mark akin to fig. 5.5: 1-2 (and fig. 10.12: 1301) on the base of an EH II sauceboat from Tiryns is likely to be.72 Footed goblets appear to have been in use throughout Crete in EM II,73 and are one of the commonest types in Vasiliki ware.74 They are attested in Fournou Korifi I, and well represented in II.75 No footed 71 A light-on-dark mark is found also under the base of a type 1 cup, from Evans's excavations in Area B: 1301 (fig. 10.12). 72 Weisshaar 1983, 337, fig. 6: 15; 342. Note also an isolated example of an incised mark on an amphora of Fournou Korifi II (Warren 1972a, 110, fig. 36: P88; Branigan 1969, 12-13, fig. 3a). It is not stated whether the mark was made before or after firing; there is nothing to suggest the jar was an import from overseas. A jug from Mochlos with a somewhat comparable sign is of MM I shape, according to Seager (1912, 39: III m). '* Warren 19720, 127, n. 2 for references.

GOBLETS Rims of this type are indistinguishable from those of footed goblets of type 2, and rims assignable to types 2 and 3 have already been considered. 425 (A3), the sole profile of type 3, is 5.8 high with the rim 7 in diameter. This simple type of goblet appears to have been distinctly rare in EM II, but is common in EM III and MM IA. As with the footed goblets of type 2, the diameter of the rim seems to be greater in relation to the height than is usual in later periods, when such goblets tend to be taller and thinner with a narrow base. Some of the smaller deep bowls of Fournou Korifi II might pass for type 3 goblets,78 as might a deep conical bowl in Vasiliki ware from the cemetery area at Sphoungaras.79 76 Blackman and Branigan ig82, 3g, fig. 14: C2. 77 Tsountas 1899, pi. 8: 13; Zervos 1957, 152, pi. 189 right. 78 E.g.

SHALLOW BOWLS OR PLATES WITH RIM THICKENED INTERNALLY This type with decoration in dark-on-light is extremely common at Knossos throughout mature EM II,80 but seems to have gone out of fashion by EM III. It is therefore a most valuable dating fossil for EM II at Knossos, and more especially for EM IIB. However, the internally thickened rim of this kind first appears on dark grey burnished chalices and other shapes in grey or light brown burnished ware of EM I.81 The EM II bowls with this distinctive rim seem almost invariably of buff ware with red, or more rarely brown or black, decoration.82 Rims (table 5.5) These are of two classes, with the top either (a) rounded, or (b) bevelled. The rims of class b always have a sharp outer edge; those of class a may have the outer edge sharp or rounded, and sometimes they are thickened externally as well as internally. Rims of class a are by far the more common, outnumbering class b by 5:1. A few class a rims have a slight outwards projection (e.g. 317), which in the case of 205-206 (Ai) is formed by a groove round the outside. Size The bowls of this type are in general small, from c. 11 to 25 in diameter. Some rims, however, of class b appear to come from larger bowls with a diameter of up to c. 30. One or two bowls were evidently very small, virtually miniatures, with diameters as little as 6.5 and 8.5, but most rims of class a, which form the great majority, seem to fall between 16 and 18. Fourteen rims of class a from Bi, which were measured as a sample, range in diameter from 12 to 24, with an average of 17.8. 80 Beginning in EM IIA late (Wilson 2007, 65). 81 E.g. Wilson and Day 2000, 28-9, fig. 1: P3; 31-32, fig. 2: P43. For a light grey ware example see 1196.</page><page sequence="121">THE EARLY MINOAN II POTTERY 109 There is no evidence for handles or spouts on these bowls; but a very few appear to have had a pair or pairs of string-holes made below their rims before firing, perhaps for handles of string to hang them from pegs on the wall. Fabric It seems that bowls of type 4 were apt to be rather irregularly made. They are of fine buff ware: the clay orange or buff, very occasionally greenish, with the surface usually a paler shade. The inside surfaces may be smoothed, but are more commonly burnished; the burnishing is often quite thorough, but at times very superficial. The outsides of these bowls would have been virtually hidden from sight when they were in use, and are therefore as a rule subjected to a less careful finish than the insides: they are superficially stroke burnished, or often merely wiped or even pared, e.g. 323 (A2). Out of some 270 bowls or fragments of bowls of this type only about three rims, all of class a, appear to have belonged to bowls with a dark wash. One of these rims is from Ai, the others from A2 (234) and B2 (946, decorated with hatching along the top in creamy white paint). Decoration The standard light surfaced bowls are almost invariably decorated. Only one scrap of rim of class a from A3 may come from a plain bowl. The decoration is most characteristically in red paint, less commonly in dark brown or black. There is normally a band round the inside of the bowl just below the rim, whether it is of class a or b. Sometimes, another band, or a thin stripe, is found below the rim round the outside of the bowl as well. But the standard decoration for the top of the rim is different between classes a and b. On class a rims, the top is usually left plain except for one or more pairs of confronting diagonal bands, normally broad and closely spaced (e.g. 322), but sometimes (doubtless when only one pair of bands is involved) widely spaced, as on 323, where the confronting diagonals are at opposite sides of the rim. Each pair normally consists of single diagonals; but double diagonals are also found, as on 945. The tops of rims of class a are occasionally painted solid, like those of rims of class b. A large example 834 (Bi) of class a with the top of the rim painted solid in this way has traces of a band painted right across the inside of the bowl. The top, that is the outside bevelled edge, of rims of class b is normally painted solid: the paint sometimes lapping over the edge of the rim to form a thin stripe below it. Occasionally the top of the rim is hatched; and once at least (840, Bi) it appears to have been left plain. Bowls with rims of this distinctive type appear largely confined to later EM II at Knossos, and only two fragments were recognised in the WCH.83 Although this type of bowl is well represented at Knossos in EM IIB, it does not seem to have been common elsewhere in Crete. A bowl of this type (or the allied type 5) with at least one pair of string-holes below the rim is illustrated from Tylissos,84 but these bowls do not appear at home at Phaistos or in the Mesara tombs. A rim of this type, in profile closely akin to 278 (A2), was found at Kaminospilio;85 but no such rims are illustrated from Ayia Kyriaki, and none seems to be recorded from any of the Mesara tombs or other sites in the area. In eastern Crete the dearth of rims of this type is equally apparent. None seems recorded from Trapeza, and none is illustrated among the EM pottery from Vasiliki in Philadelphia, with the exception of one markedly inturned rim of type 5.86 Fournou Korifi, however, presents a striking contrast. Bowls with this type of rim occur there in periods I and II;87 some have holes through the rim or perforated lugs.88 The bowls of this kind in I seem closer to the standard Knossian type than those of II — which might support a suggestion that this settlement was originally founded by a family of immigrants from central Crete, if not from the Knossos region.89 TYPE 5. BOWLS WITH UPRIGHT SIDES AND RIM THICKENED INTERNALLY Three profiles of such bowls were found together with rims that may belong to bowls of this type or to the deeper variety (type 6). It would seem that the sides of bowls of types 5 and 6 may curve inwards, or rise more or less straight to the rim, or splay slightly outwards. The rims grouped here are of two classes: (a) rounded, and (b) flat-topped, which correspond to the two classes of rim on shallow bowls 83 Wilson 1985, 329-30, fig. 27: P247; also P248. 84 Hazzidakis 1934, 82, pi. 20.3c. 85 Blackman and Branigan 1973, 201, pi. 4: 6. 86 Betancourt 1983, 55, fig. 14, pi. 13: 138, with decoration in dark-on-light, assigned to EM IIA. 87 Warren 1972a, 100, 155, fig. 39: P23-28 (I); 115, 166, fig. 50: Pi 81-182, pi. 40a: Pi 83; 117, pi. 41c: P217. 88 Warren 1972a, 100, 155, fig. 39: P26, P28. 89 Warren 1972a, 272.</page><page sequence="122">1 io KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN of type 4. One or two of these rims are thickened on the outside as well as inside, and therefore approximate to the rims of large bowls of cooking pot ware of type 11, which are themselves descended from the large bowls with hammer-headed rims of EM I type 7. The bowls of type 5 seem in general larger than those of type 4, although some of the rims grouped here are of comparatively small diameter. The diameters of the three complete profiles of type 5 are c. 14, 24, and 36. The diameters of upright rims assignable to bowls of this or of the following type 6 seem to range from as little as 10 to as much as 40. Several of these rims have horizontal side-handles like 1327 of type 6. Some or all of the shallow bowls of type 5 may then have had such handles, and some perhaps had spouts like bowls of type 6. In one case a handle rises from the top of a rim. Rims assignable to types 5 or 6 are very much less common than rims of shallow bowls of type 4, by about 1 :y. Nearly 1/2 the upright rims assigned to types 5 and 6 come from A2. The great majority of these rims belong to bowls with a light surface, which is often well burnished, and normally decorated in red or brown to black. By contrast, four out of five of the rims of this kind from B2 have a black or red wash with traces of decoration in white. Decoration includes bands or stripes below the rim inside and outside. The top of the rim may be hatched with groups of straight or diagonal lines, or may have a series of opposed diagonals forming a zigzag, as on many rims of class a from bowls of type 4. Bodies are sometimes decorated with diagonal bands or stripes, single or in pairs. At least one bowl of type 5 (1326) has a red cross under the base; and the bases of other bowls of this type may have been decorated in this manner. An EM IIA bowl of dark grey ware with a pair of perforated lugs from the WCH approximates to this type.90 TYPE 6. DEEP BOWLS WITH TROUGH SPOUT AND HORIZONTAL SIDE-HANDLES The rims may be: (a) thickened internally, as 1327; (b) bevelled, as 1329; or (c) tapered. The only complete profile of a bowl of this type is 1327 from Evans's excavations in Area B. The larger bowl 1329 from there may have had a similar spout and so is discussed now. Some of the upright rims of fairly small diameter considered under type 5 may belong to deep bowls akin to 1329. Rim 337 (A2) is perhaps best placed with this type, despite its unusual fabric. Some rather atypical rims assigned to type 6 are of distinctive fabric, with a dark wash outside, and very finely burnished inside and outside. A few rims of cooking pot ware grouped here may come from tripod cooking pots (type 23). Bowls with spouts of various types and various handle arrangements are well represented in Fournou Korifi II. TYPE 7. SHALLOW BOWLS WITH STRAIGHT OR INWARD CURVING SIDES A few rims of all sizes ranging in diameter from c. 10 to 50 seem to come from bowls of this shape. The rims occur in a variety of fabrics including cooking pot ware, for instance 454 (A3).91 TYPE 8. BOWLS WITH FLARING RIM: (a) SHALLOW, AND (b) DEEP These do not seem common. Shallow bowls (A) of this type evidently range in size from very small (D. 10 or less), such as 212 (Ai), to large (D. 35 or more), such as 1330 (D. c. 34). The rims assignable to this type merge into those of type 9, and some of them may have been counted with those of that type. The deep form (B) is represented by 344 (A2) with a red cross underneath the base. One or two rims, thickened internally and therefore assigned to type 4, may belong to bowls in shape more akin to deep or shallow varieties of type 8, such as 3x9 (A2). Normally, at least the bowls of this type appear to be of fine buff ware. One or two large examples are evidently quite plain, with an unusually high and distinctive burnish, such as 520C (A4). When decoration occurs, it is sometimes elaborate in character (e.g. 212, Ax; 1330). The outside surfaces of these bowls may be scraped, as is often the case with bowls of types 4 and 9. Rims assignable to this type also occur in cooking pot ware, such as 214 (Ai).92 90 Wilson 1985, 296-7, fig. 8, pi. 30: Pi. Blackman and Branigan 1982, 30, fig. 10: 75, in 'ash-tray' ware, might also correspond to it. 91 Cf. Fournou Korifi II (e.g. Warren 1972a, 115, 165, fig. 49: P165), and Ayia Kyriaki (Blackman and Branigan 1982, 39, fig. 14: Bi, Bio, in various fabrics including Vasiliki ware). 92 This type corresponds to Blackman and Branigan 1982, 39, fig. 14: B4. A number of bowls from Fournou Korifi approximate to the shallow variety of the type (8A): Warren 1972 a, 115, 165, fig. 49: Pi64, 166, fig. 50: Pi69 (period II); 100: P20-21 (period I); cf. Lebena T. I: Alexiou and Warren 2004, 28: 14, and Marathokefalo: Xanthoudides 1918A, 19, fig. 4, bottom row, centre — but these may be later in date). For the deeper variety (type 8B), cf. Warren 1972a, 101, 156, fig. 40: P31 (period I); 118, 169, fig. 53: P231 (period II).</page><page sequence="123">THE EARLY MINOAN II POTTERY 111 TYPE g. BOWLS WITH EVERTED RIM: (a) SHALLOW, AND (b) STEEP-SIDED This is evidently the standard shape for large bowls of fine ware, in the same way that type 4 is the standard shape for small shallow bowls. Some 1x7 rims of fine ware are assignable to this type, which represents a proportion of about 2:5 to the rims of the normally smaller bowls of type 4. The rims of bowls of types 8 and 9 merge into each other; but the bowls of type 9 appear to have been for the most part steeper walled and deeper than those of type 8. Some at any rate of the steep-sided versions of type 9 have horizontal handles, such as 1331. The fine ware rims assignable to this type seem to range in diameter from c. 20 to 40 or more, with most of them between c. 25 and 30.93 Most bowls of type 9 appear to have a dark wash with decoration in white. This is in sharp contrast to the shallow bowls of type 4 which are characteristically of fine buff ware with decoration in dark on-light. The proportion of rims assignable to bowls of type 9 with light-on-dark as opposed to dark on-light decoration rises from about 2:1 in A2 to all rims bar one in A3, and all rims in A4. Similarly, rims of type 9 with a wash are about equal in number to those with a light surface in B1, but outnumber them by over 3:1 in B2. TYPE IO. LARGE BOWLS WITH STRAIGHT SIDES AND THICK EVERTED RIM: (a) SHALLOW, AND (b) DEEP This seems to be the standard shape for large bowls in coarse ware. A group of distinctive rims, over 20 in all, is assignable to this type of bowl, which may have been in general deep and bucket-like as 975; but some large shallow bowls also have rims of this kind. Bowl 976 (B2) of type 10 evidently had an open, perhaps short, trough-like spout. Some of these bowls may have had horizontal side handles, although no evidence for them was found. The fabric of these bowls is usually coarse, the clay gritty with a lighter slip decorated in dark paint. In a few cases the inside only of the bowl appears to have had a dark wash, such as 358 (A2) and 862 (Bi). Decoration normally consists of bands round the inside and outside of the rim, and round the base; and diagonal bands or stripes on the outside of the body. There is a pair of diagonal stripes on 976, while 975 has bold loops dependent from a band round the outside of the rim, and bold lattice scoring on the inside like some large bowls or jars from the Palace Well. One or two short everted rims from small steep-sided bowls are grouped here for convenience, e.g. 473. These are of fine ware, with a dark wash outside, or inside and outside, and very well burnished. In fabric and finish they resemble some upright rims discussed under type 6. TYPE 11. LARGE BOWLS WITH CURVING, OFTEN CARINATED SIDES AND THICKENED RIM (cooking pot ware) The rims assignable to bowls of this type (fig. 5.6) appear to range in diameter from c. 25 to 40 or more. They are usually more or less flat-topped, and (a) thickened inside and outside; occasionally (b) only thickened outside; and rarely (c) only inside. Some amorphous flat-topped thickened rims of cooking pot ware may come from bowls of this type. One or two rims with (d) rounded tops also seem to be from such bowls. Some of the bowls to which these rims belong evidently had horizontal side-handles, such as 363 (A2). The bowls of this type were normally it seems of cooking pot ware. Their outside surfaces below the rim (or below the carination when there is one) are generally wiped, following the tradition of LN and EM I coarse wares (cf. the related type 18). But rim 475 (A3) assignable to this type is of ordinary fine buff ware with a light surface and decoration in dark paint. The type is well represented in the WCH.94 A distinctive class of thick rounded rims (fig. 5.6: B) that may come from deep bowls (rather than jars) seems complementary to the carinated rims of the standard type assignable to type 11 bowls (fig. 5.6: A). These thick rounded rims appear to increase in numbers during the course of EM IIB at the expense of the type 11 carinated rims. Rims as fig. 5.6: B are first attested in A2, where there are three of them as opposed to eight of the type 11 carinated rims (i.e. 1:2.6). In A3, the situation is reversed, with 37 rims of this class as against eight of the standard type 11 carinated rims (4.5:1). Similarly in Bi, the rims of this class are outnumbered by standard type 11 rims in the proportion of 1:2, while in B2 the situation is reversed (2:1) (see table 5.6). The thick rounded rims (fig. 5.6: B) in their turn appear to be replaced by a new class of thick cooking pot bowl rims (fig. 5.6: C) in EM III. 93 This type seems to correspond to Blackman and Branigan 1982, 39, fig. 14: B2, Bi 1. 94 Wilson 1985, 334-5, fig. 30: P280-286. However, Wilson (pers. comm.) sees these as comparanda for our types 17 and 18.</page><page sequence="124">KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN Table 5.6. Areas A and B.

LARGE FLAT DISHES WITH UPRIGHT SIDES (COOKING POT WARE) We found just a few rims assignable to this type, from deposits of later EM II, such as 989 (B2). Some tripod feet (see under type 23) may come from dishes of this type or plates of type 13 which merges into it. Shallow tripod cooking dishes and plates are attested in MM IA, but may have been in use before then.95 TYPE 13. PLATES (COOKING POT WARE) The only rim of this type is 990 (B2). TYPE 14. BAKING PLATES (COOKING POT WARE) A few rims of these occurred in deposits of every phase of EM II (table 5.7). The rims fall into two classes: (a) rolled, and (b) elongated.96 TYPE 15. JUGS WITH CUTAWAY SPOUT The only jugs for which there is any evidence in the EM II levels have cutaway spouts. Jugs with pinched-in or trefoil spouts of the kind found on PW type 12 do not seem to occur.97 There appears to be a considerable range in the size of these EM II jugs, and some were quite large. From Evans's 95 Cf. Blackman and Branigan 1982, 39, fig. 14: B12, in cooking pot ware; also a few dishes of comparable shape in Fournou Korifi I and perhaps later (Warren 1972a, 102, 127, 156. %• 4o: P36-38) 96 Cf.

Rims of baking plates from Fournou Korifi have very different profiles: Warren 1972a, 98, 154, fig. 30: PI (period I); 111-13, '61-3, figs. 45-7 (period II). 97 These seem rare in EM IIA but there are two from the WCH: Wilson 1985, 322, pi. 35: P193-194.</page><page sequence="125">THE EARLY MINOAN II POTTERY table 5.7.

A few jug bodies may have been carinated, but the evidence for this is ambiguous. Some jug spouts seem to have been long and elegant. Spouts and necks are not infrequently pared. Evans noted that in many cases the surfaces of cups and bowls of EM II at Knossos showed signs of having been pared with a knife,98 a technique still more emphasised in EM III and MM I. Handles are usually if not always round or very thick oval in section. Some jug handles are found set to the rim like those of the PW jugs. But it would seem that in EM II the handles of jugs were normally attached below the rim with a clear space between the rim and the top of the handle. This may not have been the case, however, at the beginning of EM IIA, to judge from the fragments of jugs with painted decoration from the WCH: most of the handles appear to be set to the rim, although a few are below it." Contrast Debla II, where most of the jugs illustrated have handles set to the neck below the rim.100 The setting of the handle on the neck in this way instead of to the rim appears to be a change of fashion which in the Northeast Aegean begins in the horizon of Troy I and becomes stronger in that of Troy II.101 Fabric Most jugs were evidently of fine buff ware with decoration in dark paint continuing the tradition of EM I. The clay is orange or pale orange, with a slip outside that may be orange or buff or whitish, and which sometimes has a slight greenish tinge. The evidence from Ai suggests that at the beginning of EM II the outsides of jugs were normally well smoothed or burnished, but even at the beginning of the period jugs may have a dark wash in red or red-brown to black, such as 239 (Ai) or 1335.102 98 PM I, 74-5. 99 E.g.

The necks of these jugs are characteristically adorned with parallel stripes or bands; or with a triple chevron combined with a thin stripe on the rim of the mouth. One jug neck has a large solid spot on it. The bodies of such jugs may be decorated with horizontal or diagonal bands and stripes, or with chevrons. Latticed triangles are a very characteristic motif of decoration on jug bodies, and evidently descend from the crossing diagonals which form a lattice pattern on EM I jugs. Handles may have a stripe or a group of two or three parallel stripes running down their length. On 238 (Ai) the stripe is flanked by diagonal lines to make a branch-like design. Broad diagonal hatching is also found on handles, such as 877 (Bi). (2) Light-on-dark Decoration in creamy white paint on a dark wash includes horizontal bands, such as 239 (Ai), and diagonal ones as seen on 994 (B2), which has a good lustrous black wash and a row of incised decoration at what was evidently the base of the neck.103 TYPE 16. SMALL SPOUTED BOWL-JARS: (a) TEAPOTS WITH VERTICAL HANDLE, AND (b) WITH HORIZONTAL SIDE-HANDLES Most of the fragments of small jars of fine ware, whether of buff ware with decoration in dark paint or of dark washed ware with decoration in white, appear to belong to pouring vessels with cutaway spouts of the teapot class c or more rarely of classes a and b (fig. 5.7). There seem to have been two main varieties of these jars: (A) teapots with a vertical handle opposite the spout; (B) jars with horizontal handles, which are ancestors of the similar jars with class c (teapot) spouts or class d bridge spouts that are common in EM III-MM IA and later — but 1288 (below) is an unique early example of a bridge spout, of EM IIA. For examples of type 16 in the SMK, see pp. 260-1, 274. Wilson and Day, in their full discussion of this type in fine painted ware (much of which appears to have been imported from the Mesara), call it 'rounded bowls (side-spouted bowls/one-handled cups)'.104 There is a wide variety in the rims of these jars (fig. 5.8). Thickened rims of class b are common; and those of class b2, which are thickened internally and often have a distinct metallic look, seem very characteristic. These rims of class b2 appear to be the equivalent on jars of the distinctive internally thickened rims found on bowls of types 4-6. Rims of class b2 are much less in evidence in the levels assigned to EM III, and appear altogether absent in the B3 deposit. The distinctive rims of class e with an internal ledge for a lid come from deep bowls and from jars of various types and sizes. Six rims of this class come from EM II levels; 245, the earliest (Ai), is somewhat atypical with the ledge not so well marked. This and two other ledged rims of this class 500-501 (A3) are in cooking pot ware. Four teapots of type 16A with spouts of class c and dark-on-light painted decoration were taken by Zois as characteristic of his 'Koumasa' style of EM IIA.105 Fragments in fine painted ware including spouts of class c from the WCH probably come from teapots of this type brought to Knossos from the Mesara;106 there is an EM II teapot of type i6A with a class c spout from Palaikastro-Patema;107 and teapots with class c spouts are typical at Fournou Korifi and may have existed there in period I.108 Some teapots of type 16A from the Trapeza cave have tubular spouts of class b; one with a class c spout was assigned by Pendlebury to EM III.109 Teapots with spouts of class c were still in use in MM I.110 A large vessel from the WCH is akin to type 16B but more bowl-like; it has a thickened rim and a spout like class b.111 103 Cf.

TYPES 17 AND 18 There are many fragments belonging to large deep bowls or jars with inward curving rims. These are almost entirely of cooking pot ware. Most of the rims are markedly thickened. Only two shapes could be distinguished, spouted jars with horizontal side-handles of type 17, and jars with vertical handles of type 18; but some of the rims may come from other types that cannot be reconstructed. Most rims of class a may be from jars of type 17, and rims of classes bi, b2, b3 and c mostly from jars of type 18. A distinctive group of large rounded and thickened rims of class bi may belong to a type of deep bowl or jar with characteristics to differentiate it from types 17 and 18. TYPE 17. LARGE SPOUTED BOWLS OR JARS WITH HORIZONTAL SIDE-HANDLES We have no complete profile of ajar of this type; but rim fragments, occasionally with horizontal side handles and simple tubular spouts of class b, evidently come from jars of this kind which are standard in EM III-MM I. The EM II jars of this shape are normally of cooking pot ware; and any decoration is therefore in white paint on a red or brown surface. But one or two rims from jars of this type are of ordinary coarse ware with a light slip and decoration in dark paint. Decoration may consist of a band</page><page sequence="128">116 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN round the outside of the rim and diagonal bands or stripes on the body of the jar. Sometimes warts are found on these rims; it may have been normal to put a wart on the part of the rim opposite the spout. TYPE 18. LARGE BOWLS OR JARS WITH INWARD CURVING, OFTEN CARINATED AND THICKENED RIMS (COOKING POT WARE) The greater part of a large example of this type 392 comes from A2. It stood 54 high, and appears to have had four vertical handles of which three survive. The profile of a smaller vessel 1339, of the same shape but more bowl-like with the diameter greater than the height, was restored from fragments in the SMK. The type only occurs in cooking pot ware. The outside surface below the carination (or below the swelling of the shoulder where a carination is absent) is characteristically wiped as in the case of the large bowls of the related type 11. Type 18 is represented in the WCH deposits.112 TYPE 19. COLLAR-NECKED JARS WITH HORIZONTAL SIDE-HANDLES This type of jar evidently goes back to EM I, and includes a fairly complete example 1294 in the SMK. Rims belonging to this type from EM II deposits occur in varieties of fine and coarse ware, and also in cooking pot ware. The type occurs in the WCH113 and Fournou Korifi I, and is very prominent in Fournou Korifi II.114 TYPE 20. SUSPENSION POTS These are few in our EM II levels, although 195 (Ai) is a largely complete small example. It is of fine red burnished ware, and in shape recalls the suspension pots of the Palace Well, but the lugs evidently had double perforations instead of the single perforations in the Well examples. At Lebena, likewise, a large group of globular or sub-globular suspension pots with double perforated lugs has been assigned to EM II.115 Rim 280 (A2) is of the same red burnished fabric as 195. A few small jar rims of fine ware may belong to suspension pots. TYPES 21 AND 22. LIDS Lid fragments were curiously rare in the EM II levels. The two we noted are from Ai, including part of a flat lid with two handles 196 (type 21) and pattern burnish that looks back to EM I. A scrap with black burnished surface may come from a lid of the cover type 22. Two scraps of possible flat lids of cooking pot ware are reported from the WCH,116 where parts of several cover lids were also found: all of these had traces of burning on the outside surface, and one fragment inside as well.117 Cover lids of this type were at one time regarded as characteristic of EM II,118 but they are well represented in the Palace Well (see pp. 49-50 for fuller discussion); and it looks as if lids of this kind were still being made and used at Knossos into MM IB, to judge from an example in fine cooking pot ware from a deposit on Gypsades.119 TYPE 23. TRIPOD COOKING POTS (COOKING POT WARE) While it was long thought that tripod cooking pots occurred for the first time in Crete in EM II, they can now be seen to appear probably a little earlier, at Ayia Fotia (Siteia) in Cycladic-style marble tempered ware — and the shape may well derive from the Cyclades.120 We need to be sure that the occurrences there are exclusively EM I: Betancourt sees the cemetery as being mainly late in EM I,121 but there seems to be a little evidence for its continuing into EM II:122 see further p. 284. At Knossos tripod cooking pots seem still relatively uncommon in EM IIA; Warren implies that none was identified 112 E.g Wilson 1985, 333-5, fig. 30, pi. 41: P273-274, P276. 11S Wilson 1985, 339-40, fig. 33: P326-327, 346, 348-349; fig- 37&gt; Pi- 5°: P395"396 114 Warren 1972a, 141-3: P563-595. 115 E.g.

Some 28 feet of cooking pot ware come from our EM II deposits (table 5.7), belonging probably to deep bowls with simple rims like those of type 6 class c, as well as dishes and plates akin to types 12 and 13. Most of these feet are round in section; a few are thick oval, and some thin oval. The sole foot from Ai is round, but one of the three from A2 is thick oval, and two of the six from A3 thinnish oval. Five of the seven feet from the WCH are round to oval, and two flattened oval (one of them with a vertical rib — cf. Fournou Korifi II125). In general, however, cooking pot feet at Fournou Korifi seem to follow a different path of development from Knossos: in periods I and II their sections are predominantly flattish oval to oval, and just a few thick oval to round.126 At Knossos in EM III and MM IA round section feet seem to be replaced by feet with oval or thin oval sections. Later at Knossos, tripod feet gradually tend to become thicker; in MM III-LM I they are as a rule thick oval, becoming round again in LM III. TYPE 24. HORNED STANDS (COOKING POT WARE) Fragments of five or six of these enigmatic objects were found, all in definite EM II contexts, except for two likely scraps in EM III contexts, one in A5 and 1135 in B3 (table 5.7). Plenty of fragments were noted in the SMK, and are discussed below (pp. 264-6). They seem restricted to EM IIA, and do not occur in EM IIB or III except as occasional strays.127 All these are of standard cooking pot fabric. TYPE 25. INCENSE BURNERS 404 (A2) appears to come from a vessel of this distinctive type.128 The only restorable early examples are from Fournou Korifi II;129 but the type may have been quite widespread in Crete during this period. Two pieces from Trapeza are comparable to 404, but were classified as globular pots.130 A small bowl-like object with holes round the rim from Krasi also appears to be of this type,131 which may be ancestral to the later vessels variously interpreted as fire boxes, incense burners or vessels for the manufacture of perfumes.132 TYPE 26. THERIOMORPHIC VESSELS Two probable feet from theriomorphic vessels are from EM II levels: 405 (A2) and 548 (A4). 405 has many parallels from other EM contexts. These vessels were popular in EM II, and appear to go back to EM I.133 TYPE 27. PITHOI Some pithos fragments come from Ai, two or three of them with trickle ornament, which remained the most characteristic type of decoration for pithoi and other large store jars through the rest of EM and MM into LM I. One piece has a false or vestigial strap handle. Trickle ornament is found elsewhere on pithoi from EM IIA onwards.134 Features spouts (fig. 5.7) Examples of spouts of classes a, b and c, were noted, but none of class d.

Tubular spouts of class b2 now occur on small jars of type 16 and commonly on large jars of type 17. Teapot spouts These distinctive spouts of class c appear to have been confined to small jars of type 16. Some of them are comparatively long and elegant, e.g. 498 (A3) and 1337. They do not seem attested in Crete before EM II. There are no spouts of this kind from the Palace Well, and none is reported from Pyrgos or Kyparissi; side-spouts on vessels from these burial caves are all of class b. Teapot spouts of class c are well represented, however, in EM IIA. There are many from the WCH, and they are found on the teapots from Ayia Kyriaki and Koumasa.135 Spouts like those of class c are found on metal vessels in Anatolia and the Near East in early times. Possibly the fashion for teapot spouts on clay vessels originated in Crete from the imitation of imported metal ones with spouts of this kind. Bridge spouts No example of a bridge spout of class d was found in our EM II deposits at Knossos; but there is one (1284) of EM IIA in the SMK. At present, it is unique among the EM I—II pottery of Knossos. Bridge spouts of class di occur in Vasiliki III,136 and there are many bowls and jars with spouts of this class, if not in some cases with true bridge spouts as class d2, in Fournou Korifi II.137 In the Neolithic, bridge spouts first appear in FN IB (Stratum IIIA) at Knossos.138 HANDLES Vertical and horizontal handles occur, and are normally round or thick oval in section; but 509 (A3) has a thick rectangular section; and one from A4 is a true strap handle with thin oval section. 1044 (B2), of sub-rectangular section and peculiar fabric, may belong to an imported vessel. Handles with perforations at both ends may be something peculiar to EM II (see pp. 116, and 134: 195). Jug 1339 has a handle with such holes, and a similar handle 256 (Ai) may also be from a jug. These holes may have been intended for string (which would have had to be thin), or made to improve the firing by letting the heat penetrate at places with unusually thick clay where the handle joins the wall of the vessel. carinations Many bowls and jars of cooking pot ware of types 11 and 18 have a sharp carination below the rim. Isolated instances of other types may have had carinated bodies but, apart from types 11 and 18, carinations seem rare.139 BASES These are in general flat, but sometimes concave, or slightly convex like bases in EM I. Pellet (lug) feet resembling those from the Palace Well (p. 57: 154) occurred in Ai, and the only other foot of this kind was from A2. Such feet on roughly flattened bases appear to have been the norm for jugs in the RRS EM IIA deposits.140 See also 1263. Ring bases occur on what may be imports of Vasiliki ware; and 262 (Ai), of fine burnished ware, may also be from an import. Fragment 261 of a small pedestal from Ai, in shape like those from the Palace Well, has an orange-buff burnished surface with red encrusted decoration. A more complete pedestal of similar size and fabric with the same type of decoration is in the SMK (B.II 405: cf. p. 242, fig. 10.1: 13). In the technique of decoration these fragments recall the FN painted ware of Phaistos. These pedestals may come from chalices, but 1045 (®2) °f rough fabric almost certainly belongs to some other shape. 135 Cf. Blackman and Branigan 1982, 31, fig. 11, assigning all the examples of such spouts from Ayia Kyriaki with dark-on-light decoration to their 'Ayios Onoufrios II' ware, which they suggest may be the equivalent of the EM IIA Koumasa style of Zois. 136 E.g.

Both modes are found on burnished surfaces as well as on smoothed or washed ones, especially at the beginning of EM II, when burnished wares are more in evidence. Dark-on-light This painted decoration is similar in character and technique to that noted in the Palace Well. The buff surface of the vessel is usually well smoothed or burnished, with the stroke marks of a burnishing instrument often clearly visible. The paint is most commonly red, but may be red-brown, or shades of light or dark brown; it is normally matt, or has only a slight lustre. Light-on-dark Decoration in white paint occurs, although it is rare, on red and black washed surfaces of vessels in the WCH,141 and on fragments from Ai. Mackenzie thought that white paint might have been used for decoration at Knossos already in EM I,142 although no certain examples of white painted decoration appear to have come from the lowest Minoan stratum of the West Court Section on which he based this view. There is no evidence for white painted decoration in the Palace Well, and no sign of it elsewhere at Knossos in EM I. Pendlebury suggested that the fashion for light-on-dark decoration was first developed in eastern Crete in EM II in connection with dark surfaced Vasiliki ware.143 Betancourt has isolated an early cycle of light-on-dark painted decoration in eastern Crete, and assigns it to a late stage of EM II.144 No white painted decoration was identified in Fournou Korifi I and very little in II,145 where it was concentrated in one house, presumably reflecting the predilections of one family.146 The evidence suggests that the fashion for decorating pottery with designs in white may have been established in southern Crete before it was at home in the north or east of the island. Several vessels in the EM I level in Lebena T. II have decoration in white paint on a red surface;147 while some examples of white painted decoration from Trapeza may date from an EM I horizon or even earlier: one came from an undisturbed deposit with Trapeza ware.148 But decoration in red paint, more rarely white, or occasionally both combined together, is found on burnished surfaces in Class C ware from the earliest FN stage of Phaistos.149 It seems possible then that the light-on-dark tradition continued in this part of Crete into the beginning of Early Minoan and spread from there. Although there is no light-on-dark decoration from the Palace Well, it is found at Knossos in EM IIA and became increasingly dominant alongside the growing fashion for dark washed fine wares during EM IIB. This suggests that, even if the fashion for light-on-dark decoration was ultimately derived from southern Crete, it may have spread to the Knossos region before reaching the east of the island from there. The white paint used for light-on-dark decoration at Knossos in EM II is characteristically thick, and creamy white in colour, and looks quite yellowish when it is wet. It is easily distinguishable from the thin chalky white of MM I—II at Knossos. Designs of painted decoration The same motifs are found in dark-on-light and in light-on-dark. As time passes, the designs tend perhaps to become more elaborate. The most elaborate ones seem to occur on dark surfaced vases, which may reflect the fact that, during the course of EM II, dark surfaces became increasingly prevalent on fine wares. Motifs are still recognisably skeuomorphic in their antecedents, as they were in EM I; but they have moved further away from their original prototypes. Thus the intersecting diagonal stripes recalling string nets on gourd-shaped jugs of PW type 12 crystallised into formal cross-hatched triangles on the bodies of the equivalent jugs of type 15 by EM IIA. Designs include horizontal and vertical stripes and bands. Diagonal lines adorn the rims of bowls, and appear on the sides of bowls and jars, where they often intersect, recalling the net-slings from 141 Wilson 1985, 313. 142 Mackenzie, in Evans 1904, 22; cf.

Chevrons adorn some goblets and small jars of fine ware of type 16. Pedestal 261 (Ai) appears to have been decorated with loops in red. Small loops in dark-on-light and light-on-dark, usually single but sometimes double or multiple, hang from EM IIB goblet rims, which were mostly found in Area B.150 We did not find this as a decorative motif in EM III. Multiple concentric loops appear in dark-on-light on the flat rim of an unique EM II bowl.151 Vertical rows of loops in dark-on-light flank a solid mass on the body of a jug from Fournou Korifi II.152 Multiple loops in white on a dark wash hang from the shoulder of a jug from Palaikastro.153 In general, however, painted loops seem rare in the EM II repertory outside Knossos. The rich assemblage from Ayia Kyriaki, for instance, has only one example of this motif: a row of simple inverted loops in dark-on-light at the base of ajar neck.134 It is true that multiple concentric loops or semicircles are a standard motif of incised decoration on Cretan light grey ware vessels. But the loops of the contemporary painted decoration may derive from a different source, some lingering version perhaps of the Ubaid tradition of the Near East, as seen for instance in Mersin XIIB. Loops are not in evidence on any of the painted pottery from our EM III deposits at Knossos, but they appear in various forms in East Cretan EM III light-on-dark. Some of these approximate to the simple versions of EM II Knossos;155 but in general they are large and arc-like, incorporated in complex designs or used as filling ornament.156 A solid spot appears in isolation on jug neck 228 (Ai). Spots are flanked by lines or stripes on 512 (A3) and 549 (A4), both in light-on-dark and from EM IIB deposits. Spots appear to have formed the terminals of a diagonal net pattern in light-on-dark on 513 (A3). The rosette in light-on-dark on goblet rim 426 (A3) is surprising, since the design is more at home in MM IA; but the rim appears to be in context and EM II in date. Other elaborate designs attested by single examples are the hatched band in dark-on-light on the shoulder of a jug or jar 411 (A2); bands of short dashes in light-on-dark on 1012 (B2); and the bisected oval chain in dark-on-light on 412 (A2). This fragment had been worn by use as a rubber; the fabric of it is exceptionally fine, and the vase may have been an import, perhaps from one of the Cyclades, where the same motif is found on EC pottery (see pp. 154-5). The motif seems ultimately derived from the repertory of the Halafian culture of northern Mesopotamia via Syria or Cilicia. Crosses were sometimes painted underneath bases, mostly it seems of bowls. These are usually simple, made with a pair of fairly wide crossing bands (e.g. plates 25: 330, 417-418; 27: 344). A few more elaborate versions, however, are attested.157 Such crosses occur in light-on-dark (p. 155) as well as dark-on-light. A fragment with part of an elaborate eight-armed cross or star in white comes from Bi (plate 39: 852). There are several examples of simple red crosses on bases in the WCH.158 This decoration suggests that the bowls were intended to be viewed, when not in use, either upside down on a flat surface or, more likely perhaps, hanging from pegs on the wall — which would explain why many EM II bowls have string-holes, some of them we may imagine with cruciform decoration underneath. At Fournou Korifi red crosses appear on six jug bases in period I, and on spouted bowl bases in II.159 A two-handled jar from Pyrgos, assignable perhaps to EM IIA, has a cross under the base.160 Red crosses also come on the insides of pedestal bowls, apparently of EM II date, from Ayia Kyriaki.161 Boldly painted red crosses like those of EM II do not seem to occur on the rounded bases of EM I vessels; but a small jug from Kyparissi, which may date from mature EM I, has its nearly flat base decorated with lines cutting across it in the form of a cross;162 and an elaborate cross formed by the 150 Such as plates 26: 307 (A2), 29: 425 (A3}, 38: 832-834 (Bi), 41: 941-944 (B2). In a magnified version single loops depend from the rim of a large bowl of type 10: 975 (B2). 151 HM 5556, of type 9 from Mochlos (Seager 1912, 25, figs. 7, 13: II.l; Zois 1967a, pis. 10, 32).

These marks are composed with one or more short strokes or spots, and are clearly deliberate. Their purpose, however, is obscure; see further pp. 105 above and 275. Trickle ornament appears on large jars including pithoi. This type of decoration remained very common on pithoi and store jars until LM. Pithos fragments with trickle come from Ai and the West Court House. PATTERN BURNISH This distinctive type of decoration scarcely occurs at all in the elaborate form in which it appears on the fine wares of EM I. The only example of true pattern burnish from our EM II deposits is lid 196 (Ai). Vertical stroke burnishing on light surfaced goblets of type 2 may have had decorative intention, but hardly qualifies as pattern burnish. INCISION Evans's excavations produced a fair amount of incised decoration assignable to EM II, but it is extremely rare in our EM II deposits. Only eight fragments with incised decoration of any kind were found. They are not confined to any particular phase of EM II. One or two of these fragments may come from imports, like the pieces of jar 419 with a red wash, which looks Cycladic. But incised decoration mostly seems to occur on vessels in cooking pot ware of local manufacture, including jug neck 484 (A3). Jug fragment 994 (B2) has a row of diagonal or herring-bone incisions around the base of the neck. This foreshadows the ribs with incised decoration commonly found round the necks of jugs of fine ware in EM III and MM IA. On 994, however, there is no rib: the incised decoration is on the flat surface of the shoulder. But a rib with incised decoration occurs on the side of ajar of cooking pot ware 390 (A2). Rim 271 (Ai) of a goblet or small bowl with a dark wash has an incised arrow-like design, and an unique fragment of a goblet 924 (B2) a diagonal zone of short jabs. Bold criss-cross scoring of the insides of large bowls or open jars as found in EM I continues, such as 390: see pp. 30, 59. RELIEF Ribs or bands The two examples of this type of decoration are: on jar 390 in cooking pot ware, combined with incisions, and 901, a scrap from a suspension pot with a dark burnished surface.165 Warts There are five examples of warts on the shoulders of large jars of cooking pot ware of type 17: 389 (A2); 537-538, 543 (A4); 1026 (B2). Warts are also found on one or two smaller, type 15 jars in fine ware: 487 (A3) and 530 (A4). Small rivet-like warts occasionally appear on the tops of rims: on a large bowl in cooking pot ware 865 (Bi), and on two goblets or small bowls of imported Vasiliki ware 286 (A2) and 820 (Bi). One such rivet occurs on the side of Vasiliki ware goblet 420 (A3). 163 Evans 1895, 113-14, fig. 106. 164 Blegen 1921, 6, fig. 5: 3. 165 The latter may come from a vessel like one at Koumasa assigned by Xanthoudides (1924, 9, pis. 1, 18: 4193) to EM I or the beginning of EM II.</page><page sequence="134">Chapter 6 The Early Minoan III pottery Two main deposits assignable to EM III were identified in our excavations: A5 in Area A, and B3 in Area B. Some notable differences in the character of these deposits may reflect a difference in date between them. A5 appears to be the earlier, and closer to EM IIB; it was above a floor (Floor IV) sandwiched between A4 (Floor V, mature EM IIB) and a later deposit of EM III (A6, Floor II) with pottery which, as far as could be judged from its relatively small amount, is more or less comparable in character to B3. The difference in the relative preponderance of type 2 footed goblets and type 3 goblets between A5 and B3 — 15:13 in A5, 70:90 in B3 — suits the view that A5 is earlier. The B3 deposit was separated from the underlying EM IIB deposits by a plaster floor (see pp. 86, go). It seems to correspond to what Evans recovered from the area and called Early Minoan III.1 Other substantial EM III deposits in various parts of the Palace site2 include the Upper East Well (UEW),3 from which a group was illustrated by Mackenzie as a sample of early pottery at Knossos.4 In his 1904 report Evans assigned the 'hoards of vases' from this well to a group labelled EM III,5 but later he put it in MM IA,6 presumably following Mackenzie's placing it in MM I.7 (See too p. 12 and n. 109). EM III at Knossos is essentially a phase of transition between EM IIB and MM IA.8 At the same time some marked changes from EM II can be detected. One notable change is the striking predominance of bowls of type 8/9, another the rise into favour of type 3 goblets at the expense of footed goblets of type 2. Many of the types characteristic of EM II (such as bowls of types 4 and 5) seem to have disappeared by EM III. The various dark burnished fabrics of EM I descent, which lingered into EM IIA late,9 have also vanished. A scrap of light grey ware and some Vasiliki ware from A5 might be EM II strays, although a survival of Vasiliki ware into a period around the beginning of EM III at Knossos seems on the face of it not impossible.10 In many respects Knossian EM III is closer in character to MM IA than to EM IIB, and the footed goblets of type 2, and many of the type 3 goblets, can be difficult to distinguish in isolation from MM IA ones. In particular, the low footed goblets of type 2, in both their shapes and their simple, rather standardised decoration, are very close to those of MM IA, and innovations like the use of barbotine decoration also align this Knossian EM III horizon more closely with MM I rather than EM II. It might indeed seem tempting to classify this as an early phase of MM IA, as we were inclined at first to do.11 Once, however, we had studied the A5 and B3 pottery in detail, there could no longer be any doubt about its being EM III, and between EM II and MM IA.12 It is therefore clearly desirable, even essential, to retain the traditional nomenclature for this horizon at Knossos. An overlap here with what is called EM III in eastern Crete is confirmed by the East Cretan EM III white-on-dark import 1124 in B3. The fashion for white painted decoration already attested in EM I in the south could have spread from there to Knossos, where a growing taste for it can be traced, our excavations show, throughout EM II into EM III: it could well have spread from the region of Knossos to the east. (See also pp. 11, 97, 119, 287). Likewise, there is a good possibility that polychrome decoration in red and white reached Knossos from the Mesara during EM III, to judge from a few unusual and probably imported pieces in 1 PM I, 108. 2 Listed by Momigliano (2007c, 81-93). 3 Hood and Taylor 1981, 21: 198. The pottery was studied first by Lee (1974) who recognised it as EM III, and has since been fully discussed by Andreou (1978) and Momigliano (1991, 155 63; 2007c, 81-93). 4 Mackenzie 1903, 167, fig. 1; 1906, 252, for the provenance. 5 Evans 1904, 20.

Wilson 2007, 64. 10 See Betancourt 1979, 21-2. 11 E.g. Hood 1962, 93. 12 Hood 1966.

In both regions EM III is also marked by the predominance of painted decoration in light-on-dark on the finer wares. The earlier white painted pottery of eastern Crete assigned to EM III may continue the simple linear designs fashionable in EM II at Knossos.16 In the absence of well stratified settlement deposits, no clear picture has yet emerged of the pottery of this horizon in the south and west of Crete.17 In the west, the careful analysis of the pottery from Lera by Guest-Papamanoli dates it to EM I and II and to MM, but places nothing in EM III.18 A vessel from Platyvola assigned to EM III by Warren and Tzedakis is of a type that Pendlebury set in MM I.19 In the Mesara Phaistos has now produced levels stratified between EM IIB and MM IA that may be contemporary with Knossian EM III,20 while a knobbed jug from the UEW is almost certainly from the Mesara.21 However, decoration in red (and more rarely in white) paint on a dark surface is attested at Phaistos from the beginning of FN; and in a very few instances red and white paint are used in combination.22 Barbotine decoration, which suddenly appears at Knossos at the beginning of EM III as in A5, may also be a fashion derived (ultimately) from the south, where a form of it (granulation) was at home in Phaistos FN.23 But intermediary examples have not so far been recognised in any part of Crete in EM I—II to suggest a survival of such a tradition. Re-invention, or the borrowing of ideas from Anatolia or the Levant, where comparable decoration is attested, are among other possible explanations for its appearance at Knossos in EM III. FABRICS The EM III categories of fabrics have been added to the sequence of those for EM II, which have been included for convenience in table 6.1, although several of them are no longer attested, or are only represented by what appear to be earlier strays. There was a simple evolution in fabric between EM II and III. But some fabrics, which reflect a continuation of EM I or LN traditions into EM II, evidently went out of use by EM III: e.g. dark grey, red, and light brown burnished wares. Fine Wares LIGHT surfaced WARES Buff ware This is still a standard fine ware, especially for larger vessels, but smaller vessels now usually have a dark wash. A burnished finish for buff or orange-buff surfaces is less in evidence than in EM II. But at 13 Momigliano 2007c, 84, 87-91, citing: two jugs from House B (Momigliano 1991, 221, 231, pi. 47: 38, 42), a bowl from the SFH (Momigliano 1991, 204, fig. 14, pi. 40: 19), and two sherds from a deposit at the Theatral Area (Batten 1995, 78-9). Pendlebury (1939, 84-5) allowed for the appearance of polychrome before EM III citing, however, a cup and ajar from Palaikastro (Bosanquet and Dawkins 1923, 8-9, fig. 5d, pi. 30) that have to be MM IA, and a teapot from Knossos (PM I, 110, fig. 78) that looks MM IB. 14 Pendlebury 1939, 94, 109 (amplifying PM I, 108).

Two type 3 goblets from House B are interesting evidence of the impact of the East Cretan EM III style on Knossian potters: one (Momigliano 1991, 222, fig. 23; 227, 230, pi. 45: 26; 2007, 82) for its wide, conical shape and decoration — it may be an import; the other (Momigliano 1991, 226, 233, fig. 27, pi. 51: 67) for its decoration on a regular Knossian type 3 goblet. 16 Cf.

White burnished ware No example of this rare EM II fabric was noted in our EM III deposits. Light grey ware This EM IIA fabric appears as one scrap in A5: it may well be an earlier stray. DARK SURFACED WARES Dark grey, red, and light brown burnished wares These wares, which are at home in EM IIA and less in evidence in EM IIB, do not appear at all in our EM III deposits. Dark (red and black) washed wares These are the standard wares for the finest decorated vessels, as is seen clearly in B3. Black is the dominant colour, but it still merges into red with intermediary shades from uncertainties in the firing. In general, however, the washes tend to be a more even black or red, and of better quality, less flaky, and more lustrous (often with a distinct metallic sheen), perhaps from improved firing methods. Vasiliki ware Three scraps come from A5. They may be earlier strays, but B3 produced two fragments also. It is possible that Vasiliki ware continued to be made in the Mirabello area for a time after the beginning of EM III.24 Coarse Wares Coarse wares are much the same as in EM II with the addition of soft sandy ware. Soft sandy ware The soft fabric and sandy clay of this ware are unmistakable. It was very prominent at Knossos in MM I—II and later. It does not occur in our EM II deposits, but we have examples in B3. 24 PM I, 108.</page><page sequence="137">1 26 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN SHAPES, FEATURES, AND DECORATION (EM II types that only appear to be represented by stray fragments in EM III deposits are marked with an asterisk) types (fig. 5.1): *iA.

The types that were actually current in EM III at Knossos are likely to be confined to those without an asterisk. Types *TYPE 1A. CUP WITH LARGE LOOP HANDLE A large handle of circular section from A5 appears to belong to a cup of this type, which may have continued in use, if becoming rare, in EM III at Knossos.25 TYPE IB. CUPS WITH VERTICAL HANDLE A base that may belong to such a cup comes from A5, and five or six fragments from B3. This suggests that the type began to be less uncommon at Knossos towards the end of EM III. TYPE 2. FOOTED GOBLETS These are described in detail under A5 and B3. EM III footed goblets clearly evolve from those of EM II and merge into those of MM IA. Those from Yiofyrakia look comparable to ours.26 TYPE 3. GOBLETS The increased popularity of goblets at the expense of footed goblets of type 2 is one of the features that distinguishes EM III from EM II at Knossos. The goblet becomes increasingly prominent during the course of the period, as is clear from comparing the relative numbers of type 2 feet and type 3 bases in A5 with those in B3. Many of the Knossian EM III goblets appear to have been relatively 25 For an example from the UEW, see Andreou 1978, 18, pi. 1: 9, and Momigliano 1991, 158, fig. 2: 21; 162: 21. 26 Marinatos 1935, 51, fig. 4: 1-8.</page><page sequence="138">THE EARLY MINOAN III POTTERY 127 squat like those of East Cretan EM III,27 but some later examples are tall and elegant, like 661 (A7) and 1055-1056 (B3). Goblets from Yiofyrakia resemble Knossian EM III ones.28 A number from the Idaian Cave, where the lower strata are said to go back to the end of EM, look very comparable with the squatter varieties of type 3 from Knossos.29 *TYPE 4. SHALLOW BOWLS OR PLATES WITH RIM THICKENED INTERNALLY This very common EM II type is represented by 18 rims, of which six are of the rounded class a, and 12 of the bevelled class b. This reverses the situation in the EM II deposits where class a rims outnumber those of class b by 5:1. A5 produced eight rims (three of class a and five of class b), while only one class a rim comes from B3. This might suggest that bowls of this type, or at any rate ones with class b rims, continued in use into early EM III at Knossos. Andreou notes that 'no bowls with thickened inside rims, so characteristic of the EM II deposits at Knossos', occur in the UEW.30 *TYPE 5. BOWLS WITH UPRIGHT SIDES AND RIM THICKENED INTERNALLY This EM II type is represented by one rim from A5. TYPE 6. DEEP BOWLS WITH UPRIGHT SIDES Bowls of this general type appear to have existed, but only three rims from A5 could be assigned to it. TYPE 7. SHALLOW BOWLS WITH STRAIGHT OR INWARD CURVING SIDES This type is relatively well attested, especially in B3. It merges into the common and characteristic type 8/9. TYPE 8/9. BOWLS WITH FLARING OR EVERTED RIMS This type of bowl seems a hallmark of EM III at Knossos, where such bowls are very common in the UEW.31 The bowls tend to have thicker rims and be of heavier fabric than their equivalents of types 8 and g in EM II. Some bowls from A5 seem to have had small round section horizontal handles;32 but there is no evidence of them in B3. A bowl of this type with elaborate light-on-dark decoration was found in an EM III deposit in Mochlos town.33 TYPE IO. LARGE BOWLS WITH STRAIGHT SIDES AND THICK EVERTED RIM Some 15 rims are assignable to this type. *TYPE 11.

Several examples were noted in B3. Bridge spouts B3 has several fragments: class di with a circular hole through the wall of the vessel. Andreou notes that bridge spouts of this kind are relatively common in the UEW, while bridge spouts with a semi circular hole (as class d2) are more common in the EM III of eastern Crete.35 HANDLES These are in general round or sometimes thick oval in section. A double round section handle 656 comes from A6. Several handles with more or less rectangular sections were noted, mostly in A5. Horizontal handles appear to have a rounded outline; none is of the pointed shape found in MM I. 34 Cf.

Only one example was noted in B3. BASES Bases are in general flat. Decoration paint The ascendancy of light-on-dark over dark-on-light painted decoration, which is such a recognised feature of EM III, merely reflects the predominance of dark (black or red) washes on the fine table ware. Decoration, whether in light-on-dark or dark-on-light, is still for the most part simple and linear. The use of diagonal lines, singly or in groups of three or more, appears very popular by the time of B3. This may be an expression of that feeling for torsion or spiralling movement that Matz noted in Cretan Bronze Age art.36 Dark-on-light Decoration in dark-on-light is still attested throughout EM III at Knossos, even on some of the smaller vessels in fine ware. Lattice and large solid spots are among the motifs. A row of solid spots adorns base 555 (A5). A type 2 footed goblet 1052 (B3) has solid semicircles hanging from the rim. As in earlier and later periods, pithoi and large jars are decorated with trickle ornament. Light-on-dark The earlier history of decoration in white paint in Crete has already been discussed (p. 123). It is much more in evidence than dark-on-light decoration in our EM III deposits. The paint used for this light-on-dark decoration at Knossos ranges in colour from fairly white to creamy white with a distinctly yellowish tinge as found on East Cretan EM III White-on-Dark ware.37 Motifs include lattice, a row of solid triangles 566 (A5), and diagonal lines in various combinations: with solid spots 640 (A6), and flanking a single wavy line 1106 (B3), or a spiraliform motif 663 (A7). Solid spots linked in the form of a running spiral appear on 657 (A6). The spiraliform motifs of this and the somewhat comparable 663 seem to be a new departure at Knossos during this period, despite a spiral in pattern burnish on EM I chalice 1183 and a presumably EM IIA spiral in dark-on-light painted ware 1299. Yet it is interesting to note that there is nothing exactly like these early Knossian spiraliform motifs in the extensive repertory of East Cretan Early Minoan III White-on-Dark,38 although true spirals and running quirks are at home there.39 The paint used for this light-on-dark EM III decoration at Knossos ranges in colour from fairly white to creamy white with a distinctly yellowish tinge as found on the equivalent East Cretan ware.40 The fine chalky white paint, the 'new white' as Evans called it,41 current in MM I—II at Knossos, does not appear to be at home there in EM III.42 The neat character of the spiraliform decoration on 657 and 663 contrasts with the bold spiral on 1124 (B3), imported from eastern Crete. The general impression made by the EM III light-on-dark decoration of Knossos is indeed one of restraint — if not austerity — when compared with the rich, ebullient style of its East Cretan counterpart. The Knossian pottery of subsequent Minoan periods appears to reflect this same capacity for tasteful restraint when compared with the products of other Cretan centres. INCISION This is rare, but is attested in deposits of early and later phases of EM III at Knossos. Incised hatching appears on a raised band 658 (A6), and on the ribs at the base of jug necks 1094-1097 (B3). The bodies of two small bowl-jars 1140-1141 of type 16 (B3) have reserved zones with fine incised lattice. 36 Hood 1978, 234, 274, n. 2, with references. 37 For the paint used for this ware, see Betancourt 1984. 38 Betancourt 1984, 22, 26, fig. 3-5: 7 (quirks), 8 (J-spirals); 32. 39 Betancourt 1984. 40 For the character of the paint on East Cretan EM III light on-dark ware, see Betancourt 1984 with a full analysis. « MI, 111. 42 Cf.

Warts occur on the bodies of jugs and below the rims of large bowls or jars of type 17. BARBOTINE Barbotine as a form of decoration seems to be attested for the first time at Knossos at the beginning of EM III. Four fragments from A5 and one from B3 illustrate two varieties: naturalistic 'barnacle work'43 on 629 (A5) and 1102 (B3); and fish scales on 571 and 627-628 (A5).44 White painted decoration appears in the area not occupied by the fish scales on 571. In the Mesara barbotine does not seem to appear until later MM IA.45 Fish scale barbotine seems unusual in Crete. Some of the few examples listed by Foster are MM III-LM I in date,46 and others are not strictly comparable with our EM III pieces.47 Fish scales resembling ours appear, however, on some fragments from Patrikies,48 where some of the pottery may fall within EM III at Knossos.49 Fish scales of this type also adorn two-handled jars of unusual shape from Beycesultan XVIII and XVIIb of EB I, thought to be contemporary with Troy I.50 Some jars of the same shape 20 from Beycesultan XVII are decorated with ordinary 'prickle' barbotine.51 Foster suggests that 'fish-scale surface manipulation' may be an anticipation of 'irregular polygonal ridge slip manipulation',52 that is to say, of barnacle work barbotine. RIPPLING Rippled decoration was noted on a fragment from A5. 43 As Evans called it [PMIV, 100, 102, figs. 67-8). 44 For other EM III barbotine from Knossos (and Archanes) see Momigliano 2007c, 84-5, fig. 3.3: 1 (Mackenzie 1903, 167, fig. 1: 6; 1906, 252, for the provenance); Momigliano 1991, 156 7, fig. 8: 9; 161 : 9); 87, 91, fig. 3.9: 1. Mackenzie (1903, 167, fig. 1: 5-6) showed two goblets with barnacle work. One of these was then illustrated twice by Evans, first as MM IB, and later as MM IA [PMI, 180-1, fig. 129a; IV, 100, 102, fig. 68). Foster discusses these goblets as examples of her exaggerated polygonal ridge type of barbotine, but wrongly assigns them to houses below the Kouloures in the West Court (Foster 1982, 16, 52, 58, 14®&gt; P1· l3: AM 1938-415)· 45 Todaro 2005, 42. 46 Foster 1982, 50. 47 E.g.

Piece βΐ5 is now considered an import from western Crete, possibly from around Chania (Broodbank and Kiriatzi 2007, 252-4, fig. 5e), where many examples of such scale barbotine have been found (Coldstream and Huxley 1972, 85; Chania-Kastelli: Tzedakis 1969, 428, pi. 4356). 48 Bonacasa 1968, 45, fig. 34, top left: bottom row, left and second from left. 49 Zois (1968A, 122) for instance assigned it to transitional EM III-MM IA.

Two of them are EM, the rest clearly Neolithic.1 The Neolithic sherds belong to vessels of all sizes, some large but others very small; their surfaces are well burnished, shades of light and dark brown and black and red-brown, the clay tempered with distinctive angular lumps of white grit, apparently gypsum, which in many cases shows in the surface. This distinctive white grit appears to match Tomkins's fabric id, which appears in MN and is a characteristic of LN I at Knossos.2 The two EM sherds may be EM II. They are both from closed vessels; one is a scrap of fine white burnished ware: orange clay, plain inside, but a thick, warm, well burnished white slip outside; the other has a hard fabric: orange clay with fine black and white grit, with a buff slip outside and traces of decoration in black. It does not, however, appear to be a Mirabello product. Deposit Ai: Floor VII EARLY MINOAN IIA3 Levels LAi 14, LAi 16-LA117; LAi 11, LAi 13; LAiog-LAi 10 (which may be mixed with material from deposit A2). Amount about 1 table. The amount of pottery from this deposit is small, and nearly 1/2 of it belongs to lots that may have been mixed with material from deposit A2 above it. All the same, the pottery of Ai is markedly different from that of A2, which is definable as EM IIB. In Ai, burnished ware is much more in evidence than in later levels. It includes both fine buff ware, often with painted decoration in red, and a fair amount of dark grey burnished ware continuing the EM I tradition, with some light brown and red burnished ware. Several lug (pellet) feet like those in the Palace Well (see p. 57) come from this deposit — and also occur on jugs from the WCH.4 They are very rare in later EM levels in our excavations. This may be fortuitous; but it is interesting that these feet do not appear at either Fournou Korifi I or II, although they are quite well represented in Debla II. The deposit may date to a later stage of EM IIA than the WCH,5 since it has a scrap or two of Vasiliki ware in apparently pure contexts, and already decoration in white paint on a dark surface on 239. Fragments of pithoi are adorned with the trickle that is such a characteristic system of decoration for pithoi and large vessels of every shape in subsequent Minoan periods. The chalice bases have shrunk to a stage immediately ancestral to the classic EM IIB goblet bases of deposits A2 and B2, and can be classed as stemmed (footed) goblet bases. What is most significant is the appearance here side by side of identical bases: 186 in fine dark grey burnished ware in the EM I tradition, and 201 in fine buff burnished ware with decoration in red, like the EM IIB goblet bases in A2 and Bi; while 261 is a small example of a high pedestal, in shape like those of EM I, but of buff burnished ware with decoration in red in the EM II tradition. 1 Tomkins (pers. comm.) notes five EM IIA sherds and 15 EN/MN. 2 Tomkins 2007, 21, 25, 27. 3 This deposit was for a long time mismarked as 'Floor VP, leading to some confusion: see p. 75, and table 4.1. 4 Wilson 1985, 314, 316-7, fig. 19: P144, P158; 357. 5 See Wilson 1985, 292. !3!</page><page sequence="143">132 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN FABRIC Fine ware Light surfaced ware This is more in evidence than dark surfaced ware. The vessels in standard buff ware are often, and in the case of the characteristic drinking goblets of type 3 almost invariably, burnished, with the stroke marks of the burnishing implement normally quite visible. Decoration is in linear designs in matt or slightly lustrous paint, red, red-brown, light brown or shades of dark brown to black. Dark surfaced ware Some fragments come from vessels with a dark wash, either burnished or unburnished, and decoration, when it occurs, in white; but dark grey burnished ware continuing the EM I tradition is the chief representative of dark surfaced ware in Ai. There are also examples of the allied fabrics: red and light brown burnished wares. Over 60 fragments of dark grey burnished ware were noted. These mostly belong to small vessels, notably footed goblets of various types and bowls. Some of these vessels are of very fine fabric with thin walls. Several sherds with a dark burnished surface may be Neolithic strays (e.g. 190), although only one or two scraps were certainly identified as Neolithic. Vasiliki ware is represented by four scraps (PLATE 26: 273-274), two of them from levels which may have been mixed with material from A2. The outside of one scrap from a closed vessel has very fine stroke burnishing. On a fragment of a small cup or goblet, and on the two sherds from the possibly mixed levels, the surfaces appear merely well smoothed. Some vessels are scraped, both in fine ware, light or dark surfaced, and cooking pot ware. Cooking pot ware This is by now clearly differentiated from standard coarse ware. The clay is red, with fine grit, and well fired; the surface is often wiped (plate 24: 272). This wiping, which was very common on coarse ware vessels from the Palace Well, seems confined in Ai to vessels of cooking pot fabric. The surfaces, whether wiped or not, often have a red wash. Sometimes they have a thick white slip with decoration in red (plate 24: 265). TYPES IN DARK GREY AND RED BURNISHED WARES The shapes of vessels in dark grey and red burnished ware are so different from those in other wares that it seems best to consider them separately. Dark grey burnished ware Where the shapes in this fabric can be inferred, they are evidently small cups or bowls with high feet or pedestals, descendants of the much larger chalices and food vessels of Palace Well types 1 and 2; but true pedestals of the EM I type are less common than high feet like 186. This is the only fairly complete example of such a foot, but fragments of at least five others were noted. There is a considerable variety in rim shapes: some are inward curving, others straight or outward curving, and others internally thickened. An unique rim 189, and the scrap 190 with a ribbed or fluted surface, are probably Neolithic. 180 (Ni) fig. 7. l. Goblet rim. D. c. 8.5. Finest dark grey burnished ware; orange clay, grey-black at surface, which has fine burnish outside, like polish; inside less well burnished. For the carinated profile of the rim cf.

Horizontal ribbing and fluting of this kind are very much at home on the standard, class C black or brown burnished ware of Phaistos FN. Vagnetti illustrates many examples and suggests that this form of decoration may show imitation of metal work.7 Red and light brown burnished wares Red burnished ware is less in evidence than dark grey burnished ware. The proportion is about 1:3. There are parts of a small suspension pot 195, and about 20 other fragments of red burnished ware from a variety of goblets or bowls of different shapes and sizes. Five of these are of exceptionally fine fabric with the red surface highly burnished like some of the finest dark grey burnished ware. The fragments of this fine red burnished ware come from both open and closed shapes, all evidently of small size. Light brown burnished ware shades into red burnished ware. Our few fragments of it include part of a lid 196 with pattern burnish. See also pp. 256-8 below. 191 (Ni4a) fig. 7.2, plate 23. Goblet rim with stump of open (?) spout. D. c. 8.

A small suspension pot from Pyrgos is closely comparable in shape and size and also has red burnished wash (Xanthoudides 19180, 145, fig, 6; 149: 25). Another from Koumasa that seems comparable in shape and size is assigned by Xanthoudides (1924, 36, pi. 25: 4173) and Zois (1967 a, 719) to the start of EM II. Cf. Boyd Hawes et al. 1908, 56, n, 2: f, fig. 37: 2, from Rock Shelter A. Lugs with double perforations appear at home in Crete by EM II, but are not attested in the Palace Well. 196 (LA/61/P12) fig. 7.2, plate 23. Lid with two handles. About 1/3 pres. D. 17.5. Reddish orange clay, light brown to reddish surface, well burnished on top; pattern burnish underneath of groups of lines radiating from centre. There is an identical lid in SMK B.I.8 226.

FOOTED GOBLETS ETC. 197-203 These occur in a variety of fabrics. Fragments of goblets of this or allied types in dark grey or red to light brown burnished ware have already been discussed. Rims 202-203 from mixed (?) deposit and another scrap, all apparently from goblets, have remains of an overall wash in red to dark purple brown. But goblets of the standard type are most commonly of light surfaced buff ware, burnished and with decoration in red. Of 13 rims of goblets of this buff burnished ware, eight (over 1/2) come from what may be a mixed deposit; but the other five are apparently from pure levels of Ai. Goblet rims of buff burnished ware mostly seem to be c. 10 in diameter; but two are 1 x, and one like 198 is only 7. The surfaces of these rims, shades of orange or buff, are burnished with vertical strokes outside and often inside as well. The vertical stroke burnishing on the outsides of these goblets is often careful and appears decorative in intent. The rims are characteristically painted red, more often (eight examples) with a thin stripe 6 We thank Peter Tomkins for advice on 189-190 and 341 below. 7 Vagnetti 1973a, 79-80.</page><page sequence="146">AREA A.

Two other rims (e.g. 200) have a thick red band round the top of the outside and traces of a diagonal band on the body as well. We found only one fairly complete goblet foot 201. This is of the high type like 186 in dark grey burnished ware. It comes from mixed (?) deposit; but a scrap of another similar foot comes from what appears to have been a pure context of A1.</page><page sequence="147">i36 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN 197 (Nig) fig. 7.2.

SHALLOW BOWLS OR PLATES WITH RIM THICKENED INTERNALLY 204-208 Out of 20 rims, 11 are assignable to class a and seven to class b; two are indeterminate. One or two rims of class a (e.g. 205-206) have a slight groove round the outside which gives the profile of the rim the appearance of being thickened externally as well as internally. Almost all the fragments of these bowls come from mixed (?) deposit; only two rims, one of each class, are from pure levels of Ai. In fabric the bowls of this type are indistinguishable from those of A2; all rims except one are of fine buff ware with decoration usually in red. The exception — from mixed (?) deposit — appears to have had a black wash. Rim 204 of class a from mixed (?) deposit has a pair of string-holes made before firing, like 322 (A2). 204-207 (N96-9) Rims of class a (fig. 7.3; plate 24: 206-207). 204: D. 24. 205: D. 16. 206: D. 17. 207: D. 18.

Most are from jugs decorated in dark-on-light, or from cooking pot ware vessels, like 255 (plate 24) which is round in section, of fine cooking pot ware with a red to red-brown wash. The base of an apparently vertical handle 256 (N130) from an open vessel (not a jug) is perforated with a string-hole; the surface has a burnished wash in shades of dark and reddish brown outside, and red inside. CARINATIONS These are much in evidence on bowls of cooking pot ware of type 11.</page><page sequence="152">AREA A. ROYAL ROAD: NORTH. THE EARLY MINOAN II —III DEPOSITS 141 BASES 257-263 These are normally flat. But one or two bases appear to have been deliberately sunk, e.g. 195. Three fragments of bases with pellet feet come from pure levels of A1. It is curious that only one other base of this type was noted in the later EM II levels, from A2. These feet all seem to belong to small closed vessels, which may have been jugs, and are of fine buff ware, with the outside surface smoothed or burnished, e.g. 259. Fragments of two or three pedestal bases of dark grey burnished ware were found (see pp. 132-3). Pedestal 261 has decoration in red paint, reminiscent of Phaistos FN, but there is a sound parallel from the WCH. Ring base 262, evidently from a bowl, is of the type found in Vasiliki ware, and may be an import. 257 plate 23. Base of small bowl. Fine orange clay with light brown wash, well burnished inside and outside. 258 (N135) plate 26. Small flat base of closed vessel. Fine orange clay, orange-buff outside, smoothed.

Fine orange clay, orange buff outside, smoothed or burnished; decoration in red and red-brown. 261 (N124) fig. 7.4, plate 26. Pedestal base frag. Fine grey clay, orange towards outside, which is orange-buff, with fine vertical stroke burnishing: like EM I pedestal bases. Traces of decoration in thick red applied after burnishing: loops rising from edge of pedestal. Part of a closely similar pedestal base comes from the WCH (Wilson 1985, 309, 311, fig. 16: Pi 16). A more complete example, of the same fabric and with the same type of decoration, is in the SMK (B.II 405).8 If both the fabric and thick red decoration of 261 are reminiscent of the fine, class C burnished ware with encrusted decoration in red ochre of FN at Phaistos, the surface colour of the Phaistos FN painted ware is usually dark. 262 (Ni 1) fig. 7.4. Ring base, evidently of bowl. D c. 7. Hard, well fired grey clay; apparently with slip, black to red-brown under base, which is burnished; inside of vessel black, with very high burnish like polish. 263 plate 24. Frag., apparently underside of a base, perhaps of flat dish or plate of types 12 or 13. Cooking pot ware: red-brown clay, with apparent a red wash; bold straw impressions showing in surface. DECORATION Paint 264-267 Dark-on-light, in red or red-brown, or black This is the most common type of decoration, which appears in its most elaborate form on jugs of type 15 (see p. 138). The motifs are linear: lines, or thicker stripes and bands, horizontal, vertical and diagonal, predominate. On deep bowls and jars interlacing diagonal lines seem characteristic, and are reminiscent of the string nets from which they are no doubt derived. Lattice, which may also be ultimately derived from string-work, is found not only on jugs of type 15, but in a very neat form on the rim of miniature bowl 212. Triangles or other areas of lattice flanked by thick bands as seen on jug fragment 237 occur on a few jugs from the WCH.9 Areas of lattice outlined by thick bands in this way also appear on various types assignable to EM II in southern Crete.10 Small loops hang from the rims of goblets, and larger ones rise from the bottom edge of pedestal base 261 described above. A solid spot adorns jug neck 228. Vessels of cooking pot ware with a white or buff slip may have decoration in red paint (e.g. 265). One bowl base from mixed (?) deposit has a simple red cross on the underneath. Pithoi have trickle ornament. 264 plate 30. Two frags, of deep bowl. Fine orange clay with buff surface, stroke burnished inside and outside; outside decorated with interlacing diagonals in red-brown. 265 plate 24. Fine cooking pot ware. Reddish clay, grey at core. Thick buff slip outside, with decoration of a broad vertical band in thin red-brown. 266 plate 25. Underneath of bowl base with parallel lines which may be part of elaborate cross. Buff surface, burnished inside and outside; decoration in red-brown. From mixed (?) deposit. Light-on-dark This occurs in creamy white paint, but is rare. For the jug shoulder 239 with a dark burnished surface and bands in white, see p. 138. The decoration on bowl fragment 267 is more elaborate. 8 In the Cyclades vessels of various types are found with pedestals in EC II, which overlaps with EM II (cf. Wilson 2007, 70, 77); and some EC II high feet have decoration comparable with that on 261 (e.g. Zervos 1957, figs. 229, 240). Cf. a high foot or low pedestal from Arapi in Thessaly assigned to the Arapi (Dimini 2) phase of LN (Hauptmann and Milojcic 1969, pi. 13: 6). 9 Wilson 1985, 326-8, figs. 24-6: P221-222. 10 E.g.

Pattern burnish 268 True pattern burnish as found in the Palace Well is virtually absent, apart from the lid of light brown burnished ware 196. It is notably absent from the vases of grey burnished ware, which in shape and fabric continue the EM I tradition. An isolated scrap of light greyish brown ware 268 (N 13) from mixed (?) deposit, with rough horizontal stroke burnishing like pattern burnish, may be an EM I stray. The vertical stroke burnishing on goblets of fine buff ware of type 2 was perhaps decorative in intent, but is not strictly pattern burnish. Incision 269-271 Incised decoration is rare. 269-270 (N121-2). Fragments of coarse gritty cooking pot type ware; orange surface, smoothed. Decorated with finely incised parallel lines. 271 (Ni 20) fig. 7.4, plate 24. Thickened rim of goblet (?) with stump of open spout or handle. Overall red-brown to dark purple-brown wash. Incised arrow-like, or simple branch, sign made before wash applied. From mixed (?) deposit. Cf. Warren 1972 b, 394, fig. 4, for an elaborate branch in dark-on-light on a fine bowl from the lower EM IIA occupation level in RRS. Scoring 272 Vessels in cooking pot ware, notably bowls and jars of types 11 and 18, often have their surfaces boldly scored (or wiped), continuing the practice of EM I and earlier — see pp. 28-30. 272 plate 24. Jar frags. Thin walled. Fine red cooking pot ware; outside neatly scored. IMPORTS 273-275 Four scraps of Vasiliki ware (e.g. plate 26: 273-274) may be from imports from eastern Crete, and see above for light grey ware and 212 for fine painted ware. A scrap of coarse ware 275 (N134) is reminiscent of East Aegean fabrics of Troy I or earlier: it is of soft fabric with abundant straw, with grey clay grey at the core, orange at the surface, and traces of a red wash outside, much worn. Deposit A2: Floor VI EARLY MINOAN IIB13 Levels LA 106, LA 108, LA105B. Amount: about 2 tables. This deposit represents the pottery found above the floor of the EM II house and the contemporary ground level outside it. Accordingly, a good many complete vessels come from this horizon, together with large fragments of others. The presence of these might suggest a destruction level, as may apply also for the presumed floor(s) in Area B that produced the whole pottery that Evans found in 1908 (see chapter 10). Strays which appear to be intrusive, either fallen from the sides of the trench during excavation or subsequently working their way into the baskets of pottery before it was studied, include two scraps of LM I plain conical cups, one thin strap handle and another bit of a MM II cup of fine black washed ware, and the flaring rim of a wheelmade bowl of soft sandy pale orange clay, its wheel marks clearly visible, of MM IB—II: 276 (N58).

THE EARLY MINOAN II —III DEPOSITS 143 FABRIC The smaller vessels are still predominantly of fine buff ware, with burnished or well smoothed surfaces; but several now have a wash (dark washed ware) and decoration in thick creamy white paint. Even the fine ware vessels are apt to be irregular in their manufacture. Some fragments of dark grey burnished ware were found, but they are all scraps and may be earlier strays, and not contemporary with the deposit, as would apply also to a scrap of light grey ware. Even if some or all of this dark grey burnished ware is contemporary, it is certainly much less in evidence than in Ai. On the other hand some fragments of fine red burnished ware appear to be contemporary with the rest of the deposit. Red burnished ware may have been the fabric selected for making small jars or suspension pots. Vasiliki ware is a good deal in evidence. Vessels of dark grey and red burnished wares, and of Vasiliki ware, are considered separately from the rest, since many of the types or characteristics of vessel in these wares appear to be special to them. Dark grey burnished ware 277-279 We have 10 to 12 scraps of this fabric: some or all may be strays from Ai levels. Most belong to goblets or bowls, including a fragment from the top of a pedestal of EM I type; two scraps are from the edges of small pedestals or goblet bases like 187 (Ai); there are also two or three rims as 277 (N84) (fig. 7.5), a scrap of an internally thickened bowl rim as type 4 class a, and another more steep sided 278 (N25) (fig. 7.5; D. c. 20).14 A short everted bowl rim 279 (N85) (fig. 7.5) has a wart-like projection. There is a scrap of a round section handle. Red burnished ware 280-281 There are some 1 o fragments of this, of fine orange clay with a red to light brown surface with a very high burnish (outside only in the case of closed vessels). One scrap comes from a bowl; the rest are from closed vessels — most if not all perhaps suspension pots, including rim 280 (N66) (fig. 7.5) (D. c. 8), a fragment of a carination (D c. 15), and a small rounded base 281 (N64) differentiated by a carination like many EM I bases but only c. 4 in diameter. (Number 282 was not used.) Light brown burnished ware Bowl rim 287 has a light brown burnished surface but may be a variety of Vasiliki ware and is included below. Vasiliki ware 283-290 About a dozen fragments come from at least six vessels, of typical Vasiliki ware with the washed surface orange-red mottling to shades of dark brown and black, smoothed but not obviously burnished; at least no stroke marks are visible. Goblet 283 looks like Vasiliki ware, but may be of Knossian manufacture. On the other hand it has no trace of decoration in white, which usually appears on the dark washed goblets of local make. Two beaded jar rims are suggestive of metal prototypes. Beaded rims like these are characteristic in Vasiliki ware and allied fabrics, but do not seem to occur on jars of local Knossian fine buff or dark washed ware. 283 (LA/61/P8) fig. 7.5. Goblet.

Vasiliki ware (?). It is uncertain whether this is really Vasiliki ware from eastern Crete: Betancourt (1979, 27) regards the appearance of small rivet-like pellets of this kind on or near rims as characteristic of Vasiliki ware found at Knossos and suggestive of a local centre of manufacture.

Not typical Vasiliki ware, although perhaps imported from eastern Crete. Fine orange clay with wash outside and inside the rim, light brown to reddish in colour, and well smoothed or burnished. Cf. 822 (Bi). Beaded rims like these and 289 occur on jars of Vasiliki ware in eastern Crete in EM IIB (e.g. Warren 1972a, 151, 202, fig. 86, pi. 64B: P667; Betancourt 1979, 51: X.D Myrtos 1), but are already found there in other fabrics in EM IIA (e.g. Warren 1972a, 101, 156, fig. 40, pi. 33A: P32). TYPES 2 AND 3. FOOTED GOBLETS AND goblets 291-311 Just one base of a simple goblet of type 3 comes from A2. It is c. 3.5 in diameter, with traces of dark wash outside. On the other hand there are over a dozen feet of goblets of type 2 with diameters between 4 and 5.2. These (fig. 7.6) range from high examples like 291 (N71), through medium high like 292 (N72), to low like 293 (N70) (plate 23). One low foot 294 (N69) is reminiscent of the low feet with upturned rims that are characteristic of MM IA. The solid high foot 295 (N68) is of exceptional fabric, with rather gritty buff clay, plain (without decoration) outside but well burnished inside. Of the other feet of goblets of type 2, about 2/3 are of fine buff ware with decoration in red: these are either painted solid red, or have a red band round the waist, or a band round the waist and a stripe round the lower edge (fig. 5.4). Of the remaining four goblet feet, which have an overall dark wash, 310 has a white band round the waist, and 293 a band round the waist and four broad stripes rising vertically from it. Several feet have marks on the underneath. Thus 310 shows a stroke in white on a dark wash. Two other feet with a dark wash outside have the underneath of the foot plain except for a band round the</page><page sequence="156">AREA A. ROYAL ROAD: NORTH.

Scale 1:2. edge as 293. 292 with a red wash outside has two strokes in dark-on-light meeting at an angle on the underneath; 296 (N206)15 of buff ware has a single such stroke across one edge. Rims of types 2 or 3 There are about 37 rims assignable to these types with diameters between 7 and 13, but mostly it would seem between c. 9 and 1 o. Most of these rims are more or less pointed or rounded; but one is flat-topped. About 2/3 of them (25) are of light surfaced buff ware. They have simple decoration (fig. 5.2) of horizontal stripes or bands in red or shades of brown to black (plate 23: 297-301, where 297 has decoration in black). One exception, however, is plain buff outside, with a solid red wash inside. The outsides of the remaining 1/3 of the rims (about 12) have a red or black wash, shading to purple brown and dark and light brown. Decoration in the characteristic thick creamy white paint includes a variety of motifs (plate 26: 302-308): single, double or multiple stripes or wider bands on or below the rim; small loops hanging from the rim, and chevrons (308); once a diagonal band on the body below the rim (305).16 An atypical rim 311 in this dark washed ware has a carination.

Carinated rim, apparently from small goblet. D. 7. Black wash. TYPE 4. SHALLOW BOWLS OR PLATES WITH RIM THICKENED internally 312-329 These are very common. The shape could be restored for 322-323 and 329; and many rims were found. Bowls of this type seem rather irregularly made, of fine buff ware with orange or buff clay and usually a paler surface. The insides are smoothed or, more often, burnished, sometimes quite well but on other occasions in a very superficial manner (scribble burnish). The outsides are in general less carefully treated than the insides, with scribble burnish, or wiped or pared, e.g. 323. Rims of the rounded class a outnumber those of the bevelled class b by about 3:1. (a) Rounded rims like 312-324, 312A (N22-34) (fig. 7.7: 312, D. 26; 313, D. 13; 314, D. 11; 315, D. 22; 316, D. 18; 317-320, D. 17; 322-323; plates 24: 313, 316, 318, 321, 27: 312A). About 44 examples. Diameters range from c. 11 to 25, with most between 15 and 25 and a large number between 16 and 18. Rim 317 is markedly everted on the outside like 205-206 (Ai). Flaring rim 319 may come from a bowl more akin to type 8B than to type 4. A pair of string-holes was made before 15 Also marked in pencil 'N106'. 16 Another goblet rim from Knossos with comparable chevrons in light-on-dark in this position is Zois 1967A, 152 and n. 2, pi. 30: 3. Cf. a rim from Tylissos (Hazzidakis 1934, pi. 17.1b, of the First Period, which included EM II as well as EM III and later material: Andreou 1978, 173, n. 1; 177, n. g). Chevrons are also found on EM III goblet rims. Andreou notes a goblet assigned to EM III from the Premier Charnier at Malia with a row of chevrons flanked by pairs of bands (Demargne 1945, 6-7, pis. 8, 29: 8529; Andreou 1978, 123).

All rims of this class are from light surfaced bowls of buff ware, except 324, which appears to belong to a bowl of type 4 but has a dark wash. Decoration is normally in red paint, and the motifs are standardised: a broad band just below the inside of the rim, or on top of the rim confronting diagonal stripes or bands, usually broad and more or less closely spaced to form a chevron; but on 323 the diagonals are spaced at opposite sides of the bowl rim. These diagonals may ultimately derive from string lashed round the rims of bowls of some other material. 322 (LA/61/P2) FIG. 7.7, plate 27. About 1/2 pres.

About 14 examples of rims of this class range in diameter from c. 18 to 30. The bowls from which these come seem in general to be somewhat larger than the bowls with rims of class a. All the rims of class b are from bowls of fine buff ware with decoration in dark-on-light, normally in red, consisting of a broad band round the inside of the rim which continues on its bevelled outer edge. In one or two cases the paint has spread over the bevelled edge of the rim to form a narrow stripe on the outside of the bowl below it. 325 has a broad band round the outside as well as round the inside of the rim. 329 (LA/61/P4) fig. 7.7.

BOWLS WITH EVERTED RIM 351-354 Of 12 rims, about seven belong to shallow bowls of type 9A (e.g. 351) and five to bowls of the deep type 9B, e.g. 353. They range in diameter from c. 22 to over 40; several appear to come from bowls c. 30 across. Those with a dark (red or black) wash and decoration in white outnumber those of buff ware with decoration in dark-on-light by about 2:1. The bowls of buff ware are burnished and have decoration in red. The standard scheme of decoration is a band below the rim inside and outside, with alternate diagonals forming chevrons on top of the rim.

JUGS WITH CUTAWAY SPOUT 373-383 There are fragments of several jugs of fine buff ware with decoration in dark-on-light. Handles appear to be set just below the rim and differentiated from it, as on 1339, and are round or very thick oval in section. Necks and spouts are decorated with parallel stripes or chevrons, e.g. 374; shoulders typically with upright hatched triangles, e.g. 373. Handle 383 has broad diagonal stripes. The motif of triple chevrons as seen on the neck of 374 appears to be standard on jug necks at Knossos in EM IIB (e.g. 375-376, 379). It is also found at Tylissos on jug necks of period I, which includes a good deal of EM IIB material.17 The motif is not represented, however, on jug necks from Ai or the WCH. A jug from Vasiliki II has this motif on the neck combined with cross-hatched triangles with single spots between them on the shoulder above a pair of thick bands.18 373 is probably closely similar to this or, better still, jugs such as 1332-1333 from Evans's excavations in Area B, but its decoration is not so complete as theirs. Cf. also 995-998 (B2). Unless otherwise stated, the surface of the fragments described below is buff and the decoration is in shades of dark brown. Fragments 373-383 are all shown on plate 25. 373 (LA/61/Pi 1). Frags, from upper part of body. Fine orange clay; with buff slip with slight greenish tinge outside. Decoration in slightly lustrous dark purple-brown to black: two broad horizontal bands with upright cross-hatched triangle(s) above. 374 (N86). Neck and rim. Orange clay with buff, well smoothed surface; neck pared as on MM IA jugs. Decoration in rather matt dark brown to black: upright cross-hatched triangles on shoulder, triple chevrons on neck, thin stripe along top of rim. 375 Neck and rim.

Two (e.g. 384) have the stumps of horizontal side-handles as type 16B. Most bowl-jars, whether small of type 16 or large, appear to be light surfaced with decoration in dark-on-light; but 385 has a dark wash and traces of decoration white; and there are fragments of other similar bowl-jars. 384 (N83) fig. 7.10.

LARGE SPOUTED BOWLS OR JARS WITH HORIZONTAL SIDE-HANDLES 388-391 A number of rims, mostly of coarse ware with decoration in dark-on-light, but others of cooking pot ware or fabric akin to it, may come from vessels of this kind. The rims are normally more or less 17 Hazzidakis 1934, pi. 18b, e. 18 Boyd Hawes et al. 1908, 50, pi. 12: 20A, 20B (Zois 1967a, pi. 29: 3725).

Decorated with curving band in relief with diagonal cuts or slashes on it. Raised bands or ribs with slashes across them are attested at the base of jug necks in EM IIB at Knossos and are not uncommon in EM III. But a slashed rib like 390 on the body of ajar appears to be unusual in EM Crete. It recalls the ribs with slashes or cuts on some pottery of Phaistos FN, but the vessel shapes are different and the ribs are straight, not curved (e.g. Vagnetti 1973a, 54-6, fig. 57: 13, 19; 92&gt; fig- 82: 3'. 100&gt; fig- 94: 9; 107&gt; fig- 108: 4). 391 (N163) fig. 7.10. D. 15. Cooking pot ware: clay grey at core, red-brown at edges. Red wash, shading to dusky brown in places outside. Two or three other similar rims were found. TYPE 18. LARGE BOWLS OR JARS WITH INWARD CURVING, OFTEN CARINATED AND THICKENED RIMS 392-399 A restorable example 392 and about six other rims are assignable to this type. The rims, which are all more or less thickened, appear to range in diameter from c. 20 to 45 or more. In general they seem large. A smaller example is 1339 from the Early Houses. 392 (LA/61/P15) FIG. 7.10, plate 28. Tall jar with carinated rim.

Fabric akin to cooking pot ware, with light grey-brown surface, finger-wiped inside; strongly wiped outside, probably with bunch of twigs, like some EM I coarse wares. A distinctive group of large thickened rims of cooking pot ware may be discussed here. The rims seem to come from deep bowls or jars c. 40 to 50 or more in diameter. In shape these vessels may have resembled type 18, but rim 397 has the stump of an horizontal side-handle — cf. type 17. Possible traces of fire on the inside of 398 and the outside of 399 suggest that the vessels to which these rims belong were used for cooking. 397 (N162) fig. 7.10. D. 35. Three rim frags., one with stump of horizontal (?) side-handle. Clay red-brown at edges, with red-brown wash. 398 (N161) fig. 7.10. D. 40.

THERIOMORPHIC VESSEL 405 Fragment 405 (N94) (plate 29) may be the foot (or head ?) of an animal: of fine orange clay with buff, well smoothed surface; decoration in bright red paint. Cf. foot 548 (plate 29) (A4). spouts Two or three fragmentary spouts of cooking pot ware appear to have been tubular as class b2. One or two fragments of fine ware may come from similar spouts, or from cutaway ones of the teapot class c. HANDLES 406 These continue round or thick oval in section, as in Ai. The curious fish-tail handle 406 (N166) (plate 25) may belong to a lamp or brazier. It is of cooking pot ware, the clay dark brown at the core, red-brown at the edges; the surface has a red wash. The shape is like 1260 in dark grey burnished ware (see p. 256 below, with parallels from Lebena and Ayia Triada). CARINATIONS These are much in evidence below the rims of large bowls and jars of cooking pot ware of types 11 and 18. Some fine ware vessels like goblets 309 and 311 are also apparently carinated. BASES 407 These are in general flat, but sometimes slightly concave. One or two may have been convex and rounded like many characteristic EM I bases; but this rounding of the base was not perhaps intentional as it clearly was in EM I. A small lug foot 407 (N90) may belong to a suspension pot of type 20. This is of soft fabric with dark orange clay, dusky at the core, and wiped inside. The outside is much worn. DECORATION Paint 408-418 Dark-on-light in red, shades of brown, or black This is more common than light-on-dark. The designs are simple and geometrical; they appear to be most elaborate on goblets (types 2 and 3) and jugs (type 15). Loops may hang from goblet rims; upright cross-hatched triangles characteristically appear on the shoulders of jugs; diagonals interlace to form an embryo network on the sides of bowls or jars large and small (types 16 and 17) (see plates 28: 409 and 30). Fragment 411 from the shoulder of a small jug or jar has a design of hatched bands, and 412 of exceptionally fine fabric, which appears to have been used as a rubber, has unique decoration consisting of rows of open circles bisected by lines; as this design appears in the Cyclades, this may be from an import. Simple crosses are painted underneath the bases of bowls, and also of some jars (plate 25). Occasionally the crosses under the bowls are elaborate (cf. plate 39: 1347). 408 plate 28. Body frag, of large jar. Coarse ware; gritty, dark reddish-orange clay with orange-buff slip outside. Decorated with horizontal bands in dark red-brown. 409 plate 28. Base of jar or large bowl.

Sherd used as rubber, c. 2.9 across. Th. 0.5. Fine fabric: orange well fired clay, appearing light grey at core, smooth inside, and well burnished orange buff outside. Decoration in dark brown to black: diagonal rows of open circles intersected by lines. The motif of open circles or ovals bisected by a line may be derived from the cycle of decoration of vases of the Halaf 19 Like Warren 1972a, 122-3: P314-318.</page><page sequence="166">AREA A. ROYAL ROAD: NORTH. THE EARLY MINOAN II —III DEPOSITS 155 culture of northern Mesopotamia through Syria or Cilicia (e.g. Von Oppenheim 1943, pi. 50: 4). Wilson (1984, 302 3, pi. 63: E. 1.1 593) illustrates an EC II imported vessel in the SMK with this motif.20 An elegant framed version of it seems to occur on a fragment of a jug shoulder from the WCH (Wilson 1985, 327, pi. 39: P240), and likewise on one end of an unique barrel-shaped theriomorphic vessel from Koumasa: Zois believes this may come from Tholos Β and assigns it to EM IIA: Zervos 1956, pi. 267 left (called MM I); Zois 1967a, 721 and n. 1, pis. 7, 22: 4162). The same motif appears in dark-on-light in the Cyclades and Attica (e.g. Kea, Ayia Irini: Wilson 1999, 80, pi. 68: II 689; Syros: Zervos 1957, 182, fig. 241; Keros: Zapheiropoulou 1975, 81, fig. 4ζ, ν—ξ; Koropi: Kakavogianni Light-on-dark decoration in creamy white paint This is much less in evidence than dark-on-light, but predominates in the case of bowls of type 9. On the rims of goblets of types 2 and 3 the designs in light-on-dark are perhaps more varied and elaborate than those in dark-on-light. When decoration occurs on cooking pot ware it is normally in creamy white paint on a red washed surface. Bases with a dark wash may have crosses painted in white underneath. 417-418 plate 25. Bowl bases, with red (417) or black (418) wash, and simple cross in creamy white underneath. Pattern burnish No example of true pattern burnish was noted. Incision Incised decoration is rare. 419 with bold grooves may be from an import; but bowl 390 (see p. 153) with a slashed band in relief on it appears to be of local manufacture. 419 (N91) plate 28. Two frags, from large jar (?) of wash, well burnished. Decorated with chevrons made by rather coarse reddish clay, smoothed inside; outside has red bold U-shaped grooves. Perhaps import from the Cyclades. Relief The curving rib on 390 is unique. Warts evidently occurred on the shoulders of large bowls or jars of type 17 (e.g. 389), and perhaps on smaller ones of fine ware as type 16.

This material comes from the upper part of the deposit above Floor VI. It may be contemporary with the material from A2, and it certainly looks earlier than the material from A4 above it. But in view of the possibility of contamination from A4, it was studied separately from the rest of the A2 material. FABRIC Along with the standard coarse wares and fine light surfaced buff ware there is a good deal of dark (red and black) washed ware in A3. As in the case of earlier examples of this ware, the wash is apt to flake and come away from the surface of the vessel. 1993, 166, pi. 18a). 41a could then well be from an import of EC IIA (Wilson, pers. comm.). 413 (N93) plate 28.

Two or three sherds, including one with incised decoration, are certainly Neolithic. It would therefore be natural to expect an even larger number of strays dating from EM I or earlier EM II. But some of the fragments of dark grey burnished ware may come from EM IIB vessels. Among these is the rim of a goblet 435, thin-walled and sharp-pointed like 427, and c. 10 in diameter. Red and light brown burnished wares One or two fragments are assignable here. They include: a fragment of a pedestal of fine grey-brown clay, light reddish-brown and well burnished outside (perhaps an earlier stray); and a scrap of a bowl of fine red-brown sandy clay like cooking pot ware, with a red wash and fine stroke burnish, and probably contemporary with the deposit. Vasiliki ware etc. 420-424 We recognised some 18 fragments coming from at least 1 o different vessels, all apparently open bowls or goblets, except for one scrap from a closed vessel. One large fragment 420 and five rims are from goblets or small deep bowls; four rims are from shallow bowls, and five fragments from bases of bowls or goblets. All seem to be of more or less typical Vasiliki ware: rather pale orange, well refined clay, the surface with a well smoothed or burnished red or orange mottling to black wash. Betancourt is doubtful about several of our attributions, as noted below. 420 (LA/61/P16) fig. 7.1 1, plate 29. Goblet or deep bowl, with wart below rim and, probably, eggcup foot, which is missing. C. 1/2 rim pres. D. 9.5. Vasiliki ware: pale orange clay with wash, red inside where surface badly flaked, red mottling to pink with black splodges outside.

Vasiliki type ware: orange clay with orange to reddish shading to purple-brown surface. According to Betancourt, it is marginal if it is Vasiliki ware. TYPES 2 AND 3. GOBLETS 425-437 Simple goblets of type 3 are still rare. One complete profile 425 was found together with a scrap from a base. In contrast to this about 24 eggcup feet from goblets of type 2 were noted. Three of these are large with a diameter of over 6, but the diameter of the rest seems to lie between 4.7 and 5.2. Most of these feet (some 20 or 5/6 of the total) have a wash (11 red, nine black) outside; and of these six or seven show traces of a white band round the waist. In about five cases (1/4 of the total) the underneath of the foot is painted solid; in another four (1/5 of the total) it has a circular band round the edge. One tall foot with a light brown to black wash is unusual in having the light brown inside surface of the bowl of the goblet burnished. Only four feet (1/6 of the total) are plain, without any wash; all of these have a red band round the waist as FIG. 5.4: 2. Rims of types 2 and 3 (plate 29) About 60 rims are assignable to goblets of these types with a diameter ranging from 5 to 11, but mostly it seems between c. 7.5 and 9. These rims are normally thin and pointed; but one or two flat topped rims appear to be deliberately made like that. The outsides in many cases bear traces of having been scraped or pared. Most rims, about 50 or 5/6 of the total, have a wash (20 red, 30 black) inside and outside. But 428 with anomalous decoration is entirely plain inside; and others may have been plain inside except for a wash round the inner edge of the rim, since one or two eggcup feet with an outside wash have the inside of the goblet plain. One scrap of rim of fine grey-brown burnished ware 434 (fig. 7.11) may be a stray from EM I. There is considerable variety in the decorative motifs on these goblet rims, including combinations of horizontal bands and stripes, chevrons, and diagonals (figs. 5.2-5.3). The rosettes on 426 are surprising from such an early horizon as this, but the fragment seems to be in context.</page><page sequence="168">AREA A. ROYAL ROAD: NORTH.

SHALLOW BOWLS OR PLATES WITH RIM THICKENED INTERNALLY 438-447 Bowls of this type, especially those with rounded rims of class a, are very common (see fig. 7.11). (a) Rounded rims 438-443 (N209-14) (fig. 7.11: 438, D. 15; 439, D. 13; 440, D. 20; 441-442, D. 15; 443, D. 13; plate 30: 439, 441). About 39. These seem to range in diameter from c. 12 to 20, with many between 13 and 15, which may suggest that the bowls of this type in A3 were considerably smaller than those in A2; but this impression may be false. The rims tend to have the outer edge sharp rather than a rounded one. The outsides mostly show pronounced traces of having been scraped or wiped. All the rims are of fine buff ware, with decoration in dark-on light (normally red, but in a few cases dark brown or black) consisting of a band round the inside of the rim, and on top of the rim broad diagonal bands, whether single or in pairs, and usually it seems confronted. (b) Bevelled rims 444-445 (N215-6) (fig. 7.11). Only four. D. c. 20. Fine buff ware with decoration in dark-on-light: a band in red or black on the inside of the rim; the edge of the rim hatched, or in one instance solid red. Bowl 446 (N221) (plate 30), of which we have two fragments, has a band in purplish red round the inside of the rim and a group of parallel stripes running across the centre of the inside. One rim is plain. One scrap, which appears to come from a bowl of this type, has a black wash. Rim 447 (N208) (fig. 7.11, D. 14) is exceptional; it has a slight internal bead, and a dark brown to black wash outside which is well smoothed, but the inside is plain buff, smoothed. TYPE 5. SHALLOW BOWLS WITH UPRIGHT SIDES AND RIM THICKENED INTERNALLY 448-449 Two rims are assignable to this type, both in fine buff ware. 448 (N218) fig. 7.11. D. 14. Decoration in red: bands 449 (N219) fig. 7.11. D. 26. Decoration in dark brown, inside and outside; broad diagonal band on top of rim. worn: band below rim outside. TYPE 6. DEEP BOWLS WITH TROUGH SPOUT AND SIDE-HANDLES 450-451 Two fragments may be grouped here. 450 (N314) FIG. 7.11, plate 29. Rim of deep straight-sided bowl with stump of small horizontal side handle of circular section. D. 13.

SHALLOW BOWLS WITH STRAIGHT OR INWARD CURVING SIDES 452-454 A few rims are assignable to this type.</page><page sequence="170">AREA A. ROYAL ROAD: NORTH.

Cooking pot ware with red wash, well burnished inside. TYPE 8. BOWLS WITH FLARING RIM 455 There are rims of some eight shallow bowls like 455 (N220) (fig. 7.11, plate 30) assignable to the shallow variety A of this type or to type 7. The diameter is from c. 13 to 16. They are of fine buff ware with orange or buff surfaces, scraped or smoothed outside, and decorated with a red band inside the rim. TYPE 9. BOWLS WITH EVERTED RIM 456-469 These are evidently common and characteristic. Of some 33 rims assignable to bowls of this type, about 2/3 come from shallow (A), and about 1/3 from deep (B), varieties of such bowls. The rims (fig. 7.12) range from (1) sharply differentiated like 456 (N223), to (2) slightly differentiated like 457 (N224), and (3) undifferentiated and outward curving like 458 (N225). Rims of class 3 merge into those of bowls of type 8; but most of the rims assigned to type 9 more or less approximate to class 1. These bowls are apt to be thin-walled, but very uneven and irregular in their manufacture, e.g. 459-461, especially on the outside. The rim diameters are therefore difficult to ascertain, but in general they seem to fall between c. 20 and 30. In three cases the stump of a small horizontal round section handle is preserved on the side of the bowl below the rim, as shown in fig. 5.1: type gB. One of these rims with the stump of a handle 462 is unique, as the only rim in fine buff ware with decoration in dark-on-light assignable to type 9. But one or two other fragments of dark-on-light, including scraps of bases with a red band round the inside, may come from bowls of this shape. All other type g rims, however, apart from 462, have traces of a black or red wash, black washes outnumbering red by 4:3. The tendency of the paint to flake off the surface, which is apparent in the EM II wares of Knossos, is very marked on these rims. Decoration in white normally consists of a band round the inside of the rim, and often it seems round the inside of the base as well; once at least there is a white band round the outside of the base. On the rim itself are found broad opposed diagonal bands, groups of parallel diagonal stripes 460, and crossed stripes 461. 459 from the side of a bowl has interlacing diagonals in white. A few scraps from bases that may come from bowls of this type have crosses underneath, once in dark-on-light (red on buff), once in light-on-dark (white on a red wash). Once it seems there is a white cross painted on the inside of the base. 459 plate 30. Frag. Fine orange clay with purple-brown wash. Decoration in creamy white outside. 460 plate 30: inside. Rim.

The bowls to which these belonged were evidently of good fabric and, although comparatively thick walled, neatly and evenly made. 466 (N264) (D. 30) and 467 (N265) (D. 25) have a red wash. 468 (N226) is unusually small: of gritty reddish clay with a well smoothed or burnished orange-brown surface, decorated in white with a group of thin diagonal stripes on the flat top of the rim and a thin band round its inside. One other anomalous bowl rim of cooking pot ware may be grouped here (fig. 7.12): 469 (N267) (D. 26) has a burnished wash, red outside, light brown inside. TYPE IO. LARGE BOWLS WITH STRAIGHT SIDES AND THICK EVERTED RIM 470-473 Three rims of coarse ware together with two fragments of bases are assignable to standard bowls of this type. Both the bases have a band, in black or dark brown, round the inside; and 472 also has crossing diagonal stripes outside. 470 (N310) fig. 7.12, plate 32. D. 30.

JUGS WITH CUTAWAY SPOUT 483-484, 510-511 Only fragments of jug necks and handles were found. All spouts appear to be of the cutaway type, and some of them distinctly elongated, like jar spout 498. Handles are round section; in the two cases where the rim is sufficiently preserved, the handle is set below it (as shown in fig. 5.1: type 15). One or two spouts are markedly scraped or pared. Several fragments of jug spouts and necks have traces of a wash in black, or shades of brown and red. Most are of fine buff ware, the surface orange or buff, or not infrequently pale greenish in colour. Decoration on these light surfaced jugs is in red or shades of brown and black; necks may be decorated with multiple stripes or chevrons, handles with a stripe or stripes down their length. Some fragments with decoration in dark-on-light, apparently from jugs, may be strays of an earlier phase of EM II or even of EM I (e.g. plate 31: 510, of orange clay with a buff burnished outside surface, decorated in red-brown; and 51121 with an orange surface decorated in black). Jug neck 483 (plate 30) of fine cooking pot type ware with a brown wash has traces of decoration in white. Another apparent jug neck fragment 484 (N280) (plate 30) is of fine cooking pot ware, burnished red shading to brown outside, with three irregular horizontal shallow grooves running round it. TYPE 16. SMALL SPOUTED BOWL-JARS 485-501 Some if not most of the rims of small jars of fine ware grouped here evidently come from spouted bowl-jars of type 16. Most characteristic seem to be the rims of class b of which 11 were found; eight as class bz, three as class b3. One of class b3 has the stump of a horizontal handle of round section, as type 16B. Six (3/4 of the total) of the rims of class ba have a dark wash, in most cases black but once red-brown, and traces of decoration in white. The wash in almost every case extends over the whole of the inside of the rim as well as over the outside. The two rims of class bss with decoration in dark on-light are both unusually small, as 488. The two rims (including 491) assignable to class ci are rather carelessly made and uneven with a red or black wash outside, but not inside. 485 (N298) fig. 7.13, plate 30. D. 12. Cf. class ai.

LARGE SPOUTED BOWLS OR jars with HORIZONTAL side-HANDLES 502-505 Some 22 rims of cooking pot ware appear to belong to jars of this type. Two of these have horizontal side-handles, such as 50a (N272) (fig. 7.13, D. 25), and two others tubular spouts of class b. There are traces of decoration in white paint on at least eight of these rims: four examples are on plate 30 row a. Three other rims, which may also come from such jars, are of orange clay with fine grit, the surface orange or buff and decorated in shades of red-brown or black, e.g. plate 30: 503-505. type 18. LARGE bowls or jars with inward curving, often carinated and thickened RIMS 506-508 Four or five scraps of carinated rims may have belonged to jars of this kind. But some 37 other rims of cooking pot ware, mostly thickened and from vessels of larger diameter with high shoulders, may be grouped here. These are not associated with handles or spouts; and none of them has traces of decoration in white. 506 (N274) (FIG- 7-*3' D. 50) and 507-508 (N275-6) (fig. 7.13, D. 35) have a reddish-brown or red wash; the inside of 508 is dusky. TYPE 23. TRIPOD COOKING POTS Of six fragments of tripod feet, four are round and two thinnish oval in section. SPOUTS Spouts from jars are of both classes b and c. Those belonging to large jars all appear to be of class b. handles 509 Handles in general seem to be more or less round in section. But there are fragments of five small strap handles of more or less flat section that appear to come from cups or jars of fine ware. All except one have a black, red or red-brown wash. The exception 509 (N391), of rather thick kidney-shaped section, is of fine buff ware with decoration in black of bands down each side with diagonals between them. BASES Bases are mostly flat. But one base of a jug or jar with a dark brown to black wash and decoration in white has been deliberately sunk. decoration Paint 510-513 Dark-on-light, in red, shades of brown, or black Simple linear designs include parallel lines and lattice. Some fragments with this style of decoration may be strays of EM I or early EM II date (e.g. plate 31: 510-511, both apparently from jugs). Light-on-dark, in creamy white paint. Bands, stripes, parallel lines and lattice From jars of fine ware come fragments with large dots in rows, e.g. 512 (N319) (fig. 7.13, plate 32). In two examples the dots depend from intersecting pairs of diagonals: 451 (fig. 7.11) and 513 (N318) (fig. 7.13, PLATE 32). A version of the design on 512, with diagonal lines flanked by solid spots, appears in light-on-dark on 911 (Bi). There is a similar design on the rim of a footed goblet from Building 19 at Archanes Fourni; the wide relatively high foot and shape of this suggest a date in EM IIB.22 The same scheme of decoration is seen, however, on the unique bowl rim 640 (plate 32) (A6) assigned to EM III.23 Incision The only example is the jug neck 484 with grooves round it (plate 30).

TYPES TYPES 2 AND 3. GOBLETS 515-519 No bases of simple goblets of type 3 were found, and only seven eggcup feet of type 2: 515-519 (N201-5) (fig. 7.14), ranging in diameter from 4.5 to 5.5. All the feet have a wash (six red or light brown, one black) and three a band of white paint round the waist, as fig. 5.4: 4. In two cases the under side of the foot is left plain; in the other five the wash covers it. Two of these five feet with the wash underneath have also marks in white: 51 5-5j6 (plate 31). Rims of goblets. Some 19 have diameters from 6 to 9. All are more or less pointed. Wiping or scraping of the outside is very marked. All except one have a wash (nine black, nine red). TYPE 4. SHALLOW BOWLS OR PLATES WITH RIM THICKENED INTERNALLY Of nine scraps of rim, four belong to class a, five to class b. Those of class a are of fine buff ware, with an orange, buff or greenish surface, smoothed or scraped outside, and a band in red or black round the inside of the rim. Once there is a broad diagonal on the rim; once the rim is painted solid. Four of the rims of class b have a similar band round the inside. The remaining rim, which may come from a steep sided bowl as type 8B, has a red band round the outside continuing on its bevelled edge, but not inside. TYPE 8. BOWLS WITH FLARING RIM 520-521 A few rims are assignable to bowls of this type. Most belong to shallow bowls as type 8A; but 521 is steep-sided (cf. type 8B). It is noteworthy that most of these rims have plain surfaces, with a high stroke burnish but no trace of painted decoration. All are of fine buff ware unless otherwise stated. 520 (N234) FIG- 7-Hi plate 31. D. 11. Buff surface, smoothed outside, well smoothed or burnished inside.

Orange clay, with orange buff slip inside, well smoothed or burnished; outside with red wash, very well smoothed or burnished, but much worn. Some bowl bases may be considered here. One of these at least from its size and fabric appears to belong to a bowl of type 8; it is large, with an surface orange-buff burnished surface, and has a cross in dark brown underneath. A small base has the inside surface orange-buff, finely stroke burnished, while the outside has a black wash, well smoothed, continuing to form a black circle round the underneath of the base. TYPE 9. BOWLS WITH EVERTED RIM 521A-52IC Of 23 rims assignable to bowls of this type, about x8 come from the shallow variety 9A and five from the deep variety gB. Diameters are mostly between c. 20 and 30, with several c. 26. The rims from this deposit show the same range of variation as those from A3. All of them have traces of a wash (10 black, 13 red). Most are decorated with a white band round the inside, one at least with a band round the outside as well. Broad diagonal bands or groups of parallel lines appear on the flat tops of the rims. plate 30: 521A-521C shows the insides of three rims with a red or purple-brown wash and decoration in creamy white. One base of a black wash bowl of this type has a white band round the inside. TYPE 10.

On 549 (N238) (plate 32) the stripes are combined with alternate rows of small dots. This has a red wash, while another of the three 550 (N239) (plate 32) has a black wash.24 EARLY MINOAN III Deposit A5: Floor IV Levels LA99-LA99A. Amount: about 1 table. This material includes a fair amount characteristic of EM II, but also much that corresponds to what appears to be peculiar to EM III in B3. There was some intrusion of later material, notably about 12 sherds of wheelmade pots, including some LM I (mostly LM IA, but one that could be LM IB) and four or five that seem MM II. Earlier strays include one or two scraps of Neolithic, and some that may be EM I. FABRIC Fine ware There seems to be an improvement in the fabric compared with earlier levels in area A. Much of the pottery now has a black or red wash, which is apt to be of better quality, more stable and less flaky, and also more lustrous, than the washes in the earlier levels. But there is still a certain amount of fine buff ware with a buff or orange-buff burnished surface. Cooking pot ware Some of the cooking pot ware has a red wash, as is usual in EM II; but in general brown surfaces are now more dominant. Vasiliki ware 551-553 One scrap of a bowl rim 551 (N259) (FIG- 7-15' plate 26; D. 15) is of true Vasiliki ware. Scrap 552 (N356), apparently of Vasiliki ware, comes from a cup or goblet, and a similar fragment 553 (N361) from a larger open vessel or bowl. Light grey ware 554 A scrap of rim 554 (N354) (fig. 7.15; D. 18) is of this fabric, and stroke burnished.25 TYPES type ia. cup with large loop handle One long handle of round section may come from a cup of this characteristic EM II type. It is of fine orange clay, with a red wash inside and out. 24 Rows of dots flanked by lines occur in light-on-dark in the repertory of East Cretan EM III. These rows may be straight or curving, and some of the straight examples are diagonal like 549 (e.g. Zois 1967A, pis. 12: 32; 13: 47; 17: 6, 8; x9: 31}. The motif is usually single; a double version, however, reminiscent of 549 but curving, appears on the lower part of a teapot from Vasiliki: Seager 1907, 121-2, 129, fig. 13 (= PM I, 109, fig. 76 top left).

Fine orange clay with between bands. well smoothed or burnished buff surface, including under TYPES 2 AND 3. FOOTED GOBLETS AND GOBLETS 556-571 There are about 15 eggcup feet of goblets of type 2 as opposed to about 13 simple goblet bases of type 3. Goblets of type 3 would therefore seem to be nearly as common as footed goblets of type 2. This clearly links this deposit with B3 rather than the EM II phase(s) in which simple goblets of type 3 appear extremely rare. (a) Eggcup feet of type 2 Examples include 556-559 (N190-3) (fig. 7.15): about 15 exist (D. base 4.5-5.5). Nearly all have a wash (five black, eight or nine red or light brown) outside, and in all bar two of these the wash also covers the inside of the bowl of the goblet. In no case, however, does the wash extend to cover the underneath of the foot; but four feet have a band of paint round the edge of the underneath (e.g. 558: N192), and 559 (N193) (plate 31) has a large solid spot in the centre of the underside. One 556 (N190) of the two feet with a wash outside but with a plain (without a wash) inside to its bowl, may be an EM II stray. It is exceptionally high; the plain inside surface is burnished. (b) Simple bases of type 3 About 13 exist, including one complete profile (D. base c. 4.5-5). All have an overall wash (six black, seven red) covering the whole of the inside as well as the outside and continuing underneath the base. Rims of goblets of this type are normally indistinguishable from those of type 2. 560 (N200) FIG. 7.15, plate 32. Frags, of rim and base. with groups of vertical stripes. There are frags, of another D. 8. D. base 4.6-4.7. Fine orange clay, with dark red wash similar (plate 32: 561). inside, dark brown to black outside. Decoration in white Goblet rims of types 2 and 3 About 65 exist (D. 7-10, but mostly between 8 and 9.5). One or two are somewhat S-shaped, as 562 (N199) (fig. 7.15; D. 8). About five rims were evidently made with their tops deliberately flat, e.g. 563 (N195); but 564 (N194) (plate 32) appears to have been cut flat at some later stage, presumably after the rim had been chipped in use. The outside surfaces of many of the rims show clear traces of having been wiped or scraped. Only rim 565 (N196) is light surfaced, of orange clay with a thin red stripe round the top; it may be a stray from an EM II horizon. All the other rims have an outside wash (41 black, 23 red), and in all except two of these the wash covers the inside of the bowl as well; but even these two exceptions have a band of red or black wash round the inside edge of the rim. 566 (N 197) (fig. 7.15, plate 32; D. 7) has a black wash, and decoration in white consisting of a row of solid triangles set between groups of horizontal stripes. Rows of solid triangles are already attested as a motif of decoration in dark-on-light in EM IIA.26 The motif seems to be rare in the light-on-dark of East Cretan EM III, but occurs as a fill ornament on a fragment from Gournia.27 One or two rims have a narrow white band round the outside, but 19 have a band (10 black, nine red) below the rim (e.g. plate 32: 567). 568 (N198) with a black wash as a white stripe on top of the rim and three narrow horizontal bands below it. A black washed fragment 569 (N207) from a goblet body has a pair of horizontal stripes and a diagonal band beneath them (plate 32). Several rims, some 10 to 12, bear traces of such diagonals, either single broad bands (plate 32: 570), or groups of two or even three narrow stripes. The remarkable rim 571 (N350) (fig. 7.15, plate 32; D. 7), apparently from a goblet, has groups of thin diagonal stripes in white flanking a zone of barbotine scales in relief (see p. 174 below). 26 E.g.

SHALLOW BOWLS OR PLATES WITH RIM THICKENED internally 572-573 (a) Rounded rims Only three scraps of rounded rims were found. All are of fine buff ware, with an orange or buff surface and a characteristic red band round the inside. 572 (N242) appears to have solid semi-circles on top of the rim. (b) Bevelled rims Five of these include the flaring rim 573 (N241) (fig. 7.15; D. 21). All are of fine buff ware, with an orange or buff surface and a band round the inside of the rim in red or dark red-brown. TYPE 5. BOWL WITH UPRIGHT SIDE AND RIM thickened INTERNALLY 574 Only rim 574 (N240) (fig. 7.15, plate 32; D. 15) is assignable to this type. Of fine buff ware, it has decoration in red of a pair of narrow red bands outside, and one below the rim inside; on the rim itself crossing diagonals form a thick lattice. The comparatively few rims of types 4 and 5 may be EM II strays but, if they are contemporary with the deposit, they would reflect its position as intermediary between EM IIB and EM III as defined in B3. TYPE 6. DEEP BOWLS WITH UPRIGHT SIDES 575~577 Three straight upright rims of small bowls or bowl-jars with fine burnished surfaces are grouped here. 575-576 have the top of the rim hollowed as if to form a rest for a lid, and 576 preserves the stump of what may be a horizontal side-handle. 577 has a large wart set below the rim. 575 (N251) FIG. 7.15.

SHALLOW BOWL WITH straight OR INWARD CURVING SIDE 578 Five or six rims of fine buff ware (D. between c. 15 and 20) are assignable to this type. All are scraped outside and decorated with a wide band in red or black round the inside of the rim. Rim 578 (N289) with bevelled edge in cooking pot ware appears to come from a large bowl of this shape. TYPES 8/9. BOWLS WITH flaring OR EVERTED RIM 579~594 Bowls of this kind are evidently common. About 65 rims are assignable to these types, including 579-586 (N254-61) (fig. 7.15: 579-580, D. 26; 581, D. 40; 582, D. 27; 583, D. 30; 586, D. 20). Some 45 of these (over 3/4 of the total) apparently come from deep bowls of class A, and about 20 (less than 1 /4) from shallow bowls of class B. Rim diameters range between 12 and 36, mostly between 20 and 30. These rims appear to be in general thicker, and the bowls to which they belong are evidently of heavier fabric, than their equivalents in EM II. There is great variety in the profiles of rims. Several are markedly turned down, as 579. This feature is also noticeable on rims of the equivalent bowls from EM II levels, and may have been deliberate.28 One or two rims have a bead on the outside edge as 587 (N246) (fig. 7.15; D. 35). Two rather small round section horizontal handles may come from bowls of this kind. In contrast, the equivalent bowls from B3 appear to be handleless. Fabric The firing tends to be good and, in spite of the comparatively thick walls of the bowls, the clay is apt to be an even colour throughout. Rim 588 (N245) (fig. 7.15; D. 20), assignable to this type, is of cooking pot ware with a red-brown wash. Over 1/2 of the rims (35) have an inside wash (13 black, 22 red); and nearly all of these have an outside wash as well. Only three or four (about one in 10) are 28 Cf. 968 (B2), and Tylissos: Hazzidakis 1934, 82, pi. 20.3b.</page><page sequence="181">KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN Fig. 7.15.

THE EARLY MINOAN II —III DEPOSITS 171 the short everted rim of a bowl of standard Vasiliki ware 551 from the same deposit, suggest that they are from bowls of local make: the resemblance of the fabric to Vasiliki ware may be fortuitous, or the bowls may be local imitations of that ware, rather than late and degenerate examples of it imported from eastern Crete. On the other hand it is noteworthy that all except one of these seven or eight rims evidently come from class B deep rather than the more common class A shallow bowls. One exceptional short everted rim of a deep bowl 590 placed here has a small solid triangular lug projecting horizontally from it. Its fabric is akin to the soft red burnished ware of MM II, and it may be a later stray: the clay is soft, under-fired and dusky at the core; the inside surface is buff, burnished; the outside has a burnished red wash. Decoration Of the nine rims (apart from 590) that are plain inside, six are from class A shallow bowls, three from class B deep bowls. The rims from the deep bowls have a band (one black, two red) on the inside continuing on top of the rim, which is painted solid; on the two rims decorated in red, the outside is well stroke burnished. Four of the six shallow rims belong to bowls of somewhat small size with diameters between 12 and 20. These, and one other rim from a shallow bowl, have a top painted solid. Finally, the rim of a shallow bowl 591 (plate 30; N262) is irregular, like some of the rims from the EM IIB A4 deposit; it has a buff surface and is decorated with bands in black below the rim inside and outside, and on top of the rim with a pair of diagonal stripes. A diagonal stripe in dark red-brown appears on top of rim 592 (N243), which comes from an exceptional bowl; it has a wash over the rest of the inside, but the area of the rim is reserved. Diagonal bands in white are found on several of the bowl rims that have an inside wash; usually these white bands are single, but once at least, on the rim of cooking pot ware 593 (N245), they are double. These diagonals on the rim continue the EM II tradition: diagonals are virtually absent (there is only one possible instance) from the rims of the equivalent bowls in B3. One rim with a wash 594 (plate 30; N244) has what appears to be part of a solid semi-circle in white on top of it; semi-circles in dark-on-light may have adorned the top of bowl rim 572 of type 4 (see above). These rims with decoration in white (and a few other rims with an overall wash but no decoration) have traces of white bands below the rim inside; and there are white bands round the insides of two or three bases which evidently come from such bowls. Only one or two of the rims with a wash outside as well as inside have possible traces of white bands below the rim outside. But indications of horizontal bands or stripes in pairs appear on the outsides of three fragments from the walls of such bowls. type 10. large bowls with straight sides and thick everted rims 595-597 Six rims of various sizes are assignable to this type. Of the coarse gritty fabric that appears to have been usual for such bowls, they have a buff slip inside, or on both the inside and outside. Two rims appear to be from bowls with a red wash inside, e.g. 595. All these rims are painted solid inside and outside and along the top. 595 (N249) fig. 7.15. D. 40.

TYPE 14. BAKING PLATE 602 The only baking plate rim 602 (N296) (plate 30) is of rounded profile with a dark brown wash. TYPE 15. JUGS WITH CUTAWAY SPOUTS 603-606 There are fragments of seven or eight spouts from jugs, many of them with remains of a wash and one or two of these with traces of decoration of stripes or bands in white. This prominence of washed jugs with decoration in light-on-dark in A5 contrasts with the apparent popularity of jugs of fine buff ware with a burnished surface and decoration in dark-on-light in B3. Jug fragments with a light surface from A5 include two bits of spouts: one is of orange clay with a greenish slip, decorated in red-brown with triple chevrons in the characteristic EM II style (plate 32: 603). Another fragment, which may come from the neck of a jug, is of fine buff ware, with orange clay with a buff surface, vertically pared and afterwards well smoothed or burnished, and decorated in black with a group of stripes and a large solid spot below (plate 32: 604) (N347). A scrap, apparently from the body of a jug, has lattice in red (plate 31: 605). Fragment 606 (plate 32) with the stump of a handle appears to come from the body of a jug; it is of fine buff ware, the clay orange with a worn black wash outside; the lower part of the body below the handle is decorated with incisions. Similar incised decoration occurs on one or two fragments of jugs from B3. Only three handles of jugs are preserved to the rim: two are set to the rim like the jug handles in the Palace Well, one to below the rim. TYPE 16. SMALL SPOUTED BOWL-JARS 607-617 The rims assignable to these seem to correspond to rims from EM II levels rather than to those from B3. Of 18 rims, five (over 1/4) are of the characteristic EM II class b2, while another five are flat topped as class C4. Two rims, one of class a, the other of class C4, are associated with the stumps of spouts. All except three of the 18 rims evidently come from vessels with an outside wash, most commonly black, but sometimes red. The three remaining rims are of fine buff ware with light surfaces; of these 609-610, both EM II class b2, belong to vessels with a very fine burnish but evidently with no painted decoration. Carinations are much in evidence. All the nine carinated fragments, coming from small jars of this type or perhaps jugs of type 15, have an outside wash (seven black, two reddish).</page><page sequence="184">AREA A.

LARGE SPOUTED BOWLS OR JARS WITH HORIZONTAL SIDE-HANDLES 618-620 There are about a dozen rims of jars of this type, the majority being of cooking pot ware, but one or two of coarse ware as 618. One rim of cooking pot ware has a tubular spout of class b; two others have warts. Several of the rims of cooking pot ware have their tops flattened or bevelled on the inside like 620. 618 (N335) fig. 7.16. D. 22. Class bi. Rather coarse gritty clay, dusky at core.

SPOUTS The only spout recovered is a large example of class b belonging to ajar of type 17. HANDLES 624 Handles are normally of more or less round section, but there are six thick strap handles (e.g. plate 32: 624) ranging in size from medium to small: all are of thick rectangular section, one or two more or less concave. BASES Bases are in general flat. A fragment of a fairly large pellet foot may be an earlier stray: it is of fine orange clay, dusky at the core, with a well smoothed buff slip, and has a red stripe round the base of the foot.</page><page sequence="185">174 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN DECORATION Paint Dark-on-light Thin stripes appear on one or two scraps, which may be earlier strays. There is lattice in red on 605 (plate 31), apparently from the body of a jug. Large spots occur twice: on fragment 604 (N347) (plate 32), probably a jug neck, and on what may be a cup base 555 (fig. 7.15, plate 32). Solid semi-circles appear to have adorned bowl rims in two instances, in dark-on-light on 572 (N242), and light-on-dark on 594 (N244). Light-on-dark Stripes and bands occur singly or in groups; they are often and characteristically diagonal, especially on the bodies of small jars of type 16. One scrap, perhaps from a cup, has lattice in white. Diagonals may cross to form a bold lattice, as on 624. Incision 625-626 Incision is rare, but occurs on jug fragment 606 (plate 32) and on ajar fragment in fine cooking pot ware with a red to light brown surface 625 (plate 32). A fragment of fine cooking pot ware, flat and perhaps from a lid of some kind, has boldly grooved chevrons 626 (N349) (plate 32). Similar bold incised chevrons seem to have adorned the base of jug neck 994 (B2). Relief Warts occur, notably on the shoulders of large spouted jars of type 17. Barbotine 627-629 Sophisticated barbotine in such an early horizon is surprising; but the isolated example 629 of fine 'barnacle work' barbotine is paralleled by 1102 (plate 46) from B3; and a couple of goblets with decoration of this type were found in the UEW.29 The three fragments with fish scales in relief 571 (which has been introduced above) and 627-628 are of great interest. As already noted (p. 130), Foster has suggested30 that 'barnacle work' barbotine might have developed from relief work of this kind, and fish scales like those of our examples appear on vessels from levels at Beycesultan assigned to EB I, which overlaps with Troy I. 571 (N350) fig. 7.15, plate 32.

This small group of material, from above the latest of the series of early floors beneath Floors II and I of LM IA and IB, seems to correspond in a general way to our B3 deposit. There is no hint of polychrome decoration to suggest MM IA. Two scraps of wheelmade cups or bowls are evidently strays from LM I levels above. TYPES TYPE 2. FOOTED GOBLETS 632-633 Only seven eggcup feet from goblets of this type were found, ranging in diameter from 4.5 to 5.5. They have an outside wash (one red, six black) which for all bar one covers the inside of the bowl as well; but in no case is there any sign of a wash under the foot. Foot 632 (N185) is decorated with a broad white band immediately above the waist, but not round it as was common in EM II. The end of a wide diagonal band in white appears on the body of a goblet attached to foot 633 (N186). TYPE 3. GOBLETS 634-638 One complete profile 634 and seven bases were found, the bases ranging in diameter from 3.5 to 4.5. All are of fine ware except one of cooking pot ware. All except one have a wash (three black, four red) inside and outside, and continuing under the base. One has a wash only on the outside. 634 (LA/61/P17) FIG. 7.17, plate 33. 1/2 pres. Ht c.

These rims are rather thick in comparison with those from EM II deposits and from A5. 635 (N187) (fig. 7.17; D. g) was apparently made with a flat top: it has a wash, red inside and light brown outside, with a narrow white band to the rim. Two other rims were deliberately cut flat, doubtless after the original rim had become chipped in use, e.g. 636 (N367) (plate 32). All these rims have an outside wash (18 black, 11 red) and all except one a wash inside as well. The exception 637 (N188) shows a narrow band of wash round the inside of the rim, while the rest of the inside has a buff slip, well smoothed. Decoration in white includes a band round the outside of the rim or below it; a band below the rim is sometimes combined with a thin stripe on its top edge. Two instances were noted of white diagonal bands on the body of a goblet, e.g. 638 (N 189). TYPE 4.

It is somewhat reminiscent of Vasiliki ware both in shape and fabric, and may then be an import from eastern Crete, although the scheme of decoration does not exactly correspond to anything illustrated by Betancourt32 and can be paralleled in EM IIB deposits at Knossos — e.g. 512 (A3) and 911 (Bi). 640 (N369) fig. 7.17, plate 32.

BOWLS WITH FLARING OR EVERTED RIM 641-644 Large bowls of this type seem to be common and characteristic, as in B3. Some 10 rims were found (D. c. 20-30): about four of these are apparently from sub-type B (deep), and six from sub-type (A) shallow, bowls. One or two rims are (a) differentiated; most are (b) slightly differentiated, a few (c) undifferentiated. Only three or four of the rims have a wash, usually black, inside and outside; two of these bear decoration in white. Rim 644, of true soft sandy ware, may have had a red wash. The other six rims are light surfaced, of orange clay with a buff slip, 641 with fine stroke burnishing inside and outside.

A7.1: level LA54; A7.2: level LA51. These two small groups of pottery excavated in 1960 came from the middle of the sounding that was made in depth in 1961. Some later intrusions were found in both groups; but the material is basically EM III in character, and may have been associated with Floor III of that date. Several large pieces of vessels from the smaller group 2 (level LA51) are reminiscent of debris above a floor. An admixture of EM IIB material in the larger group A7.1 (level LA54, stratified below LA51) suggests that it cut down into the deposit of Floor V. A7.1: level LA 54. Amount about 1 1/4 tables. Well over 1/2 the fragments of pottery of all kinds, including coarse and cooking pot ware, has an overall wash, more commonly a shade of black than of red by about 3:2.

ROYAL ROAD: NORTH. THE EARLY MINOAN II —III DEPOSITS 179 has traces of decoration in light-on-dark, but none of it has designs in red combined with white in the manner of MM IA. A certain number of fragments appear to come from earlier (EM IIB) vessels. These include about seven rims from bowls of various types (including five of type 4) with decoration in dark-on-light, mostly in red, but in two cases in black. A fragment of a base with part of a red cross underneath may come from an EM II bowl of type 4. A solitary piece from a jug or jar has a dark wash mottled in the manner of Vasiliki ware, but the surface has not been smoothed or burnished in the classic Vasiliki manner. One or two fragments appear to be intrusions from the LM I deposits immediately above the sounding here. These include two small strap handles, and the everted rim of a handleless cup of one of the types standard in LM I at Knossos, of plain orange clay with a paler surface. TYPES TYPE 2. FOOTED GOBLET 660 Some 15 fragments of feet come from the deposit, but over 1/2 are scraps. Diameters seem to range between 4.8 and 5.3. The feet are clearly not as high as those from EM II deposits. One foot has an upturned edge like fig. 8.9: 3, suggesting it is of EM III date. All but three of the feet (1/5 of the total) have an outside wash, and this (as far as it is possible to judge) covered the inside of the goblet bowl as well; but the feet are either plain underneath, or have a ring painted round the outer edge. Two or three feet are plain outside as well as underneath, apart from a red band round the waist as commonly found in EM II. 660 (N463; plate 33) from the body of a footed goblet has a red-brown to red wash and is decorated with a torsional design in white. type 3. goblet 661 Simple goblets without feet also occur: a virtually complete example is 661; there are also two profiles and 21 base fragments. All bar three of these pieces have an outside wash: black for one profile and 10 other fragments, red on 661, the other complete profile and eight base fragments. The wash normally appears to cover the underneath of the base, but on 661 and in two other cases the base is plain or has only a slight ring of paint round the outer edge. In most cases, but not on 661 which is unusual in this respect, the wash extends over all the inside as well as the outside of the goblet. Three fragments of bases are plain. 661 (N472) FIG. 7.18, plate 33. Complete except for inside rim, but not over whole of underneath of base, part of rim. Ht 7.4. D. 7.8. Hole in base made after firing, Decoration in white: band below rim, and apparent stripe perhaps to use goblet in libations. Outside wiped and on top of rim. coated with red to red-brown wash, continuing deep TYPES 2 AND 3. FOOTED GOBLETS AND GOBLETS 662-667 Some go rims are assignable to one or other of these types. 662 is exceptional in having a flat top; and another was deliberately ground down to a flat top, perhaps after being chipped during use. All except three rims have an outside wash: two of these exceptions (including 664) may be EM II strays, but the third, with a plain surface, may belong with one of the plain type 3 goblet bases noted above. Black washes are commoner than red by 2:1 (some 58 rims black outside, 30 red). The wash normally seems to cover the inside of the rim as well, but in some two or three instances it only continues for a short distance into the inside of the rim. The rims with a wash are mostly scraps often with worn surfaces, but several retain traces of simple decoration in white, as on fig. 7.19. More elaborate decoration as 662 and 663 seems rare. 66a (N465) plate 33. Flat-topped rim. Dark red-brown wash. Broad diagonal band in white on outside. 663 (N466) fig. 7.18. D. c. 8. Red-brown wash.

BOWLS WITH FLARING OR EVERTED RIM 669-672 Such bowls are evidently characteristic of EM III. Of about 18 rims, two or three belong to large bowls. The insides of all except three (about five in six) have a wash in shades of red, red-brown, or black. Traces of a white band were noted on the inside just below the rim in four or five instances. On 669 and 671 this is associated with a diagonal band of hatching along the top of the rim. The other three rims are plain, except for their tops which are painted solid; the paint sometimes continues as a band below the rim inside and round its outside edge. 669 (N469) fig. 7.18, plate 33. D. 18. Dark red-brown wash. Decoration in white: band below rim inside, and hatching along top of rim. 670 (N470) FIG. 7.18. D. 25. Orange clay. Red to dark red-brown lustrous wash.

Orange clay; surface orange-buff, scraped and then burnished outside, wiped and smoothed inside. Rim painted solid in red to red-brown. Several fragments of flat bases evidently come from bowls of these types. They have a wash inside and outside, and a broad white band around the inside. JUGS Only one or two scraps that might come from jug spouts were noted. jars 673-680 (1) Some four rims of a simple type like 673 may belong to EM II vessels. 673 (N473) fig. 7.18. D. 12. Stump of vertical handle to rim. Black wash outside continuing as band on inside of rim. 674 (N474) plate 33. Scrap with circular hollow-topped wart below rim. Dark red-brown wash. 675 (N475) plate 33. Scrap with oval wart just below rim. Orange clay with paler surface. Vertical stripes in red outside. (2) The incurving and thickened rim 676 may also be of EM II date. 676 (N476) fig. 7.18. D. 15. Purple red-brown wash. (3) Flat-topped rims (fig. 7.18) as 677 (N477) (D. 10) and 678 (N478) (D. 6) appear characteristic of EM III. Such rims may have been inspired by prototypes in metal. Six rims of this kind come from the deposit. All are from comparatively narrow-mouthed vessels, and have a wash (mostly black, but once at least red) outside and continuing on top of the rim and round its inside. Decoration in white seems to have been usual on the jars from which these rims come: a band around the neck, and hatching, either straight or diagonal, on top of the rim. (4) The scrap of rim 679 (N47g) (fig. 7.18) (D. c. 12) is probably from a collar-necked jar of type 19, of orange-buff clay with fine grit, with a black band to the rim inside and out. (5) Four rims like 680 come from large jars, probably with tubular spouts (as 680) and side-handles. All have a dark brown or dark reddish brown wash. 680 (N480) plate 34. With spout. D. c. 20?

Two small strap handles may</page><page sequence="193">knossos excavations 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN be later intrusions: one is of rather sandy orange clay with a paler surface; the other to the rim of a cup, perhaps of the Vapheio type, is of fine orange clay with a worn red wash. carinations Two fragments with a black wash and traces of decoration in white outside appear to come from the carinated bellies of closed vessels (jugs or jars). BASES Bases are in general flat. When the outside of a vessel has a wash this seems often, but not always, to continue over the underneath of the base. DECORATION Paint 683-685 Dark-on-light Several scraps have decoration in shades of red, red-brown, dark brown and black. Some of these may be EM II strays; they include the fragment of a bowl base 683 (plate 33) of orange clay, with well smoothed or burnished surfaces and part of a red cross underneath. Trickle ornament appears on two or three pieces of large jars or pithoi, like 684 (N486) (plate 34) of hard orange clay with grit, its surface a paler shade of orange with black trickle outside. Light-on-dark This seems to be the most common form of decoration, with simple linear designs including groups of parallel stripes and bands and chevrons. The parallel stripes may be diagonal as on 685 (plate 33). The diagonal stripes which appear to be flanking a row of dots on 663 are exceptional. COOKING POT WARE 686-688 Only scraps of cooking pot ware were recovered. The dominant type appears to be a large deep bowl or open-mouthed jar with a thickened and carinated rim. The six rims assignable to such vessels are of coarse cooking pot ware with the surfaces shades of light or dark brown and red, such as 686 (N483) (fig. 7.18) and 687 (N484). A number of side-handles of round section may come from the same vessels. The one rim of a baking plate (type 14) 688 (N 485) (fig. 7.18) is of fine reddish brown cooking pot ware and resembles EM II examples; it may be a stray of that period. A7.2: level LA51.

The fragments of 692 and another rim have a plain surface with decoration in dark-on-light; 693 and the remaining four rims have a wash with decoration in white. 692 (N4go) fig. 7.18, plate 34. Shallow bowl with flaring rim. D. 23. Several frags, include two from base. Rather coarse grey clay with grit; grey to light grey-brown surface, not smoothed or burnished.

JARS 694-696 Four out of six rims grouped here appear to be from large wide-mouthed jars with side-handles. 695 with a slight bead of metallic inspiration may be a later, MM II—III intrusion. This and another rim have a wash. The other two rims of large wide-mouthed jars including 694 are decorated in dark-on light; and 694 has a wart. The remaining two rims are like 696 with smaller diameters. 694 (N492) fig. 7.18, plate 34. D.15. Circular wart below rim. Rather coarse orange clay with grit; paler surface.

COOKING POT WARE 697-698 Rims (fig. 7.18) from large bowls or jars 697 (N4g5) and 698 (N496) (D. 40) are of cooking pot ware with red-brown surfaces. 697 is a characteristic EM III shape: cf. 1092 (fig. 8.13). Two fragments of round section handles were also noted. There are two pieces of tripod feet, one evidently oval, one thin oval in section. (Number 699 was not used.) Deposit A8: Sounding between walls ay and ar| (EM II) Level LA94. Amount about 1 1/4 tables. Deposit A8 comes from the lowest levels reached in the space between the later walls ay and ar| to the south of the main EM sounding in RRN (fig. 4.1). The latest material from the deposit seems to be assignable to a relatively early phase of EM II, but one later than deposit Ai (Floor VII). The fragmentary character of the pottery suits the idea of a fill that may have included some earlier pieces, which could explain the high proportion of dark grey, red and brown burnished wares. Dark grey</page><page sequence="195">184 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN burnished ware is more abundant than it was in A2 (Floor VI) by about 5:1, and both red and brown burnished ware are similarly about five times better represented in A8 than in A2. At the same time the red and light brown burnished wares are more reminiscent of what was found above A2 than of what was above A4 (Floor V). We see A8 as coming in the ceramic sequence between Ai and A2, and probably to be assigned to EM IIA late. FABRIC A fair amount, as much perhaps as 1/5 of the standard fine ware, appears to have a wash, sometimes red, but more commonly (2:1) black or dark in colour. Light grey ware One fragment seems assignable to this fabric. It is from the lower part of a goblet bowl where it joined the foot. The clay is fine, light grey throughout; the surface is worn. Dark grey burnished wares About 40 fragments were found, a proportion of 5:1 when compared to A2. They include rims assignable to types 2 or 3 (701), 5 (702-706) and 9 (707). One or possibly two fragments (708, 710) appear to be from lids. One scrap from a bowl has a string-hole made before firing. Red and light brown burnished wares These shade into each other. Of 23 fragments assignable to these wares, about 18 have reddish, the other five light brown burnished surfaces. This represents about five times as much (in relation to the total amount of material) as from A2. Rims are assignable to types 2 or 3 (711), 4 (712-714) and 9 (716-718). Vasiliki ware Some four or five fragments of this distinctive ware were recognised, two of these certainly from jugs or jars. One, apparently from a bowl base, has a burnished surface. The washed surface of another had been well smoothed. The fabric does not obviously suggest that any of the fragments belong to imports, and the vessels may therefore be of local make. One scrap of rim 700 looks as if it may be wheelmade. It could have strayed from a later level, unless it comes from a vessel imported from some part of the Near East where the fast wheel was already in use, such as the wheelmade vessel of Syrian origin from a Troy I deposit.34 700 (N462) fig. 7.20. Rim of cup or small bowl. D. 13. Thin-walled. Possibly wheelmade. Fine orange clay. Traces of dark brown to black lustrous wash. Cooking pot ware This is clearly differentiated from the ordinary run of fine and coarse wares. A surprisingly large proportion, about 1 Aj. of the total number of fragments from the deposit, appears to be of cooking pot ware. Surfaces are in general shades of light brown and red; but some black surfaces are evidently due to the application of a wash, and not merely to use over a fire. In several cases the surfaces are wiped or scraped; sometimes they are burnished (e.g. on plates like 764), but this appears exceptional. In view of the large amount of cooking pot ware, it is described and illustrated separately after the rest of the material.

Three of them are light surfaced with a red band round the top on the outside where they once joined the bowl. Two have a dark wash including underneath, while the remaining scrap has an outside wash only, and just a thin band round the edge of the foot underneath. TYPES 2 AND 3. FOOTED GOBLETS AND GOBLETS Of around 16 fragments of rim assignable to one or other of these types, some 10 have a wash, mostly in shades of light brown or reddish, but occasionally darker and approximating to black, and once or twice mottling after the manner of Vasiliki ware.

JUGS 74X Fragments of jugs are not much in evidence, but five rims with attachments for a handle appear to come from them; in two cases the handle is set to the rim, in the other three below it. Two of the fragments with the handle below the rim have a black wash; the other three fragments (including both of those with handles set to the rim) have remains of decoration in dark-on-light. The handles are round section, except for the large handle 741 (N437) (plate 35) set to the rim: this has a thick oval section and is surmounted by a wart. A fragment, apparently from the side of the neck of a large jug, with a red-brown wash also seems to have remains of a wart. There is a small oval wart on a similar fragment with a smoothed black wash and traces of decoration in white. One fragment of a jug neck is akin to fine cooking pot ware in fabric, but has a well burnished light brown slip outside.

SPOUTS An open trough spout with a red-brown wash appears to be from a bowl. HANDLES 748 These are in general round in section; but 741 (plate 35) from a large jug is thick oval. One scrap of a small strap handle, evidently from a cup with a red wash, looks MM in fabric and may be intrusive. The unusual 748 seems to be EM II and is therefore included here, although it comes from level LA93 above. 748 (N487) plate 35. Frag., round section, with double or triple relief band round one end. Fine orange clay with paler surface.</page><page sequence="199">i88 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN Another handle with relief bands 878 was found in Bi (p. 198), and others that appear assignable to EM II in the SMK include one with a group of three relief bands like 748 that has been identified as an import from southern Crete;35 one similar from Phaistos is evidently from a deposit of EM II.36 All these handles probably come from jugs like those with applied relief bands (whether single or in groups of two or three) from the WCH and Fournou Korifi I, of EM IIA date.37 But more examples of such handles seem to have been recorded from Knossos than from any other part of Crete, while similar handles appear to be attested at Knossos in later deposits. Thus a handle, apparently from a jug, in a LM I deposit in the excavations by Hogarth's Houses on Gypsades, has a pair of applied bands above a metal-imitating rivet.38 In this case the applied bands are round the base of the handle, while on the EM examples the band or bands often at any rate appear to be applied to the top end. The bands in these instances seem to reflect imitations of cord wound round a handle to strengthen it; but some of the applied strips on handles from Fournou Korifi clearly have other derivations.39 BASES 749-750 These are in general flat. 749 (plate 35) from a closed vessel, probably a jug, has a lug (pellet) foot of the type common in EM II, of fine orange clay, buff to the outside and decorated in red. Two other base fragments, both apparently from closed vessels, may have traces of red crosses underneath. On vessels with a dark wash, the underneath of the base is sometimes coated too, but it is often left plain. A strainer base fragment 750 (N461) is of coarse cooking pot type ware with a red-brown wash outside, which is smoothed (plate 36). DECORATION Paint 751-756 Dark-on-light This is by far the most common form of decoration. Simple geometrical patterns are the rule and include wide bands, groups of parallel stripes, and latticed triangles (on the bodies of jugs). The small rim 751 (N438) (fig. 7.21, PLATE 35) from a bowl or open jar, of orange clay with a buff surface well burnished inside and out, is decorated with a diagonal chequer pattern in dark red-brown. Two other fragments on plate 35 appear to be from the shoulders of jugs: 752 has a buff surface and decoration in dark brown; 753 is of orange clay with a greenish slip and decoration in dark brown to black. Three more fragments on plate 35 may also be from jugs: the surface of 754 is orange with decoration in red; 755 and 756 have buff surfaces decorated in red-brown and dark red. Light-on-dark Only three or four fragments have traces of decoration in white paint on a dark wash. Pattern burnish 757 Pattern burnish is extremely rare. One or two scraps of dark grey burnished ware have traces of simple pattern burnish consisting of parallel stripes; these may be EM I strays. Fragment 757 (N441), apparently from the base of a bowl (perhaps of type 9), seems EM II; it has a red wash with groups of thin parallel strokes in pattern burnish. types in cooking pot ware 758-759 RIMS OF LARGE BOWLS LIKE TYPE 9 758 (N443) FIG. 7.21.

Amount: about 1 table. Bi is the deposit from the lowest levels assignable to Early Minoan II in Area B (the Early Houses to the s of the Palace) and includes pottery from pit B, the foundation trench for wall 8 in trenches A and B. The deposit was superimposed on, and/or cut into, Neolithic occupation debris, and some stray Neolithic sherds were incorporated with the pottery in the deposit. This deposit may be contemporary with the complete vessels that Evans and Mackenzie found in 1908, which look as if they were a floor deposit (see pp. 81, g3, 266-74). B l appears to belong to the same early stage of EM IIB as A2 in RRN, although they may not be exactly contemporary. If there is a difference in date, it looks as if A2 may be a shade earlier than B1. B1 has no dark grey burnished ware, just one worn scrap of light grey ware, and only five fragments of the red or light brown burnished ware that is still conspicuous in A2. FABRIC This is in general as in A2 (see p. 143). The vessels in fine ware mosdy have light surfaces, usually or invariably with a slip, which may be smoothed or occasionally burnished. There are also some fine ware vessels with a dark wash. Light grey ware One, much worn, scrap is assignable to this rare fabric: cf. B2. Red and light brown burnished wares Just five fragments are assignable to these wares. Two, including part of a flat base, come from small jugs, or from jars, perhaps suspension pots. Two of light brown burnished ware may belong to similar vessels: one of light grey clay, the inside surface light grey, outside light red-brown with a very fine burnish; the other a base with a light brown wash inside and outside, but burnished only outside. One bowl base has a very fine stroke burnished surface, red outside, black inside. Vasiliki ware 820-823 This is well represented. Of 16 fragments, nearly 1/2 (seven, including rim 822 and three typical ring bases as 823) come from closed vessels with no wash inside. The other nine fragments, including four rims and one base, have a wash inside as well as outside. The washed surface is usually well smoothed or burnished, which gives it a lustrous appearance and soapy feeling; but two fragments that seem to be of typical Vasiliki fabric have no signs of smoothing or burnishing over the wash. 820 (N93) fig. 8.1, plate 40: inside.

Only five feet (about 1/3 of the total) are of fine buff ware, contrasting with about 2/3 of the similar feet in A2; 825 (Ngo) (fig. 8.1) has a mark in red paint underneath, and all have red bands round the waist, as FIG. 5.4: 2.

THE EARLY HOUSES: THE EARLY MINOAN II —III DEPOSITS 195 Among 52 rims of goblets there is the same proportion of about 2/3 (35) with an overall wash as against 1/3 with a light surface. Some five rims (four with a wash) are flat-topped. On 826-834 on plate 38, the wash is black on 826, red on 828, and red-brown on 827, 830 and 833.1 There is great variety in the decoration of these rims, whether in dark-on-light or light-on-dark. We find bands and stripes, horizontal and sometimes vertical, multiple chevrons, single or double loops hanging from the rims, and once a large spot in light-on-dark set below the rim (828). Once diagonal zones of lattice appear in dark-on-light (829). Rim 831 with triple chevrons below it has an exact, if unprovenanced, parallel from Knossos.2 A pair of vertical stripes flanked by diagonals in light-on-dark gives a tree-like effect on 830.3 824 (PEM/60/P30) FIG. 8.1, PLATES 38, 59.

All are of fine buff ware; with orange clay (once, 836, with a greenish tinge), with a paler well smoothed or burnished surface inside, but outside less carefully finished, and sometimes markedly scraped, e.g. 835. Decoration is normally in red, but in dark red-brown to black in four cases. All the rims have a wide band round the inside; and are decorated on top with broad opposed diagonals, except for the large rim 834 (N78; D. 22), which is painted solid and has a diagonal stripe descending from it across the inside of the bowl. The outsides are normally plain; but one scrap has a red band, and rims 837-838 have a thin red line round the outside edge. 835 (N81) fig. 8.1. Profile. D. 14.

Two bases of small bowls with upright sides of fine orange clay are well smoothed or burnished inside, and less well outside. One of them, which may belong with rim 846, is decorated with three stripes in dark brown to black on the outside. The other, which may belong with rim 845, has a band in dark brown to black inside, and crossing pairs of diagonals in dark red outside. TYPE 8. BOWLS WITH FLARING RIM 848-849 Only three rims, all of cooking pot ware, are assignable to this type. 848 (N124; fig. 8.1, plate 39; D. 40)4 is of fine cooking pot ware, with a red wash, well smoothed or burnished. Another rim is of similar fabric but smaller (D. c. 20); and 849 (N145) is a large rim of fabric akin to fine cooking pot ware with a red-brown slip, well burnished inside. TYPE 9. BOWLS WITH EVERTED RIM 850-858 There are about 14 rims, mostly it seems from bowls of the deep variety 9B. Out of five rims well enough preserved to judge, two are light surfaced, while three have a dark wash. On two of these it is on both sides, and on one only on the inside. A base that appears to come from a bowl of this type similarly has a red wash inside, while the outside is plain but decorated with three stripes in red to red-brown (plate 38: 850). A fragment with purple-brown wash from the side of a typical thin-walled bowl like 854-855 has a horizontal side-handle. Base fragments that may come from bowls of type 9 include several with a red or purple-brown wash and a white band round the inside (plate 38: 851). One from a very steep-sided bowl has a thin white band round the outside, and traces of a cross in white underneath. Another scrap 852 (N104) evidently comes from a base with an eight-armed cross design in white underneath. 853 (N103) from a large thick base with an orange-buff surface, stroke burnished on both sides, has a simple cross in dark red underneath.

This deposit includes the material from above Floors 3 and 2 in Area B, together with that from pit C, originally thought to be a hearth, at the ne corner of trench A. The whole deposit was sealed by the EM III floor 4. Most of the pottery from trench B probably belongs to this horizon, and was studied in connection with trench A. No pottery, however, from trench B has been included in the statistics and, where fragments from trench B are described or illustrated, this is indicated. Light grey ware There are two small scraps, one of them with a carination: cf. Bi. Dark grey burnished ware The only fragments are two stray rims of EM I chalices. Red and light brown burnished wares About seven fragments are assignable to these fabrics, including a goblet rim and the internally thickened rims of one large and one small bowl akin to type 4. All these may be earlier strays, belonging to late EM I or early EM II. But two bases of bowls of good fabric with a red or light brown wash, well stroke burnished both sides, appear contemporary with the deposit. One large internally thickened bowl rim is unique in having a black burnished surface: it may be an earlier stray. Vasiliki ware 913-920 Over 30 fragments were noted, more or less evenly distributed throughout the deposit.

One bowl rim has a clay rivet on top like 820 (Bi). Two bases, e.g. 918 (plate 40), evidently belong to bowls, but some eight or nine fragments of bases and five body fragments come from closed vessels. Jar rim 919 (N211; FIG. 8.4, plate 40)9 from level Bi, and therefore not well stratified, is included here; it has a bead somewhat like 822 (Bi) (fig. 8.1, PLATE 40). 920 (N196; fig. 8.4, plate 40) may be from the edge of a lid with a rib running round the side.10 types TYPES 2 AND 3. goblets 921-944 Just four or five bases of goblets of type 3 come from the higher levels (one from level A7, three from A6). The evidence from Area A also suggests that simple goblets of type 3 were extremely rare in EM II, although common in EM III. All these bases have a wash (red, dark red or black) both sides. One or two other scraps of bases, however, from levels A8 and A6, with only an outside wash, may also come from goblets of type 3. Eggcup feet from goblets of type 2: about 34 range in diameter from 4.2 to 5.7. Of these, seven (about 1/5) are of fine buff ware, the surfaces for the most part burnished, sometimes even on the underneath of the foot. The majority of these seven feet has a band in red (once in black) round the waist as fig. 5.4: 2. The remaining 27 eggcup feet (about 4/5 of the total) have a wash (12 red, 15 black), and most of these, some 20 or more, are decorated with a white hand round the waist as fig. 5.4: 4. In almost every case the wash appears to have covered all the inside of the goblet as well as the outside; there are only three examples where the inside is plain. In nine cases (1/3 of the total) the underneath of the foot is painted solid. In six others it has a ring of paint round the outer edge as fig. 5.5: 6, once combined with a pair of large spots 921 (N157; fig. 5.5: 5, plate 40). In one case a diagonal stripe in white has been added on top of the ring. Several other bases have similar marks on the underneath: in four cases a single short stroke, once in white on a dark wash, in the other three instances in dark (red or red-brown) on a light surface, as 922 (N156; plate 40). In one case two short strokes are combined to make a cross in red on the underneath of the 7 Cups of Vasiliki ware akin to our type 1B seem not uncommon: Betancourt 1979, 40: VI.A Ayia Triada 1 (35, fig. 10: i7)andPorti 1 (23, fig, 5: 2B; 35, fig. 10: 18), to which add Blackman and Branigan 1982, 34, fig. 13: 157. 8 Wilson and Day 1999, 3, 37, 39-40, 59-61: sample KN 92/ 176, fabric group 9 (Vasiliki ware, with fine metamorphic rock fragments), perhaps from a production centre in (north) central Crete. 9 Wilson and Day 1999, 3, 37, 39-40, 59-61: sample KN 92/ 175, fabric group 9, as 917. 10 For the rib, cf. 1208 in light grey ware, and SMK D.III.i 503 with red pattern burnish decoration, both of which are earlier than 920.</page><page sequence="214">AREA B.

A scrap of a high eggcup foot of anomalous fabric may be an earlier stray: it is of soft grey-brown to black clay, and worn; the outside, it seems, was once black burnished. An unique fragment 924 (N 159; fig. 8.4, plate 40) has a dark brown to black wash outside, dark purple red-brown inside. On the outside is part of a reserved diagonal zone decorated with irregular rows of jabbed incisions and flanked by white stripes. On the underneath, which is plain, is a pair of vague and perhaps fortuitous marks in very thin brown paint.11 Rims assignable to goblets of types 2 and 3: about x 19, of which about 1/4 (31) is of fine buff ware, while 3/4 (88) have a dark wash. The proportion of washed rims to those with a light surface rises significantly from about 1:2 in level A12 to 1:4 in levels A10, A8 and A7, and to 1:5 in level A6. Decoration is varied, and often quite elaborate, especially in white paint on the larger number of washed rims, plate 41 shows goblet rims with decoration in dark-on-light: on 926 in red, on 925 and 927 in red-brown, on 928-930 in black, on a buff or orange surface which has been smoothed or burnished, plate 41 also shows goblet rims with decoration in white on a dark wash, which shades from red 938 to light red-brown 931 through dark red-brown and purple-brown to black 942. Motifs of decoration on goblet rims include horizontal bands and stripes in different combinations; and groups of chevrons, both horizontal and vertical (plate 41: 930, 938-940). Pendent loops are much in evidence, mostly in the form of rows of small single loops hanging from the top of the rim; these occur both in dark-on-light and in light-on-dark (e.g. plate 41: 941-943). There are also one or two examples of large double loops from level A10, and one case of large quadruple loops from level A6 (plate 41: 944). A rim with a horizontal wavy band in white on an overall red wash, unstratified from trench B, appears to be EM II (plate 41: 934). Another rim from level A7 has a row of short dashes between stripes on an overall red wash (plate 41: 937). Some goblet bodies were evidently decorated with vertical stripes, others with diagonal. TYPE 4. SHALLOW BOWLS OR PLATES WITH RIM THICKENED INTERNALLY 945-950 Bowls of this type are common, as in other EM II deposits. Rounded rims of class a outnumber bevelled rims of class b by 10:1. (a) Rounded rims: about 100, including the miniature bowl 947. Rims of this class are as equally plentiful in the later as in the earlier levels of the deposit; no less than 19 come from level A6, and seven from pit C (level Ag). 946 is exceptional in having a dark wash both sides and decoration in white. The others are of fine buff ware, with decoration in dark-on-light of a band below the rim inside, and once outside as well, normally in red, but in 10 cases in black. One rim has a string-hole below it. 945 (PEM/60/P32) FIG. 8.5. Complete profile. Ht 2.5. D. 15. Fine orange clay, surface scraped outside, orange buff burnished inside.

(b) Bevelled rims: only 11, including the profile of a miniature bowl 950. Some large examples of these rims are more or less everted as 948-949. Rim 949 has a black wash inside. The rest are of fine buff ware, with bands of paint (normally red, sometimes black) inside and on the bevelled outside edge. 948 (N163) fig. 8.5. D. 30. Fine orange clay with paler surface, smoothed. Bands in red inside and outside rim. From level A10. 949 (N164) fig. 8.5. D. 30. Fine orange clay with paler surface. Outside apparently scraped; black wash inside.

Underside of bowl decorated with some design, of which only a scrap is preserved. 11 A footed goblet from Ayia Triada has a scheme of decoration of an horizontal reserved band with four rows of small vertical incisions reminiscent of 924: Banti 1931, 179, fig. 36: 59. Banti noted that the shape suggests a date in EM II, but the decoration led her to assign it to EM III. A footed goblet from Koumasa, which she compared for the shape, looks EM IIB (C'VA Denmark 1, Copenhagen 1, pi. 30: 10). Among other examples of this system of decoration assignable to EM II are: Betancourt 1979, pi. 5c (Seager 1912, 83, fig. 48: M.44), on a spouted jar of Vasiliki ware; H. W. Pendlebury et al. 1936, 79, pi. 11: 616.</page><page sequence="215">KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1 957-1 961: EARLY MINOAN 945 946 947 948 949 I 950 a 952 W 'HI 953 m 954 fl I -&amp; 955 7 951 956 lug 957 958 960 959 961 962 964 965 ii ' "jm W 966 968 Fig. 8.5.

Over 3/4 of them (some 26) have a dark wash (16 red, 10 black), with decoration in white of bands or stripes inside, and often outside the rim as well, and round the inside of the base. On the rim itself are found broad wide diagonal bands (973), and once (970) bold lattice; once chevrons combined with large solid spots occur (969). A large spot also appears on 971 with the stumps of a horizontal side handle. The six-odd remaining rims are light surfaced, 968 apparently plain, but the others decorated in dark-on-light.

A group of rims which appear to come from deep bowls with more or less upright sides is described here. The rims are all of distinctive fine burnished ware. The insides are characteristically plain and very well burnished, while the outsides are also well smoothed or burnished, but have a dark wash. 980 preserves the stump of an open trough spout, or it may have been a vertical handle rising above the rim. The stumps of large vertical handles of thick oval section appear on two rims of this fabric (from levels A6 and Ag) which have a black wash outside. 983, although from a bowl of a different shape, is included here owing to its similar fabric: Wilson and Day assign it to one of their Vasiliki ware groups.12 979 (N180) FIG. 8.6.

JUGS WITH CUTAWAY SPOUT 994-999 Only fragments of these were found; many seem to belong to relatively large jugs. All spouts appear to be of the cutaway type. One or two spouts are pared outside. In the one case where a handle is preserved with a section of rim (from level A10) it is set below it. This, and about 1/2 the fragments of jug necks and spouts, have a dark, in most cases black, wash. Fragment 994 from the shoulder of a jug with a lustrous black wash has decoration in white paint, and what appears to be the lower part of a row of incised chevrons round the base of the neck. This is reminiscent of the raised bands with incised decoration which characteristically appear at the base of jug necks in EM III, but are found at least once in Vasiliki ware (1336): compare the boldly grooved chevrons on 626 (A5; plate 32), which may come from a lid. Two necks of large jugs (e.g. 995) of fine buff ware have characteristic decoration in dark-on-light of a thin stripe on top of the rim with triple chevrons below it. Bodies of jugs of fine buff ware may be decorated in dark-on-light with cross-hatched triangles (e.g. 997-998). Cf. 374-375 (A2) and The unique fragment 999, which appears to come from the rim of a jug of cooking pot ware, has a vertically perforated lug, doubtless one of a pair, set on the inside. 994 (N189) plate 43.

From level A12. TYPE 16. SMALL SPOUTED BOWL-JARS IOOO-IO25 Some 33 rims of fine ware may be grouped here. Of these, about 2/5 (13) are of the characteristic EM II class b2: two (1003-1004) are associated with spouts, two with horizontal side-handles, as type 16B. The tops of rims 1007-1008 look as if they had been deliberately hollowed to receive a lid. Seven rims are of the simple class a; and one of these (from level A7) is associated with the stump of a spout which may have been of class c like the isolated spout 1028 (plate 44); another preserves the stump of a vertical handle, as type 16A. Over 2/3 of the rims considered here have a wash outside and many of them one inside as well. The wash is in shades of red or black in the proportion of c. 2:3. Over 3/4 (10) of the 13 characteristic rims of class b2 have a wash, and 1/2 of these (five) have the wash inside as well as outside. Rims of class b in general appear to come from comparatively wide-mouthed vessels. But those of classes c and d seem to belong to narrow-mouthed jars; when they have a wash outside, it only continues inside round the edge of the rim. The decoration on the rims and fragments of these jars of fine ware, whether in dark-on-light (plate 44) or in the more common light-on-dark (plate 43), is apt to be elaborate. 1005 (plate 43) and 1002-1003 have a red wash, the others a wash which is shades of dark purple-brown or black; on 1020-1021 the wash is inside as well as outside, and these fragments may therefore come from wide mouthed jars with rims of class b or even from bowls. 1000-1019 are rims. 1000 (N202) fig. 8.7.

CARINATIONS Carinations were only noted in connection with rims of cooking pot ware assignable to bowls or jars of types 11 and 18. BASES 1045 Bases are in general flat.

The fragment of a small pedestal foot 1045 may be EM II rather than a stray of an earlier period. 1045 (N160) fig. 8.7. Frag, of small pedestal foot. Bowl broken away and missing; thus, this may belong to a small jar of some kind rather than a chalice.

DECORATION Paint Painted decoration occurs in dark-on-light and light-on-dark, with a wide variety of motifs, especially in the now relatively common light-on-dark. The most elaborate decoration is found on goblets of</page><page sequence="223">212 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1 957-1 961: EARLY MINOAN type 2, small jars of fine ware of type 16 — as on plates 44 (dark-on-light) and 43 (light-on-dark) — and jugs of type 15. Motifs include bands and stripes, single or in groups, horizontal, vertical and diagonal; rows of short dashes, cross-hatched triangles, and chevrons; loops, normally small and single, but occasionally double or even quadruple, hanging from the rims of goblets or bowls; and large solid spots. Bowl bases may be decorated with crosses on the underneath in red on a light ground (examples from levels A12 and Ag) or in white on a dark wash (examples from levels A10 and A6). Incision Incision is extremely rare, but occurs in the form of short jabs on goblet 924 of type 2, and on jug shoulder 994 where it appears to foreshadow the incised relief bands round the necks of jugs in EM III and MM IA. Relief Relief decoration seems confined to warts on the shoulders of some jars, especially those of cooking pot ware of type 17. EARLY MINOAN III Deposit B3 Levels A3, A3a. Amount: about 3 tables. This deposit from between the two red plaster floors 4 and 5 has a relatively large amount of pottery considering the size of the deposit. The material seems homogeneous, and differs from that assignable to MM IA, most notably in the complete absence of polychrome decoration. But in the case of the bulk of the material (that from level A3) there is a slight possibility of contamination from Pit A, the foundation trench of wall p. The much smaller amount of material from level A3a is from uncontaminated deposit. Unless otherwise stated, however, the pottery described and illustrated is from level A3. There is little doubt that this B3 material corresponds to what Evans intended by EM III at Knossos, even if it seems more akin to pottery of MM IA than of EM II. It has recently been assigned to EM III late (the Upper East Well Group).13 At the same time the material from sites in eastern Crete that has been defined as EM III appears in many respects very different from this Knossian EM III. Rim 1124 of ajar with spiral decoration belongs to an import from eastern Crete, where it would clearly pass as 'EM III'. This suggests that the by now traditional view is substantially correct: that EM III at Knossos overlaps with the so-called EM III of eastern Crete, but evolves into MM IA while in eastern Crete what is defined there as EM III continues.14 While this B3 pottery is distinguished from that of MM IA by the lack of polychrome ware, it differs in many respects from that of EM II. There is only one scrap of an internally thickened rim from a bowl of the distinctive EM II type 4, and that is damaged and worn. At the same time simple goblets of type 3, extremely rare in levels assignable to EM II, now appear to outnumber eggcup footed goblets of type 2. FABRIC Fine ware Vessels are in general well fired, although the clay is still often dusky at the core. About 1/3 of the fragments of closed types and, to judge from their rims, the vast majority of the numerous goblets of types 2 and 3 have a dark wash: shades of black or red, black washes being more common than red by about 2:1, although there is no rigid line of division between them, red merging through shades of light and dark brown or purple-brown into black. The washed surfaces of the vessels are often mottled, as is common in EM II, but the mottling does not appear to have had any decorative intention — unlike Vasiliki ware. The washes in general tend to be slightly lustrous in contrast to the matt appearance normal in washes of EM II. When the wash, whether red or black, is thick, it may have a high metallic sheen, as is common in MM 11 A. This tendency towards a more lustrous quality in the washes may simply reflect improvements in firing the pottery. 13 Momigliano 2007c, 83: 8. 14 Andreou 1978; Betancourt 1984; Momigliano 2007c; etc.</page><page sequence="224">AREA B. THE EARLY HOUSES: THE EARLY MINOAN II —III DEPOSITS 213 Surfaces in fine buff ware, without an overall dark wash, are shades of orange or buff, sometimes greenish, as in EM II; occasionally there is a greenish slip or wash. One base of a large shallow bowl is of a very soft whitish clay. Burnishing of fine ware, whether light surfaced buff ware or dark washed ware, appears more restricted than in EM II, and virtually confined to jugs, where it may have had the practical objective of proofing them to retain liquids. Decoration for vessels with a dark wash is in white. There is no evidence for the use of red, nor for combining white and red to give a polychrome effect. The white ranges from a fairly whitish to a creamy white and/or distinctly yellowish white, as found on the EM III pottery of eastern Crete. The white never seems to correspond, however, to the fine chalky white apparent in the decoration of many MM IIA vessels. Many vessels, however, of MM I—II at Knossos are decorated with a white with a distinctly yellowish tinge, rendering it indistinguishable from some of the whites used in this EM III phase and perhaps earlier still. Vasiliki ware 1046-1048 This is extremely rare. Only three possible fragments of it were recognised. Scrap 1046 from a closed vessel is of standard Vasiliki ware; rim 1048 of a deep bowl or small jar is of anomalous shape and fabric, and not true Vasiliki ware according to Betancourt. The surface in this case has not been smoothed or burnished, although the wash has a metallic sheen. Assuming, as seems likely, that this fragment belongs to an import from eastern Crete, it may represent an ultimate stage in the development of Vasiliki ware, when the surface was no longer smoothed or burnished but was covered with a lustrous wash. The same tendency to refrain from smoothing or burnishing pottery surfaces as the lustrous quality of washes improved is already apparent at Knossos in EM II and becomes more emphatic there in EM III. 1046 (N74) plate 45.

Coarse ware Coarse gritty clay was used for making large vessels, notably bowls with flaring rims of type 8A, bowls of type 10, and spouted bowls or jars of type 17. Soft sandy ware This distinctive fabric with soft sandy clay is common alongside other wares in MM I—II and later. It now appears for the first time, and is used for making some jars (e.g. 1116) and a few bowls with flaring rims of type 8A. Cooking pot ware This accounts for rather under 1/6 (1/2 a table or less) of the pottery from the deposit. It shows considerable variety. Some smaller vessels are thin-walled and of comparatively fine fabric, with the clay fired an even colour throughout in shades of orange-brown or reddish. Even with larger vessels the clay is often fired an even colour throughout, but may be dusky at the core. Some very large vessels are of coarse crumbly fabric with large grit, and several of these and other vessels in cooking pot ware are burnished. One or two fragments, perhaps earlier strays, have wiped surfaces (in the EM I tradition that continues in cooking pot ware into EM II). Several fragments show a red wash, but in general brown washes appear to have replaced the red washes normal in EM II. TYPES TYPE IB. CUPS WITH VERTICAL HANDLE IO49-IO51 These seem to be characteristic, but are rare, like the cups of type 1A in EM II from which they are no doubt descended. Fragments of some five or six were recognised. Three bases are differentiated like 1051, but at least one cup base 1050 is simple. Handles, to judge from 1049, are of thick oval section like some handles in EM II that may come from cups. No thin strap handle with concave section was noted like those common in MM IA.</page><page sequence="225">KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1 957-1 961: EARLY MINOAN Fig. 8.8. Deposit B3 (EM III).

Type 2 goblet feet: 3 = 1053. TYPE 2. FOOTED GOBLETS IO52-IO53 In a comparison of the footed goblets alone, the B3 horizon is clearly demarcated from both EM II and MM IA. The only complete profile recovered is 1052, which is unique in this deposit for being virtually complete, as well as for the fineness of its fabric and its elaborate and striking scheme of decoration, which is matched on a goblet of the same shape but smaller of MM IA date from RRS: see below. Some 70 eggcup feet belonging to goblets of this type were found. Diameters range from 4.5 to 6, but most are around 5. These feet tend to be low; but some are quite high, like a number of goblet feet in EM II. Some feet are low-waisted as seen from the outside, but show a high gap between the ground and the underneath of the bowl inside. About 12 feet, mostly low-waisted, but one or two of them high, have the edges upturned in a way that is very common and characteristic in the eggcup feet of MM IA. In height, there would seem to be no very great difference between the feet of this EM III horizon and those of EM II; but the EM III feet appear to be in general thicker-waisted than the earlier ones. In finish there is a very marked contrast with EM II. All except three of the 70 feet from this EM III horizon evidently come from goblets with a dark wash on the body, but the foot is left plain, e.g. fig. 8.9: 1. One upturned foot 1053 (N10; fig. 8.9: 3) is plain except for a thin stripe round the outside edge. Only six out of the 70 have traces of a wash covering the whole of the outside of the foot, as fig. 8.9: 2. On the other hand in most cases the wash evidently once covered the inside of the bowl of the goblet as well as the outside; in only about 20 cases is there no trace of an inside wash. Also in striking contrast to the fashion in EM II is the complete absence of a white band round the waist of the foot: among the 70 feet no example was seen with such a band. In contrast to the not uncommon practice in EM II, no foot is painted solid on the underneath. The under sides of the feet are left plain, apart from one or two isolated examples of feet with a band forming a circle round the outer edge of the under side as on EM II examples like fig. 5.5: 6. 1052 (PEM/60/P19) FIG. 8.8, plate 45. Broken, but virtually complete. Ht 7.5. D. rim 7-7.4. D. base 4.3. Edge of foot upturned. Orange clay, grey at core; marked vertical paring outside, perhaps intended as ornamental. Decoration in slightly lustrous dark brown to black: wide band round inside of rim; outside, four solid semi-circles pendent from band round rim, and thin band below; stripe in added white on band below rim. Foot painted solid outside, continuing as band to edge underneath. A similar but smaller goblet with the same decoration (RR/59/P414) comes from the RRS MM IA rubbish deposit. This might suggest that 1052 was a MM IA intruder in A3. Some EM II material, however, had been incorporated in the RRS MM IA rubbish fill, and it is therefore reasonable to assume the presence of EM III pottery that would be difficult to distinguish from that of MM IA. There are also parallels for the shape of 1052 from the UEW (Andreou 1978, 17, fig. 1: 1-3, pi. 1: 1-4; Momigliano 1990, 480-1, fig. 2: 1-3; cf. Momigliano 1991, 84~5&gt; %• 3-3: 1 —s)* The style of the decoration on the other hand seems easier to parallel in MM IA. It is true that solid semi-circles like those on 1052 hang from the rim of a type IB cup from Mochlos, assigned to EM II (Seager 1912, 52, fig. 22: VI.6). But a squat handmade goblet from Apesokari with similar decoration may not be earlier than MM IA (Matz 1951, 17, pis. 4: 3, 20: 5). A row of inverted solid semi-circles adorns the shoulder of a jug with an incised rib at the base of the neck found north of the Knossos Palace along with other pottery that Mackenzie (1906, 249-50, pi. 10: 4; better illustrated: Zois 1965, pi. 18: 2739) assigned to MM I. The same inverted version of the motif appears round the bottom edge of a bowl on a high pedestal from a chamber beneath the West Court also assignable to MM I (Evans 1905, 17, fig. 9: 12; Mackenzie 1906, 250, pi. 11: 12). These parallels and the unusually complete state of 1052 might seem to favour the view that it is in fact an intruder of MM IA, as mentioned above; but we see A3 as a whole deposit and prefer to see 1052 as a contemporary part of it and thus EM III, with EM III parallels at least for the shape. TYPE 3. GOBLETS 1054-1061 Simple goblets of this type are extremely rare in deposits assignable to EM II. But in this EM III horizon they appear to outnumber footed goblets of type 2. Some 90 bases of such goblets, including six profiles, were recognised, as opposed to only about 70 eggcup feet of type 2. In diameter these</page><page sequence="227">2i6 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN bases range from c. 3.5 to 7, but most of them seem to be between c. 3.5 and 5. The six complete profiles (see below) vary in height from 5 to 7.7, with rims between 6 and 8.5 in diameter. These examples are probably smaller than the average, and the existence of a complete profile in these cases is no doubt due to this. Two small goblets 1059-1060 are evidently exceptional, for their size and their complete lack of painted decoration. Some 20, less than 1/4, of the bases assignable to goblets of type 3 are plain inside and out: the clay is shades of orange or buff or greenish, wiped outside or sometimes markedly pared. The rest, about 70, over 3/4 of the total, have a dark, red or black, wash outside; and in the case of just over 1/2 of these, about 38, the wash evidently covered all the inside as well. In a few examples the underneath of the base has a wash, but usually it is left plain. The underneath of base 1054 (Ni 1) has a ring of paint round the edge and a large solid spot in the centre: cf. 559 (A5; fig. 7.15, plate 31). Another base fragment shows traces of some kind of decoration in dark-on-light underneath. 1055 (PEM/60/P21) FIG. 8.8, plate 45. Parts missing. Ht c. 7.7. D. rim 8.1. D. base 3.6-3.8.

Rims of goblets of types 2 and 3: about 265 (D. c. 7-12, most between c. 8 and 9). The rims tend to be rather thick when compared with those from the EM II levels. Only about one in 15 is of fine buff ware with a light surface, and of these virtually all have a band of paint on or sometimes below the rim (see fig. 8.8): in black (six) or red (10). The only two plain rims are those of goblets 1059-1060, whose exceptionally small size has been noted. The great majority of goblet rims has a dark wash outside, and most of them (over 3:1) inside as well. Black washes outnumber red by about 3:2. The difference in the colour of the wash appears to be deliberate. The paint used for the wash may be the same in each case, and the difference in colour may depend upon the method or degree of the firing. Shades of colour intermediate between red and black occur, however, and on the same rim the red may merge through shades of purple-brown into black. Two rim fragments, which may come from the same goblet, have a light brown wash both sides. The exceptional rim 1061 with unusually careful and deliberate decoration may belong to a very small cup of type 1A rather than a goblet. 1061 (N44) fig. 8.8, plate 45.

Of these rims nine evidently come from large bowls with a diameter of c. 30 or more, as 1062 1063. Three rims like these are plain; a fourth has a black wash inside, continuing as a band round the outside of the rim, and decoration in white. Three other rims are plain outside: two of these have a red band round the inside, but the inside of the third has a purplish wash.

The bowls seem to be in general shallow with flat bases, and there is no evidence that any had handles. The rims are mostly thick, and divide into three main classes: (a) differentiated; (b) slightly differentiated; (c): undifferentiated, as type 8 (fig. 8.10: a-c). A few of the rims grouped here approximate to those of the thin-sided bowls of type gB which are characteristic in EM II. Some or all of these rims may then be EM II strays. There are altogether about 85 rims from bowls of this kind. Over 1/2 of these (around 45) are assignable to class b, and nearly 1/4 (around 20) each to classes a or c. Diameters range from 18 to 40 or more, but most appear to be between 22 and 28. The bowls, although thick-walled, are mostly of quite good fabric: the clay orange or buff, or occasionally greenish, well fired. Some bowls of this kind are of coarse, gritty soft clay; a few of soft sandy ware and cooking pot ware. The outsides in a large number of cases (including several of those with a wash) are markedly pared, e.g. 1076. One fragment from a bowl of this kind is of soft orange clay with a dark red-brown surface (due to wash?), very finely stroke burnished (virtually polished) inside and out. Over 1/2 the rims (48 in all) and 11 base fragments have a wash inside: black (21 rims, seven bases) or red (27 rims, four bases). Less than 1/3 (14) of these 48 rims, and six base fragments, have a wash outside as well as inside: black (five rims, three bases) or red (nine rims, three bases), e.g. 1066 (plate 45). On the remaining 34 rims and five base fragments the wash is only on the inside. But on two rims (both with a black wash inside, and perhaps from the same bowl) the wash laps over to form a broad band round the outside. In nine or 10 cases (about 1 in 5) the rims with a wash have one, or sometimes two or three, broad white bands round the inside (1073-1074). 1067 (N 12) (plate 45) with a black wash inside has traces of a wide diagonal in white between the white band and the rim. 1047 °f class c with a red wash outside seems true Vasiliki ware (see above). Some 35 rims of light-surfaced bowls of these types, including 1068 (N15; fig. 8.10) of soft sandy ware, have a broad band of paint (black or red in the proportion of 3:4) inside the rim; on two rims there are double bands, e.g. 1069 (N 14; plate 46), and in six cases (two black, four red) a band round the outside of the rim as well as round the inside. Several bases, which evidently belong to bowls of this kind, have a broad band round the inside, either in dark-on-light, or in light-on-dark (white on a black/red wash). Some bases have bands or stripes on the outside, like 1066 with a red wash and three stripes in white. 1070 (PEM/60/P23) FIG- 8.10. Profile and c. 1/5 of rim pres. Ht c. 5.6. D. 28.5.

Both are of fine buff ware, with buff surfaces, well smoothed inside but scraped outside, and dark red-brown bands round the inside of the rim. A profile and two rims of cooking pot ware belong to small bowls of this shape. 1079 (N62) fig. 8.10. Profile. D. c. 13. Cooking pot ware; clay grey-brown at core, red-brown at edges.

LARGE BOWL WITH CURVING SIDES AND THICKENED RIM (COOKING POT WARE) 1087 The only rim assignable to this distinctive EM II type may be an earlier stray. This type and the corresponding EM II type 18 appear to have been replaced by the bowl-jars with massive thickened rims of type 12. 1087 (N65) fig. 8.11. D. 35. Cooking pot ware; gritty red-brown clay with traces of possible red wash. TYPE 12. LARGE DEEP BOWLS OR JARS WITH THICK TRIANGULAR-SECTIONED RIMS 1088-1092 Some eight or nine large thickened rims of cooking pot ware, or a very coarse fabric allied to it, are of distinctive profile and evidently belonged to deep bowls or jars whose shape we could not reconstruct. These rims seem to range from c. 25 to 50 or more in diameter. 1090 has the stump of a small horizontal side-handle set immediately below it, and 1091 a large flat disc-like wart. The vessels from which these rims come appear to replace the bowls of type 11 and the bowls or jars of type 18 characteristic in EM II. These EM III rims are more massive, and the vessels to which they belonged thicker walled and of coarser fabric, than their EM II counterparts. 1088 (N67) fig. 8.13. D. 50.

JUGS WITH CUTAWAY SPOUT IO94-HO3 Only fragments of these are preserved, but they give a picture of a distinctive type of jug, markedly different in details of decoration from the type fashionable in EM II. Some 10 fragments are all apparently from spouts of the cutaway kind. A few round section handles probably come from jugs, but none is preserved to the rim, so that it is not clear whether they are set to the rim or below it. Bases were evidently flat. In six cases the necks of jugs are encircled by a distinctive rib in relief, and five out of six of these ribs are decorated with diagonal cuts (plate 46: 1094-1097). Raised ribs with diagonal cuts like this seem a characteristic feature of the jugs of this horizon, although the first example we know is 1336 in Vasiliki ware from Evans's excavations in the Early Houses (see p. 274). Warts on the swelling of the body may also be characteristic. Some eight fragments, apparently from jug bodies, have bold warts on them. It looks as if some jugs may have been adorned with three warts on the swelling of the body, one below the spout opposite the handle, and one in the middle of each side. This system of adorning jugs with warts was very fashionable in Troy I and the corresponding periods V-IV at Emporio in Chios.15 Fabric The smaller jugs at any rate normally appear to have been of very fine buff ware, stroke burnished outside. The spouts of such jugs show marked signs of having been pared with vertical strokes of a knife before the burnishing of the surface. All six fragments of jug necks with ribs in relief round them, and most of the body fragments with warts, are of this characteristic buff burnished ware. But some jugs are evidently of coarser fabric: the clay gritty, with the surface unburnished. Decoration Paint Four or five fragments of spouts with a fine buff burnished surface have a thin red or black stripe along the top of the rim: e.g. 1098 (N37; plate 46). Horizontal stripes are found round the base of the neck, and/or below the neck on the shoulder: such stripes characteristically flank the raised ribs round necks. Several fragments with a fine buff burnished surface, which appear to come from jug bodies, have trickle ornament: 1099-1101 (plate 47). Incision Incision was noted only as diagonal cuts on the ribs round the base of jug necks (see above). Relief (a) Barbotine. One fragment of fine buff ware 1102 (N 38; plate 46), which may come from a small jug, is decorated with barbotine. (b) Warts appear on a number of body fragments from jugs (see above). On 1103 (N 39; plate 46) a wart occurs below the rim, on the side of a jug spout of coarse gritty fabric. The clay is pale orange, covered by a slip with a slight greenish tinge. TYPE 16. SMALL SPOUTED BOWL-JARS IIO4-II16 Almost all these jars appear now to have a dark wash (see below). They are of fine ware; but three scraps of small rims of class ai are of cooking pot ware, e.g. 1112. The small profile 1105 (N24; Ht to rim 6.7; plate 46) has a vertical teapot handle, as type 16A. There is one other fragment of a large vertical handle, and a complete handle of this kind 1139 (N47; fig. 8.12) has traces of incised decoration. 15 Hood 1981, 239, 386-8, fig. 174.</page><page sequence="232">AREA B. THE EARLY HOUSES: THE EARLY MINOAN II—III DEPOSITS 221 A profile with a spout of class c — 1104 (N23; plate 47) — evidently comes from ajar with horizontal side-handles as type 16B.16 Three other horizontal handles from jars of this type were found, e.g. 1106 (N25; FIG. 8.12). Rims These are mostly simple, S-shaped and thickened inside: cf. class ci, as in 1104-1106. 1107 (N26; fig. 8.12), with black wash both sides is of class ai. 1108 (N27; fig. 8.12), with red wash outside, is flat-topped, like class C4. There seems to be less variety in the shapes of rims than with small jars assignable to type 16 in EM II; but this impression may be false. On the other hand rims of class bs, which appear to be very common and characteristic in EM II, are conspicuous by their absence. Spouts The spout of 1104 is of the teapot class c which is characteristic in EM II, but continues until the end of MM IA, if not into MM IB, at Knossos. There are fragments, however, of six or seven bridge spouts of class d which did not occur in any EM II context; all of these have a circular hole as class ci, and none it seems is of class C2, which may be more at home in eastern Crete. Handles These are all more or less round in section. None of the horizontal side-handles is markedly pointed in shape, as such handles are apt to be in MM IA; all are more or less rounded. Seen in profile, they may reach either below the rim (as 1106) or above it. Bases In general bases appear to be flat. Two fragments of differentiated bases may belong to type 16 jars: 1115, and 1109 (N28; FIG. 8.12, PLATE 45). Carinations Fragment 1110 (plate 45), which appears to be from the body of ajar of this type, is carinated. Fabric Virtually all the jars of fine ware assignable to this type have an outside wash in black to purple-brown or red. Sometimes the wash shades from black to red on the same vessel. The wash often, it seems, covered the underneath of the base and normally, but not in every case, continued round the inside of the rim. The isolated rim 1113, and base fragment 1114 which may belong with it, are of fine buff ware with a light surface, very well burnished as in the vase of the jugs of type 15. Three small rims of class ai, including 1112, are of cooking pot ware; and there are fragments of a base with the stumps of horizontal side-handles belonging to a small jar of coarse gritty reddish clay akin to cooking pot ware with a wash, well smoothed or burnished outside. Base 1116, of soft sandy ware, is placed here, although the type of vessel is uncertain: it may come from a small jar or perhaps a jug. Decoration Paint (a) Dark-on-light. See under 1113-1114. (b) Light-on-dark. On spouts, stripes; on bodies, groups of diagonal lines, three to five in number — on 1139 enclosing a wavy band; on bases, horizontal stripes, once at least triple on 1109.

THE EARLY HOUSES: THE EARLY MINOAN II—III DEPOSITS 223 TYPE 17. LARGE SPOUTED BOWLS OR JARS WITH HORIZONTAL SIDE-HANDLES II17-H24 Vessels of this type seem common. Many fragments assignable to them were found including 43 rims. Rim diameters appear between c. 23 and 40, with most around 25. Three rims have large horizontal side-handles springing from the shoulder; other large handles of more or less round section apparendy belong to vessels of this kind. Their shoulders are in general high, in three cases with a sharp carination: xi 18 has a large horizontal side-handle springing from it, and 1119 a wart set immediately above it. Two fragments of large spouts of class b evidently come from vessels of this type. Fabric It is noticeable that the vessels of this kind no longer seem to be made in cooking pot ware as was usual in EM II. The fabric is in general rather coarse, with sand or grit in the clay. About eight rims (less than one in five), and one or two bases which evidently belonged to such vessels, have a black/ red wash outside. But over 4/5 of the rims are light surfaced. Decoration This occurs in both the more common dark-on-light, and in light-on-dark, normally consists of a band round the outside of the rim, which may sometimes continue inside the rim as well; while the body, whether there is a band round the rim or not, may be decorated with diagonal stripes, single or in groups of two or three, e.g. 1122 in dark-on- light; cf. 1118 and 1121 in light-on-dark.

Wilson and Day sample KN 92/234 (not published): Mirabello fabric (pers. comm.). The fabric, decoration and thickened rim show this to be an import from eastern Crete, where single spirals linked by multiple lines are standard in EM III White-on-Dark, e.g. Betancourt 1984, 26, fig. 3-5: 8: 6; 32; Gournia, North Trench: Boyd Hawes et al. 1908, 57, figs. 4ie, 42: 10 (PMl, 113, fig. 80a: 10); Zois 1967^, pis. 13: 60, 27: 1; Mochlos: Forsdyke 1925, 78-9, fig. 96: A451.2; Palaikastro: Bosanquet and Dawkins 1923, pi. 3m. Our fragment is unusual in having a wavy stripe between the two stripes linking the spirals, but there are parallels: Gournia, North Trench (Zois 1968b, pis. 13: 71, 27: 2; Betancourt 1984, 30, fig. 3-9: 3); and Malia, on a fragment apparently of a large handle (Chapouthier andjoly 1936, 28, pi. gh; Charbonneaux 1928, 368-9, fig. 7d, seeing it as from a foot of a vessel; Zois 1967ft, pi. 26: 28). Phaistos has an EM II (probably IIB) dark-on light antecedent for the wavy stripe between stripes: Levi 1958a, 180, fig. 361, top middle, pi. 18B, second row from bottom, middle. An East Cretan EM III version from Gournia is Zois 1967A, pi. 12: 43.

What may be a rough strap handle from level A3 a is of sandy orange clay with fine grit, decorated in lustrous dark brown to black: plate 48: 1136. DECORATION Paint 1137-1139 Painted decoration is dark-on-light, in shades of red, brown or black; and light-on-dark, in white on a red or black wash. No example of polychrome decoration was noted. A scrap from a jar of fine ware 1137 (N 49; plate 45) was at first thought to preserve a trace of a thin stripe in the Indian red that Evans said was sometimes used at Knossos in EM III;17 but on further examination it was seen to be a natural variation in the colour of the otherwise black wash. Designs in both dark-on-light and light-on-dark are for the most part simple and linear. Diagonal lines, whether single or in groups of two or three or more, are very popular and may reflect that feeling for torsion, or spiralling movement, which Matz noted as characteristic of MM decoration. 1138 (N77; plate 48) from a very large jar of fine dusky orange clay, greyish and well smoothed outside, is decorated with lattice in black. Trickle ornament in dark-on-light occurs on pithoi and on some small vessels, apparently jugs, in fine buff burnished ware. Single wavy lines in white occur twice: 1124 (fig. 8.13) in conjunction with the spiral on the rim of an East Cretan jar (see above) and 1139 (fig. 8.12), where a diagonal wavy line is flanked by straight ones, appears on a fragment from the North Trench at Gournia.18 Incision 1140-1141 Fine incised lattice is found on the bodies 1140-1141 of two small jars of type 16. Incision also occurs on raised ribs on pithoi (see above) and at the base of the necks of jugs (see p. 220). 1140 (N47) plate 46. Frag, of rim with vertical handle to it, apparently from jar of teapot shape as type 16 A. Fine orange clay with black wash outside; blob of white paint on top of handle; at base of handle, horizontal reserved zone with fine lattice incised on it. 1141 (N53) plate 46.

Relief 1142 (a) Ribs in relief occur associated with incisions around the necks of jugs (see above), and on pithoi (see above). (b) Warts seem to be characteristic on the bodies of jugs (type 15), and are found set below the rims of large bowls or jars of type 17. On 1091 the wart is flat, disc-shaped. The wart on 1142, a fragment of fine orange clay with buff surface, is painted black (plate 47); this fragment may be an EM II stray, to judge from the fabric and the character of the decoration. Barbotine Fragment 1102 (above) of fine buff ware, perhaps from the body of a jug, has elegant 'barnacle work' barbotine of a type common in MM IA: cf. 629 (A5; p. 174, with references). IMPORTS H43-H47 A comparatively large number of fragments appear to be from imports. The three bits of Vasiliki ware have already been discussed (p. 213). In addition, there are fragments of about six other likely imports. The most interesting are jar 1143, probably from the Cyclades, and the spiral-decorated jar rim 1124 of East Cretan EM III (above). 1143 (PEM/60/P28) fig. 8.13, plate 48.

ROYAL ROAD: NORTH Plaster Three scraps, datable to EM IIA, of wall plaster were found. Two are from Ao (level LAi 15): one of them has black to brown paint, and had received two skims (or washes) of plaster, indicating replastering, whether immediate or after an interval. The third piece (RR/61/370), from Ai (level LA113), has been discussed by Cameron et al. It is important for confirming that black was used as a colour in EM II wall painting as well as the better known red.1 Two other fragments from Ai catalogued as painted wall plaster seem now to be pieces of burnished Neolithic pottery. Clay 1150-1157, 233; 412 Artefacts other than pottery vessels in the excavations in Area A were few and mainly of fired clay. The most interesting is the head of a figurine 1150 from the late EM IIB A4 deposit. Indeed, Higgins noted that its neck is tongued for insertion into a body, and assigned the piece to MM II in spite of the context which, he wrote, 'must surely be disregarded'.2 But we can compare a head from Foumou Korifi II, which is similar in appearance and fabric, and also has a tongue at the bottom for affixing it to a body.3 The date of these pieces is important, since it raises the possibility that the earliest figurines from some of the peak sanctuaries assigned to MM I—II are in fact EM II—III in date. Other apparent EM II anthropomorphic figurines come from the WCH.4 1151 (A5: EM III) appears to be from a model of some kind, perhaps of a building, perhaps a human or near-human. 1152 (A3: EM IIB) is part of a phallus, and likewise probably 1152A from the same deposit; see also 1363 below. The pieces of pottery of roughly triangular shape 233 (Ai: EM IIA) and 412 (As: EM IIB) seem to have been used as rubbers or pot burnishers. Three others are known at Knossos from the WCH,5 and one from B.I. 16 279.® Warren interpreted some neat triangular sherds of comparable size from Fournou Korifi as counters,7 noting that fragments with incised or painted patterns on them had evidently been chosen for these. This seems to have been the case too with 412 made from a fragment of what may have been an imported vessel with elaborate decoration of rows of open circles bisected by lines. The triangular counters at Fournou Korifi are mainly of period I, but some are of II. Sherd rubbers were also recognised in Fournou Korifi II: one at least of these is triangular.8 They are also known from EM IIB Phaistos, where Todaro suggests that they may represent fractions of a unit.9 Sherds 1153-1154, of EM III date, had been rubbed or cut into roundels. Similar roundels are known from Ayia Triada, where it is suggested that they were gaming pieces: they appear to date to EM II (and perhaps EM I),10 and from EM IIB and EM III Phaistos,11 where they appear to be counters connected with pottery production — which may also have been the case at Ayia Triada. At Knossos 1171 is an EM IIB example from Area B, 165-165A are EM I from the Palace Well, and there are nine known of EM IIA from the WCH;12 but such discs go back to MN at Knossos (discussed above, p. 60). A piece of clay 1155 (A3: EM IIB) which may come from the base of a large vessel has an impression of a vine leaf: compare 166H from the Palace Well and 1364-1365 in the SMK (the four impressions are shown on plate 19). Two clay balls 1156-1157 from EM III deposits are matched by 1160 in stone from Ai (EM IIA). 1 Cameron et al. 1977, 125, 140-1, table 6; 146-8, table 7; 159, 174-5, P'- 11: 3! a's0 Cameron in Warren 1972a, 310, n. 2. 2 fReynold Higgins, pers. comm. 3 Warren 1972a, 219-20, 242, fig. 95: 70. 4 Wilson 1984, 212-3 and pis. 54: SF661 (male, sitting in boat ?), 55: SF625 (human) and SF1111 (clothed human). 5 Wilson 1984, 221, pi. 58B top right and bottom row. 6 Wilson 1984, 221, pi. 43D bottom right.

Obsidian Doniert Evely The EM II and III structures in Area A produced around 300 pieces of obsidian:16 216 are from the main EM II, and 73 from the EM III deposits, while A8 (EM II) yielded 16 pieces. Four cores, six crested blades, three platform rejuvenation flakes, 148 flakes (73 with cortex) and 134 blades are represented, together with sundry chips, fig. 9.2 a-h, l-m, p-w shows a sample of the obsidian from Area A. As with the EM I Well, there is generally some slight direct evidence for manufacture somewhere nearby. The basic method of blade removal still seems to have been pressure-flaking, with some forms of percussion (probably both direct and indirect) being reserved for first preparing the core itself.17 In view of the level of regularity in the shape of the blades themselves, DAnnibale observes that the work was done not with the core held in the hand, but immobilised in some device.18 The manner in which the work progressed across 1/2 to 2/3 of the core's periphery also leads to the same inference.19 Prismatic blades are again the tool-of-choice, but flakes are as frequent, with over 1/2 showing evidence for on-site adjustment, if not full core preparation. Signs of use on the blades are slight — mostly edge damage rather than retouch, even less so for the flakes; second stage tool making is so rare as to be invisible. The presence of obsidian believed to be from 'Anatolian' sources is a minor element (4 pieces).20 With respect to size,21 one can at once distinguish these domestic groups at Knossos from the funerary ones where a Cycladic influence is suspected, but not from more 'purely' Cretan burial contexts where, as Carter remarks, 'all the Cretan (funerary) assemblages ... are composed of blades which are to all extents and purposes the same as those seen in contemporary Minoan domestic contexts'.22 There are no immediately obvious discrepancies in the evidence of the obsidian for this range of EM II—III contexts. One can probably safely assume that at Knossos, and no doubt in Crete generally, the manufacturing techniques for blades required in everyday domestic and craft milieux became standardised well back in the third millennium bc. Faunal Remains Valasia Isaakidou The Early Minoan deposits in Area A yielded a modest quantity of mammalian remains.23 A total of 976 specimens was selected for detailed recording (1020 MaxAU and 927 MinAU).24 The sample is large enough to explore species representation25 and the taphonomic history of the assemblage. Due to the limited extent of the deposits, however, it cannot be treated in isolation as representative of animal exploitation at the site during EM.26 Thus, the present section discusses only certain results of the analysis, with an emphasis on how the deposits were formed.27 The assemblage consists overwhelmingly of fragmented bones of all parts of the skeleton of the usual Knossian suite of farmyard animals (sheep, goat, pig and cattle), as well as a few bones of dog and badger28 (table g.i). The commonest species is sheep, followed by goat, pig and cattle. 16 For the background to this study, and that of the obsidian from Area B, see p. 62 above. 17 For a relatively recent account of recreating knapping, see D'Annibale and Long 2003. 18 D'Annibale 2008, 198-9. 19 Carter (2004, 279, fig. 22.8) reproduces an image of some of the proposed schemes. 20 Two smoky (EM II) and two translucent (EM II and EM III) pieces comprise only just over 1% of the total. 21 Figures extrapolated from Carter 1998, 69-70, figs. 4.7-4.8. 22 Carter 1999, 10.7.8. He specifically excludes here those of the Ayia Fotia (Siteia) sort from this comment. 23 For recovery methods and how representative the samples may be, see p. 63 above. 24 See p. 63, n. 304 for analytical protocols. 25 Van der Veen and Fieller 1982. 26 For this reason, demographic (dental development, epiphyseal fusion, sex ratio) and biometric data are not presented here. 27 For discussions of management and consumption practices at Knossos, see Isaakidou 2004, 2006, 2007. More extensive analysis will be presented in Isaakidou in preparation. 28 Although badgers are burrowing animals, the fact that, according to the excavators, we are dealing with stratified and undisturbed floor deposits makes it unlikely that their bones are intrusive.</page><page sequence="241">KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1 957-1 961: EARLY MINOAN Fig. 9.2.

Although butchery marks and fragmentation characteristic of human consumption are absent in our small sample, butchered bones of dogs and badgers have been identified from earlier and later contexts, both at Knossos30 and at other Cretan sites.31 These species appear to have been used — at least in some periods — as food and for their pelts,32 but larger samples are needed to explore this issue definitively for Early Minoan Knossos.

At Kavousi-Kastro, the larger size of the dog and badger assemblages allowed detailed analysis of fragmentation and butchery patterns, which provide firm evidence for human consumption (Snyder and Klippel 2003, 223-4). 32 Today badgers are mainly bred for their hair, which is used for brushes, but they were occasionally eaten in rural areas of Europe until recently (e.g., Konjevic 2005; I thank D.

The presence of long bone 'cylinders' implies that the floors were not hard surfaces subject to regular cleaning, but that debris accumulated quickly or bones were trampled into a soft substrate which allowed them to be preserved whole — on a hard substrate, trampling would have reduced 'cylinders' into shaft fragments. If the latter interpretations are correct, it may be tentatively suggested that (some of) these spaces were not living, but storage or processing areas. Alternatively, the deposits may represent fills consisting of midden materials, brought into buildings as substrates to raise floor surfaces. Larger exposures and assemblages as well as taphonomic analyses of other bodies of material are required to choose between alternative interpretations. In terms of the nature of the deposits, the range of species, body parts and taphonomic markers are compatible with all sub-assemblages representing 'domestic' debris from all stages of processing and consumption of animal carcasses. Of interest is the presence of a sawn sheep or goat femur, possibly a by-product of artefact manufacture.33 This, albeit scant, evidence may imply no spatial segregation of the various stages of processing and consumption of carcasses, and so offers no hint of the existence of specialist butchers and the like. Finally, given discussions concerning the extent of continuity in economic practices from Early Minoan into the Palatial period, it is worth commenting briefly on the taxonomic composition of the assemblage. The preponderance of sheep in the EM IIB and EM III deposits (table 9.5; the EM IIA sample is too small for evaluation of taxonomic composition) is a diachronic feature of Knossian faunal assemblages,34 but its 'economic' meaning may be different in different periods of the site's occupation.

Conversely, during the later Bronze Age, when textual evidence suggests an emphasis on wool production, ageing evidence shows that animals were kept to an older age and sex ratios of adult males/females were more balanced, both compatible with an emphasis on achieving higher yields of wool and larger carcasses. As Prepalatial sex ratios and culling profiles approximate those of Palatial assemblages, it may cautiously be argued that already in the Prepalatial period management goals were similar to those of Palatial economies.36 Vines For Jane M. Renfrew's discussion of 1155 (and 166H and 1364-1365) and other vine leaf impressions in the EBA Aegean, see pp. 68-9. ss Analysis of the use of tools in processing bones during the Bronze Age at Knossos suggests that use of saws is most probably related to use of bone as a raw material for manufacturing artefacts, rather than processing of carcasses for consumption as food (Isaakidou 2004). 34 Isaakidou 2008, 95, fig. 6.2. 35 For a recent discussion of the integration of sheep in intensive 'garden' farming based on ethnographic evidence, see Halstead 2006. 36 Isaakidou 2007, 101-3.</page><page sequence="245">234 knossos excavations 1 957-1 961: EARLY MINOAN AREA B. THE EARLY HOUSES The small find number in the catalogue below is the number given to an object on its excavation. Level numbers are also given to help identification and/or chronology. The find spots of objects appear in figs. 4.5-4.6. Plaster A fragment of pale blue wall plaster from level Bi may, or more likely may not, be EM III. It has been analysed by Cameron et al., who note that the plaster seems unusually fine, whiter and higher in lime content than seems normal for EM — 'and did the Minoans yet know of blue?'37 It is probable that it had fallen down from the Palace, or it may have been scattered from the South House. Clay 1167-1171A The principal find is the EM III jar stopper 1167 from B3 with several seal impressions. It was recognised during excavation as in an uncontaminated find-spot (figs. 4.5-4.6), with no possibility of the admixture of later material. Since it is rare for seals and sealings to come from settlement contexts, this stopper is of considerable importance for dating and interpreting the early seals of Crete — and has been much discussed. And for Knossos it is probably the only Minoan jar stopper ever found there, and certainly the only Prepalatial one.38 Shaped like a champagne cork, it has three or four seal impressions made by the circular face of an ivory seal. Only one impression can be made out entirely, showing three circling or parading lions, in a border of leaves, as identified by Pini,39 who also indicates that (i) there is, perhaps, a spider in the centre, and (ii) the type of seal used was a stamp cylinder. Why did the original seal show Parading Lions? Weingarten, pointing to another ivory seal with 'contorted lions' from Archanes-Fourni Tholos T. T, Stratum II (EM III), and others from that cemetery and the Mesara datable to MM IA, identifies them as material markers of a specific social group: a 'symbol of chiefdom, perhaps even of an emergent royalty', and a mark of power that the Minoans intentionally adapted/adopted from Egyptian originals.40 Earlier, she reviewed the possible uses of this stopper.41 Its sealings may have been intended for some domestic use only;42 but they could have had some outside function, 'or if two seal-owners were involved', then we should think of some more public purpose. And if, she suggests, such a purpose was connected with exchange or tax, or both, then we can see an emerging late third millennium practice of documentation and administration at Knossos — for which, as yet, no other evidence is available. How systematised this would have been is unclear: we do not have enough evidence for a formalised administrative system in Prepalatial times.43 Schoep agrees in general, but stresses that, while this sealing and its companions point to increasing social complexity, there is no need that they imply 'a centralised authority'. Indeed, its having been found outside the later Palace may be another sign of more heterarchical administrative practice(s) at Knossos (until well on in the Old Palace period).44 Krzyszkowska, classing the piece as a 'direct object sealing', is sceptical that it was just of limited household use, but equally sees uncertainty in the dates for other sealings that are cited as evidence for administration.45 And most recently Relaki has emphasised the domestic contexts — and thus character — of most Prepalatial sealings, which she relates to personal and collective identity and the allocation of resources.46 37 Cameron et al. 1977, 125, 131, n. 15; 140-1, table 6 ('Egyptian blue'); 148, 158, 174-5: 3 bis. 38 We thank Judith Weingarten for most helpful advice on 1167 and emphasising its (near) uniqueness. She notes (pers. comm.) that ' CMS II.8 no. 26, if a stopper, is later. Ditto CMS II.8 Add. 2 from the WCH — which I do not agree is a stopper anyway'. Krzyszkowska (2005, 78) similarly doubts the EM II date and context of the seals that impressed the WCH sealings (the other is CMS II.8. Add. 1). See I.

Obsidian Doniert Evely Torrence records some 110 specimens from Area B: 30 blades and 80 flakes with sundry chips and chunks. 75 come from the more extensive EM IIB contexts, 26 from the EM III deposit. In addition, there are seven flakes from the disturbance/pit A along the n face of wall P in trench A. The mix is much as seen elsewhere, with hints of production in the crested blades (three) and flakes (58 + six or so chunks), but relatively few blades (c. 30) or other tools now remain. Although the blades from Area B (fig. g.2: i-j, n-o) are not many (as in the Palace Well), the later examples here are shorter in their preserved state by an average 0.5 cm than those in the Well. Neither set attains the lengths of the Cycladic-influenced pieces at coastal sites in northern Crete such as, par excellence, Ayia Fotia (Siteia) ;52 they seem closer to the blades found in the Prepalatial tholos tombs.53 For the flakes, the pattern is more what one would expect: primary flakes (14) are fewest, with secondary (20) and tertiary (24) only a little more numerous. Sundry chips and chunks (over half a dozen) make up the total. Two fragments of the smoky, transparent obsidian that is probably of Anatolian' origin were found in one EM IIB deposit. There are two possible fragments from the upper levels in trench B, and two more from the pit A disturbance. In the EM III B3 deposit, four out of nine pieces seem of this smoky variety — a quite high rate of occurrence. The smoky obsidian shows less secondary working, and makes better long primary flakes.54 50 Warren 1968. 51 Cf.J. D. Evans 1964, 231, pi. 64. 52 Carter 1999; Davaras and Betancourt 2004. 53 E.g.

These come principally from levels associated with deposit B2. The assemblage shares similar characteristics with that from Area A. Species composition and relative frequencies are comparable, with sheep predominating, while no importance should be attributed to the absence of rare species (i.e., dog and badger), most probably because of the small sample size (table 9.6).

This pottery seemed worthy of publication, as did a few isolated fragments of exceptional interest and some pottery, mainly whole vessels, from the 1908 excavations at the Early Houses that we restored from sherds in the SMK boxes or could identify in the Herakleion Museum (HM) and the Ashmolean Museum (AM), together with a little EM pottery from Knossos in other museums, including the Musées Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire in Brussels (MRAH), the National Museum in Copenhagen (NMC), Liverpool Museum (LM), the British Museum in London (BM) and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (MMA).1 In the long gap, however, between the original study and the present publication, there has been intensive research into, and publication of, Evans's EM (and MM IA) pottery in the SMK, and discussion of its historical implications, principally by Andreou, Wilson, Momigliano, Day, Whitelaw and Tomkins (in the rough order of their starting work).2 Wilson has also studied and published J. D. Evans's EM IIA West Court House3 and is publishing pottery that Platon found during conservation;4 Momigliano and Wilson have published their 1993 excavation at the Early Houses;5 and Warren has produced preliminary accounts of his RRS excavations.6 These reports and papers, the recent general accounts by Tomkins of the Neolithic ceramic sequence of Knossos and by Wilson (EM I—II) and Momigliano (EM III-MM IA) of the Prepalatial sequence,7 and other articles that include discussion of the pottery and circumstances of Poros,8 all in varying degrees analyse, discuss or allude to Evans's EM pottery in the SMK. Thanks to this surge of study and the many fresh understandings of the pottery and history of Early Minoan Knossos, it is clear that we are approaching a far fuller picture of its ceramic development. Likewise, there has been a recent surge in studying, and re-defining, the ceramic sequence, culture and history of Neolithic Knossos, with important results.9 It is otiose to publish again in detail material that others have already published very well — except in so far as there is material (notably in the museums outside Crete but also in the H M in Crete) that we can add, or there are new or better illustrations (whether drawings or photographs), or other useful references, or even detailed comments that are worth making. What we present below is then to be seen as supplementary to what our colleagues have already presented. One of the more valuable elements will, probably, be the (new) drawings we provide of sherds and vessels that have been illustrated only in photographs or drawings of the early 1900s. THE STRATI GRAPHICAL MUSEUM AT KNOSSOS There is plenty of Early Minoan pottery in the SMK. This is not, however, intended to be a comprehensive survey of it, but rather a selective account of some easily definable classes that are important as they have been rare in EM excavations at Knossos — a choice that Wilson and Day have also made in their papers on their research. The most obvious instances are light grey ware and 1 There is also EM pottery in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (Fairbanks 1928) and the Gothenburg Museum (CVA Sweden 3, Göteborg 1), but nothing to show that any of it has to be from Rnossos — although Gothenburg has a little Neolithic pottery from Knossos, as does Copenhagen (CVA Denmark 1, Copenhagen 1). 2 Monographs, papers and chapters include: Andreou 1978; Day and Wilson 1998, 2002, 2004; Day et al. 1997, 1999, 2006; Momigliano 1990, 1991,2000a, 2000b, 2007c; Tomkins forthcoming a; Whitelaw forthcoming; Wilson 1984, 1985, 1987, igg4, 2007; Wilson and Day 1994, 1999, 2000; Wilson et al. 2004. To these we should add MacGillivray (1998, 2007) on the Protopalatial pottery of Knossos, and Furness (1953) on its Neolithic pottery — both of whom have also added to our knowledge of its Prepalatial pottery. 3 Wilson 1984, 1985. 4 Wilson 2010. 5 Momigliano and Wilson 1996; and pp. 81-2 above. 6 Warren 1972^ 1973, 1974, 1981. 7 Momigliano 2007c; Tomkins 2007; Wilson 2007. 8 Poros: Dimopoulou-Rethemiotaki 2004; Dimopoulou Rethemiotaki et al. 2007; Wilson et al. 2004, 2008. 9 Conolly 2008; Efstratiou et al. 2004; Isaakidou 2008; Mina 2008; Strasser 2008; Tomkins 2007, 2008, forthcoming a.

Isolated pieces include an EM I dark grey burnished ware chalice rim with patterrn burnished spiral decoration 1182; a large EM IIA amphora 1294 with painted decoration, which we restored from many sherds; and bases with mat or vine leaf impressions 1364-1366. We cannot claim that any accounts are exhaustive as we did not examine all the boxes in the SMK from the earlier excavations at Knossos. We looked at those which Pendlebury said had EM sherds11 and a considerable number of others — which sometimes produce surprising examples of EM pottery. Wilson and Day and other colleagues have examined much of this material independently; and we have all come upon pieces that others had missed. It is likely that yet more pieces of EM pottery will be found, but unlikely that they will alter the account significantly. SMK: Boxes and Contexts The SMK boxes are arranged by two systems. The first is that of Pendlebury and his colleagues. They gave each part of Knossos a letter designation, with a Roman numeral for further precision and an Arabic figure for the exact place of excavation. Thus for 'K.II.5', 'KIP refers to the Area of the North East Hall12 and '5' to the test pit on the E side. The boxes of sherds from the layers within K.II.5 are separated as 'ist. m.', '2nd. m.', etc., following the divisions of Evans and Mackenzie. The second system is that of the re-boxing in the 1960s, after the boxes of pottery had been moved out of storage in the Palace to the new Stratigraphical Museum, which was built in ig62-6313 and inaugurated in 1966 by tDame Joan Evans, who gave generously for its building, as did fMarc Fitch. In the meantime tElizabeth Schofield, to whom tMervyn Popham as Assistant Director of the British School had entrusted the work, had started re-boxing the collection. She followed Pendlebury's order but added a reference number in continuous sequence for each box. Thus 'K.II.5 ist. m.' could be referred to as K.II.5 931. As far as possible, we follow this method, which is now standard for Evans's material. But readers should note that a few sherds are not any longer in the boxes that they were in in 1964-65, but are now to be found in neighbouring boxes from the same deposit and the same depth: this is not of material significance. Furthermore, some of the boxes we examined were still Pendlebury's original SMK boxes that had not yet been re-boxed and re-numbered. This means that for some deposits we can give only a sequence of box numbers, which is usually short: again it should not be difficult to find the sherd(s). Pendlebury listed the provenances of the boxes in A Guide to the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos and explained the limits of their accuracy.14 He and his colleagues dated the pottery in Dating of the Pottery in the Stratigraphical Museum 1-3: the third part of their work presents plans of the deposits,15 from which it will be clear why we looked at particular boxes. In many cases we were looking for stray EM sherds that had survived among later material, as also happened in the RRN and RRS excavations (see pp. 190-2). Many of the boxes with Early Minoan pottery have suffered some degree of contamination — or have the same range of pottery even if it is stated that they are divided by levels and/or floors — and appear highly selected. Other boxes, however, contain plenty of coarse ware, which suggests that the excavators may have kept a high proportion of sherds from these early deposits. Among the groups where more seems to have been kept we might place the Early Houses (H.I.2), the trials in the North East Magazines (K.I.4-8) and probably the Upper East Well (L.I.4). The pottery from Knossos that we present here is almost all in the SMK, with some pieces in the Herakleion Archaeological Museum. We also include or mention pieces in the Ashmolean Museum, British Museum, Liverpool Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Musées Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire, and National Museum in Copenhagen. Some of these museums have only a sherd or two of Early Minoan pottery from Knossos. There may be other such collections that we have overlooked. Most of the whole vessels discussed below are from the Early Houses (our Area B) and probably from EM IIB 10 Wilson 1985, 312-17: 'red and black washed ware'; 2007, 58-61: 'red/black slipped ware'. 11 Eccles et al. 1933; Money-Coutts and Pendlebury 1933; Pendlebury and Pendlebury 1933. 12 Hood and Taylor 1981, 20: 181, 185. 13 Cadogan and Chaniotis 2010, 2g 1 (with references). 14 Pendlebury 1933. 15 Pendlebury and Pendlebury 1933 = part 1; Eccles et al. 1933 = part 2; Money-Coutts and Pendlebury 1933 = part 3.</page><page sequence="251">OTHER EARLY MINOAN POTTERY FROM KNOSSOS 241 floor deposits, although a few vessels that are supposed to be from the Early Houses may perhaps be EM IIA (and may even come from other contexts in the Palace area).

We also present a drawing of 1182. We have already discussed dark grey burnished ware in its EM I (p. 27) and/or EM II (p. 96) contexts, as have Wilson and Day and, recently, Betancourt.17 There is little to add to their excellent accounts. We note below how it can be seen to differ from light grey ware in very much the way that Middle Helladic Argive Minyan ware differs from Grey Minyan ware. TYPE 1. CHALICES 1179-1183 The bell shape of pedestal 1179 is an interesting addition to the repertoire of EM I chalices. We do not know of parallels either at Knossos or elsewhere in Crete. It is somewhat reminiscent of a woman's skirt (to which there could be an allusion). 1181 has a trough spout, comparable with those on bowl jar 1267 in brown burnished ware and on light grey ware carinated goblets from the WCH and Mochlos.18 As these are all EM IIA, we could perhaps assign 1181 to EM IIA rather than EM I. 1179 (AM 1909.342b).

Rim 1182 has an unusual interior pattern burnish motif of concentric circles that seem to form spirals separated by a vertical wavy line (or chevrons). This has a remarkably close parallel in a pattern burnish chalice from Arkalochori, with decoration that Hazzidakis described as 'irregular spiral ornament'.19 Evans, presumably thinking of the knots in wood, saw it as showing wood graining, which Pendlebury accepted tentatively.20 Frankfort regarded it as a (carelessly executed) 'purely geometrical design'.21 Both this chalice and that from Arkalochori have the spiral(s) on the inside of the bowl. On the outside, the Arkalochori chalice has pattern burnish decoration of horizontal lines below the rim and then vertical lines. It is not impossible that they were made in the same workshop, as companion pieces or even a matching pair. At any rate these chalices, together with the EM IIA dark-on-light fragment (probably of a jug) 1295 and a bowl base from the WCH,22 are probably the earliest representations of the spiral in the long history of the motif in Minoan Crete, taking it back through EM IIA to EM I. 1183 (K.II.i 922) fig. 10.2, plate 53.

AE.757.1 has a diagonal cross below the EM IIA rather than EM I. Early Minoan IIA LIGHT grey ware This distinctive, self-slipped fabric, where the surface is (normally) the same light grey as the clay, makes a strong contrast with dark grey burnished ware. Thorough descriptions and petrographic characterisations of it already exist; and many pieces in the SMK have been published, as 'fine grey ware', a hall mark of EM IIA.25 Among the rare EM I examples of this ware are 1183 above and the suspension pot fragment 109 from the Palace Well. We present below some pieces from Knossos that have not been published or barely published (such as 1194), or have appeared with photographs but not drawings, or where other information can be added. Light grey ware has been known by various names. Evans called it 'grey ware',26 as did Pendlebury, who described the fabric at Trapeza as 'powdery', and remarked that it is 'either so soft that it crumbles to nothing or so brittle that it flakes away like slate', and that 'the surface is sometimes polished to a blacker tone'.27 Xanthoudides similarly remarked on the dark surface of two suspension pots in Koumasa T. B: 'blacker than the clay in the break, so that it looks as if the potter had enhanced the surface by some application of black or by smoking the pots in the baking.'28 Another possibility is that they had been darkened by fumigations in the tomb.29 Warren called the fabric 'fine grey ware' at Fournou Korifi,30 but it is 'pale grey burnished ware' in the catalogue.31 At Ayia Kyriaki Blackman and Branigan used 'incised grey ware', emphasising that there it is not burnished but lightly polished.32 Some of their 'grey burnished ware', which they distinguish from 'dark burnished ware', is almost certainly light grey ware.33 We believe that light grey ware is the best term: it both emphasises the homogeneous colour of both surface and body (which is its most immediately striking characteristic, as with Grey Minyan ware), and at the same time separates it from dark grey burnished ware — which, with its typical red core and olive green to dark grey or black surface, is comparable to so-called Argive Minyan pottery. Light grey ware is an instantly recogisable product of high quality, with its well finished (finely burnished) appearance, rarity at Knossos and elsewhere, and small range of shapes. In every respect except for its grey colour and a tendency to be somewhat soft, it is like the fine painted ware of EM IIA discussed below. Wilson and Day have established that it comes from probably a neighbouring (or not too distant) production centre to the centre(s) that produced the fine painted ware,34 both in the Mesara. Consequently, the light grey ware vessels at Knossos are imports, as holds for almost all of the fine painted vessels.35 All were probably high-value products, especially as many of the shapes in light grey ware were also being produced in dark grey burnished ware36 — making the light grey ware versions something different and special, of high quality and relatively exotic origin. 24 LM 51.105.73: Mee and Doole 1993, 25: 276. 26 Wilson and Day 1994, esp. 4-23, 77-81; cf.

They are also the most frequent shape at Knossos48 — and with other light grey ware from Debla, Mochlos, Myrtos-Fournou Korifi and Pyrgos, Trapeza and Vasiliki, as well as at the least Kalo Chorio and Palaikastro-Kastri in the list above, demonstrate that the ware (i) has a variety of shapes, (ii) is often without incised decoration, and (iii) does occur in settlement contexts. The suspension pot and its lid form the predominant shape with incised decoration; but, outside Knossos, other incised shapes are pedestalled suspension pots (essentially the suspension pot on a stand) as from Koumasa T. T,49 a side-spouted jar that might belong with type 16 bowl-jars,50 and large collar-necked jars such as from Vasiliki.51 This last type seems to be an expanded suspension pot, but none is complete beyond the neck and shoulder. Lug handle 1204 (a bow-handle vertically pierced at either end) may come from such a large vessel, as it is like the lugs on the Vasiliki jar and is too big to have come from a typical small suspension pot. Vessels with incised decoration were burnished, like the non-incised shapes, and also incised before firing. Our list below of pieces from Knossos in no way supersedes that of Wilson and Day,52 but should be taken together with theirs, which includes the finds from the WCH53 and Warren's RRS excavations.54 EM II TYPE 1A. CUP WITH LARGE LOOP HANDLE ll86 For full discussion of this infrequent type — the dipper cup — see pp. 102 and ns. 44-57; 167 (a possible example in EM III deposit A5), and 1301 below (which may go back to EM IIA, despite its likely EM IIB context in the Early Houses). 1186 seems at present unique in light grey ware, at Knossos or anywhere else in Crete, although similar cups are known in dark grey burnished ware from the WCH,55 and from Warren's excavations on RRS in EM IIA dark-on-light painted ware with, apparentiy, a rounded base.56 Cup 1186 has an incurving rim, rounded body and a large handle that describes an oval loop. The handle is pierced at both junctions with the body, a feature also of the lug handles of suspension pots and of EM II jugs: these holes were made probably to ensure more consistent firing at such thick points. 1186 (E.I.g 622) fig. 10.3 plate 53.

Their clay is said to be homogeneous grey, and they are described as totally Cycladic in character. It is unlikely that they are of light grey ware.

SUSPENSION POTS ETC. 1198-1210 One of the earliest light grey ware suspension pots known from Crete is 109 from the Palace Well (EM I type 14). If it seems to have an unusually high collar (in relation to its presumed body diameter), similarly proportioned collars are a feature of these vessels in this ware.57 More frequently, however, the collar necks are low, and either vertical or with a concave profile, splaying slightly at the top (as do the large type 13 collar-necked water jars from the Palace Well). Often there is an indentation (or groove) at the base of the collar-neck and/or a horizontal ledge (as on 1199), to hold the lid more firmly. Two types of lug-handles occur. The common type (the bow-handle) is horizontal and describes a bow (or shallow arch) shape, and is vertically pierced at either end where it joins the body of the vessel.58 The purpose of this was to tie down a lid. The alternative is found on 1199: a horizontally pierced lug, of a wart shape known also in the cave of Eileithyia. These pots were both burnished and incised before firing. Sometimes the burnishing was a second stage, where the incisions are as smooth and shallow and burnished as, in general, the unincised surface: e.g. 1201. But the incisions can also be deep and straight, and done with a sharp but fairly thick-pointed instrument through the already burnished surface. If there is then no further burnishing, it counteracts the original burnishing and can lead to flaking of the surface; and on several fragments the original surface has now vanished for this reason. Marks were also stamped with a wedge-shaped instrument — the Kerbschnitt punctuation technique found both as short, often triangular jabs (e.g. 1198) and, with the steady application of more hand pressure, as longer triangles with a tail that becomes shallower (e.g. plate 53: 793). Wilson and Day suggest the use of a combed stamping tool,59 which we believe is unlikely for these triangular jabs but not, of course, impossible: it would be quite cumbersome and difficult to cut a multiple implement with such relatively complicated marks out of wood. On the other hand, a combed tool might well have been used for incising multiple horizontal and vertical lines and semicircles. The usual decorative schemes consist of: bands of diagonal lines, herring-bone and cross-hatching/ latticework, often defined by thin lines; punctuation, in both triangular (wedge-shaped) and simpler rectangular forms; and concentric semicircles with the field filled with punctuation. The most interesting example of the latter is the large fragment 1203 first noticed by Pendlebury, which has concentric semicircles above and below a central line: these overlap to give a somersaulting effect, paralleled on a small globular suspension pot from Pyrgos. Decoration in vertical panels is not so common as the horizontal schemes: examples include 793 (fig. 10.4, plate 53) from a later level in RRN (p. 191), and 1199. A suspension pot with incised decoration from Thera seems the sole known export in Cretan light grey ware.60 1198 (D.III.i 503) fig. 10.4, plate 53. Body frag, with bow-handle, doubly pierced.

Burnished outside only; probably from a jug. BROWN BURNISHED WARES Brown burnished ware comes in two fabrics that are probably related to two different ceramic traditions. In both cases, the pottery is rare and quite distinctive. One fabric is light brown burnished ware, a soft, light red-brown or tan coloured clay with a similar surface, which is probably akin to light grey ware; the other is brown burnished ware, a harder reddish clay, akin to that of dark grey burnished ware, with a dark red-brown or dark tan coloured surface, which is burnished, usually with the stroke marks apparent. A few pieces from Area A are presented above. The most interesting is lid 196 (Ai) in the soft, light brown version of the ware: it is identical to one in the SMK (B.I.8 226). Other pieces include 191, 193-196 and, perhaps, 268 (Ai); also perhaps 287 (A2); and 711-714 and 716-717 (A8). There are very few pieces from Bi and B2. SMK examples of soft, light brown burnished ware also include goblet 1264, with a slight beading at the rim, which is also found on a similar conical pedestal base (but does not occur in dark grey burnished ware); goblet 1265 with what seems to be an indented (or sunken) base, or possibly a ring base, with a pattern burnish cross in the hollow; and bowl 1266 with internally thickened rim. Everted rim 1268 (D. 20) may come from ajar with a baggy body shape like suspension pots or from a type 19 collar-necked jar. 64 Wilson and Day 1994, 22-3.</page><page sequence="267">OTHER EARLY MINOAN POTTERY FROM KNOSSOS 1264 y 1266 1269 1268 Fig. 10.8.

FINE PAINTED WARE (BUFF WARE) Fine painted (buff) ware of EM IIA is among the most distinctive ceramic products of third millennium Crete, and the quality of the best pieces of this handmade ware is as high as that of any Late Minoan pottery. We have discussed the ware briefly above (p. 96) while, with light grey ware, it has received a thorough study from Wilson and Day.67 They argue that both this ware and light grey ware are likely imports into Knossos from the Mesara, and that they are especially frequent in deposits of EM IIA early. The remarks that follow are some small additions to what they have written, together with further illustrations. Fine painted ware appears to be of the same clay as light grey ware but, having been fired in oxidising conditions, has often a pale yellow-buff to greenish colour. The difference of colour and firing between the two wares, taken with the similarity of the clay, is comparable to that between the Yellow Minyan and Grey Minyan wares of Middle Helladic;68 and these two EM wares are comparable in the quality of their production to the MH wares. It appears, however, that, although light grey ware and fine painted ware are closely akin, they were probably produced in different, but presumably nearby, workshops rather than both coming out of the same workshop(s).69 This ware has often been known as 'Koumasa ware',70 as Koumasa has produced well known examples of it,71 and there is a concentration of it in the Mesara, where this pottery was most likely produced.72 The number of pieces, however, from the WCH and in the SMK show that more of this fine ware has been found at Knossos — in settlement contexts — than used to be thought. There may also have been a locally produced version of the ware, which stands out for not having a greenish tinge to the clay but, if anything, a pinkish tinge instead, and for not being of quite the same fine quality as the best examples of fine painted ware, although still sharing their repertoire of shapes and decoration. As with Vasiliki ware, there were then probably other workshops besides the central ones, and these may well have included Knossos or somewhere nearby in north-central Crete. But it is sometimes hard to know whether to assign vessels to the Mesara workshop (s) or if they are of extra-Mesara manufacture. A well levigated clay fired to shades of pale lemon yellow, buff and pale green is typical. A few fragments have a green fabric throughout. Others have a pale yellow to buff core, sometimes with shades of red, pink or grey (which may indicate a local variant). More fired examples tend to be pinkish-yellow outside, and may have a dark grey core, while the paint (normally black, deep brown or brown) may change to red. There does not seem to be an applied slip.73 More likely, the potters smoothed the vessels with their hands when wet from working the clay, in the 'self-slipped' technique. The vessels were then burnished with horizontal strokes, which have usually been so finely done that the individual strokes are visible only on close examination. 67 Wilson and Day 1994, 23-42; see also Wilson 2007, 61, 69. Other sites to add to their list include: Eileithyia cave (Marinatos 19290, 96-9, fig. 1) and Kyparissi (Serpeditsaki 2006, 246, 256, fig. 2γ). 68 Jones 1986, 414. 69 Cf.

Other shapes are: a likely goblet of EM II type 2 or 3; bowls assignable to EM II types 6 and 8; collar-necked jars, probably of EM II type ig; and a lid, probably of EM II type 21.74 To these Wilson and Day add suspension pots ('pyxides'), citing two examples that do not seem completely convincing as canonical fine painted ware, partly for their shape, partly since neither has the indicative decorative fashion of blobs along the inside of the rim.75 To this pair we can, however, probably add one more example, from K.I.6 909,76 and then group this trio with 1289-1290, which we have placed as type 19 collar-necked jars, while not ruling out the possibility that some or all of them may be from (large) suspension pot-like vessels (as may be the case for 1268 in brown burnished ware). Lattice or crosshatching is the usual decorative motif, either as a continuous zone or inside triangles, and defined by horizontal, and sometimes vertical, bands. Crossing isolated diagonal lines also occur, usually as pairs. An horizontal band below the rim outside is normal, while small blobs along the rim on the inside seem to be standard, especially on the Mesara pieces. The decoration often becomes untidy near the base. EM II TYPE 2. FOOTED GOBLET (?) 1271 1271 is an incurving rim sherd probably best assigned to a footed goblet of EM II type 2 (but Wilson and Day, if they are referring to this piece, regard it as from a bowl; see also below). Note its green fabric. The WCH has produced similar rims (one with a green fabric), and one pedestal stem from a kylix like footed goblet.77 Stem 261 (Ai) (p. 141) is probably not of Mesara manufacture on account of its grey fabric and orange surface, and may be from the Knossos region. Likewise, E.I.7 620 has a goblet fragment with thickened rim in buff burnished ware, with profile like Wilson and Day's FP 1 (see n. 77) but a red line (not blobs) on the rim inside: it does not look like an import from the Mesara. 1271 (K.I.6 894) fig. 10.9. D. 9.5. Notably green fabric, with marked sand in the green core. Probably Wilson and Day 1994, 30: FP 56 (unillustrated); but the decoration on 1271 of crossing diagonals is like 1280 below rather than the parallel they cite (Wilson and Day 1994, 29-30, fig. 3: FP 55) for their FP 56. The box also has a likely body frag. EM II TYPE 6. DEEP BOWLS: (c) TAPERING RIM (?) 1272-1273 Two unusual bowl rims are probably best grouped here. 1272 stands out for the 'fringing' style in its untidy decoration: Wilson and Day suggest that it may be a 'rather free' Cretan imitation of EC decorated sauceboats.78 1273 appears to come from an early, and perhaps unique for Early Minoan, example of a basket-shaped vessel or kalathos with handles rising above the rim.79 Its fabric is like 1293, which might suggest that it is not of sufficient quality to count as fine painted buff ware. It does, however, have blobs inside the rim; and perhaps it is is best to see it as a local variant of the canonical ware. 1272 (K.I.6 896) fig. 10.9, plate 56. Incurving rim internally thickened.

Handle decoration in dark red to brown/black paint: lattice panels between bands. An indentation in the side to the left of the handle may indicate a (rounded) corner — a possibly rectangular vessel possibly with rounded corners, perhaps a pyxis. EM TYPE 8. BOWL WITH FLARING RIM 1274 Rim fragment 1274 is probably from a type 8A shallow bowl with flaring rim, and probably a Knossos region product, on the grounds of its grey-pink core and pink burnished outside surface; but the buff burnished interior is reminiscent of the Mesara. 74 Not in Wilson and Day's (1994) lists for the shapes of fine painted ware at Knossos are types 2/3 (if that is what 1271 is), 6 (the likely basket-shaped vessel or kalathos 1273), and perhaps 19 (but see discussion above). 75 Wilson and Day 1994, 32: FP 96 (Wilson 1985, 311-12, fig. 16, pi. 32: P 120); 32-3, fig. 4: FP 97. 76 Wilson 1984, 191, pi. 51C top, calling it a collar-necked jar. 77 Wilson 1985, 309, 311, fig. 16: Pi 10-116, esp. rim Pi 14 (Wilson and Day 1994, 25: FP 1), with green fabric, and stem Pi 16; cf. too Wilson and Day 1994, 29-30, fig. 3: FP 55 (K.I.7 911). 78 For an interim review of EC II imports at Knossos, with references, see Wilson 2007, 69-70. 79 Possible later parallels could include, for example: MM IIB Malia, Quartier Mu: Poursat and Knappett 2005, 77, fig. 23: 4a b; 85-6, pis. 30, 52: 1174-5; or MM IIIA West Polychrome Deposits at Knossos (MacGillivray 1998, 138, pi. 10: 306; 2007, 144-9 for date).</page><page sequence="270">KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN 1271 1272 1274 1278 1284 1275 \ 3 \ V 1289 A 1292 1293 Fig. 10.9.

ETC. 1289-1291 Two rim fragments 1289-1290 can probably be included here, although their collars/everted rims are low and their bodies look curving or baggy. They seem comparable in rim shapes to two fine painted ware jars from the WCH (also surviving as only rim or rim and shoulder fragments), if slightly larger.80 These two WCH jars differ, however, from 1289-1290 in not having the canonical row of blobs along the inside of the rim; instead, they have triangles (blank or latticework) pendent from the rim. Alternatively, one might see 1289-1290 as (large) suspension pots — which would mirror our uncertainty about typing 1268 (above) in brown burnished ware. 1289 (N.IV.8 1258) FIG. 10.9, plate 56: inside.

D. 22. Greenish surface outside, greenish buff inside. Burnishing visible on rim: originally perhaps burnished overall outside. Paint fugitive, originally black: inside line and row of dots to rim; outside band below rim and cross-hatching. Body fragment 1291 is unusual for its vertical decoration of zones of chevrons. Perhaps it is from a jug, perhaps a suspension pot? 1291 (K.I.6 909) plate 56. LIDS 1292-1293 Lid 1292 with its vertical sides and neat appearance could fit easily onto a collared type of jar such as 1289 (although that particular example has a greater diameter); and the two concentric rows of blobs are a distinctive feature. The fabric might suggest that it is another local variant. 1292 (E.I.7 618) fig. 10.9, plate 56. Ht 1.4. D. 11. Well fired, well levigated fine pink-buff clay, burnished on top, smoothed on side.

It was probably intended, like the EM I type 16 lids, to cap jars with low vertical collars or necks and would have been tied down through a pair (or, more likely, two pairs) of string-holes. We have not given this shape an EM II type number nor does it appear in the EM II—III type chart (fig. 5.1), as we found no example of it in our excavations. 1293 comes from a test pit of 1905 at the Ε end of Bay 4 of the North-East Magazines, which Wilson placed in 2007 in EM IIA late.81 In publishing this lid in 1994, Wilson and Day assigned it to fine painted ware,82 but it may be safer to see it as a borderline case — as one might also extrapolate from Wilson's 2007 discussion of the coarser fabrics in dark-on-light ware. Certainly, the clay of this lid is not so well levigated as the best EM IIA fine painted ware, and its decoration, even if it includes a row of blobs, is cruder: it is hard to see it as a high quality product of the Mesara. All the same, it is burnished inside and out and, if not of the best execution, must have been intended for a jar of some quality. It is probably sensible to move it from fine painted ware to the class of painted semifine to coarse ware, following Wilson and Day's 1994 classification.83 Parallels are hard to find for the decorative motif of radiating 'ladders' (albeit with diagonal crossbars), of which there may originally have been eight. The concentric semicircles rising on the shoulder have many parallels in light grey ware with incised decoration and, in painted ware, on a bowl from Mochlos,84 to which this lid is similar in its combination of free-standing cicrular and linear motifs. 1293 (K.I.7 910; NB.

COLLAR-NECKED JAR WITH HORIZONTAL SIDE-HANDLES 1204 A large collar-necked jar or amphora 1294 with a flaring rim, tall neck, piriform body, and horizontal handles set at more or less its widest part (just below the shoulder) was found in many pieces in 1964. It is among the earliest more or less complete Minoan amphorae, lacking only its base — which may have been flat, as on a similar vessel with similar decoration from Pyrgos.85 It comes from K.II.5 931, the top metre beneath the later floor at the Ε end of the North-East Hall tested in 1903: this box also produced the light grey ware suspension pot 1203 and a horned stand 1299. We assign 1294 to EM IIA. The amphora has a hard, gritty fabric. Its shape is like EM II type 19, but seems also closely related to, or derived from, our EM I type 13 — although only a few jar necks could be identified in the Palace Well: 101-104 (ΡΡ· 44-5)· 1294 seems to have a more evolved shape: its neck has a flaring profile, and a larger body than we could expect on the EM I jars. In shape and decoration it is close to the jar from Pyrgos, and fairly close to two jars (P326-327) from the WCH;86 but its handles are set slightly higher on the belly than on P327, and the lower body appears more curved. It also has a relatively shorter neck than the Pyrgos jar, which is however considerably smaller (total Ht 22) and has a decoration of crossing broad stripes (and a cross on its flat base) as against the curving broad bands pendent from a broad horizontal band on 1294. Also comparable, in flaring shape and banded decoration, is another jar neck from the WCH, but that too is from a smaller vessel.87 In EM III (and perhaps into MM IA), rims of similar shape in the B3 deposit (p. 223: 1125) and whole vessels from the 'pit repository' in the Royal Pottery Stores,88 House Β in the West Court89 and, in the East Cretan EM III style, from Myrtos-Pyrgos90 emphasise the type's endurance or resurgence91 — and the continuing utility of this shape (and its oval-mouthed amphora successor). The isolated dot in the shoulder zone is familiar in both EM I and EM IIA. 81 Wilson 2007, 64-70. 82 Following Wilson 1984, 195, pi. 4gD bottom. 83 Cf.

The fabric, and similarity of the motif of freestanding spirals to the pattern burnish spirals of Arkalochori and Knossos (see 1182 and discussion), may suggest an EM I date; but Wilson and Day assign it, rightly in our view, to EM IIA, where an isolated spiral is also known on the interior base of a tripod bowl from the WCH, that is probably a Mesara import.92 1295 (K.I.7 915) plate 56.

HORNED STANDS 1296-1300 Horned stands are a distinctive product of EM IIA at Knossos and, to date, have been identified only at Knossos. However, this may not say so much about Knossos as one might first suppose, since their absence elsewhere may reflect their not having been recognised — which at Knossos did not happen until 1964 — rather than their non-existence. It would not be surprising if they should now be found at other sites. Among Evans's finds, we have noted 76 to 79 fragments in the following boxes: B.1.4 171 E.I.7 617-620 B.I.6 !94 E.I.9 622 B.I.8 226 E.II.6 646 B.I. 10 235 E.II.7 651 B.I. 15 275 E.II.8 657. 659 B.I.16 279-280 E.III.i 660 B.I. 17 307b-c K.I.2 874-875 B.I. 18 320 K.I.5 887-888, 890, 892 B.I 377 K.I.6 894-896, 907-909 B.II 4°5 K.II-5 93i D.III.i 502 Chronology Horned stands have been found throughout EM IIA at Knossos, in both early and late contexts,93 and were quite probably produced only during that time. From our deposits, 777 (A8) (plate 35) is probably EM IIA late. A few examples mentioned above from our EM IIB deposits should probably be seen as strays or antiques: A2: 403 (plate 42). Bi: 903 (two frags.): one in plate 42. B2(i): 1042 (two frags.): one in plate 42. 82(2): one frag. These stands have not been observed in the EM IIB material from Evans's, or Momigliano and Wilson's, excavations in the Early Houses, when the type 'seems to disappear'.94 Two examples in yet later contexts are almost certainly strays: B3 (EM III): 1135 (fig. 8.13, plate 47). RRS (MM IA): 8x7. Morphology Horned stands are difficult to describe as, like baking plates, none is complete. More survives of some stands from Evans's excavations than of those from our excavations at Knossos. The stands are made by hand in cooking pot ware, usually of a red to purple colour. Vertical parts of the stands tend to show the finger marks of vertical smooothing on their exposed sides. Parts that would not have been visible have been left rough, on the inside, or the underside when horizontal. This is a helpful clue in determining which side of a fragment was on top or on the outside. These horned stands are vertical standing objects whose precise shape we do not know. They have two or more horn-like projections rising from vertical walls which are mainly rectangular but often — if not always — rounded at the corners. For stability it is likely that they were either triangular or rectangular. The 'horns', of which there were probably three or four to a stand (four if rectangular), are slightly concave and curved triangular in outline, with a definite lip to their leading edge. At their base, they join a horizontal surface which has a rounded hole, or holes, in it: this feature is reminiscent of MM 'eggstands'.95 The vertical walls also have rounded holes, which seem to have been rather larger than those on the horizontal (eggstand-like) surface. 1300 appears to be from the horizontal 93 Wilson 2007, 61, 68-g, fig. 2.13: 10.

Vertical handles occur on other fragments.96 The stands seem to have been portable. None has any signs of burning. No base has been identified. They were probably open underneath. Since none is complete, it is dificult to ascertain their dimensions: a width of 30 to 50 seems likely. A loose count of those in the SMK suggests that smaller examples are around twice as frequent as larger examples. Some seem small but, as we cannot tell where their horned projections have broken off, may in fact have been large. fig. 10.11 shows three views of three horned stands (1296-1298): the drawings on the left of each trio show a (normal) section from an horizontal view, those in the middle the plan of the object, and those on the right the section from a vertical view. fig. 10.11 also shows an apparent example of a vertical handle (1300). We look forward to the discovery one day of a complete horned stand. Until then, one reconstruction has been proposed.97 96 Such as from K.I.6 907-909. 97 Wilson 2007, 68-g, fig. 2.13: 10.</page><page sequence="276">266 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN Function These objects could have been used as stands for ceramic, wooden or skin vessels, or baskets, to keep them off the floor and upright, or possibly to set over a hearth or fire hole to keep the contents warm. It may be, as Lamb suggested (following Ôzgiic) for somewhat similar stands from Kusura, Kiiltepe and Tabara el Akrad,98 that the reason why they do not have signs of burning is that, rather than being placed directly over a hot hearth, they just held embers brought from an oven or hearth nearby. (She then dismissed this explanation for the Kusura stands on the grounds that no source of embers was found nearby.) At any rate, if the stands were put over heat, the fire must have been low. The lack of signs of burning and the presence of a horizontal surface interrupted by a hole or holes (and in some cases apparently also having a vertical handle) make it most unlikely that horned stands were used for grilling meat placed directly on them — although they could have been used for roasting meat in a domed oven. Soups and stews would presumably have been cooked in tripod pots, whose appearance is another feature of EM II in central and eastern Crete — but note the (still unique) tripod foot from Debla I." If the stands did hold pots, then the specific purpose of the horns would have been to prevent the pots' toppling over. Lamb favours an explanation of this sort for the stands she discusses;100 if that is correct, one could disassociate these stands altogether from ash, ovens and cooking or keeping food warm over a gentle heat, leaving these objects as simply pot stands.101 One comparable object in the EBA Aegean is from EH III Asine from the bothros on the 'pre-Mycenaean terrace', identified by the excavators as a stand for round-bottomed vessels.102 There are no obvious ritual links for EM horned stands, or connections with Old Palace or New Palace so-called 'horns of consecration'. They seem to have been a regular part of Knossian domestic life only in EM II, and probably only in EM IIA. We may perhaps explain their appearance as part of the changes and progress in food preparation that seem to have occurred in EM IIA.103 That they did not continue thereafter makes it unlikely that they were somehow forebears of the horns of consecration.

Early Minoan IIB (PM I, 73, fig. 40, and other EM IIB pottery probably from the Early Houses) We were able to study in Herakleion, Oxford and New York the mostly whole pots that make up this composite photograph of pottery that Evans and Mackenzie found in the Early Houses and publish them here, in effect for the first time. Their likely context and the EM IIB pottery that we found in the Houses have already been discussed (Chapters 4, 8). It is, however, not always clear which are the pots shown in the photograph; but we have tried to identify them or show the probabilities. It is also not completely certain, but still likely, that all the pots in Evans's photograph are from the Early Houses.104 Zois seemed to incline towards what would be an EM IIA date for some (or all?) of the pottery photographed.105 This would be surprising if these pots are all from the Early Houses, but more understandable if Evans introduced a few from other parts of Knossos into the composition. EM II and other Minoan pottery from Knossos also reached the British Museum, Musées Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire in Brussels and National Musuem in Copenhagen. In the two latter cases at least, as for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it came from Evans himself and/or the Ashmolean Museum: for the MMA in 1911 in exchange for Cypriot material that had been purchased by subscription,106 and 98 Lamb 1956, 90-1, figs. 1-3.

Evans probably saw an opportunity here to spread knowledge of the then barely known Minoan pottery of Knossos and its sequence.108 It is highly likely that the two EM IIB bowls 1324-1325 and an EM IIB jug 1333 in the MMA come from the Early Houses — and we believe that 1325 is shown in PMI, fig. 40. Among the sherds that the MRAH received, 1340 and 1345 would also be at home in the Early Houses, as 1341-1342 in the LM could be too. A large amount of EM IIB pottery fragments from the Early Houses now in the SMK has already been published by Wilson and Day,109 and forms one of the three assemblages (together with our deposits B1-B2 and what Momigliano and Wilson excavated in 1993) of Wilson's EM IIB South Front Group.110 What we present here complements the study by Wilson and Day We see PM I, fig. 40 as follows, row by row, from left to right: Top row 1.

We think this is unlikely, but we cannot exclude some mixing in composing the photograph. In particular, the loop-handle cup 1301 is a candidate for being an EM IIA type like 1186 in light grey ware (see discussions above, and on p. 102). On the other hand, its finish with a smoothed and lustrous thick red wash might suggest a local ceramic product related to Vasiliki ware, and thus support a date in EM IIB. Its undifferentiated base, however, tends to be an earlier feature. EM II TYPE 1A. CUP WITH LARGE LOOP HANDLE 1301 Dipper cup 1301 may perhaps be EM IIA rather than IIB. If so, it is likely to come from some place at Knossos other than the Early Houses. 107 Natacha Massar, pers. comm. 108 The MMA received a further nearly whole Minoan goblet from Knossos (MMA 21.100.3 = 1350) in 1921, the gift of George M. Whicher. The museum also has a collection of light grey, dark grey burnished and Vasiliki ware sherds (MMA 07. 232-34~43): these are unlikely to be from Knossos and were acquired four years before the pottery from the AM. 109 \\rilson an(j £)ay iggg. 110 Wilson 2007, 70-1, fig. 2.14.</page><page sequence="278">KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN Fig. 10.12.

JUGS WITH CUTAWAY SPOUT 1332-1336 (i) Buff ware, with dark-on-light decoration Jugs of this type from the Early Houses have been well described and discussed by Wilson,112 albeit only as fragments and not complete vessels. 1332, however, is a complete example from the Early Houses, and we imagine that this is the provenance also of 1333, which is closely similar to it. For further discussion of 1332-1335, see p. 113 above; and for 1332-1333 cf. also 373-383 (A2) and 995-998 (Ba). 1332 (AM 1910.145; PMl, fig. 40, top row, middle). plate 64. Ht 21.3. D. body 15.6.

Zois (1968a, 93; 1969, 42) assigned this to EM IIA, comparing jugs from Malia, Charnier I (Demargne 1945, 3: 3, pi. 2 centre) and Vasiliki (Boyd Hawes et al. 1908, 50, pi. 12: 20; Zois 1967a, pi. 2g: 3725).

(ii) Dark wash ware If it is correct that pottery that had been kept usually as sherds in the SMK is not included in PM I, fig. 40, then there is likely to have been a third jug of this type, which is shown at the left end of the third row. If, however, fig. 40 does include pottery that Evans kept in the SMK, then this jug could be either 1335 or one of two similar, but slightly smaller, jugs discussed below with 1335. 1334 (AM 1910.158; PMl, fig. 40, top row, second from left) fig. 10.12, plate 64.

OTHER EARLY MINOAN II POTTERY FROM KNOSSOS TYPE 6. DEEP BOWL 1340 1340 is one of 58 fragments from Knossos received by the MRAH in Brussels in 1913 by exchange with the AM. Evans and Hogarth selected the pieces — which still have their original AM numbers, e.g. AE 758.13.114 1340 looks to be the rim of a type 6 bowl, and could easily come from the Early Houses. Among other pieces from Knossos that came to Brussels are also 1343 (grouping three fragments) and 1345. 1340 (MRAH A2008). CVA Belgium 3, Brussels 3, pi. 99: 2° TYPE 8a.

Marks on footed goblet bases In EM IIB painted marks are a regular occurrence on the underside of type 2 footed goblets, with more in dark-on-light than in light-on-dark.

Decoration: cross on bowl base 1347 Shallow bowl bases in both dark-on-light ware with crosses painted usually on the underneath, but sometimes on the inside, and often in red, and likewise in light-on-dark are a known feature of EM IIB Knossian tableware.118 Putting the cross on the underside suggests that such bowls were decorated so as to be noticed, whether hanging on pegs on the wall or placed upside down on a table or shelf.119 Examples include 344, 852 (and 853 in white-on-dark), 951, and one from E.II.1-2 639. 1331, which is one of several from the Early Houses,120 can be paralleled in 1347. 1347 (E.III.2 663) plate 39.

It was found in a test pit 30 m north of the Theatral Area, and so not far from our Area A122 — where our earliest example of the painted motif, albeit in multiple form, is probably 266 (Ai). Another example is a cross inside and out on a fine painted ware bowl base.123 The motif is also found in pattern burnish. To two examples that Wilson cites,124 we can add (from above) 1254, a type 16 bowl-jar in dark grey burnished ware,125 and 1265, a light brown burnished ware goblet. Other instances from our excavations date to EM IIB: 344 (A2), a type 8 deep flaring bowl, and 853 (Bi), a type 9 bowl; and they occurred in B2 contexts in the Early Houses (p. 212 above). MINIATURE BOWL 1347A The miniature bowl 1347A (plate 65) is of unknown provenance at Knossos. It is basically a plain bowl with a dark line around the rim rising from a larger vessel with a dark wash. It may date to EM IIB, as does 350 (A2), or to EM III. EARLY MINOAN III We present some Early Minoan III eggcup goblets, now in Copenhagen, London, New York or Oxford, and a very small selection of other pottery from Knossos.126 TYPE 2. FOOTED GOBLETS (EGGCUPs) 1348-1352 While it is difficult to separate EM III from MM IA footed goblets when they are isolated from their original context,127 we believe that 1348-1352 are likely to be EM III,128 on the general grounds of their quality. 1348A is recorded in the AM register as being from the Early Houses — which could favour an EM III date; and 1352 is from the 'pit-repository' in the Royal Pottery Stores, which Momigliano has assigned to EM III (UEW Group), presenting as fall a reconstruction as possible of the group, much of which is still in the SMK.129 Besides goblets, cups, bowls, jugs and jars etc., it includes more eggcups (in the SMK). In 1905 Evans included an eggcup among various objects he exported from Crete to England. Marked 'F at the time and sketched, probably by Hazzidakis,130 it is probably one of 1348, 1349 or 1352, but not 1348A.131 1348 (MMA 11.186.5) F1G- 10.16, PLATE 65. Ht 8.25. D. rim 7.5. D. base 4.65.

GOBLET 1355 Rim 1355 is included for its decoration of fine incised latticework on a broad reserved band on a dark wash goblet, a feature encountered on jars 1140-1141 (B3), but rare, if not as yet unparalleled, on a goblet. The fragment is reported in the AM register as coming from the N.E. rubbish heap, which must be the North-East Kamares Area. 1355 (AM 1938.420). Ht. pres. 5.9. Brown to dark brown framed by a white line immediately above the band on the wash. Broad reserved band with incised latticework, possibly wash, and another immediately below, likewise on the wash. TYPE 16A. SMALL SPOUTED BOWL-JARS 1356-1360 It is uncertain whether to place 1356 here as an EM III product or in EM IIB as Vasiliki ware (see below). Forsdyke, aware of the dilemma, saw it as inferior Vasiliki ware that continued into EM III, and wrote of the degeneration of the style: 'Extravagant beaks were curtailed, long tubes cut down to short bridged-spouts.'145 He saw a close parallel from the UEW that Mackenzie had illustrated. Since that jar/ jug cannot now be located, and there were two others like it that are also missing,146 it is possible that 1356 is one of this trio of bowl-jars with single vertical handles (type 16A). We have one certain instance — 1105 — of this type in the B3 deposit, and up to four of 16B with horizontal handles (see 1104,1106). There are several rims of type 16 in A5, almost all with a dark wash: see 607-617. i357-i36° may well also be EM III and, in view of their small rim diameters, are probably best grouped here. 1356 (BM A434). Forsyke 1925, 76, fig. 92, comparing Mackenzie 1903, 167, fig. 1: 12 (Momigliano 1991, 163, pl. 18: 38). However, Betancourt (1979, 51: X.C — Teapots with short spouts without pedestal bases — Knossos 1) saw it as Vasiliki ware, albeit with a 'poor surface', classing it with two vessels from Myrtos-Fournou Korifi (Warren 1972 a, 151, 202-03, figs. 86-7: P669 (with ring base), P670) and one from Mochlos (Seager 1912, 83, fig. 48: 44; Betancourt 1979, 51, pl. 5C: X.C Mochlos 1; Maraghiannis 1911, pl. 10 bottom right). The one from Mochlos looks EM III, with its punctuated decoration on reserved zones combined with a Vasiliki ware-like surface for the rest of the outside of the vessel. See also discussion of the Vasiliki ware-like appearance of bowls in A5 (such as 589: p. 170). 139 The context is probably MM IA in Knossian terms. 140 Warren 1965, 26; Dawkins et al. 1905, 271; Liverpool cup (source: R.

One of these is 1361, from Room 1 of House A below the Kouloures, of which we present a photograph.

POT STAND (?) 1362 We include 1362 here which, with its vertical sides and diameter of about 24, may have been a ring stand for holding large vessels. It is probably dated best to EM III-MM IA, without attempting to decide between the periods. Todaro has recently published some parallels from Phaistos, which she assigns to MM I and sees as further evidence for pottery production in Prepalatial times and later to the west of the Palace.149 1362 (B.II.2 380) fig. 10.16.

SOME OTHER EARLY MINOAN ARTEFACTS FROM KNOSSOS A few other Early Minoan artefacts have been noted in the SMK.

The mat impression 1366 on the base of a large vessel is probably EM IIA (late) in view of its provenance. Comparanda are as yet extremely rare in Crete, but there is a mat impression on the base of a larnax from Burial Building 18 at Archanes-Fourni apparently of MM II date.150 Mat impressions are well known in the Cyclades, from LN (Saliagos) and FN (Kephala, Kea) through EC and MC and into LC, and occur in mainland Greece.151 1363 (B.I.31 372) plate 50.

Instead, this chapter will attempt to show how the pottery from our excavations, period by period, fits the sequence proposed in the Handbook,* and then to pick out some details, issues and trends in the history of the EM pottery of Knossos that either seem to need further discussion or that have become especially apparent to us in studying the pottery of the three excavations. Chapter 12 will then review the Early Minoan history of the settlement of Knossos in the light of our excavations. We realise that judgements (including those in the Handbook and ours in this volume) may have to be revised once several studies and excavations have been fully published. We await (i) Tomkins's definitive study of the Neolithic pottery sequence of Knossos, and the final reports on (ii) the trials made in 1987 by Evely, Fotou and Hood behind the Throne Room and w of the North Lustral Basin with EM I pottery, and by Peatfield by the EM III wall at the nw corner of the Palace, (iii) Warren's EM excavations in RRS, (iv) the excavations in Poros-Katsambas, and (v) the EM ceramic petrography of Knossos.2 Also in the offing are the reports on various excavations connected with the conservation of the Palace or accounts of the pottery.3 These will all have important information for the ceramic history and the history of Knossos, which may modify present interpretations. EARLY MINOAN I The pottery from deposits 1 and 2 of the Palace Well seems to represent a full range of shapes for a settlement context, with vessels for consuming (chalices and perhaps pedestal bowls), preparing (baking plates), serving (probably pedestal bowls), pouring (jugs), collecting (large jugs) and storing (pithoi), as well as vessels for special purposes such as suspension pots. It was probably a domestic context within the settlement; but one cannot exclude the possibility of the settlement's also having a discrete shrine or shrines, with special pottery of its/their own, of which the fill in the Well is the debris. (This may skew our interpretations.) Any such shrine, of course, would be extremely hard, or impossible, to detect when we have only a fill, as is the case in the Well, but no buildings to connect it with. It is also hard to tell whether the pottery of deposits 1 and 2 represents what one household was using, or several, or the whole community, or whether people from outside Knossos also gathered on the Kephala hill for events.4 But in view of its quantity, we may be fairly certain that this was the pottery of more than one household on the hill; whether it was for the whole community, and even outsiders, is not so clear. Whatever its purpose in the community, this pottery from some sort of settlement context shows that some shapes, such as the suspension pot and its lid, that had seemed very much part of the Early Minoan cemetery repertoire do also occur in settlements, and in some quantity. An immediate issue in assessing deposits 1 and 2 of the Palace Well is where to place them in the EM I pottery sequence, which includes the issue of whether to divide EM I at Knossos into an EM IA and an EM IB, or not. Here it seems reasonable to take the two deposits together, although the water jugs and pithoi of deposit 1 are stratigraphically older — how much older in years we can never know — than the large amount of pottery in deposit 2. We can then address the issues of to what extent the pottery from the Well and elsewhere at Knossos shows continuity from the pottery of Neolithic Knossos and/or whether we have evidence for possible extra-Knossian influences in ceramic production or even immigrants, who might have included potters, from elsewhere in Crete or from outside the island. 1 Tomkins 2007; Wilson 2007; Momigliano 2007c. 2 Preliminary accounts include, Neolithic: Tomkins 2007; trials behind the Throne Room and by the nw Angle of the Palace: Catling 1974, 34; 1988, 68-9; Hood 1994; Wilson 1994, 29, 34, fig. 3; Manteli and Evely 1995, 4; RRS: Warren 1972b, 1973A, 1974; Catling 1972, 21; 1973, 26-8, fig. 59; 1974, 34, fig. 65; Poros-Katsambas: Dimopoulou-Rethemiotaki 2004; Dimopoulou Rethemiotaki et al. 2007; Wilson et al. 2004, 2008; ceramic petrography: Day and Wilson 2002, 2004; Wilson and Day 1994, 1999. 2000. 3 Cf. already Batten 1995; Efstratiou et al. 2004; Karetsou 2004, 2006; Wilson 2010. 4 As Todaro (forthcoming) suggests may have happened at Phaistos. 281</page><page sequence="292">282 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN When we first studied the pottery from the Well, we believed that it could be assigned to EM IA principally on the basis of the large pedestalled chalices and bowls, which appeared to represent the earliest phase of EM I that could be recognised at Knossos or anywhere else in Crete. Thereafter we saw a diminution in size of these pedestalled vessels — the chalices especially — and a transition from communal vessels for drinking and eating to individual vessels. The first stage of this shrinking process, which seemed to continue until the goblets and footed goblets of EM III and MM IA, could be observed in the slightly smaller size/capacity of these vessels in deposits such as the Pyrgos burial cave, where several of them have horizontal swellings (or ribs) and/or grooves or channellings on their stems (which are not found in the Well). This appeared on stylistic grounds to represent a phase that we characterised as EM IB.5 Such an EM IB phase was accepted by others studying the EM pottery of Knossos; and it was even suggested that the FF4 deposit below the West Court could be assigned there, representing a phase between the Palace Well and the West Court House.6 However, the study by Wilson and Day of the pottery from Poros-Katsambas at the mouth of the Kairatos river changed perceptions. 'EM IA' and 'EM IB' were found together,7 which led to their proposing an unitary and comprehensive, if fairly broad-based and somewhat fluid, EM I.8 For Knossos this has now been called the EM I Well Group.9 We accept this new view, and recognise that it it is not possible to define any specifically 'EM IB' deposits from Evans's excavations at Knossos, nor from ours. Hence it is safest at present to speak only of EM I as a whole, while recognising that it has to be a flexible term, at least until the details are published of both the Poros pottery and of that of the 1973 and 1987 trials behind the Throne Room and elsewhere in the north part of the Palace, where the initial reports have been of 'EM IB' pottery.10 Another cause for caution arises from Todaro's recent research at Phaistos, where she detects an EM IA phase and an EM IB phase,11 following two FN phases.12 (In one location an EM I building is set over a FN IV cooking installation.13) In her ten phase sequence (Phaistos I-X), Phaistos I corresponds to FN III at Knossos, and Phaistos II to FN IV. Phaistos III of early EM I is described as 'broadly contemporary' with the bottom level of Lebena T. II, and Phaistos IV with the second use level of Lebena T. II and the Piazzale dei Sacelli at Ayia Triada.14 The Palace Well would seem to match Phaistos IV. Likewise at the newly excavated site of Petras-Kephala Papadatos has found at least three architectural phases from FN IV into EM I, with 'no evidence for any dramatic event separating the various phases'.15 These translate into two main phases of occupation: FN IV and EM I. The EM I seems fairly early in the period, with correlations with deposits such as Partira or Palaikastro-Ayios Nikolaos that have often been called Final Neolithic or Sub-Neolithic (but are best placed in EM I)16 and again the earliest pottery from Lebena T. II rather than the Cycladic-influenced pottery from Ayia Fotia (which is nearby), Pyrgos, Poros-Katsambas, or Gournes. In the end Papadatos, like Todaro for Phaistos, prefers an EM IA and an EM IB division of the period. For Knossos we probably have to stick for the time being with an unitary EM I, although we did originally make the same EM IA-EM IB separation — and, in accord with this view, Room 45 behind the Throne Room was reported as having an EM IB deposit.17 The arguments for a unitary EM I must mean that the small FF4 deposit below the West Court belongs to the EM I Well Group,18 with which it has many similarities. One must emphasise, however, how small a deposit it is, perhaps the debris of a single household deposited at one moment, in comparison with the Well, which surely represents the debris of several households. There are also differences from the Well, notably among the bowls, with an absence of large pedestalled bowls, but also the presence of a deep bowl shape19 and a shallow bowl shape (the latter at least with a flat base)20 and an indented (or sunken) base,21 that do not appear in the Well, nor in the WCH. There are two good parallels from the Well, however, for the rim of the small shallow dish, which appears to have had this flat base (see under 19), while the indented base recalls ones of class C (fine black burnished) 5 Hood ig66, 1971, 36-8, fig. 14.

In FF4 there are then features that look both to the Palace Well and to EM IIA, while its strap handles are seen as similar to FN IV (Stratum IC) handles but not like the handles that occur in the Well — and may just hint at a date in EM I prior to the Well.24 The corollary of such comparisons is important. We cannot be strongly dirigiste in our assessments but must accept a fluidity, realising that various traits do not always slot easily into our chronological/ cultural divisions — but may make earlier or later appearances than the period of their principal popularity. This point is clear enough in the Palace Well, where the piece of a light grey ware suspension pot 109 is the biggest surprise, in view of the ware's being a hallmark of EM IIA, and especially EM IIA early. An effect of this, of course, is that it is not always easy to assign single sherds, divorced from a context to, say, EM I as against EM IIA; but we are on surer ground where there are reasonably secure contexts. We also have to recognise that at a settlement site such as Knossos, where many of the deposits appear to have been fills, there is always the possibility of admixture of earlier or later pieces — which we have tended to call strays in our accounts above of the deposits. When we turn to the origins of the EM I pottery styles as seen at Knossos, it is a mixed picture. An important, but small, group that needs fuller study comes from the Central Court where Mackenzie rightly observed that the upper level of houses in the Neolithic soundings of 1923-24 was in fact EM I — a view that Evans later discounted.25 This is then the one place at Knossos where they found EM I overlying Neolithic. Recently, Tomkins has agreed with this interpretation, assigning the EM I structures to Stratum IB and those below to Stratum IC of FN IV.26 Mackenzie was quite clear on the new character of the pottery in the upper level, comparing 'the advent of a new kind of polished surfaces' with the dark grey burnished ware from Pyrgos;27 and there were other typical EM I wares, including scored ware.28 Stratigraphically, the evidence is not detailed enough to say whether there was complete and uninterrupted continuity of occupation from FN IV into EM I. Tomkins suggests that the first of many levellings and reshapings of the Kephala hill happened in FN IV, that is 'immediately' before Stratum IC, with the creation of a cobbled area which he calls the Southeast Platform, as the first central gathering place at Knossos — or Court. This first phase came to end when an EM I surface was created on top of it, with a mixture of (redeposited) FN III-IV and of EM I pottery — and the creation of a considerably larger Court.29 We cannot say how these building works happened. Was it a peaceful transition within the same community? Was there a break? Had others arrived? We do not know. If it was a peacful transition, then the implicit massive change of culture within the community would be most remarkable. Mackenzie, who was in charge of these Central Court excavations, was in no doubt. Not only did the pottery of EM I show a break from the Neolithic, but so too did the construction techniques, the EM I building in the Central Court being much sloppier than the Neolithic building beneath.30 However, the plaster fragments in deposit 2 of the Well may include the first instance of lime plaster (as well as mud plaster), by contrast with the Neolithic which saw only mud plaster (p. 59 above). Whatever happened in the transition from FN to EM, there was manifestly continuity in the choice of the location of Knossos, as likewise at Phaistos.31 There can be no doubt that these places either remained in continuous use, or were (soon) recoccupied, as settlements. Either way, they were still valued presumably for their defensive and agricultural situation etc. and, more than likely, for such ideological reasons as capturing memory and tradition: here were places that had been lived in before, perhaps by known forebears who could be recalled in rituals or by storytelling at feasts and other gatherings, perhaps by enemies who had been vanquished or usurped but whose symbolic former connections were still important enough for the new occupants to claim them. In pottery terms, continuity may be best observed in the scored jugs and jars, as known from FN III and IV, and also in large strap handles (see above).32 But there are striking innovations in EM I. 22 Vagnetti 1973a, 77, fig. 70: 3; and 65, 70 fig. 65: 9: this is of the same size as, and has a similar finish to, the FF4 base. 23 Probably from the base of a goblet (Wilson 1985, 61-2, fig. 42: FFg). 24 Tomkins 2007, 44-7, fig. 1.16: 3 bottom; cf.

Pattern burnish ware was used especially for the new shapes — pedestal chalices and bowls, but also suspension pots — that suggest new social and/or cultural needs and ranking, and technical progress (as Mackenzie had noted). While there may have been metal prototypes for the chalices and pedestal bowls,34 with the sheen of the burnishing mirroring that of copper (whose advent in Crete can now be dated to FN IV-EM I),35 and while we can note how suited these imposing shapes are for (ceremonial) passing from person to person to partake, there may (also) have been a more mundane reason for the pedestalled shapes: the high stems would have kept the contents well clear of the floor and its dirt. Indeed, one might see the move to smaller drinking vessels and bowls as a sign of more furniture with more flat surfaces off the ground — tables and shelves — in EM II and III. At any rate, the pattern burnish chalices and bowls were high quality products that needed a considerable investment of time and skill to produce, suggesting how important they were for the groups/communities that used them. Likewise, the suspension pots with pattern burnish must also have been esteemed products. What did they contain that led to their being used so much (whether in pattern burnish or light grey ware) in tombs, but also in settlements? The most likely contents were probably scented oils and unguents, which could have been for anointing the living (to clean up or smell better) as well as the dead. If so, there may be an argument here for a ceremonial use, even at feasts, of the suspension pots together with the chalices and pedestalled bowls, which all complemented each other as performance equipment, even if they did not form specific sets — as was probably the case, since the latticework (or crosshatching) burnished patterns on the suspension pots are quite different from the wavy lines, etc. on the chalices and bowls. The painted ware in the Well was also new in the ceramic repertoire of Knossos and, occurring mainly as jugs that could have been used to fill the chalices, is another argument for there not having been sets yet of pottery at Knossos in EM I times. Instead, the community seems to have drawn on different products from different workshops for different needs. There were other important novelties in the EM I pottery of the Well. Perhaps the most fundamental, as it involves eating, is the arrival of the baking plate, suggesting some sort of change, and probably an improvement, in the cuisine. The large size of these dishes would have been ideal for cooking thin flour-based foods, such as pancakes, pitta or chapatis. Another novelty — the tripod cooking pot — appears at Ayia Fotia (Siteia) in the Cycladic repertoire there,36 which would on Papadatos's arguments put it in his EM IB, but is hot found at Knossos until the WCH (where it is rare)37 and probably a litte later in our Ai deposit (247-249: p. 139). Finally, the introduction of pithoi has similarly large implications, both for EM I society and for the advent of the skills to make them, which are part of the great progress of ceramic technology in EM I.38 Were there extra-Cretan sources, stimuli or immigrants that could have introduced these developments? Yes there were, has long been Hood's belief.39 As a preface to a quick re-examination of the evidence, we see the current recognition of Cycladic elements in EM I pottery — and likely settlers bringing their own burial practices — along the north coast of Crete from, at least, Poros to Ayia Fotia (Siteia) as helpful to the argument. Although this movement did not reach Knossos (which is in itself fascinating in view of its being only a few kilometres from Poros), it shows at last in archaeological terms that there is no a priori obstacle to incomers into Crete at the start of the Bronze Age. Furthermore, these could well have involved not only people from the Cyclades but others too from other regions, who could have become sufficienttly established on Crete to form and produce the 'Minoan' cultural elements, almost wholly in pottery, that are more or less coeval with the 'Cycladic' elements. So is there evidence for incomers in EM I from the rest of the Aegean beyond the Cyclades, and/or from the East Mediterranean? The pattern burnish style in itself is not a great help, since this is a phenomenon that occurs widely across the Aegean, although there are some enticing parallels, such as 33 Betancourt 2008A, esp. 16-23, 43~9° 34 Cf. pp. 33, 44 and 289. 35 See Betancourt 2008A, 100-02, for a recent review of EM I metallurgy, with references; also Papadatos 2007; 2008, 266-7. 36 Betancourt 2008b, 70-1, fig. g.32 (Davaras and Betancourt 2004, 24-5, fig. 42: 17.20). 87 Wilson 1985, 341-3, fig. 34, pi. 46: P346-352; 358. 38 As Betancourt (20086, 78-83, 99; 2010) has emphasised.

And baking plates and related dietary changes will not help either, that is until we have a very much larger body of culinary information for the EBA Aegean. But the improvements in ceramic technology, the arrival of painted ware, the new types such as jugs, baking plates, suspension pots and pithoi, the technical changes such as hammer rims, and the frequency of lids in a variety of types, and the short-lived appearance of bowls with carinated/rounded bases (which are well suited for sandy habitats), all suggest changes from the FN culture that can be explained probably by the arrival of incomers from overseas, who presumably mixed with the extant people of the island. The ceramic continuity from FN IV to EM I, which amounts to little more than the scored style, is not enough to outweigh this argument41 — while scoring, as we have seen (pp. 28-30), had a wide vogue (like pattern burnish) around the Aegean and in the East Mediterranean, which may dilute the argument for its necessarily being of indigenous FN origins when it was used in EM I, notably for the new shape of the large water jug. Scoring may be seen instead as just part of the wider Aegean ceramic horizon at the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. Alternatively, the radical character of the changes observable between the latest Neolithic pottery of Knossos and that of EM I could be explained if Knossos had been deserted for a considerable length of time after the end of the Neolithic occupation there. On this hypothesis the EM I styles of pottery might have evolved from a FN stage in some other part of Crete during a period when Knossos itself was uninhabited. It is difficult, however, to believe that a prime site like Knossos in the centre of the most fertile part of Crete would have been abandoned for an appreciable time in this way. Desertion of the site on this scale could only have occurred in the wake of some extraordinary event, such as the leading away of the population into captivity as the result of conquest; but such organised depopulation seems improbable in Crete in these early times. It might be considered necessary to offer an apology for the idea that in Crete at the end of the Neolithic and the beginning of the EBA we are faced with at least one, and perhaps two, waves of immigration by people from beyond the seas establishing settlements there. This is a relatively moderate view compared, for instance, with that of Seager, who suggested that the makers of Vasiliki ware were colonists from abroad, perhaps from Asia Minor, and the settlement of period III at Vasiliki was destroyed by new settlers who introduced light-on-dark ware.42 The idea that the Early Minoan civilisation was inaugurated by an influx of new people or peoples into Crete is not new. Evans himself thought that some features in the Early Minoan culture were due to refugees from the Delta region of Egypt at the beginning of the Egyptian First Dynasty.43 It is the fashion, however, at the moment to interpret the archaeological evidence, which is all we have, as reflecting other factors: in the case of changes of fashion, local evolution is assumed, or at the most local development under the influence of ideas borrowed from other regions. The evidence is admittedly slight and ambiguous, and it can be made to harmonise with more than one interpretation. But the fact that a certain line of interpretation happens to be fashionable does not necessarily mean that it is right. It is heartening that recendy Betancourt has written strongly in favour of newcomers in FN-EM I, with more of them coming in EM I but 'spread over several centuries',44 while Papadatos, comparing Petras-Kephala in the east of Crete and Nerokourou in the west, sees new traditions starting in FN IV at both sites (when 'the wider Aegean world "intrudes" into Crete' — a helpful metaphor), which raises the question, particularly at Kephala-Petras, of how much of the cultural package was really new in EM I and how much was 'the result of increased experience and gradual advancement'.45 Finally, it is clear that EM I, despite many local variations in culture and pace of development, is a phenomenon that is recognisable from end to end of the island. We have, however, to admit that, if there were significant groups of newcomers bringing new cultures and practices, there is no agreement, and clues are exiguous, as to where these supposed immigrants might have originated, or how they reached Crete, or where they might have stopped along the way (if they did). The one large exception to this aporia is found in the EM I Cycladic element on Crete that lived, died and was buried at several sites along the north coast of the island. See also a farther section on EM IA and EM IB at the end of this chapter. 40 See p. 252, n. 62. 41 Hood 1990a, lggoi. 42 Seager 1905, 207; 1907, 117. 43 PM I, 64-6, 69-70. 44 Betancourt 2008A, 93-6 (p. 94 for quotation). 45 Papadatos 2008, 267-9 (p. 268 for quotations).</page><page sequence="296">286 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN EARLY MINOAN IIA Apart from the isolated pieces of pottery that we presented in chapter 10 from Evans's excavations, we have just two deposits in Area A (RRN) to ascribe to EM IIA: the basal deposit Ao, which has two likely EM II sherds and another lg that are Neolithic; and, stratified above it, Ai (Floor VII). However, the upper two excavation levels of this deposit,46 with about half of the small total amount of pottery in Ai, may have been mixed with A2, as was soon recognised; chapter 7 notes what is from possibly mixed deposit. We did not come on EM IIA levels in Area B.47 Deposit Ai again illustrates how definitions, especially chronological, of ceramic style cannot be hard edge (to borrow a term from 20th century painting). Thus, anticipating EM IIB, we find a very little Vasiliki ware (cf. 273-274) in pure Ai contexts48 and some white-on-dark decoration (239, 267) — a style that was known already from the first EM pottery of stage F in Lebena T. II,49 but is not found in the Palace Well. Looking backwards, we see dark grey burnished ware and scored ware continuing, but the pattern burnish style is very much less than in the Palace Well, or indeed the WCH. The intermediate position of the deposit is encapsulated by two goblets that are of identical shape: one (186) however is in dark grey burnished ware, the other (201) in buff burnished ware with red decoration that looks forward towards EM IIB. New shapes in Ai include buff ware type 4 bowls with rims thickened internally, two of them from pure contexts, and tripod cooking pots, marking further developments in Early Minoan cuisine.50 We do not have any type 24 horned stands in this small deposit — but they do occur in the WCH.51 New decoration includes Myrtos style fans in dark on-light (235). Likely imports from southern Crete are few and a short-lived phenomenon: probably a bowl in fine painted ware 212 and a suspension pot in light grey ware 243. There is also a scrap of light grey ware in A2. Fine painted ware may have had a variant at Knossos, of a more pink fabric and usually without the row of blobs on the inside of the rim, perhaps a local product.52 Apart from the lack of horned stands, Ai seems a fairly complete domestic repertoire that is best compared in general to the WCH, which forms the key deposit for Wilson's West Court House Group of EM IIA early.53 However, in view of its having Vasiliki ware and light-on-dark decoration, Ai is probably a little later than both the WCH and floor levels in Warren's excavations in RRS (cf. pp. 77, 131). If this makes it tempting to place it with Wilson's North-East Magazines Group of EM IIA late,54 we must keep in mind that the deposit is not nearly big enough for any certainty. A better candidate for EM IIA late is the nearby independent A8 deposit excavated a few metres from the main Early Minoan trial (that produced A0-A7). Here again there is a little Vasiliki ware, but the dark grey and red and brown burnished wares are about five times as plentiful as in deposit A2 of EM IIB. A8 also has a larger number of buff bowls with internally thickened rims than Ai, and three horned stands. This may suggest that A8 is somewhere intermediate between Ai and A2, and could be assignable to EM IIA late. We await the publication of the EM IIA levels in Warren's RRS excavation to know how A8 and Ai fit into their sequence. EARLY MINOAN IIB For EM IIB we have a range of stratified deposits that yield a valuable sequence. In Area A, deposit A2 is associated with a building of some quality, surviving principally as wall an and Floor VI, which had been built over Ai/Floor VII. A2 belongs with the building, and has several complete vessels, and large fragments of others, which may suggest a destruction level. If so, it could be the same as, or be roughly contemporary with, the destruction that we presume can be inferred from the whole pottery that Evans found in Area B in 1908 (which we have presented in chapter 10). A3 (Floor VI mixed with Floor V ?) is the upper fill above Floor VI. Next above that is A4/Floor V, with traces of a wall. In Area B (the Early Houses), the sequence is not so clean (pp. 86-9) as in Area A, but it is still useful for the ceramic history of Knossos. Deposits B2 and Bi were sealed by the EM III B3 deposit and the architecture of the SFH, as was pit C (even if we excavated it partly with B2 and partly with Bi: a misunderstanding that was resolved by Momigliano and Wilson's excavation in 1993).55 B2 and 46 LAiog-LAno. 47 But there was EM IIA late nearby (p. 83 and n. 41). 48 For Vasiliki ware in Ai and A8, cf. Wilson 2007, 69 on its rare occurrence in EM IIA late contexts at Rnossos. 49 Alexiou and Warren 2004, 117-18. 50 Cf.

EM IIB'.</page><page sequence="297">THE EARLY MINOAN CERAMIC SEQUENCE OF KNOSSOS 287 B1 are linked to two earth floors, which overlay Neolithic remains. What both the 1960 and the 1993 excavations have not revealed, however, is any architecture or any floors, let alone destruction levels, that could have been associated with the whole pottery that Evans found apparently as floor deposits. One may imagine that it would have been architecture of some quality, as we find in the EM III immediately SFH above, to match the quality of the EM IIB whole pottery, and indeed house it. In the Knossos Pottery Handbook, the pottery from the different EM IIB deposits within the Early Houses, including pit C and its continuation in the 1993 excavations, forms collectively the South Front Group that defines EM IIB. It is, however, worth exploring the possibility of developments in the pottery of both areas within EM IIB. In the Area A deposits we still find some dark grey burnished ware pottery, and red and brown burnished wares, in A256 and, to a much lesser degree, in A3; and they have gone by A4. These pieces in the two lower groups may not all be EM IIA strays, but may just be still in contemporary contexts as the last instances of old styles (cf. p. 156 for discussion for A3) — or may indicate that some of the pottery came from fills or dumps. The A2-A4 deposits all have Vasiliki ware, and fine buff ware, but there are observable trends that mark the changes from EM IIA towards EM III. In A2 there is less light-on-dark decoration than dark-on-light (except for type 9 bowls that prefer light-on dark); by A4 some of the light-on-dark decoration (549-550: p. 167) looks to be anticipating EM III. Some of the Vasiliki ware is almost certainly imported — as top quality Vasiliki ware — from the region of the isthmus of Ierapetra, but much could perhaps be called better Vasiliki-style ware, with differences in shape, technique or finish that may suggest local manufacture of the product somewhere near Knossos, as may have happened at other Early Minoan centres.57 The story is generally similar in B1-B2 to that in A2-A4. B2 is about twice as big a deposit as Bi, which should be kept in mind if comparing frequencies. For instance, B1 has two horned stand fragments (903), but B2 three (1042):58 in both cases it is interesting to see that they have such typical EM IIA products which, as with the burnished wares in Area A, may indicate the end of a tradition or that the deposits to some extent came from fills or dumps59 — which is clearly the case for Pit C and the EM III deposit B3. Thus both Bi and B2 have a few burnished ware fragments, and both Vasiliki ware. From Bi to B2 the dominance of goblet rims with dark washes grows, and dark washes on type 16 bowl-jars become more common. But type 15 jugs such as those that Evans found (1332-1333) can be matched in either Bi or B2 — although 995-998 in B2 may just be closer — and would fit well with 374-376 and 379 from A2, pointing to the long use of this type. EARLY MINOAN III In Area A EM III is represented by deposits A5 (Floor IV), A6 (Floor III), and A7, which is in two parts A7.1 and A7.2 that appear contemporary with Floor III. The pottery of A5 is stratigraphically clearly older than that of A6, and also probably than that of A7. A6 is a very small deposit, A5 about four times as large and A7 about five times as large. In Area B the most important evidence from this sounding is B3, a fill laid down and sealed between two floors in the South Front House: the upper floor 5 marks at the least a relaying of the lower floor 4, and possibly was part of a more extensive rebuilding of the SFH. B3 is the second largest deposit after the EM I Palace Well of those that we are publishing in this volume, but is still much smaller than the fill of the Well (table 2.1). In the Knossos Pottery Handbook deposit Ag/Floor IV60 is assigned to the SFH Foundation Trench Group of EM III early, and A6/Floor III to the Upper East Well group of EM III late61 — where B3 in Area B is also placed,62 and deposits A7.1 and A7.2 should belong too. More problematical in Area B is the part of the fill in pit A, the foundation trench for wall P (see the lengthy discussion of the stratigraphy on pp. 89-91 above) as it was found in our excavation. We have virtually no material from this western part of pit A (which we excavated in trench A) to add to Momigliano's account of 56 A2 also has a horned stand (403); but Ag and A4 do not. 57 Betancourt (1979, 27-8) suggests some nine production centres including Knossos (cf. Pelon and Schmitt 2003); however, Whitelaw et al. (1997, 270) note basically one (Isthmus of Ierapetra) fabric among the Vasiliki ware sampled at Myrtos Fournou Korifi; while Day et al (1999, 1032-3) report two groups of Vasiliki ware among finds at Knossos (Ierapetra isthmus, and a metamorphic group of unknown source). Cf. Wilson 2007, 73-6, noting how EM IIB red to black burnished ware at Knossos (Wilson and Day 1999, 32-4, 39, 52-3) can look like Vasiliki ware. 58 And there is one in B3 (1135), which may be a stray (cf. discussion of horned stands on pp. 264-6). 59 As Wilson and Day (1999, 4-5) suggested for Evans's pottery from the Early Houses. 60 Momigliano 2007c, 81: 3.

In A5 there are features that seem to look back to EM IIB, such as the mottled dark wash of the type 8/9 bowls which is reminiscent of Vasiliki ware, but the resemblance may be fortuitous (see pp. 170-1). It does, however, help to explain the Vasiliki-like appearance of a probably EM III teapot in the British Museum and the uncertainties of where to assign it (1356: p. 278). It is noticeable too in A5 that the rims of the type 16 bowl-jars seem closer to the EM IIB shapes than to those of the full EM III of B3 (p. 172). The pottery of B3 and similar deposits is, as several scholars have remarked, closer to that of MM IA than to that of EM II, and it is often difficult to know where to place isolated finds such as the footed goblets and goblets from Knossos discussed in chapter 10 — or the bridge-spouted jar from Lapithos in Cyprus, which is a product of north-central Crete that could be EM III or MM IA.64 But a big contrast with MM IA is that neither B3 nor A5-A7 had any polychrome (red and white on black) handmade pottery of MM IA type. Likewise at Phaistos Todaro reports that Phaistos VIII had three phases (Phaistos VIIIA-C) with white-on-dark pottery; we agree with her in keeping the absence of polychromy as an important distinction between EM III and MM IA.65 Momigliano,66 however, has pinpointed a few polychrome pieces (less than a dozen) in apparently UEW Group contexts,67 all of them of unusual fabric or treatment and most likely not local products but probably from southern Crete. While these may suggest that polychromy appeared first on pottery in the Mesara, they are not enough to make polychromy a regular and local feature of Knossian EM III. (They also mark a degree of resumption,68 after a peak in EM IIA followed by cessation in EM IIB, of the export of pottery from the Mesara to northern central Crete.69) It is clear that there is still plenty to do, at Knossos and elsewhere, in refining the sequences of EM pottery and identifying local and regional characteristics so as to produce a temporally and spatially comprehensive account of this pottery that will, absent a wide series of radiocarbon dates, probably remain the principal way of connecting the historical events of Crete — the foundations, expansions, destructions, abandonments, and likely movements of people — in the millennium or so of the Prepalatial period. Furthermore, the pottery will continue to offer rich evidence for new insights into the daily life of the Early Minoan people(s), as the research of the last 20-30 years has demonstrated. It will be interesting to see, and now is too early to tell, to what extent various key features such as light grey ware, or horned stands, or Vasiliki ware, will 'harden' as chronological and cultural markers or whether there will continue to be a certain fluidity in defining phases in ceramic terms, as we believe is now the case. As part of this work, those studying EM pottery will need to evaluate and re evaluate all deposits across the island to agree on the extent of their primary or secondary nature. We hope that the deposits from Knossos that we have presented in this volume will help the progress of what is fundamental research for understanding EBA Crete. EARLY MINOAN IA AND EARLY MINOAN IB Sinclair Hood The abundant pottery from the Palace Well was originally assigned by us to EM IA. This was because we believed it to reflect a very early phase of EM I which had not previously been identified. But the use of the term EM IA for this might reasonably be considered premature in the absence of any deposit of pottery of comparable size assignable to EM IB. Our dating of the Well deposits to an early stage of EM I was essentially based upon the difference between the chalices (large footed drinking cups) from it, with their relatively thick waists, and the 63 See Momigliano 2007c, 81: 1, with references; and they excavated another EM III early deposit nearby to the s (Momigliano 2007c, 81: 2); p. 83 above; and Momigliano and Wilson 1996, 47-52. 64 Kehrberg 1995, esp. 187, 192-9, with references. 65 Todaro 2009a, 139-40.

There were no remains of narrow-waisted chalices of this type from the Well; but a number of them were recovered by Xanthoudides from the early communal tomb at Pyrgos east of Herakleion. There may be remains of such chalices in the SMK, but nobody seems to have drawn attention to them. The only example from Knossos, about which I know, is the fragment of the waist of one from a sounding of an area of the Throne Room of the Palace made in 1987. The soundings here were under my aegis, and I have written a report on the pottery from them; but the excavations were delegated by me to Don Evely with Vasso Fotou as architect. Their reports are not yet to hand, but I have their agreement to my mentioning this discovery here. The pottery from the sounding with this fragment was not abundant, but it seemed to be pure EM I in character. It was not clear, however, whether the deposit was formed then, or consisted of rubbish brought from elsewhere to serve as fill below the earliest Palace floor. Besides the narrow-waisted chalices, which, it seems widely agreed, should be assigned to EM I, the tomb at Pyrgos also contained pottery of EM II date, some or all of it assignable to EM IIA. This later material included goblets much smaller in size than the chalices found at Pyrgos with them and in the Palace Well. A change in drinking customs may have been responsible for a shift from the use of large chalices to that of small goblets: a change from the custom of all those eating together sharing the same vessel for drink to everyone using a goblet of their own. The custom of sharing the same vessel for drinks at meals may be one of great antiquity, but has no doubt survived here and there into recent times. When I was travelling in the Antalya region of southern Turkey in the 1950s looking for prehistoric sites, it was usual to descend on a village and expect to be fed and accommodated for the night. The sleeping place was often a bench in the local cafe; but sometimes a family with great generosity offered a meal and a place to sleep on the floor in their house. I remember that on one occasion when this happened, to my great surprise at the family meal in the evening, we all drank water from the same fairly large vessel, some kind of bowl I think it was, not a chalice. This was not the occasion of a feast or part of a ceremony of any kind, but as far as I could see, just the routine of an ordinary family evening meal. It would be interesting to know the ethnographic evidence for the existence of such a custom of cup-sharing, and what the evidence for it is in the archaeological record elsewhere than in Early Minoan Crete. Like the pottery itself from the Palace Well, with its footed chalices and the bases of other types of vessel rounded and not flat as in Crete later, this might help to suggest the area from which people came to Crete to inaugurate the EM period there, as I believe they did. The boundary between EM I and EM II may coincide with a change from all drinking from the same chalice to using smaller individual goblets. The chalices with thin waists, with or without a blob of clay on them, look as if they were of shapes copied from contemporary metal vases. These would probably have been of gold or silver, easier than copper to work into drinking vessels like them. The use of vessels of precious metals is attested in the EBA in Greece and the Cycladic islands. Why not also in Crete? Metal chalices like those of the Palace Well may also have existed, but the Palace Well chalices do not display any features which might be considered metallic. In excavations at Poros, site of the nearest Bronze Age harbour town to Knossos, chalices of both the Palace Well and narrow-waisted types are reported to have been found together. It is not yet clear whether this was in a fill, or above a floor in a destruction deposit. In either case, however, this does not necessarily mean that the Palace Well types was not earlier in its first appearance in Crete than the narrow-waisted type, since with any such change of fashion there is likely to be a period of overlap when the old and the new are in use together. The evidence of the Well certainly suggests that the simple type of chalice so well represented there was in use earlier in Crete than the narrow-waisted one. Finally, it must be emphasised that the range of different types of vessel from the Well does not support the idea that the chalices were relics of feasting or drinking bouts; which does not of course mean that such activities were not a feature of life in Crete at the time. The range of different types of vessel from the Palace Well is considerable, and consistent with the view that they reflect what was in general use for cooking and eating at Knossos then. It is interesting that the report of Valasia Isaakidou on the animal bones from the Well reaches a similar conclusion about them.</page><page sequence="300">Chapter 12 Conclusions How do the three excavations we have described contribute to our understanding of Early Minoan Knossos and its culture and history? We shall now attempt to answer these questions, while keeping in mind that, as we said at the start of Chapter 11 (p. 281), there are several reports to come that will add to the picture. In the meantime judgements are necessarily provisional. A further constraint for us in viewing EM II and III at Knossos is that our Areas A and B lay on the fringes of the settlement. While then they can tell us about its growth northwards and southwards, they cannot provide evidence for what was happening in the area of the later Central Court or between that part of the hill and the later West Court, and virtually nothing to add to the debate about possible predecessors of the Palace, or proto-palaces.1 EARLY MINOAN I The EM I Palace Well, the first Bronze Age well of Knossos, and probably the second oldest well known from Crete (after the FN IV well at Fourni)2, offers valuable evidence for the life and community organisation of the settlement on the Kephala hill at the start of the Bronze Age.3 Technically, the Well must surely have been considered a feat when it was dug, a distinction for whoever commissioned it, and a fine achievement by its digger(s). We may imagine that the task (pp. 21, 70) required a water diviner to locate the underground aquifer, and a master well digger in charge of the team that had the hard, perilous task of digging it, to 17.2 m. It is highly probable that both these people were specialists — these are not everyday skills — and quite possible that, one or both, they were itinerant experts who brought their experience to anyone who commissioned them. A single community, even if it was Early Minoan Knossos, is unlikely to have been a large enough body of people to sustain two such occupations within the community. The Well required also a person in all likelihood, who would have been a 'chief', or perhaps a group, to commission a project of great value for the community, with the skilled labour to carry it through, and then ensure that it was maintained properly, with no animal carcasses thrown in4 or other pollution. The Well would have been an immediate and most welcome addition to the resources of the community and at the same time a stimulus to social cohesion, since maintaining a well demands discipline and courtesy (for the sake of public health and fair shares of the water) as well as offering opportunities to meet neighbours, or people of the other sex, or outsiders. Since it might have held up to 2 tonnes of water at maximum, to guesstimate from the depth and diameter of the Well in its use levels at the bottom (deposit 1), it is easy to imagine that it was the main source of water for the settlement in EM I, and certainly for more than one household, unless that was the chief's — which might anyway mean that it was still somehow a large communal benefit. For us its having been dug is a strong argument for the community's having had a chief, but one cannot exclude the possibility that this well was the result of a decision by a group within the community. Similar considerations would have applied to the levellings that led to the FN IV-EM I Court which Tomkins has proposed as marking the beginning of the Central Courts of Knossos, with an enlargement in EM IIA.5 The Well's going out of action, during EM I and before it became a dump (a frequent fate for old wells), must have been a heavy blow to all or some of the Knossos community. We cannot say what went wrong but there could have been a destruction by fire of the settlement: this is one explanation of why much of the pottery, and some of the animal bones, in the fill (deposit 2) are badly burnt. 1 But see important discussions, with references in Tomkins forthcoming a, and Whitelaw forthcoming; also an overview in Warren forthcoming. 2 Manteli 1992. 3 Cf. Warren 1981, 630. 4 Valasia Isaakidou sees (above p. 66) the small number of animal bones found in the bottom levels that form deposit 1, with most of them coming from the top of the deposit (where they could have percolated from deposit 2), as a sign of the good management of the Well when it was in use as a well. 5 Tomkins forthcoming a. 2gi</page><page sequence="301">292 KNOSSOS EXCAVATIONS 1957-1961: EARLY MINOAN The Palace Well also gives us evidence of (probably improved) farming in EM I, with the first of several Prepalatial vine leaf impressions from Knossos (the next is EM IIA) and two olive stones, and improved storage in pithoi and what appear to be clay bins. The pithoi and bins are in turn further evidence of improved farming producing higher yields that needed storing, and possibly concentrations of agricultural wealth in the hands of a few people, or one person alone, in the community. These pithoi at Knossos are among several groups of them that appeared in Crete in EM I, which again supports the idea of improved agriculture, but across the island. The fact that any Neolithic predecessors on Crete do not have relief rope patterning (p. 52 and n. 245) may also be telling, as another break with the past, as well as being a sign of the skeuomorphic imagination of the EM I potters, which we see above all in their gourd-like round-bottomed jugs. It may also be a sign of improved transportation in EM I, with its hint of a greater abundance of donkeys for roping the pithoi to. For diet, the Well offers the first baking plates and also apparent pot boilers — a rarity in Minoan studies — for stew or soup. The animal bones show all the four major farmyard species in deposit 1 ; a dog joins them in deposit 2. There is a little evidence for other crafts from the Well (see also pp. 59-62). It may offer the first evidence for using lime plaster (as well as mud plaster); obsidian came from Melos, to be used in one case for a tranchet arrowhead; the first Bronze Age roundels (discs cut from sherds) continued a practice that went back to MN Stratum VII at Knossos, and at Phaistos has been connected with the management of EM pottery production.6 This tends to suggest specialist potters, for which the technical quality of the chalices, pedestalled bowls and suspension pots, and the appearance of the large water jugs and pithoi are even better evidence, probably with separate workshops specialising at least in different shapes and finishes. No Cycladic-style pottery was found in the Well, by contrast with contemporary (?) Poros-Katsambas down the Kairatos river by the sea, where plenty is reported.7 The chalices and pedestalled bowls of Knossos are prestigious and high-quality tableware, which were intrinsically valuable for their quality and the investment of labour and skills to produce them. Since their capacity is too much for one person, they suggest, at the very least, eating together by groups of people, such as for example different households — or commensality. While this does not preclude that this happened principally or solely at feasts involving much alcoholic drink and much meat (as yÀévxia do in Crete), such symbolically important events need not have been the sole occasions when the chalices and bowls were used, as has been discussed (cf. pp. 70-1, 284, 289). Study of the taphonomy of the animal bones from deposits 1 and 2 (pp. 64-7) shows that they had been were lying around for some time, being gnawed by scavengers, and seemed to have accumulated gradually, before being dumped in the Well after it became redundant as a source of water. Some of the bones were burnt, in high temperatures, which does not point to cooking meat on the bone so much as to accidental or destruction fires, or deliberate burning as in bonfires for burning rubbish. But since few bones were burnt — and in one case the burning happened after the bone had been gnawed by a rodent, just as some of the pottery was burnt after it had been broken — it is considerably harder to identify a general destruction by fire (unlike later examples such as in the Palace of Nestor and at Assiros in northern Greece). It is also hard to identify isolated feasts from the bones, but the quality and size of the tableware make it quite possible that these could have happened, perhaps in a familiar pattern of grander occasions breaking the routines of daily or regular eating together. Multiple explanations of the deposit are possible. It is likely that the pottery and animal bones piled up gradually before being cleared away and dumped in the Well, after a fire or fires. This may have been a bonfire to burn the rubbish and purges sources of disease, it may have been a destruction by fire of some or all of the settlement. Or it could be a combination of these, such as a bonfire's getting out of control. If the burning observable in the Well was occasioned by arson with hostile intent, that would be a further sign of upheaval(s) in EM I, which one might connect with the suggested arrival(s) of incomers over quite a lengthy period, as we have discussed (pp. 284-5). Some may see too big an initial 'If' to make this likely. However, another hint of change and upheaval may come from an apparent contraction in the Kephala settlement in EM I. In Areas A and B we see EM IIA (Area A) and then EM IIB (Area B) people settling in places that had Neolithic scatter and lay presumably at the edges of the the Neolithic settlement; but these same places have no signs at all of any use in EM I and were clearly outside the EM I settlement, which very probably had shrunk from the size of its Neolithic predecessors.8 6 Todaro 200gÄ, 341-4 and figs. 6d, 7d, in EM IIA, EM IIB and EM III contexts.

Todaro forthcoming. 7 Wilson et al. 2008. 8 Wilson (1994, 35-6) raises the question, and emphasises how difficult it is to tell at Knossos in view of the many later terracings and rebuildings.</page><page sequence="302">CONCLUSIONS 293 EARLY MINOAN II The apparent upheaval(s) of EM I (whether human-made or following natural disasters such as earthquakes) continued in EM II, in the EM IIA destruction that brought down the West Court House and also perhaps, if we are correct, in an EM IIB destruction that could be inferred from the whole pottery that Evans found in Area B and that we found in deposit A2, the first EM IIB horizon (Floor VI) in Area A. However, in view of the evidence of expansion in EM IIA and later on the western side of the later Palace, i.e. between the Central Courts and West Courts, the destruction of the WCH may not have been the result of revolution, war or earthquake, but rather deliberate demolition as part of the long-running building programmes of Knossos, and linked with the terracings and fills of which there was considerable evidence across the site.9 Beneath A2, deposit Ai seems a little later than the WCH, revealing how the settlement expanded during EM IIA, when growth may have happened first in a westerly direction, as Warren's excavations in RRS, and a test by Pendlebury below the Palace car park10 suggest, before spreading to the lower slope of the hill to the north, which was basically virgin territory. As a small deposit, A1/Floor VII otherwise adds little to the current picture of the 'large-scale reorganisation of the settlement in EM IIA'11 but, because of its position at the bottom of a multi-floor stratigraphic sequence, is valuable for defining the local ceramic history of Early Minoan Knossos. But imports of pottery, whether light grey and fine painted wares from the Mesara or Vasiliki ware from the Mirabello region are few, and from the Cyclades non-existent (although 275 may be from the eastern Aegean). The triangular clay rubber or pot burnisher 233 from Ai has an EM IIB counterpart 412, which seems to have been made from a sherd of an imported EC IIA jug. For building and decorating, Ai has evidence that black was used as a colour on wall plaster as well as red.12 EM IIB in Area A is marked by an apparently impressive, but vestigial, building associated with Floor VI and wall an, which may in turn connect with the EM structures under the Armoury (see p. 79). This construction suggests continuing expansion of the Knossos setdement in establishing a building of some importance on its northern fringes. The building, however, may not have lasted for long, if we are right in seeing a destruction that terminated it (and the Floor VI horizon). Rebuilding followed (as A^Floor V), still within EM IIB. In Area B on the southern fringes of the settlement the EM IIB Early Houses, which underlie the EM III South Front House, were a development on virgin ground and another sign of the settlement's continuing growth. But here too, as in Area A, there may have been a destruction, of which we found no traces in our excavation but which we infer from the whole pottery that Evans found. If we are correct in associating this proposed destruction with the horizon of Bi, then B2 represents reoccupation (and likely rebuilding), which would match both what seems to have happened in Area A and the building events, involving terracing and fills, that Wilson and Day have suggested for the Early Houses from their study of the pottery in the SMK from Evans's excavation.13 This EM IIB evidence from the edges of the settlement is tantalising since it is hard to relate it to what happened in the centre, or the settlement as a whole, because our knowledge of EM IIB at Knossos, especially in the centre, is about as scanty as it is for EM I.14 There may, however, be a clue in the ramp found in 1987 sw of the North Lustral Basin, and datable perhaps to the building programme of EM IIA, perhaps to EM IIB, that seems to have been leading up the Kephala hill from the north.15 If one allows some turns in the path, this could have been a link with the Armoury and Area A EM II site, especially if the turns meant following any track that was a predecessor of the later Royal Road to reach the ramp. The existence of such a track is highly probable, principally as it would have defined, or helped define, the route of the Royal Road.16 Area B has produced a clay roundel (like those from the Palace Well mentioned above), and Area A another two of EM III date, but they remain fewer than the nine from the WCH. (If Todaro is right to connect them at Phaistos with pottery production in the western part of the settlement,17 is it significant that there was also a (small) concentration of them in the western part of the Knossos settlement? Is this a hint of pottery making nearby in EM IIA?) 9 Cf.

Nothing has been identified as coming from the Mesara or the Cyclades, other than some obsidian from Melos in EM IIA and IIB, with a very small admixture of the smoky 'Anatolian' obsidian — of which there was a relatively larger amount in the EM III B3 deposit. The arrival of tripod cooking pots suggests continuing improvements in the Knossian cuisine. Two phalli in A3 are both a curiosity and evidence to include in discussions of gender and the roles of males in Cretan society of the Bronze Age.18 EARLY MINOAN III In Area B the construction of the South Front House was a significant declaration of someone's status in erecting a building of quality on top of the EM IIB Early Houses. Its two distinctive red floors separated by the B3 fill deposit show that it had at least two building phases, and possibly more. On the basis of the evidence primarily from the 1993 excavation, these can be seen to correspond to Momigliano's EM III early and EM III late. In Area A we came upon two main floor levels (Floors III and IV/deposits A7-A5) beneath Floor II of LM IA. Both areas produced evidence for innovations in the material culture. Area A has two stone vase fragments, still rare in settlements, and a clay model of some kind. The richer evidence is from B3, the fill that, just because it is made up of discards, may be a further sign of how important the SFH was in that its occupants could afford to dump in a fill the items that we found. This claim rests on a supposition that the B3 fill came originally from the SFH (which is not unreasonable in view of its function as a fairly thin hard core support for a new floor in remodelling the building) or from somewhere close by. Wherever its original source, B3 has interesting data for such a small deposit: an East Cretan EM III imported jar; a higher presence than in EM IIB of the more exotic Anatolian' variety of obsidian; a very early, if not the earliest known, use of serpentine as the stone for a stone vase; and the bottle or jar stopper that had been stamped repeatedly by an ivory seal — and had become a discard for the persons who remodelled the SFH. Of the Parading Lions group, it is a key part of a continuing debate on the role of early seals and sealings in administration. Did it relate to just one household, or the larger community? What is the significance of the lions, especially since similar beasts occur on seals from tombs? They seem to have been a marker of high status (p. 234) which, one may easily imagine, was royal status of some sort, in view of the centuries-old link of lions and royalty. The consensus at present favours a collective or communal use of the original seal(s) which it is hard to define more closely. The South Front House must be associated with the major expansion of Knossos in EM III continuing into MM IA, but it is not easy to be more precise about how it was connected. During this time the extent of the settlement at Knossos grew well beyond the Kephala hill to reach an estimated area of between 20 and 33 ha, as compared to 6.5 ha in EM II.19 These EM III developments20 include the first known of the built roads of Knossos,21 houses and a large terrace wall below the level of West Court, the Upper East Well, perhaps the Hypogaeum (pp. 22, 81) and the Keep (p. 243), and, last but not least, the impressive wall —the North-West Terrace — at the nw corner of the Palace that could have been a very large terrace wall or part of the first truly monumental building (palace?) at Knossos, or have served both purposes.22 How could the South Front House fit into this expansion? It is tempting to see it as having been built with some protective/ceremonial/liminal purpose, quite apart from being a good place for someone to live. It is likely that the route up to the Kephala hill from the south that can be associated with the Stepped Portico and Viaduct was in use for centuries before — as a little MM IA evidence suggests;23 but it would not be surprising that there was a path there long before that (which, by EM III-MM IA, would have come directly from any occupation of that time on Lower Gypsades24). On ascending the Kephala hill, this route would have passed close to the South Front House, as later it passed very close to the South House; and the SFH would probably have commanded this way up the hill. It may well then have had some purpose on the lines we suggest, to greet, or deter, people intending to proceed to 18 Cf. Cadogan 200g, esp. 228-9. 19 Whitelaw forthcoming, seeing for late Prepalatial (i.e. EM III— MM IA) 20 ha as a minimum, and 33 ha as quite possible, rising to 37 ha if one includes likely occupation on Lower Gypsades. 20 Usefully reviewed, with references, by Macdonald (forthcoming), Momigliano (1999, 71-4), Tomkins (forthcoming a), Whitelaw (forthcoming) and Wilson (1994, 37-8); and cf.

If this is near the truth of what happened, it becomes possible to see it as a potential southern counterpart to what may have been a similar function (perhaps among several different functions) for the Keep on the northern approach to the central area25 (if, of course, the Keep did go back to EM III). It is also possible to see it as in some way a symbolic predecessor of the South House, (whose construction displaced the earlier approach route from the south),26 and perhaps too as having a special connection to Juktas, the holy mountain that is so clear from the southern slope of the Kephala hill.27 Two final points. We found no clay 'sheepbells' in our EM III deposits, although they are a feature of the UEW deposit.28 Equally, we found nothing in either area to suggest a destruction with fire to end their EM III occupations, although Mackenzie did believe that there was an 'universal catastrophe' marking the end of EM III.29 Nor did we find any evidence for any fire destructions in EM IIB or EM IIA. The sole evidence we have that may indicate a fire destruction dates to EM I, from the Palace Well. 26 Cf. now Macdonald forthcoming. 26 PMII, 165. 27 As Evans [PMII, 373) wrote, in discussing the South House: 'with the peak of Juktas peering above the opposite hill of Gypsades'. 28 Andreou 1978, si, pi. 1: 29-31; Morris and Peatfield 1990, with other find-spots at Rnossos. 29 Mackenzie 1906, 253; discussed by Momigliano (2007c, 81-2), who emphasises the complete lack of evidence of burning in the UEW Group pottery deposits of EM III late.
