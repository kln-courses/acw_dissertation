<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> JONAH RASKIN Calls of the Wild on the Page and Screen:   From Jack London and Gary Snyder   to Jon Krakauer and Sean Penn The wild seems to have come already packaged in the American DNA, and  American writers can’t help but hear its call and walk on the wild side, too. In  fact, the wilderness—as friend, foe, rough beast, and sacred place—has long  provided American writers with a sense of place and distinguished them from  their English literary cousins. Classic American literature, as D. H. Lawrence  and others understood, would hardly exist without Natty Bumppo in the  forest and Captain Ahab at sea. Moreover, as the United States has become,  increasingly, a land of malls, Prozac, and iPods, American writers have gone  on bounding into the beyond. It’s as though, as a culture, we need to recon- nect to that sense of awe, wonder, and fear our earliest ancestors felt when  they set foot on a continent that struck them as virgin wilderness.  Christopher McCandless, the twenty-something anti-hero in Jon Krakauer’s  Into the Wild (1996) and Sean Penn’s 2007 movie of the same name, dies alone  in Alaska, a victim of his own illusions. Like the book, the movie struggles  to understand why a college-educated young man from a prosperous, but  emotionally troubled middle-class white family, would throw away his privi- lege. Reviewers have hailed Into the Wild as a mystery, but there’s little that’s  mysterious about McCandless and his behavior. Young men like him, in real  life and in the pages of fiction, have been doing much the same since the  days of the Roman Empire. There’s nothing like a dose of imperial ennui  to prompt young men and young women to flee from urban and suburban  confines, run with wolves, go native, and embrace “the barbarians,” as they’ve  been called since ancient times.  The real McCandless went to extremes. He gave away his inheritance,  rejected his name, and called himself “Alexander Supertramp.”1 He also  American Literary Realism  Spring 2011, Vol. 43, No. 3 © 2011 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois </page> <page sequence="2"> raskin  Essays 199 embraced the life, as he perceived it, of his literary hero, Jack London, who  extended, more than anyone else, at the start of the twentieth century the  tradition of American literature that Cooper and Melville initiated in the  nineteenth. “Jack London is King,” McCandless wrote tersely while in Alaska  (9); those four electrifying words appear in Krakauer’s book, thoush not  in Penn’s movie. McCandless also proclaimed, “I now walk into the wild”  (134), as though he was the first man to do so, and as though he was making  history. He seems also to have had in mind John Thornton, the one really  heroic human character in The Call of the Wild (1903), since Thornton,  London writes, “was unafraid of the wild. With a handful of salt and a rifle  he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as  long as he pleased” (66). McCandless might have taken that passage with  a grain of salt. He might also have come to his senses and realized that the  wild was not just or only an idea but a real place with a history and inhabit- ants. Of course, London linked himself to the wild, but he never did what  his character Thornton did. He did not take a rifle and a handful of salt  and plunge alone into the wilderness. Moreover, his most eloquent piece of  non-fiction on the subject of the Yukon—“From Dawson to the Sea” ( June  1899)—describes how he got out of the wild, not how he got into it. It was  far more difficult than getting in.  The only passage from The Call of the Wild that McCandless selected for  special attention—and that Krakauer repeats in Into the Wild—is a description  of Buck after he has killed Spitzbergen, the dog who had led the pack. Lon- don calls Buck “the dominant primordial beast” (31). McCandless tweaked  the phrase and wrote, “All hail the Dominant Primordial Beast!” (38), which  makes it sound like a hymn to brute conquest.  McCandless couldn’t have picked a popular writer more fascinated with  the wild than London. The author of The Call of the Wild and dozens of  cautionary tales about men in the wild, like “To Build a Fire,” London took  on the persona of the wild man, and it brought him wealth and fame, just  as the American frontier was declared closed. In the pages of literature, he  kept it open and brought the wilderness as a literary territory into the twen- tieth century at about the same time that the Polish-born Joseph Conrad,  who was as un-English as an English writer could be, brought the jungle to  the English novel. Moreover, for London the wild was far richer and more  complex than McCandless imagined and so he associated with many things;  there was wild wrath, wild joy, wild fathers, and even wild patience, which  sounds like a paradox, but London thought in terms of paradox.  Like McCandless in the pages of Krakauer’s provocative narrative and  on the screen in Penn’s disturbing film, London ran away from home as  a young man, in part because of troubles at home and not simply for an  </page> <page sequence="3"> 200 american literary realism  43, 3 ideal, an idea, or to live out a myth. Like London, McCandless had an  uneasy relationship with his father, and like London he went in search of  freedom from him and at the same time in quest of substitute fathers and  father figures. There’s a great deal in the phrase from The Call of the Wild  in which London writes of Buck, “the pain of his wild fathers” (27). In the  movie Into the Wild, Hal Holbrook—who knows a lot about the wild by tak- ing on the identity of Mark Twain—plays to perfection Ron Franz, one of  McCandless’ father figures.  In the Yukon, London always boasted, he found himself as an individual  and his métier as a writer, and it’s largely true. He took mental notes and kept  a journal in which he recorded his observations of nature and wild life in the  manner of Thoreau and John Muir. London came out of the wilderness with  scurvy; he was wise enough to know when to leave and he nursed himself back  to health. Moreover, unlike McCandless, who rejected the company of men  in Alaska and lived alone in an abandoned school bus, London spent almost  all of his time with other men. In fact, he spent more time in a cabin listening  to gold miners telling stories than he did in the cold and snow prospecting  for gold. The Indians intrigued London, too, and he would write about the  decline of their culture in the clash with white civilization.  From the start, London knew instinctively what McCandless only discov- ered shortly before his death and announced in his farewell words to the  world—that “HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED” (189)—another  text that Penn’s camera captures on screen in a movie that never frees  itself from the written word. (I’m all in favor of the culture of the book  and believe in the power of words, but a movie ought to adhere to its own  modes of storytelling, visual rhetoric, and rhythm and not genuflect before  a literary text.)  London’s literary fable, Krakauer’s meditation on manliness, and Penn’s  adventure picture with a moral message all exploit the properties of the  medium in which their authors work and each makes a distinctive call on  eye and ear. London’s novel is told from the point of view of Buck, the dog  who is reborn a wolf, and so it enables the reader to see the world of men  through the eyes of an anthropomorphic beast. Krakauer’s non-fiction nar- rative gives him room to bring in his own personal experiences—he, too,  plunged into the wild as a young man—and borrow from his autobiography  as a way to make sense of McCandless’ outward bound odyssey. Penn’s movie  uses the freedom afforded by the camera and the editing room to jump  back and forth in time and place and to arrange a series of jig-saw puzzle  scenes that a viewer can choose to interpret or not. It’s in color, too, and  the camera conveys brilliantly the sweep of the North American continent,  from the southeast, through the midwest, to Alaska. It’s the majestic land  </page> <page sequence="4"> raskin  Essays 201 itself, all that vast space, that is at the heart of the movie and is its real  hero—not McCandless or any of the men and women he meets.  The Call of the Wild is a text that knows it is a text and it provides that in- formation to the reader, too. “Buck did not read the newspapers,”2 the first  sentence proclaims. Anyone who knows anything about London knows that  he read insatiably and that reading defined his identity and his personality  as much as writing and adventuring. That first sentence makes a reader  conscious of the act of reading itself. It’s a kind of literary slap in the face  that says you’re a reader, you’re holding this book in your hands, reading  this text, so pay attention, please. London also explains that one can read  one’s environment in much the same way that one can read a book, which  strikes me as ecologically conscientious. Buck runs through the forest “read- ing signs and sounds as a man may read a book, seeking for the mysterious  something” (69). London’s wild is a physical entity embodied in the forest,  the ice and snow, but it’s also a text, albeit an oral and not a written text.  The wild is, as he explains early in the story, “an ancient song” (18) surging  through Buck. It’s something he hears, feels, sees, smells, and touches.  Moreover, London explains that Buck experiences a sense of “ecstasy”  in the wild and that the animal ecstasy that he comes to know also “comes  to the artist, caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame” (29). That  sounds like London talking about himself as an artist, “caught up and out  of himself” in the very process of creation (29). In fact, it’s a description  of what it was like for him to write The Call of the Wild—what it was like to  feel the wild coursing through him as he sat at his typewriter. “Been writing  like a tiger,” he wrote in a letter to Edward Applegarth on September 13,  1898.3 Indeed, writing felt like an act of wildness. One of the original titles  for the novel was “The Sleeping Wolf.” As he wrote it, he awoke; so did his  story, and as it did that title dropped by the wayside.  The Call of the Wild is about the acts of reading and writing. It’s also about  memory and the imagination. Buck remembers. Buck imagines. He makes  up his mind what to do and what not to do. His discovery of his inner primal  memories, which have not been stamped out by civilization, is as important  as his outer journey from tame to wild. Though London intended his story  to be the biography of a dog, and though he describes the key events in  Buck’s life story, The Call of the Wild is not bound by biographical fact. The  wild is a story, a fiction if you will, that we tell ourselves in order to make  sense of our lives. Buck learns to read his environment as all survivors must  learn to do. The Call of the Wild soars into the unknown—into the world of  the spirit. Buck discovers that he must imagine how to outlast his enemies,  and so his imagination, not his fangs, becomes his most powerful weapon.  London’s art took him where it would. His unconscious called him, and  </page> <page sequence="5"> 202 american literary realism  43, 3 he followed it blindly, and so Buck is reborn a Ghost Dog in a wilderness  of the spirit as well as of ice and snow.  Krakauer has made a literary career for himself by writing about the wild.  Penn is one of Hollywood’s wilder movie stars and directors. They’re both  cultural descendants of Jack London, but both of them think too much  about the wild, and about their own careers, and so they’re caught up self- consciously in their own heads. They need to let go. Of course, Krakauer’s  and Penn’s work might grow on us. But it’s unlikely they’ll attain the on- going global attachment to The Call of the Wild that suggests, if nothing  else, that readers the world over want the familiarity of the chronological  narrative to guide them as they plunge into uncharted territory. By staying  within literary boundaries, London was able to go beyond them emotion- ally and psychologically. Despite attempts by critics to tame it over the past  century, London’s novel continues to feel like a wild book that the author  wrote without stopping, revising, or even considering what he wanted to  say. Much of the evidence suggests that London was wilder on the page  than in real life.  Krakauer’s and Penn’s McCandless is all-too-predictable: a young man  who read too little, too much, and not deeply enough. Moreover, he relied  too heavily on the tools and weapons—a gun and bullets—of the civilization  he thought he’d left behind. If he had genuinely grappled with London,  the author he called “King,” he might have walked out of the wilderness  as he had walked into it, or perhaps never left home in the first place.  I wonder, too, why neither McCandless, Krakauer, or Penn ever consulted  Gary Snyder—the author of The Practice of the Wild, who explored Alaska and  knows intimately the wilderness areas of America. Snyder, when I wrote him  about the movie, Krakauer, and McCandless, felt they could have learned a  great deal from his work, and he’s right. “Inhibitory people, archaic or recent  people who lived by hunting and gathering, subsistence, did not seek adven- tures,” Snyder explained. He added, “the wild is demanding and orderly,  not chaotic and romantic.”4 Perhaps more than any other contemporary  American author, Snyder has written insightfully and passionately about the  wild and the wilderness in both prose and poetry. He has also worked hard  to counter the romantic ideas that threatened to obliterate the real wild.  Snyder always emphasizes the wisdom of primitive peoples who live in  the wilderness, and he has always spoken for environmental awareness and  protection of the wild—an idea which one hardly finds in London, Krakauer,  or Penn. It’s unfortunate and sad, too, that neither Krakauer nor Penn were  curious enough to explore Snyder’s ecological perspective and his sense of  the obvious pitfalls and perils of the wild. “One departs home to embark on  a quest into an archetypal wilderness that is dangerous, threatening, and  </page> <page sequence="6"> raskin  Essays 203 full of beasts and hostile aliens,” Snyder wrote in “Survival and Sacrament.”  He added, “You may never see home again.”5 Sometimes, as Snyder and  London also knew, survival requires that the reader stay at home and enjoy  vicarious experiences, not the real thing in places off the map.  Snyder’s The Practice of the Wild seems like an obvious book that McCand- less ought to have read, along with London’s “In a Far Country,” which  reads now uncannily as if written with McCandless in mind. “When a man  journeys into a far country, he must be prepared to forget many of the  things he has learned,” London wrote. “It were better for the man who  cannot fit himself to the new groove to return to his own country; if he  delay too long, he will surely die.”6 McCandless died because he refused  to see—could not see, until it was too late—the pitfalls of living alone in  a wilderness as dangerous as Cooper’s frontier and Melville’s whale. “In  weakest condition of life,” he wrote on the hundredth day of his sojourn  in the wilderness. “Death looms as serious threat. Too weak to walk out,  have literally become trapped in the wild” (195).  London’s and Snyder’s kind of wild—American wild—has rarely if ever  come easy to British writers. In Atonement, for example, Ian McEwan brings a  British version of the wild into his story of class and manners in the person of  Robbie Turner, the working class hunk who seduces Cecelia Tallis—played  in the movie by Keira Knightly. “He looked so huge and wild,” McEwan  writes of Robbie.7 It doesn’t require a stretch of the imagination to know  that the author means him to be a latter day Heathcliff in Emily Brontë’s  Wuthering Heights, probably the best British novel about the wild ever writ- ten. Perhaps McCandless could have read Bronte along with London and  still be here to go on reading and dreaming of the wild. —Sonoma State University Notes  1.
