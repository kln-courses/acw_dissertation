<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXISTENTIALIST INTERPRETATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT' ERICH DINKLER* . _HREE remarkable books charac- terize the theological develop- I ments in Europe during the last half-century: Adolf Harnack's Das We- sen des Christentums (1900), Karl Barth's Der Roemerbrief (1919), and Rudolf Bultmann's Das Problem der Entmytho- logisierung der neutestamentlichen Ver- kuendigung (I94I).2 In Harnack's book we have the classical exposition of liberal Christianity at the turn of the century, the theological historicism that tried to reconstruct the religion of Jesus-his conception and example of love, which is postulated as the very essence of Chris- tian faith. While Harnack's book was in many respects a typical expression of this liberal conception, notwithstanding its character as an individual master- piece, Barth's The Epistle to the Romans, which opened a new period in theology, was not typical for the situation, though it was stimulating and inspiring even for Barth's critical opponents. In order to re-establish the authority of the Word of God as revealed in the Bible, Barth rejected any purely historical criticism * Erich Dinkler has been professor of New Testament and early Christian archeology at Yale Divinity School since I95o. Prior to coming to this country, he served on the faculties of the universities of Mainz and Marburg, Germany. He is the author of Die Anthropologie Augustine (I934); Gottschalk der Sackse (1937); Die ersten Petrusdarstellungen ein archaeologischer Beitrag zur Primatsfrage (I939); Das Bema von Korinth (I941); Bibelauthoritaet und Bibelkritik (I950), and other works. Together with Professor Bultmann, Dr. Dinkler edits the quarterly journal, Theologische Rundschau. He is also co-editor of Zeitschrift fuer Theologie und Kirche. His close association with Rudolf Bultmann as former colleague lends particular interest to his contribution in this issue. of the Bible. In order to explain the per- rennial skandalon of God as acting in Jesus Christ, Barth exhibited no interest in the historical setting of the New Tes- tament. He disregarded the Hellenistic and Judaistic background, and he was often rather arbitrary in his exegesis. Rudolf Bultmann, who also belongs to the circle of the so-called "dialectical theologians," is, like Barth, interested in the present actuality of God's revela- tion in Jesus Christ, but he is at the same time the exponent of critical, analytical exegesis. It is peculiar to Bultmann that he combines analysis and synthesis. He is concerned with the theological impli- cations of his critical, historical research. The Problem of Demythologizing was first delivered at a meeting of the Confessional church, that is, that part of the Protestant church in Germany which resisted the Nazi ideology. Published first in I94I and republished in 1948, the study has been for ten years the focus of European Protestant discussion.3 We shall confine our discussion here to Bultmann's demand for demythologiz- ing the biblical message. We shall at- tempt in an introductory fashion to ex- plain his conception and his terminology, which appear to have a philosophical character. With regard to the conception itself, I propose that we separate the definition and exposition of the problem as such from the solution (which is sug- gested by Bultmann only through ex- amples). The problem may be accepted even though the examples are rejected; both may be admitted, or both may be rejected. In any case, we must first de- 87</page><page sequence="2">TIIE JOURNAL OF RELIGION lineate the problem as such without criticizing it. The question posed is: Can the mod- ern man still be Christian in the genuine sense that he believes in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior? If so, does this mean that the modern man, living and thinking in the light of the results of modern science, must believe in the resurrection as a miraculous fact, in the empty tomb, in the "Last Day" as the end of human history, in the virgin birth, in angels and demons, etc.? These questions can be answered only by a Christian who knows personally what faith in Christ means. Since faith in Christ cannot be explained in a neutral analysis of the phenomenon "faith" as such, they cannot be answered by an unbeliever. Faith in Christ can be interpreted only when I have under- stood in my personal existence what this means. Therefore the first question as to whether modern man can still be a Christian is a priori answered in the affirmative. The second question regard- ing certain miraculous facts must be in- vestigated on the basis of the New Tes- tament. His very posing of the problem shows Bultmann to be a Christian and scholar whose prime intention is to be sincere with himself, to be sincere before God, and to be at the same time a citizen of our modern world. Therefore, he un- masks a common pious self-deception- that the Christian pretends to be a be- liever, even in the sense of acknowledg- ing the Apostles' Creed literally, and lives at the same time according to the principles of the modern world. Bult- mann points to the anomaly that the modern Christian appears on Sunday morning as a member of the church and then turns to identify himself entirely with the secular sphere in everything that concerns his job during the week. This attitude denotes a dualism in our personal existence and must be called hypocrisy. But then the question arises, "Can we in the twentieth century be Christians at all without neutralizing the very essence of Christian faith?" Bultmann is a New Testament scholar and takes up the problem by asking whether the New Testament demands that Christian faith must believe in mir- acles such as the empty tomb or the descent into limbo. He emphasizes that, although the Bible contains the testi- mony of God's revelation, it is as a book of world literature a human book, writ- ten by men; and it is understandable only in its historical setting. This human quality of the Bible (through which the Word of God comes to us) may be re- garded in some fashion as the presupposi- tion of all critical research and even of all theological interpretation in the bib- lical field today. In the human testimonies collected in the New Testament one decisive event is the center-Jesus Christ, his crucifixion and resurrection. This is the redemptive event of God's action, occurring once for all (ex&amp;ara~). It is witnessed by the faith of the apostles and evangelists and by the earliest Christian community; it was affirmed before the books of the New Testament were written. These confes- sions of faith are given in human terms, in the language of that time, with the terminology, the imagination, and the pictures of that age. This means that the reality of Jesus Christ and his significance for Christian faith are represented and described by means of expressions which are shaped by the view of the world peculiar to that period. Not only is the language related to and limited by the contemporary world view but so also is the way of thinking itself. This time-shaped language and thinking 88</page><page sequence="3">EXISTENTIALIST INTERPRETATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT Bultmann calls "mythological." An ex- ample may illustrate this: The heaven above is understood as God's dwelling place. The Bible speaks of Christ's ascen- sion and of Christ sitting at the right hand of God the Father. Hell is beneath; it is the realm of evil and Satan. Christ had to descend into hell in order to preach the Gospel to those who died be- fore his redemptive crucifixion. The Last Judgment is a dramatic scene: the Son of Man will come on the clouds of heaven, he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds (Matt., chap. 24). This world view is no longer ours. Are we required to accept it as a prerequisite of our faith in Christ? This is impossible, because we cannot repristinate the myth- ical world view any more. The biblical conception of the universe is by no means a "Christian" world view but a secular one, to be found even outside the Bible. It is the "three-story world" of antiquity. The conception of the eschatological drama can be found in Jewish apocalyp- tic as well as in pre-Christian gnosticism. However, in all these mythological con- ceptions, there is a deeper truth that cannot be dismissed. We today must try to describe and express our faith in Jesus Christ by means of our own language, our imagination, and our pictures. We should do this, however, without chang- ing the reality of Jesus Christ, without limiting his significance, without even moderating the nature of the Christ- event as though it were a stumbling block. Some may ask, "Is it not really Bultmann's intention to make Christian faith more acceptable and less scandaliz- ing to modern man?" Not at all. Christ, his significance as Our Lord, his crucifix- ion and resurrection as the redemptive action of God, must remain the intrinsic stumbling block (cf. I Cor. 1:23; Gal. 5:II). But the danger has arisen that today not Christ himself but the diction of the Bible, the language of the church, the formula of our creed, the text even of some hymns, represent the stumbling block. In order to reveal the real stum- bling block, we must dismiss the mythol- ogy, which is a pagan pattern of a dated world view, and use our own conceptions. What does Bultmann mean when he uses the term "mythology"? In his paper of I94I he defined this term in a double way. On the one hand, he characterized it as primitive science-men believe that the world is governed by supernatural powers, by gods and demons who rule the history of men and nature. On the other hand, he described it in a particular way, as speaking about transcendence in terms of this world, in figures that picture im- manent phenomena. Does this mean that two different definitions are confused?4 Recently Bultmann has emphasized that the two definitions refer to one and the same thing, because primitive science is characterized by the fact that it regards riddles in the history of nature as sudden actions of a supramundane power and that in an anthropomorphic manner it perceives this power as immanent. The first definition is therefore only a special aspect of the second conception. But why, then, the opposition of myth and modern science? The difference between myth and science can be seen in the dif- ferent conceptions of reality. Myth, in so far as it expresses religious truth, intends in fact to speak about the power that con- fronts man and thus to make him aware of his own finiteness. It speaks about a power that is not available to man in his own world, at least not by means of or- dinary recognition: about a power that is transcendent and supramundane. But myth speaks about this supramundane 89</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION 90 power in the inadequate terms of worldly space. Transcendence is described as re- moteness in space, projected above or be- neath the earth. In brief, the transcend- ent power is perceived in an anthropo- morphic perspective as an immanent though highly exalted reality. Doubtless this is done contrary to the intention of mythological speaking. But the kind of imagination and terms employed trans- mute transcendence into immanence, so that even gods are represented as some kind of supermen. God above in heaven, his omnipotence and omniscience, is dis- tinguished from mankind here by means of this "omni," i.e., by means of quantity and not by quality as "wholly other." Some critics have argued that Bult- mann's criterion for what is to be taken as mythology is nothing other than the science of the nineteenth century. They think that his demand is only an off- spring of nineteenth-century positivism. This kind of criticism is obviously based on a misunderstanding. Whether it be the science of the nineteenth or of the twen- tieth century, its world view cannot be a criterion for the truth itself, since no world view can be used as such. The mod- ern world view is used only in order to criticize the mythological world view of the Bible but not as a criterion of the truth contained in it. But even if and when present science is antiquated by a future one, neither the scientific world view of the twentieth nor that of the nineteenth century can be called "myth- ological" in the specific meaning of the term, since the decisive feature is miss- ing, namely, the idea that unexplainable phenomena are perceived as the immedi- ate breaking-in of transcendent powers. It is, however, Bultmann's intention to demonstrate that the truth of the Chris- tian gospel is independent of any world view, either past, present, or future. The method is called "demythologiz- ing." This term is a correct translation of the word used by Bultmann, Entmytholo- gisierung. It points to the deeper mean- ing of mythology. Now some may say, if this is all that Bultmann wants, then he is carrying owls to Athens. Indeed, since the age of the Enlightenment, the myth- ological passages of the Bible have been understood as figurative speech, at least among liberal scholars and preachers. Mythology, they say, has no more value; it must be dismissed; it must be elimi- nated. Bultmann, however, decisively re- jects this practice. This method of elimi- nating mythological passages is unten- able for him, because, by deleting all that we regard as out of date, we would have left only a small portion of the Bible. Elimination is not permitted, for all mythological passages hold a deeper truth and a permanent meaning. Elimina- tion leads toward limitation. Therefore we must interpret the myth in order to lay bare the actual scope, the deeper truth, which is independent of the picture lan- guage and mythological thinking of ear- lier ages. Instead of elimination Bult- mann demands interpretation of the myth, and this not merely here and there but consistently. The interpretation of the myth is often demanded by the myth itself. Plato, for instance, uses and interprets myths, being well aware that mythology requires an explanation of its deeper meaning.5 Theon writes, "Myth is a deceptive word shaped in an image of truth"; and Plu- tarch says, "The myth claims to be a word which, though deceptive, depicts truth."6 But more important is the fact that the New Testament itself begins with interpreting mythological passages, as in Paul's writings and especially in John.7 Is there a methodological key for the</page><page sequence="5">EXISTENTIALIST INTERPRETATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT interpretation of mythology, since inter- pretation demands that we do not intro- duce our own wisdom? The key may be seen in the crucial question: "What does the myth say about man's relation to God in the midst of this world?" The for- mulation of this question, which must be the leading one, is based upon the insight that the Bible does not teach a particular cosmology or new aspects of the world's structure but that it reveals what the Christ-event means for our own relation to God and for our existence in the midst of history. Therefore, the leading ques- tion must be: "Does the biblical mythol- ogy contain a new conception of our situ- ation before God?" Or, in other words: "What is the conception of the under- standing of our personal existence ex- pressed in the myth?" To put the matter in a positive way: Demythologizing is ex- istentialist interpretation.8 Let us take up the example of mythol- ogy given above: Heaven is God's dwell- ing place. This statement intends to ex- press the insight that God is not a part of this world but that he is superior, beyond and transcendent. The conception of God's being-beyond is expressed by the mythological assertion of his spatial re- moteness. The existentialist interpreta- tion further. emphasizes that this is never an objectifying statement but the confes- sion of faith that man is inferior, that the faithful is aware of his own finiteness in thought, intention, and effectiveness. In speaking about God's being-beyond, man expresses his own situation facing God's power as not available to human think- ing or action. In a similar way the myth- ological term "hell" intends to express the being-beyond of the Evil's power and the unbeliever's being-lost. The existentialist interpretation con- cerns itself with the claim that is pre- sented in the New Testament, with this summons that opens new possibilities for my own existence; it points toward a call to decision involving a surrender of my self-sufficiency, my self-security, where- by I accept the security of God's grace. This demonstrates that there must be a pre-understanding of human existence and its contingencies if we are to see and understand them in the mythological cos- tume. Bultmann emphasizes that no un- derstanding of the New Testament is possible without such a pre-understand- ing. But he insists that we must test and question and correct our pre-understand- ing in the course of reading and studying the texts so that a dialogue between the claim of the text and my own existence occurs. We in our self-understanding must ourselves be questioned by the text, when the claim of the text is understood.9 In other words, to understand a text re- quires that we stand under the claim of its call! Or, as Collingwood puts it, the historian's knowledge "is knowledge of the past in the present, the self-knowl- edge of the historian's own mind as the present revival and reliving of past ex- periences.T"10 The question arises whether Bult- mann's conception is more a philosophi- cal than a biblical one. Does he not elimi- nate by philosophical interpretation the whole realm of wonder and transform the Christian faith into a rationalized truth in order to modernize Christianity? The theology of Bultmann is indeed, by means of the existentialist interpretation, nothing other than a theological anthro- pology; the Christology is only relevant as soteriology, since the crucial question: "What is said about our personal exist- ence?" excludes the significance of ob- jectifying statements about the charac- ter of God's being, about Christ's nature, about the redemptive plan in history as such, etc." God is a transcendent reality. 9I</page><page sequence="6">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION He is the Deus absconditus and he is revelatus only in the Christ-event. There- fore-in this Bultmann is akin to Barth -we are not able to speak about God as an intelligible object. But we can and must speak about our relation to God, which is a relation in faith; we can and must speak about the actual encounter of man and God in Jesus Christ.1 Speak- ing about one's own existence and one's understanding of self, however, does not mean to speak in anthropological terms in a general sense, since an understanding of my personal existence must take into account that a human existence is marked by its being related to God and by its being in this world. My own exist- ence is not an objectifiable phenomenon; it is always indissoluble from God and the world. Existentialist interpretation seeks to explain the response of faith to the en- counter with God and Christ. Such an explanation is bound to human cate- gories, to a terminology by means of which the contingencies of human exist- ence can be adequately described. Con- sciously, Bultmann uses the existentialist terminology, the philosophical terms de- fined by Martin Heidegger. The question arises whether it is possible to use philo- sophical terms without carrying with them philosophical results. The first fact we should keep in mind is the observation in the history of theology that there is no theology without a relation to contem- porary philosophical thought-at least since the times of the earliest theologians, the Apologists in the second century. There is no biblical exegesis that does not in its method employ criteria taken from outside the Bible. As long as we are doing research work, our studies are character- ized by Greek scientific methods, arguing from cause and effect. No method as such can ever be called "Christian";13 but the scholar himself who uses such secular methods should be a Christian. Even among the Pietists of the nineteenth cen- tury who tried to explain the Bible in biblical terms an obvious idealistic con- ception can be found. The philosophical background of scholars like Harnack or Barth is indubitable. It is an illusion or fiction to pretend that we can speak in theological terms without using the lan- guage of our time which is, as the lan- guage of educated people always is, con- sciously or unconsciously influenced by philosophical presuppositions. When the- ology tries to clarify these presupposi- tions, to lay bare the existential pre-un- derstanding and its existentialist concep- tion, as Bultmann, Tillich,'4 and others do, it should be regarded as a virtue, even if this never can prevent a possible misuse. Finally, the biblical authors did not worry about this; they used nonbibli- cal terms for their theological explana- tions. One would not say that avrelt6rts, introduced by Paul into the New Testa- ment, is a "biblical" term. And, in using it, Paul takes over philosophical elements from the Greeks. Now, if this statement about the un- avoidable use of philosophical terms in theological discourse is accepted, the question still remains whether Bultmann does not reduce Christian truth to a pure phenomenon of faith understood as only the existential response to a divine action that cannot be described. It is the prob- lem whether or not his exposition of the leading exegetical question, "What does the text say about my personal existence before God and in this world?" limits the answer from the very beginning of his approach. This question is a legitimate one, in so far as it underlies all theology, whether that of Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Schleiermacher, Barth, or Niebuhr. How- 92</page><page sequence="7">EXISTENTIALIST INTERPRETATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT ever, it is not then a limitation peculiar to the existentialist interpretation, but it is determined by the personal existence of the theologian in question. Bultmann emphasizes that "theology" means the explication of faith, the explication of the understanding implicit in faith. We are left to the insight that "theology" is de- termined by the situation of its exposi- tion and is necessarily incomplete.'5 For faith, theological sentences can never be an object, since they are its explication. What then is the object of faith? It is the Christian kerygma, nothing else. And the kerygma in the New Testament contains the calling and challenging Word of God occurring in the redemptive act of Christ, the Word of God spoken in the man Jesus of Nazareth once for all, eia7ra4. This kerygma, the proclamation of God as act- ing in the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ for us, is part of the paradoxical event and cannot be objectified if it is understood in faith and is therefore be- yond the sphere of demythologizing.'6 The existentialist interpretation of the New Testament dealing with the explica- tion of faith in Christ has to keep in mind that faith as rtlrts cannot be explicated without reference to its object, namely, the kerygma, the summons. The last objection mentioned above concerns the danger of rationalizing the Christian truth. Does not demythologiz- ing put aside God's mystery? Bultmann himself takes up this problem and says: "The Christian truth and the mystery of God must be understood, but under- standing is different from rational ex- plaining. An example may clarify this. I can understand what friendship, love, and faithfulness are. But this does not mean that friendship, love, and faithful- ness offered to me as a gift during my life do not still remain a mystery gratefully accepted. For I do not recognize them by means of rational thinking but in existen- tial openness. In very much the same way I can understand what the grace of God means; otherwise I could not speak about it. But to be met by this grace still remains a mystery inexplicable in ration- al terms. Without understanding the Word of God's grace in Christ I cannot believe it. To make it understandable is the concern of demythologizing." It may be that Bultmann underesti- mates the value and the necessity of using symbols in our theological lan- guage. But in using symbols we are aware of their symbolical character, and we keep in mind that they only make trans- parent the transcendent reality and do not pretend to be adequate. In using symbolic speech, we are in fact demy- thologizing. Therefore, Bultmann never would criticize this. The task of demythologizing or exis- tentialist interpretation cannot be con- sidered complete in the mere outlines given by Bultmann in the second part of his monograph. It must be accomplished by a whole generation of scholars and be done over and over again, since no theo- logical interpretation is final. Bultmann, of course, does not pretend that his life- work, his Theology of the New Testament, has fulfilled the task. But he thinks that it is at least a step forward. HTis ap- proach in all his scholarly work is moti- vated by a deep missionary intention, namely, to make understandable the truth of the stumbling block, Jesus Christ, to the educated men, to the intel- lectuals in the best sense of the word. But he is addressing not only those who are indifferent. He is at the same time attacking our ecclesiastical self-security and scholastic self-sufficiency, and he uncovers questions that many of his "re- ligious" contemporaries try to keep cov- 93</page><page sequence="8">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ered in order to protect the illusion of security. Finally, we must add that Bultmann is concerned not only with how to preach the gospel but also with what is the truth of the gospel we are asked to proclaim. His concern is therefore not primarily the homiletical problem but the hermeneuti- cal problem.'7 Returning to the opening remarks of this article, I would like to emphasize that Bultmann's existentialist interpre- tation does not mean a denial of our lib- eral historical tradition in biblical exege- sis. It is not a break with this tradition but rather an advance in the same direc- tion in order to overcome the theological limitation of pure reconstruction and to preserve at the same time the values of liberal criticism. We must never forget that liberal theology was the cradle of Barth as well as of Bultmann. It is not only the new approach of Barth and the revival of Kierkegaard which can be seen in Bultmann's demand for an existentialist interpretation, and it is not only the terminological clarity of Heidegger which is to be recognized as a decisive feature, but also the hermeneuti- cal problem defined by Dilthey and dis- cussed by the subsequent philosophy and history.'8 The period of somehow naive biblical exegesis is finished. As in the case of historiography, so modern theology is reconsidering its methodology! Biblical exegesis is recognized as a methodological problem, and the question is once more: How can we achieve objectivity in our knowledge of the historical past? How can we attain complete understanding of the past, not some compilation of iso- lated data, not mere antiquarianism, but an understanding of the inner dynamic power that characterizes life in the midst of history? In confronting this question, Bult- mann has demonstrated a new her- meneutical method. He uses the means of the historical-critical school; he em- ploys the criteria of historical method and is one of the most critical scholars in the New Testament field with regard to the reliability of our sources. But he al- ways interprets his biblical texts-even such synoptic pericopes as he finds to be legendary and not authentic, or mythical and not kerygmatic. And his interpreta- tion is determined, as it was in Schleier- macher and in Dilthey, not by psycho- logical interests but by existentialist in- terests. In fact, no understanding and no interpretation of sources are possible without the inter esse of the scholar. The scholar has to engage in a dialogue with the past which he regards as a part of his own history. He asks the past, and this engages his inter esse with regard to new contingencies of human existence before God and in the world. It is the character- istic of a real scholar that in asking his sources he questions himself; he criticizes his own self and discloses thus the new contingencies. Only by this methodologi- cal approach, it seems to me, does objec- tivity of historical knowledge achieve its highest results. It is thus that we become aware of the claim of the past upon our very existence. In other words, the sig- nificance of the historical past for our present becomes again understandable. The problem of interpretation is the problem of understanding. NOTES i.

The paper here discussed was published first as the second part of a small book appearing under the general title, Offenbarung und Heilsgeschehen. The first part contained an article, to which un- fortunately less attention was paid because it was less sensational though not less important, dealing with "the question of natural revelation." Only the second part of this book, the programmatic demand for demythologizing, was reprinted in Kerygma und Mythos, ed. H. W. Bartsch (I948). Discussions of Bultmann's paper in this country: A. N.

The three scholars cited show that emphasis of the theological disciplines has shifted from church history to systematic theology and now to biblical exegesis and theology, at least as far as Germany is concerned. 4. This is the criticism of Brunner (op. cit., p. 312), who in general recognizes the problem Bultmann has posed. 5. Cf. Gerh. Krueger, Einsicht und Leidenschaft (2d ed., I948), pp. 29 ff., 56 ff. 6.

Bultmann, Theology of the New Testa- ment, Vol. I (I951), where examples enough can be found. 8. In Bultmann's books and papers the terms existentiell and existential are often used. The Ger- man existentiell can be translated into English by "existential," meaning that there is a relation to my personal existence, it concerns my own existence, it concerns my own being here and now. The German existential corresponds to the English "existential- ist," meaning that my personal existence is spoken about, an understanding and an explanation of it are involved. An existentialist interpretation means an exegesis that asks for an understanding of per- sonal existence. My own faith is existential, but theology as the understanding and explanation of faith is, or at least should be, existentialist. The distinction is introduced by Martin Heidegger, Sein und Zeit, I, 44-45. 9. Besides the first paper of Bultmann concern- ing demythologizing, the most important contribu- tion to our problem is his article, "Das Problem der Hermeneutik," Zeitschrift fuer Theologie und Kirche, XLVII (1950), 47 ff. He emphasizes here that, with regard to the hermeneutical task of existentialist interpretation, there is no difference between a biblical text and any other historical source. The best example for the method he postu- lates can be seen in his book, Das Urchristentum im Rahmen der antiken Religionen (Zurich, I949). io. R. G. Collingwood, The Idea of History (Oxford, I946), p. I75. 11. R. Bultmann, Theology of the New Testa- ment (I95)?, pp. i9o-9I. 12. Cf. R. Bultmann, Glaube und Verstehen (1933), PP. 26 ff. I3. Nobody would claim the biblical method of a Midrasch used by Paul to be a Christian method by means of which the New Testament must be inter- preted. Or should we take up again the allegorical method because it can be found in the New Testa- ment? Or the typological method-which scholars like W. Vischer, Das Christuszeugnis im Alten Testa- ment, and A. G. Hebert, The Throne of David, are misusing, thus confusing the situation by adopting medieval methods? 14.

Certainly, we very often encounter ob- jectified statements about the resurrection, as, for instance, in references to the empty tomb. All attempts to objectify by means of proving the truth of events, which are redemptive events only for faith and never "true" for neutral observers, are based upon skepticism and miss the "under- standing in faith." Passages of this sort can be found even in the New Testament; we must be critical of them and acknowledge that just here the mytho- logical attempt at objectifying comes through. The legend of the empty tomb taken as a proof or matter of fact is misused; it must be regarded as a confession of faith in the resurrection and must be interpreted in this way. 17. The problem of demythologizing could easily be explained (with less objections!) by an existential- ist interpretation of early Christian art, namely, the paintings in the catacombs and the sculptures of the sarcophagi. We would see then that these documents are confessions of faith and not objective doctrines about God and Christ; they express the 95</page><page sequence="10">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Christian response to the kerygma heard in the sermons. No picture of the crucifixion or the resur- rection appears. The interpretation of the cross can be found first in the passion sarcophagi about A.D. 350. The usage of pagan patterns is wide- spread; the myth of Orpheus is taken up in order to explain the salvation by Christ. The early Chris- tian's understanding of self is expressed in dramatic scenes representing the idea of salvation. Not Christology but soteriology is the prior concern, at least during the pre-Constantine period of Chris- tian art. The universal significance of Christ is con- fessed by the pagan symbols of the sun and the moon. Of course, interpretation of all this demands as a prerequisite historical studies of Christian his- tory, the history of religion, and the history of art; these serve as analogues to the New Testament field. At the same time it is obvious that a pure recon- struction of the past does not help. We need the interpretation of early Christian understanding of self in order to recognize the language of those pic- tures. And this demands the "demythologizing" of the myth that contains the Christian truth. I8. Cf. Bultmann, Das Problem der Hermeneutik (I95o), and W. Dilthey, Gesammelte Schriften, V (I924), 317 ff.
