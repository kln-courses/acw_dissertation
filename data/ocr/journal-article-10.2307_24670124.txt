Scopus, Israel msmarenmsmaren @mscc. huji. ac.il Abstract This article investigates whether Philo and the rabbis were intrigued by the same problems in the Biblical text and how they solved them. Three sets of questions and answers are studied, pertaining to the trees of Life and Knowledge as well as to God's famous saying "let us make man" (Gen. 1:26). Each cluster is investi gated in its historical context and in comparison to its parallel in the other corpus. Philo and Genesis Rabbah operated in radically different environments. While Philo was directly familiar with Homeric scholarship and applied certain of its methods to Scripture, Genesis Rabbah emerged in an environment where Chris tian exegetes rivaled their study of the same text. Questions and answers were now raised concerning the same verses and helped to define boundaries between the different groups.

Initially, the great variety of questions and answers has to be acknowl edged. Questions range from text-critical to exegetical, educational and rhetorical types. Aristarchus, the most famous of Alexandrian Homer scholars, already complained about the pervasiveness of questions, which seemed artificial to him, because they did not serve rigorous text criticism of the kind in which he engaged (Schol II. 10:372). Diversity also charac terized the Jewish community of Alexandria.

Identifying "versteckte ζητήματα," Van der Horst reconstructed the question, which prompted certain interpretations in GR, and reached the important conclusion that this Midrash and Philo often share the same exeget ical impetus, while providing different answers. In particular, Philo favours allegorical solu tions, whereas the rabbis tend towards literal interpretations. Van der Horst argued on phenomenological grounds, identifying typical procedures and assumptions of Ancient Jewish exegesis, yet leaving open how Philo and GR are historically related to each other and, furthermore, whether the implication of questions rather than their explicit formula tion has any significance.

Philos interpretations of Genesis and GR are initially conspicuous, because they are the only Jewish writings extant from Antiquity, which explicitly and systematically quote verses from the book of Genesis and explain them.7 These two commentaries thus invite comparison. Moreover, GR is a highly scholarly midrash, which probably emerged in the context of an academy rather than a synagogue, preferring close analysis of each verse to sermons.8 Its contributors share Philos 41 Critical questions concerning verisimilitude and contradiction between verses are raised by Demetrius and the anonymous Bible exegetes whom he quotes (Eus., PE 9.21.14, 9.29.15); conservative questions are raised in Ar. 128-71. For details on the former, see Maren R. Niehoff, "Homeric Scholarship and Bible Exegesis in Alexandria. Evidence from Philo's ,Quarrelsome' Colleagues," CQ 57 (2007): 166-82. 51 The most common terms used by Philo are: αί ίεραί βίβλοι (e.g. Conf. 3) and αί ίεραΐ γραφαί (e.g. Opif. 77); for a fine discussion of the Hellenistic Egyptian background of these terms and their theological significance in Philo's writings, see Helmut Burkhardt, Die Inspiration Inspiration heiliger Schriften bei Philo von Alexandrien (Giessen: Brunnen Verlag, 1988), esp. 79-91; see also the recent exchange by Folker Siegert and Jens Herzer, in Philo und das NeueNeue Testament (ed.

Niebuhr; WUNT 172; Tubingen: Mohr, 2004), 205-40; see also my review of the latter volume in TLZ132 (2007): 644-47. 6) A detailed analysis of the connections between Philo's exegesis and Homeric scholarship will be provided in a separate monograph. Some pioneering work in this direction has already been done; see esp. Adam Kamesar, "Philo, Grammatike and the Narrative Aggada," in Pursuing the Text: Studies in Honor of Ben Zion Wacholder on the Occasion of His Seventieth Birthday Birthday (ed. J.C. Reeves and J.

Finally, an extraordinary amount of Greek words in GR, often simply transliterated into Hebrew, suggests that its contributors as well as its readers were deeply immersed in the Greek language and perhaps also in Hellenistic culture.9 It is thus appropriate to ask whether these rabbinic scholars shared some of Philo's Hellenistic background regarding the "question and answer" tech nique. Where they, too, familiar with the Homeric zetemata and applied them to Scripture or did they even rely on Philonic material, available in Origen's library in Caesarea?10 My first observation is a negative one: GR contains relatively few explicit questions on the Biblical text. Comparisons to daily-life situations and parables are far more frequent. GR thus differs from Philo's treatise Ques tionstions and Answers on Genesis and Exodus (Q&amp;A), which raises a question on virtually every verse and provides one or more answers. In a way GR resem bles Philo's two other exegetical corpora, the Allegorical Commentary and the Expositio, where occasional questions on particular verses are woven into the overall fabric of interpretation. On the whole, Philo raises many more questions in several different contexts, intensively engaging in this style of exegesis. GR, on the other hand, is clearly more removed from zetematic activity. Occasionally, however, a question is raised concerning a 5) A glance at the bottom pages of the Theodor-Albeck edition, where the original Greek of such transliterations is listed, suffices to give an impression of the vast amount of Greek in GR. 10' On the possibility of rabbinic familiarity with Philo's works, see esp. Dominique Bar thelemy, "Est-ce Hoshaya Rabba qui censura le 'Commentaire Allegorique'?" in Philon d'ALexandrie.d'ALexandrie.

Holum; DMOA 21; Leiden: Brill, 1996), 492-3. Vice versa, Philo may be taken to share Palestinian traditions, which were subsequently incorporated into rabbinic works (Ben jamin Ritter, Samuel Belkin, Naomi Cohen). Such an assumption, however, is problematic, since we cannot know which rabbinic materials were available in Palestine at that time. Moreover, Philo was a proud Diaspora Jew, who did not look towards Zion for exegetical inspiration; for details on the methodological issues as well as Philo's attitude, see Maren R. Niehoff, "Alexandrian Judaism in 19th Century Wissenschaft des Judentums■. Between Christianity and Modernization," in Jiidische Geschichte in hellenistisch-romischer Zeit (ed. A.

In light of this general situation it is striking that certain questions from Philos writings resurface in GR. These questions provoked clusters of answers, indicating that they were discussed in wider circles and over sev eral generations of scholars. The similarity between them, however, is not sufficiently precise to support the conclusion that one directly copied from the other. A more complex picture emerges, which requires us to take addi tional factors into account. Each cluster of "questions and answers" must be examined not only with regard to the nature of its zetematic activity and its parallel in the other corpus, but also in its own cultural and historical context. Philo thus needs to be appreciated especially with regard to the scholarly activities in Alexandria, the traditional centre of Homeric exe gesis. Was he familiar with the methods of his Greek colleagues and, if so, how did he apply them to biblical exegesis? Rabbinic scholars, on the other hand, were situated further away from the centre of Homeric scholarship, while at the same time facing the new challenge of Christian exegesis, which often applied certain Alexandrian techniques to Scripture and engaged in polemical dialogue with their Jewish colleagues.11 Did the "questions and answers" in GR play a role in the encounter between Jews and Christians?12 Questions and Answers on the Tree of Knowledge Studying specific examples will throw light on these issues. My first example is the tree of knowledge in the Garden of Eden, which prompted similar 111 On Christian scholarship, see esp. Bernd Neuschafer, Origenes als Philologe (Basel: Reinhardt, 1987), who showed that Origen applied methods of Homeric scholarship mainly in his exegetical inquiries, while his text critical studies basically amounted to a comparison ofLXX manuscripts; cf. also Adam Kamesar,Jerome, Greek Scholarship, and the Hebrew Hebrew Bible (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993); Christoph Schaublin, Untersuchungen zu MethodeMethode und Herkunft der Antiochenischen Exegese (Theophaneia 23; Koln: Hanstein, 1974); Robert C. Hill, Reading the Old Testament in Antioch (Bible in Ancient Christianity 5; Leiden: Brill, 2005), 63-83■ 121 I have argued elsewhere that the contributors to GR were familiar with Christian exe gesis and sought to provide answers to its sometimes highly polemical character, see esp.

Only these two inquired into the nature of the tree, while other Jewish exegetes of the Second Temple Period, such as the author of the Book of Jubilees and even Josephus, merely para phrased the biblical description.13 The tree of knowledge seems to have played hardly any role at Qumran.14 For Philo and GR, however, this tree is of particular concern, being examined in the following way: Philo, QG 1:11 (ed. B. Aucher) S}1b^ t ijiuijm q}11nb|]1h &lt;Su1Um;&gt;h|J1 puipui] b ^u1p}1 τί έστι τό ξύλον τοΰ είδέναι γνωστόν καλοΰ και πονηρού15 What is the meaning of [the expression] 'the tree of knowing, of discern ing good and evil' GR 15:7 (ed. Theodor-Albeck) מה היה אותו האילן שאכלו ממנו אדם וחווה What was that tree from which Adam and Eve ate Philo and the anonymous rabbinic exegete in GR raise a rather general question concerning the tree of knowledge, inquiring into its precise nature. Philo's "τί έστι" question resembles his colleague's formulation מה היה אותו האילן. Their respective answers, however, differ significantly. Philo initially stresses that Gen 2:9 is "elusive in its literal meaning" (J1 ^iuintu t ijiuijuntuin). In the Allegorical Commentary, where he also treats God's planting of the Garden of Eden (Gen 2:8), he explains his approach in greater detail:16 131 Jub. 3:18-19; Josephus, Ant. 1.37-38. 141 One short fragment (4Q423 1-2 i), commenting on the expression כל עץ נעים נחמד להשכיל, suggests that the מבץ is put in charge of knowledge, see text and comments by Matthew J. Goff, Discerning Wisdom: The Sapiential Literature of the Dead Sea Scrolls (VTSup 116; Leiden: Brill, 2007), 36-38. 151 This line is my own translation of the Armenian into Greek. I used the LXX and trans lated the expression t (+ Biblical quotation) in line with Philo's general use in the extant Greek fragments which can be checked against the Armenian translation (e.g. QG 1:51,1:51, 1:70, 1:72, 2:15, 2:59, ed. F. Petit). 161 The more concise nature of the Q&amp;A in relation to the Allegorical Commentary has often been noted. Recently, this difference has been interpreted as a sign that the Q&amp;A was a preliminary exercise to the Allegorical Commentary; see esp. Abraham Terian, "The Priority of the Quaestiones among Philo's Exegetical Commentaries," in Hay, Both Literal and Allegorical,Allegorical, 29-46; Gregory Sterling, "Philo's Quaestiones■. Prolegomena or Afterthought?" ibid, 99-123; while Anita Measson and Jacques Cazeaux, "From Grammar to Discourse: A Study of the Questiones in Genesim in Relation to the Treatises," ibid., 125-225, stressed that the difference needs to be interpreted mainly in terms of genre and audience.</page><page sequence="7">Μ.

(Leg. 1.43) Philo rejects the literal meaning of the verse, because it depicts God in an overtly mythological and anthropomorphic fashion. Similarly, the notion of a tree providing knowledge of good and evil appears problematic to Philo, because virtue, in his view, is acquired by understanding and intellectual progress rather than by eating a physical fruit (Leg. 1.103). Such ideas are discarded and an allegorical reading is offered instead. Philo interprets the tree as a reference to prudence planted in the human heart. This particular "question and answer" is representative of Philo's overall approach. While some of his colleagues admitted that the Hebrew Bible contains myths similar to those found in Greek literature, Philo, like his predecessor predecessor Aristobulus, generally denied any mythological dimension.17 Philo is the first known Jewish exegete to raise a question concerning the tree of knowledge. He does so in a style highly reminiscent of Homeric scholarship. The τί έστι question was common among Alexandrian schol ars, especially those whose work has been preserved in the exegetical scho lia.18lia.18 These scholars tended to offer literary explanations for exceptional expressions. The τί έστι question introduces enquiries into the precise identity of a dramatic person, special stylistic features and, most frequently, the meaning of a particular phrase.19 A characteristic example is to be found in the Scholion on II. 23:638, which raises the question "what is the meaning of the expression 'outstripped [me] by force of their numbers'?" This question was raised, because Nestor thus describes the twin sons of Actor, who were victorious in the horse race. The scholiast is puzzled by the 171 See esp. Philo, Conf. 2-13; Aristobulus apud Eusebius, Praep. ev. 8.10.1-2 (ed. and comments by Carl R. Holladay, Fragments from Hellenistic Jewish Authors [Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1995], 3:134-36). Note that Aristobulus deals with "questions posed" to him (τά προκείμενα ζητήματα), when recommending the "natural sense" (τό φυσικώς) and reject ing the "mythological" (τό μυθώδες).

Franco Montanari; Storia e Letteratura 210; Rome: Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura, 2002), 170-77. 1?) See e.g. Schol. II. 2:118, 5:2a, 5:87, 5:307, 5:870, 6:43, 22:51e, 23:72b, 23:627b.</page><page sequence="8">344 Μ. R. Niehoff/Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 reference to a multitude, which seems inappropriate as a description of only two figures. He consequently tried to solve the problem by enquiring into both the precise meaning of the expression as well as the nature of the brothers and their chariots. Different solutions are offered. Antidoros transmits the solution of some (τινές), who said that the brothers "brought many chariots to the competition, impeding by them the chariots of their rivals." Others are reported to have said (άλλοι δέ φασι): "Before the start of the race they paid a prize to those competing with the sons of Actor. Therefore they released the chariots of those much earlier and let them advance." These two scholiasts added explanatory material, showing that Nestor had reason to refer to a multitude as the brothers could only win the race by using numerous aids. Aristarchus, by contrast, offered a new interpretation of the expression "twins." In his view, one must take it "not in the way we habitually understand, namely twins of the sort as the Dioskouroi,Dioskouroi, but twins in the sense of'double-natured', having two bodies." Nestor's reference to a multitude thus turns out to be an appropriate description of four brothers. Philo's τί έστι question echoes Homeric scholarship. Like his Greek col leagues he inquires into a textual detail and identifies a particular problem, in this case the mythological nature of the tree of knowledge. The problem is solved by an allegorical reading, a method well known already to Plato and Aristotle.20 Applying methods of Homeric scholarship to Gen 2:9, Philo achieves two important goals: he provides an explanation satisfying philosophical notions and stresses the uniqueness of the Jewish Scriptures. At first sight, these two seem to contradict each other as scholars have often thought that a translation of concrete biblical images into philo sophical notions abolishes Jewish distinctiveness. David Dawson's pioneer ing work, however, has shown that this is not necessarily the case. On the contrary, allegory often serves to assert Jewish identity, allowing its authors to absorb Greek culture into a scriptural framework.21 When Philo 20י While Plato rejected it (Resp. 2:378d), Aristotle embraced it (Aporemata Homerica, fragm. 175, ed. Valentine Rose); see also Luc Brisson, How Philosophers Saved Myths.

R. Niehoff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 345 interprets the tree of knowledge as prudence planted in the heart, he, too, asserts Jewish identity, because he thus insists that the Hebrew Bible, as opposed to Classical literature, does not contain myth. The significance of Philo s interpretation can be grasped by comparison to Origen's Contra Celsum. Origen supplies here an argument about the Garden of Eden, which Celsus, in his view, should have made, were he consistent. Were anybody to follow Celsus' approach, Origen argues, he would identify as myth both the biblical story and its close parallel in Plato's Symposion (Cels. 4.39). A literal reading of biblical myth is bound to amount to a comparison of similar stories in Greek literature. Similarly, Julian the Apostate described the biblical story of the Garden of Eden as "altogether mythical" (μυθώδη παντελώς) and parallel to other foolish stories (C. Gal. 75A-B). Rejecting this kind of comparative mythology, Philo stresses the unique nature of Scripture which, in his view, conveys only pure spiritual messages. The rabbinic answer to the question מה היה אותו האילן is diametrically opposed to Philo's. The literal sense of Gen 2:9 is taken for granted and the precise species of the tree is examined. The editor of GR has collected various answers, reflecting a remarkable tradition of dealing with this issue. Generations of rabbinic teachers applied themselves to the same question, providing ever new answers, while also discussing earlier solutions: "The tree of knowledge" (Gen 2:9). What was that tree from which Adam and Eve ate? R. Meir said: it was wheat, because when a person lacks understanding, people say: that man has never in his life eaten wheat bread. R. Samuel b. Isaac came before R. Zeira and asked him: is it possible that it was wheat? He answered: yes, but he replied: yet it is written "tree." R. Zeira explained: wheat plants grow high like the cedars of Lebanon. [digression on the blessing for the bread and the nature of lefeth, a vegetable accompanying bread] R. Judah b. Ilai said: it was grapes, as it is written "their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter" (Deut 32:32): those clusters brought bitterness to the world. R. Aba of Acco said: it was a citron, as it is written "and the woman saw that the tree (עץ) was good for food" (Gen 3:6). Consider: go out and exam ine the wood (עץ) of which tree is eaten just as the fruit and you will find none other than the citron.</page><page sequence="10">346 Μ. R. Niehoff/Journal for the Study ofJudaism 39 (2008) 337-366 R. Jose said: they were figs; can one not learn one thing from the word itself and another from its context?22 This may be compared to the son of a king who disgraced himself with one of the servant girls. As the king heard of this, he expelled him from the palace and he (the son) kept going around from one to the other door of the servant girls, but none received him, except the one who disgraced herself with him. She opened the door and received him. In the same way, when the first man ate from that tree, [the king] expelled him from the Garden of Eden, and he kept going around all the trees, which did not receive him. What did they say to him? R. Berekhia: (they said) "here is the thief, who stole wisdom from his creator, who stole wisdom from his master, as it is written: 'let not the foot of presumption come upon me' (Ps 36:12), i.e., the foot that presumed against its creator; 'and let not the hand of the wicked shake me' (ibid.), i.e., do not take a leaf from me." But the fig tree, because Adam had eaten from its fruits, opened its doors and received him, as it is written "and they sewed fig-leaves" (Gen 3:7). Of what species was that fig-tree? R. Abin said: it was the berath sheva, because it brought seven days of mourning into the world. R. Josua of Siknin said in R. Levi's name: it was the berath ali, because it brought lamentation and weeping into the world. R. Azariah and R. Judah b. R. Simon said in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi: Heaven forbid! The Holy-One-Blessed-Be-He did not disclose to man the nature of that tree and will not disclose it in the future. See what is written: "and if a woman approaches unto any beast and lie down with it, you shall kill both the woman and the animal" (Lev 20:16). Now if man sinned, how did the animal sin? But it is killed so that the animal would not stand in the mar ket place, people saying: "through this animal so-and-so was killed." When the Holy-One-Blessed-Be-He was anxious to safeguard the honour of his descendants, how much more so His own honour! (GR 15:7) The sheer length of this cluster of answers indicates the great interest, which the tree of knowledge aroused in GR. The editor of the midrash has collected not only different solutions, but also discussions of earlier answers by later teachers. The episode of R. Samuel b. Isaac and R. Zeira discussing R. Meir's answer vividly captures the atmosphere of academic dispute. GR clearly transcends the limited format of Philo's "question and answer," which aimed at advancing one single solution. It is moreover conspicuous that all rabbinic scholars in GR accept the literal meaning of Gen 2:9, 22)22)22) לא דבר מדבר הוא למד ודבך מעעיען. Albeck ad 10c. admitted already that this expression is "strange" and unparalleled. Mirkin uses the Oxford ms, which simply reads: מענינו דבר למד. Mirkin vocalizes the verb as "lamed," i.e. an imperative.</page><page sequence="11">Μ. R. Niehoff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 347 which Philo dismissed as a mythological misreading of scripture.23 Their focus is no longer on the nature of a particular Biblical expression, but rather on the thing itself. The tree of knowledge is taken as a reality and not as a textual motif the meaning of which must be investigated. The question then is whether and how the tree can be botanically identified. The answers vary from Tannaitic to Amoraic times: third generation Tannaitic teachers offer different botanical identifications of the tree, while subsequent Amoraic teachers insist on its intentionally undefined nature. The botanical identifications are supported by general considerations often together with scriptural proof texts. R. Meir thus corroborates his solution by reference to a popular saying; while R. Judah b. Ilai connects the bitter ness, which the tree introduced into the world, with the "grapes of gall" in Deut 32:32. R. Aba of Acco furthermore suggests the citron, because its wood can be eaten, as seemingly implied by Gen 3:6. Finally, R. Jose points to the fig tree, because its leaves cover Adam's and Eve's nakedness of which they become aware after eating from the tree of knowledge (Gen 3:7). The last answer is the most elaborate, including a parable. It also seems to have been the most popular as it was accepted by several other rabbis. The editor of GR presents it as the main tradition. All of these Tannaitic answers sug gest that the tree of knowledge was a regular tree, located in a universe providentially guided by God. The interpreters accept the message of the biblical story, expressing no query about God's command that Adam and Eve should not eat from the tree of knowledge. The Amoraic answer is of a different kind both in content and tone. It obviously differs from the Tannaitic teachings by insisting that the identity of the tree cannot be known. A totally new concern emerges, namely God's honour. The Amoraic scholars indicate that a sensitive theological issue is at stake, introducing their answer by the exclamation "heaven forbid." While they do not explain how God's honour would be offended, if the tree were identified, it seems that they think of people pointing to a specific tree, saying: through this tree God's command was disobeyed. A subtle parallel is suggested between the failure of the woman having sex with an animal and Eve's eating a fruit from the tree of knowledge.24 In both cases 231 As opposed to Philo, it is often characteristic of rabbinic scholars to revive biblical mythologoumena,mythologoumena, see Michael Fishbane, Biblical Myth and Rabbinic Mythmaking (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003); Maren R. Niehoflf, "The Phoenix in Rabbinic Literature," HTRHTRHTR 89 (1996),HTR 89 (1996), 245-65. 241 Note also the often carnal connotation of the term דעת.</page><page sequence="12">348 Μ. R. Niehoff/Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 God's command is transgressed, but in the latter Gods honour is more directly concerned, because He Himself addressed Adam and Eve, wishing to preserve the knowledge of good and evil for Himself (Gen 3:22). It is not surprising that GR preserves only one answer from Amoraic times. The lively Tannaitic discussion of various species of the tree apparently came to an end. This cluster of answers in GR must be placed into the context of its time. Whereas the tree of knowledge hardly aroused any interest in early Second Temple Judaism, questions concerning its nature began to be raised among Tannaitic scholars. It is highly significant that various Christian exegetes, too, began to inquire into the tree's nature and significance. Apelles, Marcion's student, is the earliest extant writer asking moral ques tions concerning the tree which aimed at showing that the biblical story is inconsistent as well as distorting God's image.25 He inquired why God would plant a tree of knowledge and thus provide man with an opportu nity of acquiring wisdom even though He created Adam lacking in wis dom and imperfect. Moreover, Apelles asked whether the biblical story does not prove the serpents point, indicating that disobedience to God is often a good thing.26 These are highly critical questions "dishonoring" God. Could they be the background to the Amoraic answer in GR? Apelles' questions may well have alerted Amoraic teachers, causing them to intro duce a radically new dimension to the rabbinic discussion. Their answer probably responded not only to the question arising from Scripture, but, as on other occasions, also to that posed by an outside speaker.27 Origen's discussion of the tree of knowledge is also relevant, because it addresses the issue of allegorical versus literal interpretation. While his Commentary Commentary on Genesis, where he "laboriously treated these matters as well as possible,"28 is no longer extant, a valuable fragment throws light on Ori gen's approach: Whenever we, as students, ascend from the myths and the interpretation according to the letter, we may inquire of which kind those trees were which 251 See also Katharina Greschat, Apelles undHermogenes. Zwei Theologische Lehrer des zweiten JahrhundertsJahrhunderts (VCSup 48; Leiden: Brill, 2000), 50-68. 26, Apelles apudAmbrosius, Parad. 8:38. 27' Another example is the response in GR to Marcion's criticism of circumcision, discussed by by Niehoff, "Circumcision," 114. 281 Προηγουμένως γαρ έν τοις έξηγητικοΐς της Γενέσεως ώς οίόν τ' ήν εις ταΰτα έπραγματευσάμεθα (Origen, Cels. 4:39).</page><page sequence="13">Μ. R. Niehoff/ Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 349 God planted. We say that it is impossible that [Scripture refers to] sense-per ceptible trees in a place.29 Origen addresses the literal level of Gen 2:9, associating it, like Philo, with myth. He furthermore situates himself within the zetematic tradition, say ing ζητώμεν τίνα τά ξύλα έστιν έκεΐνα. This is precisely the question raised in GR. Origen may well have been familiar with Tannaitic exegesis, emphatically rejecting it. Like Philo, he prefers an allegorical reading of the trees which, in his view, cannot have been physically existent. However, while Philo was eager to cleanse Scripture from mythological connotations in order to distance it from Greek stories, Origen generally used the alle gorical approach to construct Christian identity with respect to the Jews.30 In the next fragment Origen records a literal reading of the Biblical story, which is identified with the approach of "the Hebrews":31 It says in the Septuagint "garden of Eden," the same [expression] being used in the Hebrew language. In reality the interpretation of "Eden" literally is "pleasant."32 Have not the Hebrews then33 taught that the place where God the Lord planted "paradise" or the "garden" is called Eden? Namely they say that it is in the middle of the world, as the pupil of the eye, and therefore the river "Pishon" is interpreted as "the mouth of the pupil," as it is the first river emerging from Eden. Their tradition is as follows: Eden, which is interpreted as "pleasant," existed before the garden came into being, for it was in it that the garden was planted.34 291 Origen apud Eustathius 0FAntioch, Ant. Engast. 21 (fragm 28, PG 12:98-99). 30' On this widespread technique in Origen's work, see esp. Henri Crouzel, "Origene et le sens litteral dans ses 'Homelies sur Hexateuque'," Bulletin de Litterature Ecclesiastique 70 (1969): 241-63. 311 On Origen's general familiarity with "Hebrew" traditions, see esp. Nicholas R. M. De Lange, Origen and the Jews (Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1976), 123-32, who stresses the cooperation between Jews and Christians rather than their polemics. 321 I follow PG, reading ήδύ instead of ήδη (as does Christoph Markschies, whom I wish to thank for giving me his preliminary version of his planned edition of the fragments). My reasons are the following: (1) in the Hebrew Bible the root עדן often means "pleasant/pleas ure" (e.g. Neh 9:25, Ps 36:9) and LXX Gen 3:23-23 translates fW Ρ as τοΰ παραδείσου της τρυφής; (2) Origen follows Philo's interpretation, as evidenced in Leg. 1.45. 33' I follow PG reading ούκοΰν introducing a question rather than ούδέν (Markschies) introducing a statement. The latter does not fit the continuation of the fragment, where the Hebrew literal interpretation is further explained (και φασί γε). 34י Origen apud Eustathius of Antioch, Ant. Engast. 21 (fragm 28, PG 12:98-99).</page><page sequence="14">350 Μ. R. Niehojf/ Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 What can be learnt about GR from the fragments of Origen's Commentary on on Genesis? Initially, it emerges that GR belongs to a zetematic tradition stretching from Philo to Origen and indeed to Jerome.35 As far as Jewish exegesis in the Land of Israel is concerned, GR is the first extant work participating in this discussion.36 In Tannaitic times the question was treated with an unparalleled intensity, significantly transcending Philo's and probably also Origen's "question and answer," while Amoraic teachers deemphasized the question and recommended respectful silence. Moreover, Origen's fragments testify to communication between rab binic and Christian exegetes. Origen seems to have been aware of the "question and answers" preserved in GR and also reports a Jewish inter pretation of the term "Eden." Were rabbinic scholars, in turn, familiar with his allegorical solution? In the absence of direct references to outsid ers, such as minim or a "philosophus," we can only speculate. Is it possible that the Amoraic position is a response to the kind of concerns expressed by Apelles and Origen? Rabbinic scholars would thus have taken some precaution in order to avoid improper talk about God. In any case, the rabbinic insistence on the literal meaning of Gen 2:9 constructs distinct boundaries vis-a-vis Christian exegesis. While "they"' read allegorically, "we" understand Scripture as a reality. In a sense the rabbinic position emerges as the precise mirror image of Philo's. While both insist on the uniqueness of the Hebrew Bible, one does so by denying myth, thus distinguishing it from its Greek environment, while the other insists on myth, thus avoiding Christian appropriations of Scripture through allegory. Questions and Answers on the Tree of Life Our next and related example is the tree of life (Gen. 2:9), which provoked similarly interesting clusters of "questions and answers." Philo once more introduces a τί έστι question, which this time, however, has already been raised by his predecessors: 351 Jerome on Gen 2:8, in Charles T. R. Hayward, Saint Jeromes Hebrew Questions on Genesis.Genesis. Translated with a Commentary and Introduction (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), 31.31. 361 The cluster of'question and answers' in GR appears also in later rabbinic sources (Pesiq. Rab Kah. 20:6, b. Ber. 40a).</page><page sequence="15">Μ. R. Niehoff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 351 What is the meaning [of the expression] "tree of life" and why [was it] in the middle of paradise? Some37 believed that as there are plants [that are] corporeal and mortal, in the same manner [there are plants] of life and immortality. Wherefore they say that life and death are contrary to each other. Some plants are destructive and remedy may be necessary. But they do not know that this state is healthy in as much as, according to the sages, creation is the beginning of corruption. And perhaps this is meant allegorically? (uipq ιψ gnigt uipqtop uijjuipuihhui^ t uiju) Some say that the tree of life is the earth, because it causes everything to sprout whether in the life of man or all other things. Therefore he [Moses] chose the centre place for this tree, because the earth is the centre of all. And some say that the middle of the seven planets, which are in heaven, is called the tree of life. And some [identify the tree as] the sun, because it is really and truly in the middle of the planets and the cause of the seasons, through which everything comes into being. And some say that the tree of life is the government of the soul, because it invigorates and fortifies the faculty of the senses by directing those activities towards what is suitable to itself and towards the cooperation of the parts of the body. And the centre really is, according to the symbolical meaning, the chief and first, as the leader of the chorus. But distinguished and excellent men say that the tree of life is the best of virtues in man, piety, through which exclusively the mind becomes immortalized (QG 1:10). Philo preserves here a precious glance into an otherwise lost world of Jew ish exegesis. The very fact that such a diversity of views existed indicates vibrant scholarly activity around Scripture. Philo's testimony shows that the zetematic approach, first attested in Demetrius and the Letter ofAris teas,teas, continued to flourish in Alexandria. Philo's style is of a distinctly scholarly nature, admitting, within certain limits, a variety of possible solutions. His answer is only one among several others or, in this case, a preference for an already existing interpretation offered by "distinguished and excellent men." In this respect Philo's position differs from the exclu sive claims made, for example, in the Book of Jubilees or in the Pesher HabakukHabakuk from Qumran. The style of reviewing other positions is instead well known from Aristotle's works and the Homeric scholia, where the opinions of τινές and ενιοι are regularly reported.38 In certain circles it 37י The fragmentary Greek evidence indicates that niiuihp translates τινές (QG 1:85) and ενιοι {QG 1:93). 381 Aristotle often introduced his philosophical discussions by a review of previous posi tions (e.g. Cael. 279b34-280a2). In the 25th chapter of his Poetics, where he discusses</page><page sequence="16">352 Μ. R. Niehoff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 thus became part of the scholarly bon-ton to address the arguments of others before advancing one's own. Philo as well as the rabbinic scholars in GR clearly belonged to that milieu. Philo bundled together two questions, namely one concerning the meaning of the expression "tree of life" and the other concerning the tree's central position in the garden. He initially reports a literal answer to the first question. In comparison to the tree of knowledge Philo does not seem to be particularly disturbed by the literal meaning. Considering it in isola tion from the fact that the tree was said to be planted by God, he can accept that some take the word "tree" as referring to a plant ensuring life and immortality. Philo's criticism of this view is not based on an accusation of mythical inventions or impiety, but rather on the famous philosophical argument that creation and corruption are intertwined, one emerging from the other. Philo then inserts an editorial comment—"and perhaps this is meant allegorically?"—introducing a set of solutions, which both offer an alle gorical answer and relate to the tree's central position. The first three solu tions apply Gen 2:9 to the planets, arguing whether the earth, the middle of the seven planets or the sun is meant. Philo lists these interpretations one after the other, suggesting perhaps not only that they share a particular allegorical approach, but also that they relate to each other. Did they derive from the same social milieu or school? Did he transmit a cluster of answers, which had already been collected previously? It is impossible to know, but at least we can appreciate the liveliness of the discussion among Alexan drian Jews favouring an allegorical-cosmological approach. "problems and solutions" of the Homeric Epics, Aristotle clearly has in view previous crit ics, as Nicholas J. Richardson, "Aristotle's Reading of Homer and Its Background," in Homer's Ancient Readers Homer's Ancient Readers (ed. R. Lamberton and J. J. Keaney; Princeton: Princeton Univer sity Press, 1992), 30-40, has shown, but he mentions by name only Glaucon. The frag ments of Aristotle's Aporemata Homerica lack references to other exegetes. This is not surprising, however, since later writers quoting him were naturally interested in his views and not in those of his discussion partners. A similar situation is conspicuous with regard to Philo: the references to other exegetes are only preserved in the Armenian translation of his Q&amp;A and not in the Greek fragments, preserved by later writers interested in specifically Philonic views. Regarding the widespread references to τινές in the Scholia, consider the evidence from the first book of the Iliad: Schol. II. 1: 1:2d, 1:3b, 1:88-9, 1:124b, 1:151, 1:160a, 1:168b, 1:197, 1:200, 1:266-68, 1:306, 1:351b, 1:399-406, 1:400, l:420d, 1:423a, 1:424c, 1:449b, 1:461a, 1:479, 1:486b, 1:532a, 1:591c, 1:593a. Interpreters of Plato's works similarly began to refer to the views of previous scholars, see Maren R. Niehoff, "Did the Timaeus create a Textual Community?" GRBS47 (2007): 161-91.</page><page sequence="17">Μ. R. Niehoff/ Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 353 At the end of the cluster Philo mentions allegorical-psychological inter pretations. Some applied the image of the tree of life to the government of the soul or the best of virtues. Philo also indicates that these are his pre ferred readings, praising the interpreters as "distinguished and excellent men" (puigpli bt_ pmph). He also supports one of the interpretations by adding that the centre indeed signifies leadership. As on other occasions, Philo thus situates himself in the company of allegorical exegetes with a preference for spiritual and psychological over cosmological motifs. His detailed report of other views moreover shows that this group represented but one voice of the diverse Alexandrian Jewish community. The tree of life evi dently aroused lively interest and prompted a variety of answers, ranging from literal to allegorical-cosmological and allegorical-psychological solutions. GR strikingly lacks this interest even though it shares Philo's first ques tion concerning the nature of the tree of life. This tree is not nearly as much discussed as the tree of knowledge, receiving merely the following treatment: A Baraita: a tree extending over the whole life. R. Judah bar Ilai said: the tree of life extends over a span of500 years and the waters of the beginning emerge from under it, but R. Judan said in the name of R. Judah bar Ilai: not only its boughs are a span of 500 years, but even its circumference (GR 15:6). The editor of GR collected two Tannaitic traditions concerning the tree of life, a baraita explaining the very name of the tree as an indication of its width and two versions of Judah bar Uai's argument that the tree has a span of 500 years. Bar Ilai attributes to the tree cosmic dimensions as מהלך חמש מאות שנה is the measure between heaven and earth (GR 6:6). The tree thus reaches the sky and, according to one tradition, the primeval waters emerge under it. Rabbinic exegesis in GR once more prefers a literal read ing with distinct mythological connotations. These conspicuously sparse answers must again be understood in the context of their time. It is highly significant that the tree of life, from an early stage onwards, was given an eschatological interpretation in the Land of Israel. A most illuminating example is to be found in 1 En. 24:4-25:6, where Enoch on his second journey has another vision and perceives a highly exceptional tree, inquiring into its nature: And he [the angel Michael] said unto me, Enoch, "What is it that you are asking me concerning this tree and you are so inquisitive about?"</page><page sequence="18">354 Μ. R. NiehoffI Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 At that moment, I answered, saying, "I am desirous of knowing everything, but specially about this thing." He answered, saying, "This tall mountain which you saw whose summit resembles the throne of God is (indeed) his throne, on which the Holy and Great Lord of Glory, the Eternal King, will sit when He descends to visit the earth with goodness. And as for this fragrant tree, not a single human being has the authority to touch it until the great judgment, when he shall take vengeance on all and conclude (everything) forever. This is for the righteous and the pious. And the elect will be presented with its fruit for life. He will plant it in the direction of the northeast, upon the holy place—in the direc tion of the house of the Lord, the Eternal King. {1 En. 25:1-5, trans. E. Isaac) While this exchange of "question and answer" takes place in extraterrestrial space, it conforms to the rules of the genre: the same question as in GR is raised and an answer is provided. The authority of the angel Michael guar antees the truth of the extraordinary answer. He explains that the tree of life, taken here as in GR as a real thing, will at the end of days provide fruits to the righteous, who will thus live forever. The new creation will retrieve paradise never to be lost again. This eschatological interpretation of the tree is paralleled in a brief remark in 4 Ezra 8:52 and probably goes back to a tradition fragmentarily attested at Qumran.39 It is based on Isa 65:22 and Prov 3:18, which present the tree as a reward either for the people of Israel as a whole or specifically for the righteous.40 Christian exegetes eagerly developed this line of interpretation. In the Letter Letter of Barnabas the tree is for the first time associated with both Chris tian faith and the cross. Initially, it is asserted that those who receive baptism and cleanse their sins, thus directing their spirit and hopes to Jesus, "will eat from them [the fruits of the tree of life] and live forever" {Barn.{Barn. 11:9). The author of the Epistle applies the earlier Jewish tradition about the righteous to the followers of the new religion, stressing the escha tological dimension. Moreover, referring to 4Ezra 4:33 and 5:5, the author of the Epistle associates the tree of life with Jesus' cross and resurrection: Similarly, again, he describes the cross in another Prophet, who says: "and when will all these things be accomplished?" said the Lord: when the tree shall 39י See Alison Jack, "An Arboreal Sign of the End-Time (4Q385 2)," JJS 47 (1996): 337-44. 401 Isa 65:22 כי כימי העץ ימי עמי, LXX identifies the עץ as τοΰ ξύλου της ζωής; Prov 3:18 speaks about wisdom thus: עץ החיים היא למחזיקים בה.</page><page sequence="19">Μ. R. Niehoff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 355 fail and rise, and "when the blood shall flow from the tree." Here again you have a reference to the cross and to him who should be crucified. {Barn.{Barn. 12:1, transl. K. Lake) The author of the Epistle clearly understood Ezras enigmatic sentence "blood shall drip from the wood" (4 Ezra 5:5) as a reference to both the cross and the tree of life. The latter emerges already from the opening ομοίως,ομοίως, which connects this passage to the previous discussion of the tree of life. Moreover, the expression "the tree shall fall and rise" is closely paral leled in 4Q385 2 10 (ויבף עץ ויזקף), which also treats the tree of life, as Marc Philonenko and Alison Jack have shown.41 Justin Martyr moreover interpreted the tree of life as a "symbol" (σύμβολον) of Jesus' cross and second coming {Dial. 86:1). The issue of biblical references to Jesus' cross had already become a significant bone of contention between Jews and Christians. Justin complains that Jews omit ted (άφείλοντο) such a reference in Ps 96:1, which, he claims, originally read:read: ό κύριος έβασίλευσεν άπό του ξύλου {Dial. 73:l-3).Trypho responds by expressing severe doubts that leaders of the Jewish people would manip ulate Scripture {Dial. 73:5). The hesitant tone of his answer, however, indi cates that he is alarmed by such Christian accusations. While this issue was hotly debated among Christians and Jews, Justin adopts an earlier Jewish tradition about the tree of life, apparently without engaging in polemics. He explains that Adam and Eve, after eating from the tree, were indeed punished with death "on that day" (Gen 2:17), because for God a day amounts to 1000 years {Dial. 81:3). This is an answer to the crux why Adam and Eve continued to live even though God had threatened them with death on the very day on which they ate from the tree of life. Justin's solution relies on an early Jewish tradition from the Land of Israel, based on Ps 90:4 and first attested in Jub. 4:30. In light of this rich exegesis and the attested controversy between Jews and Christians, the discussion in GR appears surprisingly limited. It evi dently lacks the interest of Philo and his colleagues, while ignoring also a significant tradition back home. The exegesis in GR must be interpreted as a conscious posture, intentionally avoiding interpretations which had been embraced by Christian exegetes. The tree of life is thus discussed only as a mythological plant in the Garden of Eden, while the divine 4,1 Marc Philonenko, "Un arbre se courbera et se redressera (4Q485 2 9-10)," RHPR 73 (1993-94): 401-4; Jack, "An Arboreal Sign," esp. 338-39.</page><page sequence="20">356 Μ. R. Niehoff/Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 commandment concerning the tree is only placed into the context of specific Jewish laws.42 Eschatological motifs, such as the future reward of the righteous, as well as the number 1000 are not mentioned. The impres sion of a conscious limitation on the part of GR is further supported by the fact that Enoch's ascent to God, so popular in earlier Jewish eschatol ogy and Christian imagination, is discussed in this Midrash only in terms of answers given to the minim and the Matrona, who both insist that, according to Scripture, Enoch never died (GR 23:1). Looking at the "questions and answers" concerning the paradisiac trees, we reach the following conclusions: both Philo and GR belong to the zetematiczetematic tradition, ranging from Homeric scholarship to Jewish and Christian Bible exegesis. Philo of Alexandria closely echoes the Greek tra dition, using some distinct research methods of Homeric scholarship. It is more difficult to know where precisely GR fits into such a context. Did GR receive Philo's τί έστι questions and used them for its own ends or were these questions sufficiently general to be known independently by the rab bis? The latter option is rather more likely, since GR does not preserve any trace of Philo's answers. Moreover, Philo's report of previous answers indi cates that many other Jews had been intrigued by the nature of the trees. Rabbinic scholars could thus have been inspired by a number of other sources or, alternatively, been stimulated by the same curiosity. Neverthe less, it is significant that GR is the first extant source after Philo raising a question concerning the tree of knowledge, while the tree of life had been discussed by numerous other exegetes in the Land of Israel. Questions and Answers Concerning the Creation of Man Our third and final example pertains to the creation of man, as described in Gen 1:26: "Let us make man in our image and likeness." This famous verse prompted significant clusters of "questions and answers" in Philo's writings as well as in GR. While the relevant passage from Philo's Q&amp;A is no longer extant, his discussion in the Expositio and the Allegorical Com mentarymentary amply illustrate his approach. Philo says the following in the con text of the creation of the world: Should someone not without justification raise the difficulty (άπορήσειε δ' αν τις ουκ άπό σκοπού) why now he [Moses] attributed (άνέθηκεν) the crea 421 GR 16:16 interpreting Gen 2:17.</page><page sequence="21">Μ. R. Niehoff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 357 tion of man only not to one demiurge as with all the others, but seemingly to many. For he introduces (εισάγει) the Father of everything speaking thus: 'Let us create man according to our image and likeness' (DOC Gen 1:26). I would [rather] ask (εϊποιμ' άν) whether the One to whom everything is subordinate is in need of anything whatsoever? He who had no need of any collaborator when He created the heaven and the earth and the sea—should He not have been able to make such a humble and perishable creature as man without helpers, just by Himself?! (Opif. 72) Philo hesitantly introduces here a question concerning the plural form of ποιήσωμεν. It is "not without justification," he says, that "someone may raise the aporema." Philo seems to address a sensitive issue with which he is not quite comfortable. Some other scholar may well have raised it before or else Philo himself anticipates a difficulty any careful reader would raise concerning Gen 1:26. Philo's formulations provide some clues into the profile of the kind of scholar who would or indeed did raise such a ques tion. Obviously, that scholar belongs to the tradition of aporemata ranging from Aristotle's famous work to Homeric scholarship in Alexandria. More significantly, that scholar relates to Scripture as a literary work, dwelling on its authors intention and style. He asks why the author "attributed" a par ticular expression to one of the characters and "introduced" him by a par ticular speech. This highly sophisticated literary approach had been introduced by Aristotle in the twenty-fifth chapter of his Poetics and sub sequently became influential among Homeric scholars in Alexandria.43 Following Aristotle, many scholars turned away from Plato's central con cern for the exemplarity of Homer's Epics and their moral usefulness in the education of future leaders. Instead, they evaluated the literary quality of the text, inquiring into its poetic effect. Strategies of representation thus became a subject of keen interest. Aristotle had already demanded that the critic consider who is speaking to whom, in which manner and under which circumstances (Poet. l46la4-9). The aporema, which Philo presents in the above quoted passage, precisely fits into this context. 431 Gerald F. Else, Plato and Aristotle on Poetry (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1986), 17-24; Nicholas J.

R. NieboffΊJournalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 Philo's answer is somewhat surprising as it is an ironic counter-question. This suggests that originally a different solution may have been offered. As it is no longer extant, we can only speculate about its nature by examining certain clues in Philo's apologetics. When sharply asking his readers whether one can really think of God as requiring collaborators for the creation of man, Philo seems to give an ironic twist to an existing argument that God indeed needed such help. This answer would evidently acknowledge the mythological and anthropomorphic dimensions of Gods image in Scrip ture, which were so fervently denied by Philo. Philo's own solution reflects a characteristically Platonic orientation. Inspired by the Timaeus, he devotes all his exegetical efforts to proving that the plural form of ποιήσωμεν has ethical significance. God relied on "oth ers as if on collaborators" so as to shun responsibility for man's evil inclina tions (Opif. 75) .44 Only man's spiritual aspects, he insists, were created in the Divine image, while all his inferior qualities must be credited to God's assistants. Philo's theological solution in the image of Plato's Timaeus could thus replace a more Aristotelian answer, which may have been given by a scholar raising the aporema concerning Gen 1:26. This procedure con forms to a more general tendency in Philo's work. On other important occasions, too, he distanced himself from Aristotelian trends in Alexan dria, countering Peripatetic influence among his fellow Jews.45 Philo was committed to upholding proper standards of speaking about God, reject ing an inquiry into the Hebrew Bible that was not bound by certain theo logical considerations. In his Allegorical Commentary Philo returns to Gen 1:26, providing a highly scholarly and complex discussion: It is worthy and not futile to inquire (σκέψασθαι δ' ού παρέργως άξιον) of what sort is the word which is spoken from God's mouth, namely "Come and 44י Cf.

He appears to speak with some persons as if with his fellow-workers, this [plural form] is also previously written with regard to man's creation, for it says: "the Lord God said: let us make man according to our image and our likeness" (Gen 1:26), the expression "let us" apparently implying plurality. And again it says: "God said: behold, Adam has become like one of us by knowing good and evil" (Gen 3:22), for the expression "like one of us" refers not to one, but many. This must be said first, that he [Moses] supposed none of the created beings to be equal in honour to God, but there exists one ruler and leader and king through whom alone it is customary to rule and govern everything. For the lines "the rule of many is not good, let there be one ruler and one king" {II.{II. 2:204-5) cannot with justice be said about cities and men, but rather about the world and God. The world being one, there is necessarily one crea tor and father and ruler. Now that this has been conceded, the following step must be to offer suit able [explanations]. Let us inquire (σκοπωμεν) of which kind they are. Being one, God has around Him potencies, which cannot by described (άμυθητους), all assisting and preserving the created being, among them the chastising potencies. {Conf. 168-71) Philo's writings contain the first explicit examples of an exegetical approach, which inquires into Scripture by comparing similar literary expressions. Philo has noted here verses with verbs in the plural describing God. While the plain sense of these expressions is clear, they all pose the same theo logical problem and are thus treated together. This method of literary com parison was used among Alexandrian Jews already before Philo, who occasionally refers to his adversaries' comprehensive studies of specific phe nomena. Some of his colleagues collected mythical features "scattered in numerous places throughout the Torah," while another colleague "contin ued to go in detail through all similar cases" of name changes.46 The begin nings of this approach can seen in the work of Demetrius and those quoted by him, who all investigated problematic verses in light of other relevant Biblical passages (Eusebius, Praep. ev. 9.29, 1-3, 15). These earlier Jewish scholars as well as Philo himself were inspired by a method of Homeric scholarship, later known as "Ομηρον έξ "Ομήρου σαφηνίζειν.47 Initially, 46) Conf. 3; Mut. 60-62; for details on the latter, see Niehoff, "Homeric Scholarship and Bible Exegesis" 175-76. 471 Porphyry, Schol.

R. Niehoff! Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 the aim of this method was to appreciate the particular style of the poet and often also to judge whether a particular line deviates to such an extent from Homeric usage that it must be qualified as a later addition.48 Aris tarchus, in particular, used the method for rigorous text criticism, support ing his readings and emendations by reference to similar literary features elsewhere in the Homeric corpus.49 Subsequently, however, Greek scholars increasingly compared verses in a more creative fashion, using distant verses as proof texts for their particular interpretation. Jewish scholars fol lowed in their steps, Demetrius and his colleagues as well as Philo emulat ing the style of the anonymous Homer scholars in the bT tradition. Philo especially used the method to elucidate the text and explain theological difficulties. In the above quoted passage the aporema, which may again have been raised by someone else before, is clearly defined: the plural form of the verbs suggests that "He appears to speak with some persons as if with his fellow-workers" (Conf. 168). Philo's first answer is an emphatic theological statement regarding the unique status of the Creator God.50 Moses, he insists, "supposed none of the created beings to be equal in honour to God" (ουδέν των δντων ίσότιμον ΰφέστηκε θεώ).51 Philo quotes a Homeric verse in support of this principle. The modern reader may be impressed by the irony that a Homeric line is needed to prove what appears to be the quintessence of Judaism. Yet, for Philo the boundaries were obviously more fluid, especially as he ignored the con tinuation of the verse, where Zeus is said to confer authority to one ruler (//. 2:205). Philo was apparently familiar with the ongoing discussion of widespread in the Imperial period and not confined to the grammatikoi. Porter, "Herme neutic Lines and Circles," 70-74, argued against Rudolf Pfeiffer, History of Classical Scholar ship from ship from the Beginnings to the End of the Hellenistic Age (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968), 231, for the probability of the.maxims Aristarchan origin. 481 Regarding the ποιητικόν εθος, see esp. Schol. II. 1:499, 5:734-36, 5:299, 5:684, 6:71a, 6:479-80. The text-critical use of this method is summarized well in Schol. II. 14:509b άθετοΰσι δια τό ξένον της λέξεως καΐ μή κείμενον άλλαχοϋ. 4,1 See e.g. Schol. II. 7:130, 7:180, 8:130, 8:44lbl, 9:441b, 11:636. This use is also reflected in the work of Zenodotus (Schol II. 12:428al) and Didymus [Schol. II. 8:349al). 501 This is a prominent subject throughout Philo's work, see esp. QG 1:55, Deus 53-54, Sacr.Sacr. 94, Somn. 1:237. 511 I have taken the verb to refer to Moses, thus reflecting Philo's indebtedness to literary scholarship, while the English and French translators took ουδέν as the subject The latter, however, does not appropriately reflect the verb's perfect active form.</page><page sequence="25">Μ. R. Niehoff/Journal for the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 361 these verses, reacting to prevalent interpretations. His emphasis that they "cannot with justice be said about cities and men" precisely counters their traditional application to the discussion of political governments. Aristotle and Theophrastus had mentioned II. 2:204-5 in such a context, while an anonymous scholiast commented δογματίζει δέ περί πολιτειών.52 One scholiast specifically pointed to Persia as an example.53 Philo, who pre ferred a democratic to an autocratic regime and disliked Persia as much as Aeschylus, advocated an allegorical reading of the Homeric verses. His interpretation was probably inspired by an allegorical tradition attested in the Derveni Papyrus, where Zeus is presented as the king ruling the whole world and transcending the particular human rulers (DP XIX). It is significant that the dichotomy between a literal, political reading and an allegorical, theological interpretation of II. 2:204-5 resurfaces in Origen's Contra Contra Celsum. Celsus naturally presents the traditional Greek reading, while Origen typically embraces Philo's approach (Cels. 8:68).54 After this clarification of the Homeric verses Philo returns to the prob lem of the plural expressions in Scripture. He explains that they refer to divine potencies rather than rivaling deities. This interpretation is elabo rated in detail, including a sharp criticism of those who mistakenly deify the planets, thus raising them to equal status with the Creator God {Conf. 173). Philo repeatedly insists that the potencies are strictly subordinate to God, who uses them only with regard to earthly things beyond the realm of His own propriety. These potencies, or angels, thus serve mainly in the field of evil and chastisement of wicked deeds. Philo adduces a biblical prooftext supporting this interpretation: The following saying of the one who was made perfect through practice [Jacob] bears witness to my explanation (μαρτυρεί δέ μου τω λόγω): "God who nourished me from youth, the angel who delivered me from all evils" (LXX Gen 48:15, 16). (Conf. 181) 521 Schol. II. 2:204; see also: Aristotle, Pol. 1292al3-15; Theophrastus, Char. 26:1. 531 Ibid.; note that additional examples are discussed in the later D-Scholia ad. loc.loc. 54) Consider also that later scholiasts associated the verse with Hippocrates' maxim that a body composed of just one element would not experience pain (D-Scholia II. 2:204). Fur thermore, Philo's interpretation, relying on the correlation between one world and one ruler, cannot have been inspired by Stoic thinkers, who advocated eternal cycles of different worlds. On the fluidity of borders between monotheism and polytheism, see also Pagan Monotheism Monotheism in Late Antiquity (ed. Polymnia Athanassiadi and Michael Frede; Oxford: Clarendon, 1999).</page><page sequence="26">362 Μ. R. Niehoff! Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 God and an angel are mentioned here in close proximity, fulfilling the roles Philo assigned to them in his previous discussion. It is implied that we now read the plural expressions in Gen 1:26; 3:22; and 11:7 as references to God addressing his angel. In these contexts, Philo suggests, He employs a subordinate potency in order to deal with human immorality. This use of the biblical prooftext closely follows patterns of Homeric scholarship in the bT tradition. Greek scholars had used cross-references to other verses in order to corroborate certain interpretations of words. The expression και άλλαχοΰ had become a regular exegetical feature. Two examples may serve here as an illustration. The concrete image of Zeus' balance (τάλαντα) was interpreted thus: Probably he [Homer] speaks allegorically about Zeus' judgement, for how could he [Zeus] look at things still at hand? He [Homer] says elsewhere: "he knew Zeus' holy τάλαντα" (II. 16:658). (ScholII. 22:209) The concrete image of Zeus' balance is apparently not acceptable to the interpreter as Zeus could not have physically looked at something on his balance, which was still in the future. A metaphorical reading is thus sug gested and corroborated by a verse where the image of the balance is more likely to be meant non-literally. Fleeing in panic from the battle, Hector could hardly have seen the balance in a literal sense, but was likely to understand Zeus' overall plan.55 On another occasion, the word φρήν is given a particular meaning: "Even in the house of Hades there is something—spirit and phantom—even though there is no mind at all". (11. 23:104) Patroclus has discussed everything wisely and intelligently. This verse is really inserted from the Odyssey, where he [Homer] presented the souls as shady phantoms lacking a part in wisdom. Or else he [Homer] says φρένας not in the sense of the intelligible part, but rather any part from within the body, as elsewhere it says: "where the φρένες hold the liver" (Od. 9:301). (Schol. II. 23:104) 551 I wish to thank Debby Gera Levine for discussing the translation of this passage with me. See also a similar example in Schol. II. 12:37a, where Zeus' lash (μάστιξ) is meta phorically interpreted as thunderbolt, as it says elsewhere "by the evil μάστιγι of Zeus" {II.{II. 13:812). Here again the context is more conducive to the suggested metaphorical inter pretation.</page><page sequence="27">Μ. R. Niehoff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 363 These examples share significant features of Philo's discussion. A word is discussfd,discussfd, which is clear in its literal meaning, but raises theological prob lems in the present context. Some scholars suggested that the verse is a later addition from the Odyssey, which advocates fitting notions about Hades. Another scholiast, however, wishing to keep the verse, suggests a different meaning for the word. Like Philo's prooftext, the adduced verse supports the connotation, which the exegete wishes to confer to the original pas sage. Borrowing, as it were, the meaning from elsewhere, he has found a solution to the aporema. The dispute is settled by reference to another verse. In numerous other contexts Homeric scholars engaged in lively dis cussions about the precise meaning of words, each side producing proof texts in support of their particular interpretation.56 Looking at Philo's solution in the context of Homeric scholarship, it is clear that he relied on a well-established method used especially by the exegetical scholars in the bT tradition. He applied the method to passages in the LXX, thus solving problems that had arisen in the Jewish community. In GR the plural form of געשה אדם (Gen 1:26) is intensely discussed, almost an entire parasha dealing with this expression. Many of the inter pretations follow in the spirit of Philo, filling in the gap of the biblical verse with angelic figures and divine potencies (GR 8:3-7). The only ques tion, however, which is explicitly raised, appears in the context of a special unit treating the possibility that Gen 1:26 is interpreted as a reference to more than one god (GR 8:8-10). This issue is explored in light of claims made by the minim whose position is expected to be known as the unit is introduced thus: R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Yonathan: when Moses wrote down the Torah, he wrote the account of every day, but when he reached the verse 'and He said: let us make man (Gen 1:26), he said: "Ruler of the world, why do you provide an opening for the minimV." God answered: "write! Whoever wants to err will err." (GR 8:8) The unit in GR culminates in a statement by R. Hoshaya, Origen's con temporary, who invokes a scene of angels mistaking Adam for God and addressing him as "Holy, Holy." They learn of his human nature, when God puts him to sleep in order to create Eve from his ribs. This is compared to a 56י See e.g. Schol. II. 5:7a, 8:349a, 10:97a, 10:502b, 11:636c, 15:288, 16:333, 16:350, 17:297, 24:347b.</page><page sequence="28">364 Μ. R. Niehoff/ Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 king and his commander. When the two were riding together in a carriage, the latter was mistaken for the king by the crowd. They learn of the com mander s true status, when the king throws him off the carriage. Hoshaya's interpretation of Gen 1:26 indicates a particular concern with "onlookers," who may confuse a human being with God. These "onlookers" may be connected to the minim, mentioned by R. Samuel bar Nahman at the opening of the unit. It is in this context that certain questions by the minim are recorded: The minim asked R. Simlai: how many deities created the world? He answered: I and you ask of the first days, as it is written "for ask now of the first days" (Deut 4:32), "they created" (בראו) is not written there, but instead "he ere ated" (ברא אלהים). The minim once more asked him (concerning Gen 1:1): why is it written "in the beginning אלהים created"? He answered them: it is not written "in the beginning they created (בראו), but "he created (ברא) the heaven and the earth." R. Simlai said: in every place where you find an opening'7 for the minim you find the remedy next to it. Once again the minim came to him and asked him: why is it written "and God said: let us make man (נעשה)" (Gen 1:26). He said to them: read what is written afterwards. It is not written "they created (בראו) man," but "he ere ated man" (ברא, Gen 1:27). As they left, his students asked him: those you dismissed with a light argu ment, but what do you say to us? He said: formerly Adam was created from the earth and Eve from Adam, from now on: "in our likeness and our image," no man without a wife and no woman without a husband, and not the two of them without the Shechina. (GR 8:9) This exchange of "questions and answers" moves between the spheres of insiders and outsiders. While the question concerning the plural forms in Gen 1 is initially raised by outsiders, it becomes a concern of the rabbinic students. When the minim are gone, they request a more satisfactory answer from their teacher. More than hundred years ago Travers Herford identified this exchange between R. Simlai and the minim as a record of historical meetings between the rabbi and Jewish Christians. He argued that their question reflects knowledge of Heb 1:2, where Jesus is described as "the Son through whom He made the worlds (τους αιώνας)."58 While 57פתחון פה י (Ms Venetia, Paris and Oxford), while Ms Vienna and London read תשובה. 581 R.

Niehoff/Journalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 365 Herford s basic conclusion about a dialogue with Christians is convincing, it is time for reconsidering the details of his argument.59 In particular, the specification of Jewish Christians relying on the Letter to the Hebrews is unwarranted. Rabbinic literature hardly distinguishes Christians of pagan origin from those of Jewish origin. Moreover, the discussion in GR is highly scholarly, revolving around the analysis of particular expressions, while the Letter to the Hebrews does not refer to plural forms, but instead interprets Jesus as the Logos along the lines of Wis 9:1. Other Christian works, however, prove highly relevant, a key-text being Justin Martyr's Dialogue with Tryphon.60 After explaining in chapter sixty one that the wisdom mentioned in Prov 8:22 is a reference to Jesus, Justin proceeds to show that Gen 1:26 must also be understood in this light. Justin significantly rejects the interpretations preserved in GR, namely that the plural expression refers either to God Himself or His angels or the ele ments.61 He rather insists that a separate and "numerically different" being is implied (ibid.). This can further be proven, he continues, by considering another plural expression, namely Gen 3:22, which refers to "a number of associated beings different from each other."62 Justin thus provides a crucial bridge between the clusters of 'questions and answers' in Philo and GR. Like Philo, his approach is distinctly scholarly, dwelling on a particular plural expression and using a parallel case to prove his particular interpre tation. He even draws attention to Gen 3:22, which Philo had also adduced. Justin's argumentation is also based on the LXX, where the plural expres sion אלהים (Gen 1:1) was rendered as θεός and thus did not pose a theo logical problem. At the same time, Justin refers to rabbinic interpretations 591 Contra Alan F. Segal, Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports about Christianity and and Gnosticism (SJLA 25; Leiden: Brill, 1977), 124-34, who rejects Herford's argument, stressing that there is nothing specifically Christian about the approach of the minim. My acceptance of Herford's basic argument, of course, does not imply that, in my view, all references to the minim are necessarily to Christians. 601 The earliest extant, specifically Christian interpretation of Gen 1:26 is to be found in the Letter of Barnabas, which suggests that God created a Christian type of man, saying to Jesus: "let us make man" {Bam. 6:12). The Divine command to Adam and Eve that they should "multiply and fill the earth" is moreover understood as an incentive to missionary activity. 611 Justin, Dial. 62:2, cf. GR 8:3-7; for comments on this connection, see David Rokeah, Justin Justin Martyr. Dialogue with Tryphon the Jew.

NiehojfΊJournalfor the Study of Judaism 39 (2008) 337-366 of Gen 1:26, challenging them with his own specifically Christian view. It is hard to avoid the impression that GR was familiar with his polemics, putting them into the mouth of the minim. Just like Justin, they, too, stress the numerical aspect, insisting that more than one god is involved. The answers given in GR to the minim thus emerge as a response to Christian questions, which had worried some of the rabbinic students. Conclusion and Summary It has become evident that Philo and GR operate in radically different environments. Philo, like his colleagues, engaged in the Homeric discus sions and made them relevant for the LXX. They were concerned about the image of Scripture within the Jewish community in Alexandria, defining Jewish identity in the context of Hellenistic culture. Their questions and answers resemble those raised by their Greek colleagues on similar issues in their foundational texts. Jewish positions are diverse, each of them having its counterpart on the Greek side. GR, by contrast, emerged in an environ ment where rival exegetes studied the same text, applying it to the new religion. Questions and answers were now raised concerning the same verses and helped to define boundaries between the different groups. GR seems to have been sensitive to discussions in the Christian academies and chose its own distinct way. Christian questions were answered, while ear lier Jewish answers, which had been embraced by Christian scholars, were studiously avoided. The rabbis faced an extremely complex situation, where not only the encounter between Jerusalem and Alexandria, or Juda ism and Hellenism, were at stake, but also the rivalry between Jews and Christians over the same corpus of Scripture. In retrospect Philo appears to have enjoyed an environment where Jews were free to engage in the schol arly discourse of their Greek colleagues, while encountering no claims on their own texts.</page></plain_text>
