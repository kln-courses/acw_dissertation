Another perspective is introduced, a paradigmatic structure presented by Richard Kearney, which provides a framework for considering postmodernism and how it might affect theory and practice in art education in the coming decades. Post- modernism can be seen as heralding a postparadigmatic world. Some time ago I described a theoretical framework that I found useful for sorting out conflicting and highly value-laden approaches to regarding the world and, more specifically, theory and practice in art education (Pearse, 1983). The framework is a set of three paradigms devised by Jurgen Habermas (1971) in order to identify and analyze the structure of three basic forms of knowing that have characterized modern thought and action. The set of para- digms was adapted by the Canadian curriculum theorist Ted Aoki (1978) and informed his teaching and writing. At a further level of adaptation I used the structure to help examine assumptions underlying both my professional theory and practice and my general observations of art education. A paradigm is commonly described as any pattern, example, or model. Edu- cational theorists and social scientists use the word to denote ways in which knowledge and behavior are structured or organized. In its broadest terms, a paradigm is a world view. Although seldom consciously articulated, a paradigm is an internally consistent orientation from which a conceptual and operational approach to functioning in the world is constructed. A paradigm may be likened to a view finder, and new paradigms provide different points of view. Hence, when a new world view appears, one speaks of a paradigm shift (Kuhn, 1970). The Paradigms Revisited The three orientations identified by Habermas (1971) represent specific cognitive "interests" with distinct goals and values. They are derived from the history of philosophy but are not aligned with any one philosophic position. Each can be illuminated by a metaphor or root activity. For Paradigm I -the Empirical-Analytic orientation which values technical knowing - the root activity is work: intellectual and technical work that will help people relate to and control the natural and, by extension, the social world. Efficiency, certainty, and predictability are valued, and knowledge in the form of facts, generalizations, theories, and cause-and-effect laws is sought. Knowing is empirically based, and explanations are given in causal, functional, or hypo- thetical-deductive statements. Evaluation is means-ends based. Art education under this paradigm emphasizes products, facts, skills, and techniques. The approach is essentially subject-centered. Outcomes are considered in terms of objects, competencies, behavioral objectives, and accountability. When we real- ize that our goals for teaching go beyond object making and that the knowledge</page><page sequence="2">BEYOND PARADIGMS we seek goes beyond fact finding and quantification into complex areas of human interaction, the Empirical-Analytic paradigm has been stretched to its limits of usefulness. The root activity of Paradigm II, the Interpretive-Hermeneutic orientation, is communication, or as Aoki (1978) puts it, relating people to their social world. A person's relationship with the world is reflexive. The form of knowledge valued is situational knowing, i.e., grasping the structure of interpretive mean- ings. What is sought is the "deep structure" or the underlying essence of experience. This orientation originates in the philosophical stance of existential phenomenology with its interest in experientially meaningful, "authentic" in- tersubjective understanding which is an understanding based on the integration of many individuals' perceptions. An art educator operating from this orienta- tion is interested in the subjective and intersubjective meanings an artwork (and artistic activity) have for the child. In its broadest sense, the approach is "child centered," yet, essentially the educational process is seen as a dialogue with others and with oneself, in the world of things, people, and ideas. Paradigm III, the Critical-Theoretic orientation, is rooted in the activity of reflection wherein people analyze and transform themselves and their social world. Its fundamental interest is emancipation and improvement of the human condition. Knowing is critical knowing which aims to render transparent tacit and hidden assumptions by initiating a process of transformation designed to liberate and, to use a favorite term of this paradigm, empower people. Since people act upon their world in order to transform it, a central notion is that of praxis, the reciprocity of thought and action. This is the paradigm that informs art educators who see learning as socially charged and understanding as self- reflection leading to critical knowing, leading to action. It rallies those who have been marginalized by virtue of gender, race, or class. Its literature derives primarily from feminist aesthetics and critical social theory. The goal is to raise critical consciousness about a visual world linked inextricably to a social world. The method is one of deliberately relaying personal understanding and action to interaction in a larger community. It is not merely learning about the commu- nity or doing things in the community; it involves making problematic what is taken for granted and making explicit and questioning that which underlies our school and community experiences (Katan &amp; Pearse, 1990). The Paradigms in Other Fields A cursory glance indicates that educators in other fields are using similar paradigmatic structures to describe and critique approaches and orientations. In adult education, Brookfield (1989) refers to "three dominant paradigms of facilitation-the behaviorist, the humanist, and the critical" (p. 202). Although he does not refer directly to the Habermasian tri-paradigmatic structure and the labels he uses are slightly different, Brookfield's description of the charac- teristics of each of these paradigms is essentially the same. The facilitator in the behaviorist paradigm views learning in terms of previously defined objectives and sequenced activities. In the humanist paradigm the facilitator sees learning as essentially collaborative with learners negotiating objectives, methods, and outcomes. The critical paradigm challenges learners "to engage in a critical scrutiny of the assumptions, values, and norms undergirding their ideas and actions" (p. 205). Similarly, in discussing major ontological and epistemological assumptions in special education, Heshusius (1986) speaks of two essential paradigms that 245</page><page sequence="3">HAROLD PEARSE dominate the field. Although an analysis of these world views might uncover the tri-pardigmatic pattern, Heshusius simply calls these views mechanistic and nonmechanistic. The mechanistic view, wherein "order is brought about through assumptions of linearity, additivity, sequentiality, prediction, and con- trol" and the "organism is a closed system isolated from its environment" (p. 462), like Brookfield's behaviorist, recalls Paradigm I. The nonmechanistic view which sees reality as complex, holistic, and integrative and "the person as a knowing, creating, goal-directed and active personality system" (p. 462) echoes Paradigm II. A third category could probably be used to characterize those researchers in special education (like Heshusius) who critically confront taken- for-granted assumptions of students with learning problems. The field of reading education also has a history of concern for conflicting approaches and the phenomenon of paradigm shifts. Neilsen (1989) juxtaposes mechanistic and organic world views (parallel to Paradigms I and II) and considers how each shapes instruction. Again, the descriptions of each category are familiar as is the analysis of how a world view underlies assumptions held about the nature of knowledge, teaching, and learning. Although he does not propose a third paradigm, he does see the instructional process as being a transactional one in which the purpose is to think and read critically, and, in which understanding the context is extremely important. Transaction is a word also used by Monson and Pahl (1991) for the process students are engaged in during whole language instruction wherein they active- ly construct meaning. This mode is characteristic of Paradigm II. The transac- tion between what is known and what is unknown is, they claim, paradigmatic of whole language education. It is a paradigm shift from transmission (a Paradigm I mode), the historical model of teaching reading and writing wherein teachers transmit knowledge to students. The controversy surrounding the debate be- tween whole language and traditional phonics instruction is heated and deep, not simply because they involve opposing teaching methods. The conflict is between belief systems about the nature of learning, the culture of the class- room, and the roles of teachers and students. Paradigms may cause stirs but are not easily shaken. In the sciences, paradigmatic thinking has achieved new prominance with the rise in popularity of books such as Hawkings' (1988)A Brief History of Time and Gleik's (1987) Chaos: Making a New Science. Hawking's speculations on a grand unified theory for understanding the universe and the explorations of the "chaos" mathematicians and physicists are, perhaps, the ultimate in paradigmo- logy in that they are attempts at finding order in the most fluid, complex, and dynamic systems. Indeed, as we shall see later, these researchers might even be called the ultimate modernists. Recent Developments in Art Education Since 1983 when I introduced Habermas' tri-paradigmatic theory to an art education audience and attempted to characterize art education theory, re- search, and practice from this perspective (Pearse, 1983), the field has wit- nessed (and absorbed) the discipline-based art education (DBAE) phenom- enon. Promoted by the J. Paul Getty Trust, Center for Education in the Arts, and endorsed by the National Art Education Association, DBAE was heralded as a blueprint for art education in the schools. In DBAE, art, a testable, sequential, accountable subject like any other, is conceived of in terms of four parent "disciplines" -studio art, art history, aesthetics, and art criticism 246</page><page sequence="4">BEYOND PARADIGMS (Eisner, 1987; Getty Center for Education in the Arts, 1985; Greer, 1984). Although the ideas themselves are not entirely new, deriving from a long line of antecedents including Barkan's Artist/Art Historian/Art Critic model for the role of art teacher, and the aesthetic education movement of the mid-1960s (Smith 1987), the packaging and promotion are adapted to the political situa- tion of the late 1980s. Does DBAE represent a paradigm shift? DBAE certainly presents itself as a "complete unifying theory" (to use Stephen Hawking's phrase) although not on the order of Hawkings' (1988) theory of space and time or the chaos theories of contemporary science. Nonetheless, it suffers from the grand unifying theory paradox. In trying to be all inclusive, it results instead, largely because of its need for specificity, in being exclusive. This sense of DBAE's embodiment of a prescribed program may at least partially account for the fact that although the DBAE theory has animated discussion among art educators in countries such as Canada (Pearse, 1987) and the United Kingdom, the practice of DBAE re- mains almost entirely an American phenomenon. In most respects, DBAE can be accommodated in the tri-paradigmatic struc- ture. To the extent that DBAE harbors the "scientific rationalist tendency" (Efland 1990) to value discipline-centeredness, accountability, "excellence," and "technical knowing," it slots nicely into the Empirical-Analytic orientation (Paradigm I). As a world view, it is essentially mechanistic and goal based. Its claims to being comprehensive (Eisner, 1987) might make it a candidate for Paradigm II, but its blatant subject-centeredness makes for an uneasy fit. Al- though in theory DBAE should include all forms of art criticism and aesthetics, the dominant and sanctioned approach is formalist (Smith, 1986). DBAE's inherent conservatism and apparent indifference to social dimensions would exclude it from entry into the Critical-Theoretic orientation (Paradigm III). That paradigm, somewhat underpopulated in 1983, has expanded with in- creased interest in the social, cultural, and political realities facing art educa- tors and with increased concern for the impact on art education of popular culture, feminism, cultural pluralism, and multiculturalism (Duncum, 1990; Garber, 1990; Mullen &amp; Chalmers, 1990). Indeed, these developments, with their roots firmly in Paradigm III notions of liberation and empowerment of marginalized people, have done much to enrich the texture of contemporary art education. Although recent developments in art education such as DBAE and multicul- turalism derive from or exist comfortably in the tri-paradigmatic structure, postmodernism is an entirely different matter. In 1984, Gablik noted that "postmodernism is the somewhat weasel word now being used to describe the garbled situation of art in the '80s" (p. 73). By 1991, Lather used postmod- ernism as the code name for the crisis of confidence in western conceptual systems ... borne out of the uprising of the marginalized, the revolution in com- munication technology, the fissures of global multinational hyper-capital- ism, and our growing sense of the limits of enlightenment rationality. (pp. 163-164) Conversations about postmodernism among artists, educators, and others con- tain words like disturbing, unsettling, discomforting. Postmodernism, even if it could be defined, cannot be easily accommodated within any existing paradig- matic structure. I think I feel the rumblings of paradigms shifting. 247</page><page sequence="5">HAROLD PEARSE Another Perspective A new paradigm requires a new paradigmatic structure. A useful one is provided by Kearney (1988) in The Wake of Imagination, wherein he examines the ways people conceptualize the relationship between imagination and reali- ty. His approach is paradigmatic rather than strictly historical since his focus is the paradigm shifts "which signal decisive mutations in the human understand- ing of imagination during different epochs of Western history" (p. 17). The paradigms he presents are: the premodern, the modern, and the postmodern, each with a root activity and graphic metaphor. The paradigms are neatly exemplified in the changing Western conceptions of the artist. Kearny calls the premodern the mimetic paradigm and attributes as its metaphor the referential figure of the mirror The premodern cultures of Jerusalem and Athens tended to construe the artist primarily as a craftsman who, at best, models his activity on the "original" activity of a divine Creator.... This theocentric view of the craftsman also prevailed in the medieval period when the work of the icon maker, painter, scribe or Cathedral designer was generally evaluated in terms of its capacity to obediently serve and imitate the transcendent plan for creation. (Kearney, 1988, p. 12) The premodern artist-as-craftsman was replaced in the modern movements of Renaissance, Romantic, and Existentialist humanism with the paradigm of the artist as "the original inventor" (Kearney, 1988, p. 12). This is the modernist anthropomorphic or humanist aesthetic which "promotes the idea of the artist as one who not only emulates but actually replaces God" (p. 12). The modern is the productive paradigm, and the metaphor is the expressive figure of the lamp, the light that leads the way. In short, the modern portrait of the artist, as a young person or old, is habitually that of a proud demonic overreacher who negates the given world and resolves to produce a new one out of his or her own imagina- tion. (Kearney, 1988, p. 13) An aim of modernity was emancipation, the creation of a society emancipat- ed from poverty, despotism, and ignorance. Emancipation is, of course, a key goal of the critical theoretic paradigm. Not coincidentally, paradigm building itself is a modernist trait. Postmodernists, such as Jean-Francois Lyotard, point out that these dreams of emancipation have proven to be illusory. Indeed, the whole anthropocentric paradigm is overturned by postmodern culture. As Kearney (1988) puts it, "modernity is where we grew up" and "postmodernity is where we now live" (p. 18). We cannot operate the same way in a world revolutionized by communication technology and depersonalized consumerism in which we are innundated by the products of the mass media that cause us to constantly question what is real. Sophisticated television and computer graphic devices can create "virtual reality." Photographic and computerized reproduc- tion techniques make indistinguishable, and irrelevant, what is original. Post- modernity questions the modernist cult of creative originality as well as the notion of artistic progress and the possibility of perpetual newness. The central message of postmodern philosophers (especially Foucault, Derrida, Lacan) is the denial of the very idea of "origin." In their work, language consists of an open-ended play of "signifiers" and "meaning is deconstructed into an endless play of linguistic signs, each one of which relates to the other in a parodic circle" (Kearney, 1988, p. 253). There is no possibility of a single founding reference or 248</page><page sequence="6">BEYOND PARADIGMS "transcendental signified" external to language that can be called truth or human subjectivity. Truth is replaced by endless parody with imitations reflect- ing imitations. In the visual arts this refusal began in earnest with Warhol, who replaced the notion of the "authentic original" with that of a mechanically reproducible multiple series. Similarly, the works of Lichtenstein, Beuys, Ben Vautier, and initially Duchamp, ironically mimic the dehumanizing tendencies of our mecha- nistic age. Art movements centering on the conceptual, environmental, and more recently the social and political "share a basic impulse to demystify the pretentions of high modernism, with its established notions of controlling au- thor, narrative order and metaphysical profundity" (Kearney, 1988, p. 5). With postmodernism then, the model of the productive inventor is replaced by that of "the bricoleur" (Kearney, 1988, p. 13) or collagist who finds and rearranges fragments of meaning. The postmodern is theparodic paradigm with the reflective figure of a labyrinth of looking-glasses as defining metaphor. Mi- mesis and the mirror metaphor have returned, but with a difference. What is reflected is not the outer world of nature or the inner world of subjectivity, but a complex maze of associated meanings-the mirror's reflection of itself into infinity. The artist has become a fun-house mirror anonymously parodying, simulating, or reproducing images. Or to mix metaphors and drop a typically postmodern pun, the postmodern artist is like a postman, delivering multiple images and signs which he has not created himself and over which he has no control (Kearney, 1988). Although postmodernism can be seen as an ending and a denial of the extremes of premodernism and modernism, its end need not be futility or nihilism. By dispossessing itself of the premodern tendency to repress human creativity to avoid usurping the supremacy of a divine creator, and the modern tendency to over-emphasize the originative power of the autonomous individ- ual, thepostmodern imagination can, says Kearney (1988), explore "possibilities of another kind of poieses - alternative modes of inventing alternative modes of existence" (p. 33). The end of modernity requires reexamination of modernist ideals and recovery of humanitarian intentions with the possibility of re-begin- ning through reinventing our ways of being. Perhaps this ontological path will lead us out of the labyrinth. Postparadigms A skeptic might say that what is being called postmodernism is a cluster of varied and unstable tendencies and conditions that are too unstable to be called a paradigm. A postmodernist would say that this state of flux is not something transitional -it is exactly the point. Postmodernism's stance of being opposi- tional, being radically unsettling, and making problematic captures a kind of truth, albeit a paradoxical truth which denies claims to certainty and totality. Postmodernism goes beyond the bounds of conventional paradigms. It is post- paradigmatic. Nevertheless, "old" or earlier paradigms continue to exist as both historical artifacts and governing perspectives for some people. Premodern and modern art remain in our museums, and works created in these modes may even be newly created. Paradigms may co-exist, but it is the dominant one that exemplifies the zeitgeist. The current zeitgeist, call it postmodernism, is pushing the boundaries of notions of paradigms. Yet as is the case when a new paradigm replaces other ones, it still has to contend with the old ones being somewhere on the landscape-sometimes as competition, sometimes just as clutter. 249</page><page sequence="7">HAROLD PEARSE Whither Art Education It appears that we have embarked on a postparadigmatic era, one in a constant state of flux, a kind of perpetual pluralism. Kearney's (1988) paradig- matic structure gives a framework on which to hang a discussion of post- modernism and its implications for theory and practice in art education. When considered as a kind of paradigm, or at least a world view, postmodernism can be juxtaposed to the familiar world view that has dominated art education for most of the twentieth century: modernism. Art education has embraced mod- ernist ideas such as the artist as creative genius, the child as having the potential for creative self-actualization, the notion that art transcends real life and can be an end in itself, that art involves aesthetic sensing, and that anyone sufficiently sensitive and experienced will perceive aesthetic quality (Webb, 1989). DBAE, with its desire to train students in the techniques of formalist art criticism and to expose them to masterworks that exemplify historical styles, reflects modernist views. Indeed, Apple (1988) sees DBAE as part of a "conservative restora- tion" and a desperate attempt to revive modernism. However, with post- modernism, the modernist pillars of self-expression, authenticity, originality, and the masterpiece are no longer sacrocanct, or even relevant. Whether or not postmodernism is a paradigm, the real challenge for art teachers is to understand postmodernism as a way of being in the world and the implications it has for professional practice. Contemporary students, as part of the electronic, plugged-in generation, are attuned to postmodernism. Both Webb (1989) and jagodzinski (1991b) have noted that art educators have been slow to embrace postmodernism or to even enter the debate. jagodzinski (1991a) suggests some ways that art educators might operate under postmod- ernist tenets. The first step is to see art as a social process and to rename it "cultural production." We should examine cultural practices as signifying systems, as practices of representation, not as the production of beautiful things evoking beauti- ful feelings. Art-texts produce meanings and positions from which those meanings are consumed. Art educators should begin to understand the rhetoric of the image (and of art criticism) - how it persuades and posi- tions the viewer/reader. If we replace production for creation then we can begin to get at the social conditions; if we replace consumption for recep- tion we can begin to politicize the act of seeing. The entire syllabus changes when we see art as a form of socialpractice. (jagodzinski, 1991a, p. 149) Art is one way people participate with the world, how people read its images and signs, and how their participation is read. As we examine the language of public images, from those in museums to those in magazines, television, com- puter monitors, etc., the boundaries between high culture and popular culture become blurred and the arena of participation, what constitutes culture, be- comes extended and particularized. The art and culture of the local community, of "the folk," of marginal and disenfranchised groups, are, in the postmodern view, as valid subjects for study and emulation as the so-called "masterworks" of Western art. A postmodern art educator needs to be versed in semiotics and methods for decoding sign systems as well as in methods of deconstructing social meaning. Art students need to be provided with the means to critically examine the mass media and its visual language and to be receptive to various forms of cultural production. As producers themselves, their challenge is not to 250</page><page sequence="8">BEYOND PARADIGMS produce novel forms but to produce work which meaningfully and critically interprets the potentially infinite array of cultural forms and interactions. Post- modern art education researchers are cast as prototypical questioners not phased by ambiguity and uncertainty. They need to develop methods that are culturally and linguistically responsive and sensitive, and, perhaps in attempt- ing to study the structure and effects of visual images, they will develop ap- proaches that are truly visual. The postmodern view has features which evoke both optimistic and pessimis- tic responses. As we approach the twenty-first century, optimists would envision an art education in which local cultural practices are valued; the differences of those historically marginalized by virtue of gender, race, ethnicity, or class, are celebrated; and the cultural artifacts of all places and times are valid "texts" for study by art educators and students. Pessimists would see an aimless, fragment- ed, relativistic art education, cut off from standards of excellence. A paradig- mologist would remind each that it is one's world view and the visions it can accommodate that guide how one acts in it. A lesson for all from postmod- ernism is that nothing can be taken for granted, and we must be vigilant. As Lather (1991) notes, Foucault's cautionary words should guide us: " 'My point is not that everything is bad, but that everything is dangerous'" (p. 154). References Aoki, T. (1978).
