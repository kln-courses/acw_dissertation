Nyquist Michigan State University PRESENT MEANS OF STUDYING the human trauma syndrome associated with vehicle collisions include the following types of programs utilizing human volunteers, cadavers, animals, and anthropomorphic dummies: 1. Controlled impact with various devices to individual body areas and components. 2. Impact sled programs. 3. Centrifuge experiments. 4. Full-scale crash tests. 5. Accident investigations. All these methods have advantages and disadvantages, and all contribute to the overall knowledge of this field. A versatile research facility (the Wayne Horizontal Ac- celerator Mechanism, WHAM II) is described herein which permits detailed studies of parameters associated with ac- celeration and impact trauma. The facility simulates the crash environment with modified automobiles, and also pro- vides a means of conducting linear acceleration experiments on a sled with a payload of 1500 lb. While this facility was designed for study of human tolerance to impact, it is suf- ficiently versatile to permit studies of the characteristics *This research supported in part by General Services Administration Contract No. GS-00S-56359 and U.S. Navy Contract No. N 00600- 67- C- 0922. of vehicle components under simulated crash impact con- ditions. The versatility of the facility becomes apparent upon considering some of the programs currently under way and those planned for the future. The current projects include impact studies of: Steering assemblies, instrument panels, human tolerance (head, chest, knee impacts), airbag sys- tems, dynamics of the head and neck under flexion condi- tions (human volunteers), whiplash and effectiveness of head supports, and the effect of mass added to the head (helmet) on the dynamics of the head and neck. Future programs under consideration include: Human tolerance to pedestrian type accidents, restraint systems and integrated seat research, side impacts, rear-end impacts, oblique impacts, and impacts to the extremities. WAYNE HORIZONTAL ACCELERATION MECHANISM - WHAM II Studies of effects of forces and impacts on the human body have been underway for approximately 30 years at Wayne (1-5)? Impact equipment used in these programs includes linear and rotary impact mechanisms (6, 7), im- * Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. ABSTRACT A versatile acceleration facility is described which ac- celerates and decelerates a sled or a modified automobile on its own wheels. The same propulsion and snubber systems are used for both the sled and the vehicle configurations with less than an hour required between runs. Accelerations and decelerations up to 60 g, velocities up to 60 mph, onsets of 200-2000 g/sec, acceleration dis- tances up to 10 ft and deceleration distances up to 6 ft are available with excellent reproducibility. Extensive safety features for the operating personnel are provided. 3152</page><page sequence="2">pact swing (8), drop tower (9, 10), vertical accelerator (11, 12), the earlier WHAM I (13-15), and a horizontal accel- erator on loan from General Motors for several years (16-18). The second Wayne Horizontal Accelerator Mechanism - WHAM II -- was designed and built for maximum versatility and to provide many of the desirable features of the several aforementioned systems. The WHAM II has two main configurations, each with several variations: vehicle configuration and sled configura- tion. Simulation of forward or rearward type collisions in the vehicle configuration is achieved by accelerating or decelerating a modified automobile on its own wheels and suspension system. Fig. 1 is a photograph of WHAM II in the vehicle con- figuration. Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of WHAM II. The main components are the propulsion cylinder and accumu- lator with an operating valve assembly between the two, the snubber, the crosshead, and the vehicle guide or sled rails. Concentrated masses such as the engine, transmission, and differential are removed for safety research programs involving passenger compartment impact. Without these concentrated masses the vehicle can be accelerated and/or decelerated at g levels corresponding to 30 mph barrier col- lisions without damage to body or chassis except for the interior damage caused by the occupant (s). Force and /or acceleration measurements on the occupants and /or in- terior components permit absolute and comparative safety evaluation of old and new designs in a realistic crash en- vironment without damaging the vehicle. Dummy or cadaver occupants in the vehicle on its sus- pension system reproduce the interior collision dynamics Fig. 1 - Overall view of WHAM II with modified vehicle in place ready for acceleration Fig. 2 - Schematic diagram of WHAM II 3153</page><page sequence="3">3154 L. M. PATRICK, ET AL. exactly except for a small deviation due to the elimination of the concentrated masses which modifies the vehicle dy- namics slightly and the elimination of vehicle impact de- formation. The latter effect could be added with a mechan- ical-hydraulic system to simulate floor pan and firewall movement, but the added complexity with little gain in accuracy of results has not been considered worthwhile. The major advantage of the system is the reproduction of the interior dynamics including the interaction between the occupant and the interior, the mounting of the components(s) under study with the correct edge effects, and the reproduci- bility of the collision conditions. In the present Vehicle Configuration four different modes of operation are available: frontal force deceleration, frontal force acceleration, rear force acceleration, and rear force deceleration. Forward deceleration is the most commonly used mode in which the vehicle is accelerated to the de- sired velocity over a comparatively long (up to 10 ft) dis- tance and stopped in a short distance. The 30 mph barrier simulation is a good example with an 8 ft acceleration stroke and a 22 in. stopping distance. Other types of frontal force accidents can be simulated by increasing the stopping dis- tance up to 72 in. The forward force acceleration mode is achieved by accelerating the vehicle from rest in a rear- ward direction as described by Cichowski (19) except that he mounts the vehicle body on a sled. Rear force accelera- tion is achieved by applying the force to the rear of the vehicle initially at rest, simulating the rear-end collision. Rear force deceleration is accomplished by stopping the vehicle traveling backward from a predetermined velocity with a predetermined pulse shape. The sled configuration consists of an aluminum carriage riding on tracks mounted on each side of the vehicle path. When not in use and during preparation for an experiment, the sled is stored at the end of the tracks beyond the travel of the vehicle. An electric winch pulls the sled into pro- pulsion position from the storage position and from the stop- ping position after each run. The sled is a weldment of aluminum channels and plates which rides on six slippers lined with Oilite bearings. Two independent, hydraulic brake systems grip the rails to stop the sled when a long, low deceleration (under 2 g) is desired. The brakes are actuated at any desired point in the travel by cams attached to the rails. Styrofoam blocks at the end of the track provide a safety stop in case of brake failure. The sled shown in Fig. 3 is 12 ft long and 7 ft wide. Eight feet of the length is covered with aluminum plate 1/2 in. thick to which seats, camera mounts, and other equip- ment can be bolted. As shown in Fig. 3, the sled is set up for human volunteer, cadaver, or dummy research with a seat that is adjustable to various seating heights and angles. The seat can be oriented in any direction with respect to the acceleration axis. Three modes of operation are available in the Sled Con- figuration: acceleration with brake deceleration, accelera- tion with snubber deceleration, and low acceleration with snubber deceleration. The first mode is used when the con- trolled acceleration is the important part of the cycle and a long stopping distance is desirable to prevent adding the effects of deceleration to the acceleration effect. The second mode permits studies of combined acceleration- deceleration effects. The third mode allows high decelerations from high velocities. The primary feature of this facility is that the same pro- pulsion and deceleration components are used for the sled and vehicle configurations. This reduces the space required and the cost of installation and operation while providing increased versatility. Experimental programs can be con- ducted efficiently since several vehicles and/or the sled can be prepared simultaneously without interfering with other experiments. Rapid installation of a vehicle or the sled in propulsion position allows maximum utilization at minimum time and cost. Some of the important features of WHAM II are: 1. Vehicle Configuration - (a) The crash simulation is attained with a vehicle roll- ing on its own wheels. This is the most realistic approach and provides the same conditions and dynamics of the vehicle and occupants that are encountered in accidents. (b) A wide range of crash variables can be considered, including the selection of any effective vehicle impact velocity up to 60 mph, and any stopping distance up to 72 in. (c) Either acceleration or deceleration mode can be used. (d) The vehicle experiments are conducted indoors where weather and time of day are not factors. (e) Collisions are simulated without deforming the ex- terior of the vehicle, thus enabling numerous experiments to be conducted with only replacement of damaged interior components. This results in short turn- around time and re- duced research costs. Fig. 3 - Sled with adjustable seat and camera mounts used in human volunteer experiments</page><page sequence="4">VEHICLE ACCELERATOR CRASH SIMULATOR 3155 (f) The experimental conditions can be closely con- trolled, permitting comparative evaluations of similar com- ponents as well as basic evaluation of new components. (g) Elaborate safety precautions have been taken to pre- vent injury to the operating personnel. 2. Sled Configuration - (a) The sled has a 1500 lb payload at maximum velocity (60 mph) with larger payloads at reduced velocities and accelerations. (b) A wide range of performance of the sled is available including 0-60 mph, 0-60 g and 200-2000 g/sec onset. (c) Close control of the experimental conditions is main- tained with excellent reproducibility. (d) The sled is versatile, permitting experiments with human volunteers, cadavers, animals, and components of the vehicle including mounting the vehicle body on the sled for oblique impact studies. (e) The same elaborate safety precautions have been taken with the sled configuration as with the vehicle con- figuration. WHAM II PROPULSION SYSTEM Propulsion is provided with a 10 in. diameter, 10 ft stroke pneumatic cylinder of 1500 psi working pressure with an aluminum piston and piston rod (Fig. 4). The piston rod Fig. 4 - View of part of propulsion cylinder, crosshead, crosshead safety lock and snubber cable terminates in a crosshead which is guided on two rails with linear ball bushings to support lhe extended end of the piston rod. A self- aligning head, attached to the crosshead, trans- mits the propulsion force from the piston rod to the vehicle (or sled). The device utilizes a spherical seat and sliding contact with the vehicle (or sled) to minimize the trans- verse force and bending moment in the piston rod. The operating valve assembly connecting the propulsion cylinder and accumulator consists basically of two rotating ball type valves in series. Each has a 4 in. diameter unrestricted opening which is approximately l/6 the area of the pro- pulsion cylinder, resulting in a mean flow velocity of about six times that of the propulsion cylinder piston. At the 60 mph design velocity of the propulsion cylinder piston, the mean flow velocity through the valve is under 600 fps which is not high enough to cause serious flow problems. After reaching peak velocity, the vehicle or sled separates from the propulsion system so only the kinetic energy of the piston, piston rod, and crosshead must be dissipated in bringing the moving mass of the propulsion system to rest. This is accomplished by using the piston rod side of the pro- pulsion cylinder as a cushioning chamber. Progressive pres- sure buildup of the air in this chamber reduces the kinetic energy to zero. Oscillations caused by the "air spring" ef- fect are damped out rapidly by the friction in the piston and rod seats. The accumulator (Fig. 5) is a 12 in. diameter cylinder with a floating piston without a piston rod which is used to vary the volume of high pressure gas in the propulsion system. The volume can be varied by supplying an incom- pressible hydraulic oil to one side of the floating piston in the accumulator until the volume on the gas side reaches the desired value. By establishing a specific predetermined volume and pressure in the accumulator and an initial cush- ioning chamber pressure, a given pulse shape and velocity of the vehicle or sled is achieved. WHAM II DECELERA TOR The decelerator, or snubber (Fig. 5), is a custom de- signed, controllable pulse shape, hydraulic shock absorber. Essentially, it consists of a tube or cylinder with orifices programmed along its length (see the disassembled view, Fig. 6). A second concentric cylinder has grooves milled' in it which mate with the programmed orifices in the pri- mary cylinder. By rotating the outer concentric cylinder, the area of the programmed orifices can be varied to ob- tain the desired pulse shapes. The double ended piston rod of the snubber, mounted just below and behind the accumu- lator (Fig. 5), has a hole through its length. A cable passes through the snubber, under the accumulator and propulsion cylinder in a guide tube, and attaches to the vehicle or the sled. A sufficient length of cable rests in the guide tube behind the snubber to permit the propulsion stroke and pre- determined free travel after acceleration is completed. When the end of the travel is reached, the cable, which has a large diameter stopper attached to it, engages the</page><page sequence="5">3156 L. M. PATRICK, ET AL. piston of the snubber and decelerates the vehicle or sled at the set deceleration rate by displacing oil through the ori- fices. The snubber cable has a 60 ton breaking load which permits forces of nearly 120,000 lb to be applied to the sled or vehicle. With a vehicle or sled gross weight of 2000 lb, this results in a deceleration of 60 g. If larger pay loads are required, the peak deceleration decreases accordingly, or a stronger cable must be used. VEHICLE MODIFICATION The vehicle is subjected to the same decelerations that are encountered in the type of collision being simulated. To prevent damage to the vehicle, its mass is reduced as much as possible. The engine, transmission, differential, doors, fenders, hood, radiator, and other parts that do not contribute to the crash environment in the passenger compart- ment are removed, resulting in a vehicle of less than half the original weight. With the concentrated masses removed, the vehicle is not damaged by accelerations up to 40 g. With suitable reinforcement at the weakest points, these peak values can be increased to the 50 or 60 g level. In addition to removing the weight of the concentrated masses, the vehicle has a structure adapted to it permitting the snubber to be attached, and also to provide a point for applying the propulsion force. It consists of a series of tubes and reinforcing members to distribute the load and provide a rugged attachment point aft of the vehicle for the cable and crosshead. Fig. 5 - WHAM II decelerator; A, power cylinder; B, accumulator and C, snubber Fig. 6 - Disassembled view of snubber</page><page sequence="6">VEHICLE ACCELERATOR CRASH SIMULATOR 3157 VEHICLE GUIDING Guides are attached to convenient structural members of the vehicle at the fore and aft positions. The guides con- sist of a link, hinged at both ends, attached to a yoke which holds linear ball bushings at the aft of the vehicle and linear ball bushings plus a unidirectional brake on the front. These guides and brake are shown in Fig. 7. The function of the brake is to prevent the vehicle after being stopped from being accelerated in the reverse direction by the energy stored in the cable. Fig. 7 A - Rear vehicle guide Fig. 7B - Front vehicle guide and brake WHAM II CONTROL SYSTEM The control system can be divided into the functional control and the safety control. The functional control con- sists of a pneumatic system which activates the operating valve assembly which consists primarily of two ball valves in series as a safety precaution; that is, failure of one valve or its associated control mechanism will not cause inad- vertent firing of the propulsion cylinder. A schematic diagram of the functional control system is shown in Fig. 8. It consists basically of solenoid and air- pilot operated valves which control pneumatic cylinders that rotate the two ball valves. The upstream (safety) valve is opened relatively slowly by local control system air. The operating valve is opened rapidly by means of a rotary ac- tuator controlled with port mounted large capacity valves. Port mounting is necessary to assure high speed operation of the ball valve. The various components are indicated on the schematic diagram of Fig. 8 and the photograph of Fig. 9. During operation the accumulator pressure is set to the re- quired value for the desired test conditions, as indicated by gages on the control console and accumulator. An elec- trical interlock is provided which prohibits actuation of the fire ball valve unless the safety ball valve is fully open; hence, the possibility of throttling is eliminated. Additional valves shown on the schematic diagram (Fig. 8) are used to adjust the snubber stroke and accumulator pres- sure and to position the propulsion cylinder during setup or after a run. Since the safety control system becomes in- operative in the event of an electrical power failure, the accumulator is equipped with an automatic dump valve that will reduce the pressure in the tank to zero in about 3 min- utes, thus eliminating danger to the operators. Every effort has been made to provide a system that is fail-safe for the operators. The system has several electrical interlocks, any one of which will prevent the system from firing if it is in an unsafe condition. There are four palm button type abort switches located at different points in the laboratory, any one of which will prevent the system from firing. Also, human volunteers on the sled have a grip type abort switch which they must hold in the depressed position during the period prior to the actual initiation of the ac- celeration. If at any time the volunteer wishes to abort the run, he simply releases his grip on the switch. In addition to the abort switches, there are two key spring-lock switches which must be held by two different operators in the closed position prior to firing. If either switch is released at any time prior to the propulsion stroke, the system will not fire. All of these safety devices have lights on the control panel indicating when they are in the safe or unsafe "ready-to- fire" position. There are red and green lights for each de- vice. A "green panel" is required before the accelerator will fire. The heart of the electrical control system is a timing mechanism containing several adjustable cams for setting the timing sequence of each device. This allows the system</page><page sequence="7">3158 L. M. PATRICK, ET AL. to be completely automatic, except for the abort capability, after the timer has been activated. Prior to actuation of the main operating valve, a pre- determined sequence of operations occurs. The cameras are started and brought up to speed through a delay timer, the overhead photographic lights are brought up to full voltage by a motor driven autotransformer, and the oscillographic recorders are started. The last operation is the triggering of the 100 deg fast- acting rotary actuator, which opens the fire ball valve and pressurizes the propulsion cylinder. The cam timer has a total duration of 25 sec, after which all recording devices automatically stop. At any time up to the instant the fire ball valve is opened, the sequence can be shut down by opening any abort switch or releasing either key spring-lock switch. In addition to the safety features described above, there is a closed loop mechanical-hydraulic safety interlock (Fig. 4) that is completely independent of the electrical system. It consists of a clevis or yoke that holds the crosshead in posi- tion with respect to the propulsion cylinder even though the fire valve is operated. It is positioned by two hydraulic cylinders with crossed hydraulic connections between them. Manual operation of the lever adjacent to the control con- sole actuates one cylinder, which in turn drives the remote cylinder attached to the safety lock on top of the propulsion cylinder and crosshead. When the lever adjacent to the panel is operated, the clevis is raised, permitting the cross- head to move with respect to the propulsion cylinder. As soon as the clevis is raised from its down, locked position, a horn is actuated and continues to sound until the crosshead is returned to the safe position, or until the crosshead is in the completely extended position, also a safe condition. After the run is completed, the operator must return the propulsion cylinder crosshead to one of the safe positions (either fully extended or in the firing position with the clevis lock in place) before the horn stops sounding.

PERFORMANCE Fig. 11 shows the results from a computer program used to predict the performance characteristics of the propulsion system. Points derived from experimental data are also included. The theoretical curves consider the variation in pressure and volume in the accumulator and the pressure in the cushion end of the propulsion cylinder. From this family of curves it is possible to predict the velocity and ac- celeration of the vehicle or sled for any set of conditions in the accumulator and propulsion cylinder cushion chamber. The vehicle accelerator has been used primarily for in- vestigating impacts to the steering assembly and instrument panel in simulated forward-force collisions. Both cadavers and dummies have been subjected to impacts corresponding to barrier crashes at speeds up to 30 mph with stopping dis- tances (that is, snubber stroke) up to 24 in. Other less severe forward-force types of collisions have been simulated with speeds up to 45 mph and snubbing distances up to 72 in. Figs. 12 and 13 are sequential photographs from instrument panel and steering assembly impacts, respectively. Fig. 14 is a record of a cadaver- instrument panel impact with an impact velocity of 18.9 mph and a stopping distance of 20 in. The vehicle acceleration record is the second one from the bottom and indicates a peak acceleration of 7.4 g. The other records include seat belt loads (O.L.C. - 890 lb and I.L.C. - 911 lb) and A-P head acceleration at impact with the instrument panel (L-AP - 97 g). Fig. 15 is a similar record for a 28.4 mph impact with a 24 in. stopping distance. In this case the peak vehicle ac- celeration was 34 g, the seat belt loads were 2020 and 2121 lb and the L-AP head acceleration was 106 g peak. A complete series of experiments of this type is being conducted on several of the popular model cars. The results will be compared with accident cases where identical de- Fig. 10 - Control console ACCUMULATOR PISTON POSITION (ft.) - 40 ■ 41 0.5 1.0 20 4.0 6.0 w J. / / -T^IOOO z INITIAL CUSHION CHAMBER / / / / / O PRESSURE • 14.7 p$io / / / / / r O PRESSURE • 14.7 p$io / / / / / // ut / / / ****§§§ r ¿ / S y' CURVES : THORETICAL - 10 - / S POINTS : EXPERIMENTAL t S S &lt;¡r 0 : 3tt PISTON POSITION Z 200 A : 6ft.

With the deformations the same for the accident and the laboratory impact, the forces and accelerations will be correlated with the injuries of the ac- cident victims to provide a direct measure of the forces and accelerations required to produce the injuries. Fig. 16 shows a sawtooth acceleration pulse and Fig. 17 shows a skewed, half sine pulse on the sled. These are typical early sled runs used to determine the various pulse shapes attainable. Note that, as required for one program, the ac- celeration onset was between 300 and 700 g/sec. Accelera- tion onsets up to 2000 g/sec can be attained. The current sled program consists of human volunteer runs in a hyper-flexion attitude with complete body restraint from the shoulders down. Accelerations are measured on a biteplate, at the occiput and at T^. The results will provide accurate kinematic data on the human head and neck in a flexion environment. Similar data will be obtained in the future for other body orientations and other types of restraints. A preliminary study of the pedestrian impact injury syn- drome has been made.

The most severe head injuries resulted from impact to the con- crete roadway with only noninjurious head impacts to the hood of the vehicle. Additional impacts with the pedestrian at other velocities and different orientations will provide a complete picture of the injury potential. The effect of front-end design on the degree of injury to pedestrians is planned for the future. SUMMARY The WHAM II is a versatile, comparatively inexpensive device that permits a wide variety of research programs to be conducted in controlled acceleration environments. Its primary features are: 1. The same propulsion and snubber units are used for the vehicle and sled configurations. 2. Accelerations or decelerations up to 60 g can be ap- plied to the vehicle or the sled. 3. Velocities up to 60 mph can be achieved. 4.

Modified automobiles can be accelerated up to 60 mph on their own wheels, which provides realistic dynamic impact simulation without damage to the chassis and body. 6. It can be used to verify compliance with safety stand- ards. 7. Extensive safety features for the operating personnel have been provided. 8. Experiments are conducted indoors where climatic conditions do not interfere. REFERENCES 1. E. S. Gurdjian and H. R.
