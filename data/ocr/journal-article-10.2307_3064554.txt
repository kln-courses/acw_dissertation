<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 239 glorious thing in the world that the house of Theodosius the Great's elder brother Honorius didicit regnare. 51. '... c'&amp; qui un difficile problema testuale...' writes C., concluding her discussion with the words: 'Scelgo pertanto, sia pure con qualche esitazione, lavat, lezione accolta anche da Birt.' But Verg. G. 3.358 does not confirm lauat here; quite the opposite in fact: the Sun's horses, like the typical Roman, take their bath at the end, not the beginning, of the working day. 163. I do not see C.'s promised defence of quod, which, by comparison with qui, is thoroughly pedestrian. 174. For the classical poets the noun is Achelous, and Acheloius is always an adjective (cf. ThLL 1.388f.), and it is not correct to designate the former the Greek and the latter the Latin form, as C. does, possibly in the interests of an argument based on lectio difficilior. It may be that Achelous abiret is a 'congettura umanistica' - it is certainly a Heinsian conjecture - but, whatever its status, it is, I believe, what Cl. wrote. 188. alio ... numine, 'Con ben altro auspicio', is not vindicated, to my satisfaction at least, by C.'s invocation of three Virgilian passages involving forms of numen (Aen. 2.123, 7.119, 8.78), no one of which proves that numen could be applied to torches (I take it that there is no question of the numen of Salus being changed). In support of lumine Heinsius aptly compared Ov. Fast. 2.561 f.: conde tuas, Hy menaee, faces, et ab ignibus atris / aufer. habent alias maesta sepulchra faces. 189. C., while acknowledging that coronas has appeared in 181 and coronam in 185, attempts to defend coronis here in the transferred sense of 'onorificenza, riconoscimento' by appealing to 24.76. All this is beside the mark, unless the post of comes sacri stabuli (to which refer 190-3) be deemed as honorific as a corona ciuica (181ff.). 206. In her text C. prints confessis... procellae, which I favour, but in her note ad loc. canvasses the possibility of reading confessi.. .procella, confessi being the reading of most of the MSS, procella her own conjecture. For myself I doubt whether procella unqualified in the sense of 'a causa della tempesta' is a serious contender for a place in the text. 214. To say that Serena eyes the door (respectans limina) as she takes a last tearful farewell of her departing husband seems natural enough to me. C. does not say why she finds respectans lumina ('looking into his eyes', surely no more than that; 'volgendoti indietro a guardarlo' strikes me as unnecessarily fussy) objectionable, yet, while printing it, she is already suggesting conjectural substitutes for it in her note ad loc. Heinsius' respectans numina, however, does not strike me as analogous to 8.273 respectans aethera; and lumine uultus (seemingly claimed by C., but in fact already proposed by Jeep) or lumine uultum is surely no more than an alternative way of saying lumina uultu.

Et ego dixi. in uacuum laboraui, sine causa, et uane fortitudinem meam consumpsi. Words such as these come unbidden to my mind as I survey a commentary on the first book of DRP which for the most part takes its lemmata from Theodor Birt's edition of 1892; and, lest I seem to harbour exaggerated suspicions of a certain Anglophobia in Karl-Franzens-Universitat Graz, let me add that Aetna is cited not 10 OCR</page><page sequence="2">240 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW according to the excellent edition produced by F. R. D. Goodyear (Cambridge, 1965) but the unspeakable one produced by S. Sudhaus (Leipzig, 1898). Via stulti recta in oculis eius. qui autem sapiens est, audit consilia. The commentary is of the exegetical type now fashionable, and it does contain a deal of information that it is arguably better to have than not to have. It is weakest on the critical side, perhaps because P. seems to have felt it incumbent on him to disagree with me as often as possible. At 238, for example, I had opted for the reading formata' since Jormare... is commonly employed of engraving or casting in metal...'; in thus opting for formata I may be wrong, but I did at least try to justify my option, instead of inertly retainingfirmata and asserting that Dem Sinn nach ergibt sich aber kein Unterschied zwischen firmata und formata'. This is possibly the most striking example of disagreement for disagreement's sake, but P.'s credulity in face of the incredible is hard to credit. At 243, to take one telling instance, the molten metal with which the subterranean smiths Pyragmon and Steropes work, incoctum maduit lassafbrnace metallum. That was what I read, because, as P. correctly reports, I saw no sense in ceruice (but I did not say that ceruice was ' iberliefert'); for P., e contra, a good explanation is offered by Geoffrey of Vitry when he says metallun ... uidetur madidum et ceruicem quasi lassam deponit et effluit. Were Claudian talking of the melting down of anthropomorphic bronzes, I could under- stand, and would accordingly have retained ceruice; but he is not. In line 4 P. retains mens congesta, to which he assigns the meaning 'seine Gedanken sammeln', rejecting as unnecessary mens concussa (which is not my emendation, as he states, but the reading of the Isengrin edition, as I had stated). In support of his interpretation, which I thought I had adequately disposed of in my commentary, he cites Ovid (Met. 14.352, where Picus returns to his senses) and Cicero (Div. 1.66, where furor is defined as taking leave of one's senses), evidently unaware that these two passages are not complementary but contradictory. A few miscellaneous observations on matters of text. 72: P. takes disrumpit pelagus apart from siluas camposque ... rapturus... But disrupting pelagus siluas camposque is strained, and Cicero's reference (Div. 2.44) to winds ripping clouds apart hardly validates the expression disrumpit pelagus. 130: whether or not uicina toro is right, it is equivalent to dyXiyatos- (cf. Parth. Jr. 22, Nonn. 5.572). 139ff: P. concludes that both 139 and 141 are genuine: I should not like to think that Cl. could have been content to write commendat Siculisfurtim suapignora terris / aethera deseruit Siculasque relegat in oras. 164: P. does not even mention, let alone discuss, molibus, in my opinion the true reading. 189: 'Fur fruges spricht letzlich auch die Alliteration.' Prove it. 273:' Der Ausdruck pudor steht hier fir rubor wie 10,268 und 28,565.' The two nouns, however, though metrically interchangeable, are not synonymous: at 10.268, certainly, it is not easy to believe that in praising Maria's complexion Cl. wrote miscet quam iusta pudorem / temperies... For P. (see his introductory chapter entitled 'Aufbau und Intention...) the DRP is no mere 'Stilubung' but a poem with a religious purpose. Begun in 397 when the city prefect Florentinus was responsible for taking measures to avert famine in Rome, it is to be read as a pagan allegory in praise of the Eleusinian trinity (19, 34), and the poet's daring (1.3 audaci promere cantu; and cf. the first preface) consists in his undertaking such a theme. His sympathetic treatment of Pluto and of the Underworld in general is designed 'beim Zuh6rer/Leser vor allem Sympathien fur Hades zu wecken', the poem being so conceived that 'einer harmonischen Aussohnung zwischen Ober- und Unterwelt zum Nutzen der Menschen nichts im Wege steht' (24, 34). By 397 Cl. was already established at the court in Milan; and his patron Stilicho</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 241 was nothing if not a zealous Christian. Even if Cl. in fact was a pagan at heart, is it conceivable that he would have risked his lucrative and prestigious position on the imperial staff by 'deviating' (P.'s word is 'abweichen', 19) from political poetry in honour of the generalissimo to crypto-pagan epic in honour of a functionary whose importance was localised and who before the end of 397 praefectus agendo negotio segnior uisus Lampadio successore mutatus est (Symm. Ep. 6.64)? We do not know whether Florentinus was a pagan; but we do know, on Eunapius' testimony, that the Eleusinian mysteries had effectively and finally been brought to an end by Alaric's invasion of Greece, which antedates Gildo's withholding of the corn supply to Italy. Because myth is arguably functional (so P., following D6pp), not merely decorative, in the political poems, it does not necessarily follow that the mythological epic may not be an end in itself; and Cl.'s treatment of the Underworld is perfectly well explicable in terms of Hellenistic 'verismo' (cf. e.g. Callimachus' Fifth Hymn, ed. A. W. Bullock, 4ff.). Discussion of Cl.'s religious beliefs is now almost de rigueur in monographs and commentaries on his poems. In view of his interpretation of DRP as covert propaganda for paganism, P. hardly needed to devote a separate section to what in his case is a foregone conclusion. The evidence, such as it is, has been combed repeatedly for new clues, but its inherent conflicts (Orosius' paganus peruicacissimus writing an Easter poem referring to Christ's redeeming death and man's salvation sums it all up) are unlikely to be resolved and the debate will doubtless continue. In the circumstances there is not a little to be said for the somewhat cynical view taken by Cameron and Matthews of Cl. the opportunist, at bottom a pagan but 'prepared to let it be believed that he was a Christian'. A somewhat desultory section on style concludes P.'s introduction. It ends with the sentence (44): 'Entgegen der Meinung, Claudian sei mehr Rhetoriker als wahrer Poet, glauben wir gezeigt zu haben, dass die rhetorische Komponente deutlich hinter die poetische zuriicktritt.' I am not sure that I understand what this statement means, and I doubt whether any Latin poet, at least from the Augustan period on, would have understood it either. London J. B.

Housman, who wanted thought to be applied to textual criticism, would have applauded this edition. Professor Watt (hereafter W.) is an admirably sane critic, sharp in perception and balanced in judgement. He has contributed very substantially to the establishment of a credible text of Cicero's Adfamiliares, both by his own conjectures, rarely spectacular but often convincing, and by his sagacious appraisal of earlier work. He has done much for which he claims no credit, particularly in punctuation. We have here an accomplished and sustained exercise of thought: it rewards attention, page by page. The clear and succinct preface, being uncontroversial, requires no comment. Nor do the accurate indices nominum et Graecitatis. So I concentrate on text and 10-2</page></plain_text>
