<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION REPLY TO PROFESSOR BAYLIS' CRITICISM\IS Professor Baylis' criticisms of my article "On God and Immortality" can be answered as follows: (1) I grant that my conception of God as the ultimate system in the uni- verse differs considerably from the anthropomorphic conception of deity held by many people in both primitive and modern times. God seems to me indeed worthy of worship, but my account of the nature of worship cannot easily be summarized here. (2) There is no begging of the question in my statement that "any discon- firmation of any theory (since it is a confirmation of some other theory) also involves a confirmation S." In saying that a fact f disconfirms a theory X, I mean simply that f confirms some theory which is inconsistent with X. Hence a disconfirmation of X is necessarily a confirmation of some theory inconsistent with X. I do not hold that any one fact confirms both S and the contradictory of S. I did mention a theory T which is inconsistent with S, so that confirmations of T would be disconfirmations of S. If f is a fact. for which we have no known explanation, and if g is the fact that we have no known explanation for f, then g might be a confirmation of T and a dis- confirmation of S. If h is the fact that g confirms some theory, then h con- firms S and is the confirmation of S that is involved in the disconfirmation g of S. (3) The theory of types seems to me objectionable because it appears to raise difficulties of its own as serious as those which it purports to solve. (See my paper "Self-Reference in Philosophy," referred to by Baylis, and also a short note in Mind, n.s. vol. LAVI, p. 184.) The paradoxes of logic and semantics can be avoided without any theory of types by using a demonstrably consistent system of logic such as that formulated in my paper, "An Extension of Basic Logic" (forthcoming in the Journal of Sym- bolic Logic). In any case Baylis' result about the "theory which explains all those and only those theories which do not explain themselves" depends on the false assumption that to every class of theories there corresponds a theory that explains just the theories that are members of that class and no others. (4) As Baylis rightly points out, it is usual to deal with the confirmation of theories in such a way that if we can deduce a fact g from the conjunction of a theory X with a fact (or a conjunction of facts) f, then we say that g confirms X. My approach is superficially different, but it amounts to 698</page><page sequence="2">REPLY TO PROFESSOR BALIS' CRrrIcIsMs 699 essentially the same thing. Instead of confirming X by deducing g from the conjunction of X with f, my procedure is to confirm X by deducing from X the proposition "If f then g," that is, the proposition "not-(f and not-g)." Observe that "not-(f and not-g)" is a fact if f and g are facts and that it is deducible from X if and only if g is deducible from the conjunction of X with f. This argument holds even if f and g are particulars and though X makes no direct mention of any particular. In case "the assumption of a number of other laws, hypotheses, or theories is required" before the confirming facts can be inferred from a theory X which is being tested, we should re- gard the confirming facts as providing confirmation not of X by itself but of the conjunction of X with these other laws, hypotheses, or theories. From this standpoint I can surely maintain the view that if a theory implies the contradictory of a fact, then the theory cannot be true. (5) I can see no objection to regarding all true propositions as facts and all facts as true propositions. My position on this point is the same as that of Professor C. J. Ducasse. (6) Let H be the hypothesis that some experience of ours will not be followed by a later experience. Baylis is mistaken in supposing that H "is also confirmed by every experience we have." For let e be some specific experience (of mine). I cannot deduce from H that e will not be followed by a later experience; so that even if e had not at a given time been followed by another experience, this state of affairs still would not confirm H. But anyhow as I regard e in retrospect I see that e is followed by many other experiences. Let J be the hypothesis that e will not be followed by a later experience. The mere fact that e at the time of its occurrence has not been followed bAy a later experience is no indication that it will not be so followed. The reason for this is that J is not really a confirmable theory at all, since it involves a direct mention of the particular e. FREDERIC B. FITCH. YALE UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
