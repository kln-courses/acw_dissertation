<plain_text><page sequence="1">568 Reviews with the Islamic world, and it should be translated into English as soon as possible. The methodological rigor that informs Tibi's approach to the book's central problem are as noteworthy as the wealth of analysis here brought together. All too rarely do German and American research mesh in this fashion, and it is one of the delights of this volume that is successfully fuses these two important traditions of learning. My own work has recently begun to deal fairly extensively with contemporary Islamic fundamentalist thought, and I have arrived at the opinion that Islamic fundamentalism is "modern" and revolutionary in ways that go beyond the framework of a backward- looking utopia, just as my work on the scriptures has convinced me of an innate flexibility of the core of the Islamic "canon." But Tibi's interest in his book is primarily to pose questions and to pinpoint multidisciplinary methodological approaches. Thus, the volume pulls together as well as challenges the work done today in many disciplines on the contemporary Islamic world. I find it to be Tibi's most thought-provoking work to date. Its richness lies precisely in its thesis that the analysis of Islamic socioeconomic and political realities remains a partial analysis of that culture unless the religious component- as "cultural system of symbols"-is included in it. In the global dialogue concerning the theme of this volume, other voices will have to be heard. They will not disagree with Tibi's understanding that contemporary Islam is in the throes of a cultural crisis whose roots lie deep in the past. NOTE '1981; English trans., The Crisis of Modern Islam, 1988. School of Languages and Linguistics BARBARA FREYER STOWASSER Georgetown University Aziz AL-AZMEH, Arabic Thought and Islamic Societies (London Croom Helm, 1986). Pp. 304. This book is a description of Arabic thought in its "finished and consummated form." It covers the historical period beginning with the tenth century and ending with the work of Jalal al-Din Suyufii, who died in 1505. In the preface, the author, who teaches at the University of Exeter, tells us that the present work is an explanatory synthesis of material based on samplings of scientific works written in Arabic, "and is, by the very nature of things, a synthetic survey, one that is deliberately designed to detect openings, delimit conceptions, identify problems and orient further research." It intends to revise the present state of scholarship on medieval Arabic thought by incorporating "what has become the common stock of historical and other social and human sciences into the field, and to shed the topical repertoire of orientalism." To do that, al-Azmeh devotes a large part of the book to identifying the "primary metaphysical principles" of medieval Arabic thought, through an exhaustive and detailed analysis of metaphysical and natural scientific texts. The first principle is "hierarchy," which is not only at the heart of order in the universe, but also in the human body, and in social and political organization. In this hierarchical order, everything has its station and rank. God in his ultimate perfection and eternity is the apex of the great chain of being. All else suffers in privation relative to its distance from the first principle, which is the supreme component of all being, intrinsically necessary, and the telos of all creation. Having articulated the ontological hierarchy, the author turns to a discussion of "nature," and an exposition of the different views of Arabic philosophers and theologians. The ground is familiar: The natural is simple; the artificial is composite. The distinction between composition (ta'lif) and combination (tarkib) clarifies how certain bodies are</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 569 natural in a conventional sense. Underlying the simple and the composite are the concepts of substance (jawhar) and primary matter (hyle). Form and accident constitute and the reality of the thing and the course of its activity. Form is the quality of the body, and the body is the carrier of this quality. Form and accident are relative terms, although form remains "the mother of all accidents," making a thing what it is. The focus shifts to humankind as the "gist of creation." Humanity itself is also hierarchically organized in terms of degrees of rationality and spirituality, culminating in prophecy, "the highest station of humanity and of human potency." The theological view of prophecy (a special, divine endowment) is contrasted with the philosophical view, involving the cultivation of human reason. Which assumes primacy, reason or prophecy, remains a controversial question in medieval Arabic thought. For the mystics, however, sainthood is akin to prophethood, at least insofar as both agree that knowledge is intuitive. Common characteristics, as well as differences between saintly miracles, prophetic miracles, and magic are sketched. The possibility of magic is accepted or tolerated so long as it does not involve the assumption of prophecy. In dreaming, as in prophecy, sooth- saying, and mystical gnosis, the "veil of sense" is removed. Whatever form of communication with the "highest realms" it takes, man remains the "archetype of the universe," signifying the access of humanity to divinity. In this context, sliding into anthropomorphism, as in the case of the Ashcarites, is inevitable. Ibn Taymiyya's "deference to the letter of the [Qur'anic] text," while also eschewing anthro- pomorphism is rightly dismissed by the author as "discursively untenable." Regardless of doctrinal inconsistencies, the whole theological scheme affirms the "homological associa- tion" of humanity and divinity, which can also be seen in the realm of the occult, in particular in the legacies of Pythagorean numerology. Just as there is affinity between character and physical form, there is also an association between symbols and signification in the interpretation of dreams. Similarly, the conjunc- tion of planets indicates cataclysmic events in the life of nations, as the Stoics had detected. Azmeh relates this effectiveness to an important metaphysical premise of Arabic thought, "that the relationship between more sublime and baser things is organized according to two principles: as the mystics expressed it, love, passion and longing linking the lower to the higher, and coercion, disposition and comprehension relating a sublime thing to its inferiors" (p. 78). Inevitably, the questions of causality, divine will and human acts, central to the development of kaldm, are considered. The Ash'arite rejection of the possibility of natural causation (replaced by the custom of God), and their notion of kasb-man's capacity to acquire what God creates-are fully articulated. What some Ash'arites may question, however, is the author's interpretation that the latter doctrine represents "a certain monistic continuum along which human will operates as an indistinct moment in divinity, a notion akin to monistic pantheism" (p. 83). Knowledge, understood as the certification of signification, leaves the question of "cer- tainty" in a very peculiar position, as the author rightly indicates. Consequently, he detects "a profound scepticism" as a hallmark of Arabic thought in general, rooted in the generally accepted doctrine that God's intention is ultimately ineffable. What bearing does this have on the Arab understanding of science? Science, as treated by Muslim thinkers, is constructed on the basis of a number of premises which are intertwined with two processes of knowledge, tasawwur (apprehension) and tasdiq (assent). They divided the sciences into 'ulam naqliyya, and Culum Caqliyya, based on the nature of their premises. But such classifications, he warns, "do not have as their exclusive purpose the division of knowledge into licit and illicit," from the Islamic point of view. Azmeh challenges the reason-belief antinomy upon which much modern scholarship is based. Reason and belief are not "antithetical substances, but are strands of apodictic origin woven into the meshes</page><page sequence="3">570 Reviews of scientific paradigms and of individual intellects" (p. 198). Even Hanbalism and Zahirism resorted to the exercise of rigorous reason; and the legitimacy of philosophy in Islam was questioned not in the region of science but in the field of ideology. After discussing the "heretical" theses for which philosophers suffered persecution in Islam, the author argues that it was political rather than doctrinal reasons that brought the wrath of the rulers down on those who pursued the art of philosophy. The story of Ibn Rushd and the Almohad Caliph Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur is retold, with emphasis on the political conditions that led the ruler, although fascinated by philo- sophical studies, to persecute the man he had previously honored. The same argument applies to the formation of dogmatic and legal schools. Conflict between the various schools did not have conceptual issues as the overriding concern. Support by certain rulers for a particular dogmatic school did not imply doctrinal espousal. The rulers were politicians "aware of the role of scholarship and culture generally in life, but mindful of political conditions and politic consideration" (p. 219-20). Paradigmatic school in theology and law centered around a particular person, but shared ideas, positions, and methods in common. It was not until the eleventh century that they became professionalized in the process of becoming institutionalized in the academic context of the madrasa. After describing the Colleges and their system of education, al- Azmeh concludes that education in the medieval Muslim world was "the transmission of an implicit apodictic system, one whose apodictic statements . . are taken on trust, on the assumption of their validity, and with the sanction of authority" (p. 229). In the last chapter, al-Azmeh restates his main thesis that science does not only have to do with knowledge; it must also be treated "in its capacity as a field where extra-epistemic conflicts are articulated and, indeed, fought out." Science, culture, and ideology are connected with the good order of society and polity. To illustrate this interconnection the author reviews the relationships (mainly of patronage) between Muslim rulers and the ulama, poets, and other professionals. However, science was not compromised. For example, the traditional interpretation of Maward-i's al-Ahkdm al-Sulta-niyya as an attempt to reconcile the "moribund reality" of the caliphate with its ideal is vigorously disputed. In an argument that perceptibly begs the question, he asserts that "no such reconciliation was ever attempted . . . the classical theory of the caliphate was unaltered, and the provision for obedience to the powers of the day could legally ... be accommo- dated in terms of force majeure, without this altering the original parameters of the caliphal topic" (p. 258). The ulama were the ideological guardians of an Islamic utopia. In Arabic Thought and Islamic Societies, Aziz al-Azmeh presents medieval Arabic thought in terms of its structure and its basic conceptual elements, and with a vitality unknown in most literature in the field. The book is not for the casual reader, neither is it for the student who is only superficially familiar with Arabic and Islamic thought and culture. The author's command of his sources is impressive, and no review of this size could do justice to this pioneering work. Although one may question some of his sweeping generalizations, no one can dispute the power of his arguments, or deny the intellectual challenges he puts forward.
