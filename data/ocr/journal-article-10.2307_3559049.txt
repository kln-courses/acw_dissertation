<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALLEGORY AND PSYCHOANALYSIS by Barbara E. Johnson* As part of a celebration of the work of Claudia Tate, I am going to discuss the two terms that figure prominently in the titles of her books: allegory and psychoanalysis. How are these two terms related? Almost a quarter-century ago, Roy Schafer created some ripples in psychoanalytic theory by protesting against what he called its "anthropomorphisms." In an essay called "The Mover of the Mental Apparatus," he wrote that "In this chapter I focus on the anthropomorphism that both pervades and artificially sustains Freudian metapsychology. I identify the manifestations of this anthropomorphism and argue that it is an inescapable consequence or correlate of Freud's mechanistic and organismic mode of theorizing."1 Protesting against the tendency to transfer agency away from the responsible subject to another psychic entity ("my unconscious made me do it"), Schafer sees such anthropomorphisms as "artificial" and "mechanical" abuses of rhetorical fictions. Interestingly, these are the same qualities that led William Wordsworth to argue against the "gaudiness and inane phraseology" associated with the "personification of abstract ideas." In his 1802 Preface to his lyrical ballads, he wrote, "My purpose was to imitate, and, as far as possible, to adopt the very language of men; and assuredly such personifications do not make any natural or regular part of that language. They are, indeed, a figure of speech occasionally prompted by passion, and I have made use of them as such; but have endeavoured utterly to reject them as a mechanical device of style." Wordsworth rejected personification as a mechanical device of style in his quest for the "real language of men." Schafer rejected anthropomorphism as a disavowal of agency in Freudian theory. In both cases, they find that an artifice of rhetoric has taken the place of, and obscured, the real. Telling the truth about the real requires a stripping away of rhetoric similar to that called for by W. E. B. Du Bois in The Souls of Black Folk. He writes: We are compelled daily to turn more and more to a conscientious study of the phenomena of race-contact,-to a study frank and fair, and not falsified and colored by our wishes or our fears. And we have in the South as fine a field for such a study as the world affords.... What are the actual relations of whites and blacks in the South? and we must be answered, not by apology or fault-finding, but by a plain, unvarnished tale. *Barbara E. Johnson, who teaches in the departments of English and Comparative Literature at Harvard University in Cambridge, MA, has recently been appointed the Fredric Wertham Professor of Law and Psychiatry in Society. 66</page><page sequence="2">ALLEGORY AND PSYCHOANALYSIS Du Bois thus undertakes to tell the truth about segregation at the start of the twentieth century. The tale will be "unvarnished" by wishes or fears-just the facts, Ma'am, neither embellished nor rhetorically skewed. Yet the word that promises a lack of rhetoric is itself a rhetorical marker: the word "unvarnished" is taken from Othello's explanation of his winning of Desdemona. Claiming that he is "rude of speech," he tells the Duke of Venice: "I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver." But of course, lack of rhetoric is what is most powerfully simulated by both Othello and Du Bois-rhetorically. Both use lack of rhetoric as a consummate rhetorical move. "Unvarnished" is a varnish designed to be invisible, as of course the most effective varnishes try to be. A classical varnish calls attention to the painting it highlights, not to itself. What would the function of a varnish be that called attention to itself at the expense of what is depicted in the painting? A varnish can only be seen to the extent that it fails to disappear. Some indication of the complexity of the task Du Bois has set for himself can be gleaned from his use of the word "colored": the study of race relations will not be "colored by our wishes and fears." But since the object of study is precisely the "color line," it seems that the object of study excludes itself. In studying color, one must strip away color. Color can only be studied by those who have neither wishes nor fears-that is, those who have no color. The real language of men and the real agency of the subject are not so easy to convey if the science or poetics of the real includes the desires and fears of the observer. Du Bois's use of "shadows" and "veils" come from a double register: the register of "darkness" and the register of "allegory." Described as a "dark conceit" or a "beautiful lie," allegory paradoxically can sometimes make vivid by veiling. Personification and anthropomorphism are also identifying marks of allegory-excessive, rather than inadequate, rhetorical representation. The real would then be not the object of representation but either a representation obscured or an unrepresentableness represented, an unspeakableness spoken. In rhetorical treatises like the one by Pierre Fontanier, allegory is described as follows: "Allegory consists in a proposition with a double meaning, both a literal meaning and a spiritual [conceptual] meaning together, through which one presents a thought through the image of another thought, which can properly make the first more perceptible and striking than if it were presented directly and without any sort of veil." Du Bois's use of the image of the Veil has been the occasion for much comment. But before we turn to it specifically, let us stay with allegory for a while longer. In an article in "Race," Writing and Difference, Abdul JanMohamed, citing Frantz Fanon, called colonial allegory "manichean." But I would say that all allegory is manichean to the extent that it is based on clear binary oppositions. Joel Fineman, in "The Structure of Allegorical Desire," defined allegory as the story of the desire for structure: "I am concerned with a specifically allegorical desire, a desire for allegory, that is implicit in the desire for structure itself." The smallest units of structure itself appear to be binary oppositions. Thus, no matter how complex they seem, allegories would always have a manichean logic. Black characters and white characters, for example, would signify something they self-evidently embody. They are chosen in allegory in order to signify. Black and white are not treated in this case as unknowns, then, but as knowns. 67</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY The structure of allegory would then, in effect, be the structure of segregation. And in fact, a quick look at some classic and moder allegories bears this out in an overdetermined way, not only racially but also sexually. Pilgrim's Progress has one journey for man, a second for woman. In Camus's The Plague, the important women either die or are expelled from Algeria so that the exploration of "man" is confined to "types of men." It seems as though there is often sexual segregation in allegory unless sexual difference constitutes the subject of the allegory, as in The Romance of the Rose, for example. So Jacques Lacan can speak of "urinary segregation" in Western culture as the instatement of two bathroom doors separated only by sameness. It is the separation-of the sexes, of the races, of the classes- that brings all bodies into culture, not anything the separation signifies. If, as Paul de Man suggests, allegory is the story of the failure of symbol to be what it says it is, then perhaps the history of segregation (or secession) is the failure of unity (or union) to be what it says it is. There is something too easily said about this, however-something that is not including the position from which it can be said within it. Something that therefore, fundamentally, relies on the logic of segregation in order to seem to be outside it. The inside/outside boundary, fundamental to all segregation, is also what is supposed to define objectivity. Many people have commented on the difficulty of establishing the location of the Veil, and of Du Bois's location with respect to it. Between, on, in front of? Characteristic of blacks or whites? Above, within, beneath, outside? In his "Forethought," Du Bois writes: "Need I add that I who speak here am bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of them that live within the Veil?" "I who speak here" am not external to that of which I speak. The object is the same as the subject-but never at exactly the same time. The relation between them is profoundly divided, full of "unreconciled strivings." It is the structure of racial hierarchy that has given this self-division its racial coloration. All consciousness is what Du Bois calls "double- consciousness." In citing Adam's words to Eve from Genesis, however, Du Bois has less consigned blacks to the role of "lady of the races" than warned against celebrating the end of segregation too soon. The Biblical story of Eve coming from Adam's rib is a reversal of the biological story of Adam coming out of Eve. The Genesis story is a denial, not an erasure, of difference. The elimination of the Gothic presence of the Veil-with its uncanny capital letter and its allegorical existence-may not be as easy as it seems. Although such an elimination is yearned for from one end of The Souls of Black Folk to the other, it seems it cannot be removed without destroying life itself. In 1870, Congress passed the 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution granting black men the right to vote. The equality of all men as anticipated in the Declaration of Independence was on its way to becoming literalized. Less than a year later, Congress passed the first Dictionary Act, explaining how the language used in any act of Congress should be read. The word "person," it said, should be understood to include associations and corporations, not just natural persons. In other words, just at the moment the equality of individuals becomes law, corporations become persons. Is this an accident? Doesn't it seem designed to counteract the redistribution of property that the new rights entail? 68</page><page sequence="4">ALLEGORY AND PSYCHOANALYSIS If a corporation can function as a person, the law nevertheless reserves the right to look beyond the rhetorical entity and investigate the "natural persons" that compose it. This is called "piercing the veil." The veil of artifice is stripped away, revealing the "real" behind it. The only problem with this structure is that the aggregate of the corporation's component parts does not function like the "person" the corporate person once was. When "Congress" passes a law (say, the 15th Amendment or the Dictionary Act), its inner conflicts or divisions-its "unreconciled strivings"-are artificially forgotten in favor of the agency conferred on the corporate body by the fiction of unity. So, for example, we say that the last presidential election was "decided by the court," even though we are well aware of the divisions and uncertainties such a formulation covers over. Paradoxically, then, the more democratic a society, the more subject it is to the agency of fictions of unity, that is, to the rule of personification. So we find ourselves unwittingly back deep in the very thing William Wordsworth was inveighing against. But as Steven Knapp describes it, "personification of abstract ideas" was a source of nervousness even for the Enlightenment writers Wordsworth thought he was writing against. Samuel Johnson, for example, writes: Milton's allegory of Sin and Death is undoubtedly faulty. Sin is indeed the mother of Death, and may be allowed to be the portress of hell; but when they stop the journey of Satan, a journey described as real, and when Death offers him battle, the allegory is broken. That Sin and Death should have shown the way to hell might have been allowed; but they cannot facilitate the passage by building a bridge, because the difficulty of Satan's passage is described as real and sensible, and the bridge ought to be only figurative. Knapp comments: Allegorical personification-the endowing of metaphors with the agency of literal persons-was only the most obvious and extravagant instance of what Enlightenment writers perceived, with a mixture of admiration and uneasiness, as the unique ability of poetic genius to give the force of literal reality to figurative "inventions." More important than the incongruous presence of such agents was their contagious effect on the ostensibly literal agents with which they interacted. It is just such a "contagious effect" that is produced on the ostensibly literal "men" who are forced to interact with the uncanny, figurative "Veil" in Du Bois's text. The "Veil" enters and exits the stage of history (accompanied by something like the theme from Jaws) as if it were an independent character. It is not something that simply covers or divides or blinds men; it is also an external reality with which they interact. It is not a fantasy but a reality. Yet it is a fiction. Du Bois has succeeded in describing what happens when fictions take part in real life. In other words, his search for the "real" is real to the extent that it pierces the veil not of a fiction but of literality. Something like this is in fact what makes psychoanalysis possible. When Freud discovered that the childhood scenes of incest that his patients described to him were not always "real," he did not simply discard them. He took them as evidence of a different kind 69</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY of reality, one to which he could no longer function as exterior. He took them as evidence that he didn't know what the real was. Later psychoanalysts treated Freud's psychic rhetoric as if it were real, which was why Schaeffer was not wrong to question it. By telling a "plain, unvarnished tale" not just about the reality of fiction but about the inadequacy of concepts of what counts as real, Du Bois, too, makes it impossible for any reader to escape the "color line." The "unreconciled strivings" that almost tear asunder that "one dark body" don't allow for the seduction of visibility that fallaciously stabilizes them behind an image of racial identity. It is the oneness of the body that is the originating and alienating fiction. Far from being the real and the literal, the human body remains for all of us a dark conceit indeed.
