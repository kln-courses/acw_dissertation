DAVID PUGMIRE University of Southampton Highfield, Southampton SO9 5NH United Kingdom I Human folly, it seems, traces not only to ignorance and impulsiveness but also to the power of wishes that the erring agent acknowledges as unfit to motivate him. The possibility of genuinely perverse preference can be either denied or explained. To explain it, sense must be made of how a person's understanding of the choices before him could fail to decide his preference - how what convinces could fail to persuade. The question is how the influence a given consideration has over a person's choice can be other than a function of the beliefs he holds about its merits, so that as between competing considerations the one esteemed best doesn't win, despite continuing to be esteemed best. The belief in question must be final; all the priorities and relevant facts must have been considered together and a judgment struck on that basis, leaving out nothing and keeping everything in perspective. Otherwise the person would merely have not made up his mind until the moment of choice and then have chosen precipitately, in midst of deliberation and in response to whatever happened to be uppermost in his mind at the moment (an 'aw, what the hell!' choice). It may be rare for a deliberation that is both exhaustive and decisive - what Davidson terms an 'all things considered judgment' - to be traduced.1 The problem is how it could occur at all. 1 Donald Davidson, 'How Is Weakness of Will Possible?' in Essays on Actions and Events (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1980), 21-43</page><page sequence="2">74 David Pugmire To understand the conditions of action that is irrational to this degree, we must ask what is the relation between one's grasp of what is best - one's judgment - and one's motivation to act. This relation could be either a priori or empirical. The formal notion - that one's appreciation of what the alternatives are is all there is to motivate a free choice - is what makes action against better judgment puzzling in the first place. On the other hand, perhaps the alignment of one's estimate of the relative worth of the alternatives with how much one cares about them respec- tively is vulnerable to disruption. Then the interesting questions become psychological: What are the extra-judgmental conditions of motivation? How are they brought into play and what power have they? Non-judg- mental shapers of motivation would seem to be necessary to account for the hardest sort of irrational choice, that against an all-things-considered judgment on which one intends to act at the time one fails to act on it. If motivation is not vulnerable on other fronts than that of perceived reason, irrationality of this degree might seem impossible. Are there judgment-immune routes of motivation that can skew choice? I will discuss one, perhaps the principal candidate, viz., biasing by self-blandishment. This is the deployment of attention, be it sponta- neous or deliberate, that releases or even enhances the full motivational potential of a given prospect whilst diminishing that of its rivals. This is achieved in the first place by concentrating just on the right features of the wrong alternative while ignoring all that would make one think twice about these and about this alternative and by adding to this the judicious use of the imagination, association and memory to excite oneself at the prospect thus raised and transfix oneself by the pleasure of anticipation. With delectation already begun and focused, a new urgency is born, that of consummation or continuance, and with this, a new pressure on choice. It is one thing to know that the Sirens' music is irresistible and another to hear it. Moreover, not only may the charms of what tempts be evoked and dwelt on, but so may the trialsome aspects of the better alternative (including, of course, the aching prospect of the void that would be left by the sacrifice of the tempting experience). 'The akratic alternative sometimes acquires its attractions by its power to dominate the agent's attention ... by filling the experiential field it drowns out the preferred alternative.'2 This diagnosis is rich in practical import, for the direction of focus is controllable: 'the self-reforming akratic can.... learn to define the preferred alternative in ways that focus and magnify his attention' (Ibid., 210). 2 A. Rorty, 'Akrasia and Conflict/ Inquiry 22 (1980) 193-212, at 209</page><page sequence="3">Perverse Preference: Self-Beguilement or Self-Division? 75 II Few would deny that the strategic deployment of attention can some- how raise the attraction of a course of action and that, thus enlivened, the temptation to it may prevail against the resolve to reject it. Philoso- phers who see this as the explanation for acting against one's considered better judgment do not think that the excitement produced my the manipulation of attention affects one's choice by altering one's belief about the reasons one has and thereby one's actual assessment of the alternatives: that would no longer amount to the conferring of undue strength to the wrong desire. What they think is that the focusing of attention effects choice by a selective excitement that acts strictly as a cause, circumventing one's judgment while leaving it intact. Strategic attending accounts not for a volatility of judgment but directly for the irrational behavior. According to A.R. Mele in his recent defense of this idea, it is the 'balance of motivational strength' that is shifted, and shifted against a current of one's better judgment.3 In what follows I will try to show that this analysis cannot work and to assess the consequences of that for our understanding of irrational action. Ill The argument that selective focusing of attention intrudes on choice of action as a cause independent of reasons and judgment is that choices in the teeth of better judgment and solution to act on them do seem possible. The agent's conviction as to how to act and his intention so to act may remain even after strategic attending and imaginings have disabled them as governors of action. At its most general, the principle here would be that factors not perceived by the agent as offering good enough reasons can nonetheless affect the strength of his motives and so their balance. As Mele puts it, 'the motivational force of wants typically is not under our control to the extent to which the evaluative ranking of wants is' (Ibid., 39). He gives an example: John must complete a biology lab assignment that requires him to extract a sample of his own blood. He 'weighs his reasons in carrying out the assignment against his contrary reasons and judges that, all things considered he ought here and now to prick his finger with sufficient force to release an appropriate 3 A.R. Mele, Irrationality (New York: Oxford University Press 1987), 35-41</page><page sequence="4">76 David Pugmire amount of blood for the experiment. But his reasoning does not stop here. He judges unconditionally that this is the best thing to do, that is, he intends to prick his finger at once; and he moves the needle towards his finger with the intention of drawing blood/ However, he balks at thrusting home. He looks away, tries again but on contact again stops. 'Now, it is not necessary to suppose that John is psychologically unable to perform the task. Rather, it looks as if John's failure is due to weakness (akrasia); because he is weak, he fails to do what he judges to be best, all things considered, and what he intends to do' (Ibid., 34-5). Now just what does this example show? What is happening when a person freezes (not just hesitates) at the brink and thus fails to follow his resolve, perhaps repeatedly? The phenomenon is familiar enough, but no one interpretation of it is obvious. It does not unambiguously amount to 'strict akrasia' (Ibid., 7, 49), i.e., intentionally and freely intending to do what, all things considered, one deems it best to do here and now - in this case to draw one's own blood. At least two other interpretations are possible. Neither of them uses the model of free choice of action prompted by extra-judgmental motivation, which Mele uses to defend this sort of example. Here is the first: (A) In freezing at the brink John simply discovers what matters most to him then. The full nature of an act may become clear only at the moment of execution. His judgment alters as the actual nature of what he proposes to do emerges. Preliminary delibera- tion is not necessarily completed deliberation, and its conclusion can prove more provisional than it seemed. Even if motivational force is distinct from ascribed value, they are not separate here. John's resistance to pricking his finger testifies to how much it actually alarms him to do this - portrays a disposition that eluded his preliminary reflections - and this just is to place a value on not shedding his own blood. Actually, it is something that appalls him. The obvious objection to this is that if his judgment were altered on the brink of acting (or only finalized then), why does he admonish himself to try again and perhaps to try to manipulate his psychology around the difficulty? Does this not show he continues to hold to his judgment that piercing his skin is the lesser of the evils and to his resolution to act accordingly? It does not show this. At the moment of decision, John has shown himself squeamish, more squeamish than he realized or had hoped. He may regret that he should give such importance to minor self-injury, wished he were not like this, hoped that his squeamishness can be overcome by further attempts or by fixing his mind on the right things. But all these presuppose that at the time of his failure, he does grant such importance to such things.</page><page sequence="5">Perverse Preference: Self-Beguilement or Self-Division? 77 Yet does he not regret this attitude precisely because in his judgment it concedes excessive importance to dealing himself a trivial wound? In other words, the value he attaches to not piercing his own body under- determines his aversion (the motivational strength of his wish not to); so that his valuational attitude fails to account for his aversion. Is this correct? No. The impression that his renewed struggle against his aver- sion shows that he believes small what he treats as great is an illusion, and not only a philosophical one. It comes from confusing what one thinks desirable in itself with what one thinks is desirable for oneself. That I think it would be best to be a person who preferred X (e.g. not eating meat) doesn't entail that I am a person who does prefer X. The clash here needn't be between what I put worth on and what I prefer regardless of the worth I put on it. It can equally be between what I think deserves being given worth and what I give worth. Someone in John's position might well feel chagrin not just at failing to finish his assignment but at being the sort of fusspot who gives such unconditional importance to even the smallest lesion. Squeamishness is like irritability, finickiness, cowardice, or impatience, and unlike being ticklish or dizzy or getting hot easily: it isn't a non-valuational reaction but a disposition to give certain things more worth than others, namely, things that don't deserve it from any vantage-point except that created by this very disposition. Thus an irritable person doesn't flare up at the slightest provocation without regarding the provocation as an annoyance; he regards the slightest thing as an annoyance and flares up. At the same time, and distinctly, the provocation may also strike this person as trivial and he may lament his readiness to be annoyed about it. Squeamishness is similarly ambiguous: to be squeamish is not to shrink from an action that one doesn't really find disgusting or disturbing; it is to shrink from something because one does find it disgusting or disturbing. Yet this needn't prevent one from also recognizing that it is so trivial that to regard it as aversive and recoil from it is pathetic. Often people can understand the larger view that shows up their actual cares as petty foibles (or tacky, or craven, etc.). The capacity to achieve this chastening perspective on where the real values lie can be confused with really holding these values and deceiving oneself that one does not really hold the petty values. The device that allows a person to pretend that he isn't really con- cerned for something that he knows better than to be concerned for is the monolithic conception both of the 'all things considered' value judgment and of the value judgment that is 'unconditional' or 'decisive at t.' In the latter case, there is more to 't' than meets the eye. Such a judgment, once struck, needn't be static in time, casting its unmoving shadow forwards over the continuous unfolding of experience, reflec- tion, and response. Neither need All-things-considered mean once-and-for-</page><page sequence="6">78 David Pugmire all Furthermore, 'all things considered' is ambiguous as to how dis- tanced or abstract the vantage-point is from which the judgment is made. This makes it possible to ignore the difference between my 'holding X best'i, understood as believing that X deserves to be so rated, and 'holding X best'2, understood as so rating it in one's choices of action regardless of whether one believes it deserves this. How? The two difficulties reinforce each other. Thus, (1) If my 'all things considered' judgment is regarded as the one I took at a certain point (unless I revise it explicitly), then any contrary predilections that rise up subsequently are apt to seem products of something other than judgment and to be mental effects and causes that do not count as reasons. And to the extent that I do not acknowledge predilections contrary and subsequent to my standing judgment as showing what I really then regard as good rea- sons, my judgment will seem unchanged. And this can be just mistaken, mistaken both as a philosophical account and as a piece of self-under- standing. 'I did know Y was more important' and T really meant to do it' can be sincerely affirmed without necessarily being true. To profess is not always to hold. For, (2) there may be things about an act that only emerge to someone poised to commit it. In that case my previous deliberation, however sincere, was hollow and the real deliberation was only completed with the choice to desist. The worth I claim to put on things can be more a matter of wishful belief or of aspiration than I can admit without disrupting my picture who and what I am. The cost of disrupting the concept of myself around which I have built my life may be high: disorientation, disillusionment, discouragement. So I have a motive for identifying my actual values with the values I would prefer were my actual values. And for me to take the view that my failure was just weak, a regrettable lapse but merely a lapse, would constitute an exercise in self-deceit. It might still be felt that to be deplore the preferences evinced by my act precisely shows that they do not represent my ultimate judgment (and that my act was akratic after all). I didn't act as I really thought best. The argument assumed here seems to be that if I think I ought to think X best then I do think X best. This does not follow. 'Judging best' is ambiguous. A judgment on a judgment about X is not the same as the judgment about X. The fact that I regard financial considerations as always coming first could be something I also regard as wanting in myself. If to regret X was to be disburdened of it, it could never be regretted. It seems possible really to regret not really regretting some- thing. Conceding something is to be preferred is one thing, preferring it another. On interpretation (A), then, John (perhaps unwittingly) acts freely and continently because his judgment has revised itself and he is acting in accord with it. Suppose his performance really does betray his judgment,</page><page sequence="7">Perverse Preference: Self-Beguilement or Self-Division? 79 however. In that case, the interpretation of freezing on the brink that most strongly suggests itself is compulsion. Powerful needs and inhibi- tions constrain thought less than action. After all, there is little sign in these cases that the hesitation is free. The more often John reiterates his original intention to act for the best and then fails, the stronger the presumption that he can't help himself. The more clearly he judges the act's importance to being overriding, the less his several failures to carry it out look like choices. And of course the problem of understanding why a person doesn't do as he really thinks best vanishes if it is something he just can't do. The second interpretation, then, is: (B) So long as John can't get himself to pierce his finger, however important he realizes it is to him to do so, his balking is something he cannot help. He is indeed psychologically unable to draw his own blood. Against this, it could be argued that the motivational inef f icacy of his better judgment does not make John's refusal to drive in the pin a compulsive inhibition, because John has more ways than deliberation to motivate himself to make the right choice (Ibid., ch. 2). He could concen- trate on the prospect of gains from completing the assignment and try to blot from sight and mind the lance-jab. It is open to him to do this much, and since it could change his motivational balance of power, he is not unfree when he does refuse to press home the needle. There are two weaknesses in this position. (1) His undoubted freedom to engage in psychological self-manipulation does not render free his refusal to pierce himself if the manipulation fails. (In practice this question can never be quite closed, since the next try might always bring success, but, again, the more tries that fail, the more the evidence leans the other way.) (2) However, if he succeeds in coaxing himself over the brink by re-representation of what he is doing, what he then does is not, to him at that moment, quite the same action as the one he failed to carry through. Now he presents his act to himself exclusively as a face-saving with peers or as an early finish or a surprise for the contemptuous biology Professor, but not as a finger-lancing or blood-drawing. And he acts in accord with the reasons he has under his new description or aspect. The case collapses into (A). The whole rationale for repackaging the options is that only by changing the terms of the choice subjectively can one make the choice ordained by previous deliberation. Odysseus denied his sailors the sound of the Sirens' song because had they heard it they could not have passed the rock by. That they could obey the order to row on in their unhearing state hardly implies that had their ears been clear and they turned for the rock, they would have turned freely.</page><page sequence="8">80 David Pugmire A tempting alternative to (A) and (B) as an explanation of squeamish- ness and 'perverse' freezing is to say that the agent's emotion is irrational: John is disabled by a wave of fear (or some such negative affect) that doesn't reflect his actual appraisal of his situation, i.e. his values.4 And this might in turn result from what is and is not salient to him about his situation (which aspects of it emerge to him as figure and which as ground). The temptation should be resisted. That one reacts at the brink of action with forceful aversive feeling does not itself ensure that a coun- tervailing appraisal will not prevail. People can force themselves to act against their occurrent feelings. Passion, not just judgment, can be grimly flouted. Sometimes bitter medicines are swallowed, humiliations borne, disgusts endured, all undiminished. By themselves, then, degree and quality of feeling do not suffice to explain waywardness of action. The fact that powerful feeling lies behind a choice does not alone explain how it secures overbearing motivational force, since other factors some- times prevail against it motivationally . It begs the question of how strict akrasia is possible. On the other hand, the motivational efficacy of one's immediate feelings towards a prospect will be more assured if the feeling accords with, because it expresses, the worth one in fact puts on this prospect. Then it is unchallenged by the motivational force of contrary valuation. Mistakes about what one values most are possible (often because of ignorance and wishful thinking). They offer a non-question- begging way of understanding how strong feeling can indeed prevail: when it prevails against a judgment one wrongly thought (and perhaps wished) one held and reveals the judgment one really holds. In other words, (A). IV So far, I have tried to show that the sort of example that is supposed to support the possibility of strict akrasia via representational biasing is open to other, equally plausible interpretations. However, there remains a less ad hominem issue of principle. Strict akrasia is supposed to be explained by a mismatch of adjudged priorities and motivational strength. The distorting increment of motivational strength is explained 4 On the distinction and separability of judgment and emotional feelings see espe- cially S. Leighton, 'Feelings and Emotion/ Review of Metaphysics 38 (1984) 303-20; and M. Stacker, Tsychic Feelings: Their Importance and Irreducibility/ Australasian Journal of Philosophy 61 (1983) 5-26.</page><page sequence="9">Perverse Preference: Self-Beguilement or Self-Division? 81 in turn by the operation of influences that are independent of one's assignment of value. This means that self-mastery and the conquest of akrasia can result from harnessing these non-valuational influences and that akrasia of the strict sort results when their unharnessed weight tilts against better judgment. I assume that this account of the possibility and nature of strict akrasia entails the possibility of the former strategy as a remedy. So that if such a strategy could not effect a remedy, the account of strict akrasia from which it follows cannot be correct. For this reason I shall consider the most prominent of these extra-ra- tional pressures in its defensive deployment - self-beguilement by strategic re-representation of the options - and ask whether it could deflect otherwise incontinent choices. Attention to a feature of something can be either directed to it or captured andheldbyit.Buteven when the feature does the catching rather than the agent the casting, it is usually up to the agent whether he lets it rest on what has engaged it. So in both cases the play of attention and its potential effects are at the agent's disposal. Except where the attention-ar- resting feature has the power to obsess, selective focusing is either something I do or that I let happen. Either way there is a choice. Self-distraction is a conspiratorial undertaking. Now, I want to suggest that this undertaking could not explain how one could do what one knows better to do at the time and indeed that it is itself not so easy to explain. The strategy of manipulating the relative strengths of one's motives by redeploying one's attention can serve either of two purposes, to consolidate the grip of better judgment on choice or to loosen it. Start with the latter. Where indulgence in selective focusing is intended (or serves) to enhance the motives for doing what one at the time knows better than to do, there is the problem of its own motivation. For if it is needed in order to egg one into flouting one's better judgment then until it has succeeded, the motivational strength of better judgment must predominate over that of all standing contrary temptations. Unfortu- nately, however, the selective focusing with its (intended) function of self-beguilement, is itself a flouting of that better judgment, since to know better than to do something is to know better than knowingly to do anything liable, let alone intended, to achieve it. (This is the trouble with Mele's attempt to deal with the aforementioned problem [see his Irrationality, ch. 5].) And the flouting of one's own prevailing better judgment is what it is meant to achieve. So at the point when beguile- ment is to be attempted, the motivational force that it is supposed to divert to the cause of temptation is the motivational force it needs to get started but that is lacking at that point. If it is possible, it isn't needed; if needed, it is impossible. The man who is resolved not to have that last drink (which would take him over the limit) before hitting the road is not in a position to make himself break his resolution by blotting out</page><page sequence="10">82 David Pugmire images of having an accident or being breath-tested and instead imag- ining the astringent sweet taste of the next Tequila Sunrise and the increasingly uninhibited conversation he is beginning to enjoy. For if this focusing were free and intentional, it and its purpose would be recognized, but at that moment, with its work as yet undone, he remains overwhelmingly disposed to keep his resolution to abstain and hence not to subvert it. As something one does and does in the teeth of one's recognized best interest, stoking an appetite by selectively attending to it is itself an incontinent act and so cannot explain incontinent action. A similar problem would face the attempt to mobilize attention in support of an unconditional judgment menaced by contrary temptation of superior motivational force. The very willingness to try self-persuasion should be precluded by the predominant reigning motivational force of the temptation. To straighten myself out, I have to be straightened out. It could be objected that the attempt to carry out a project of self beguilement is not the same choice and act as the act it is to support, so that the overpowering temptation not to engage in the act it is to support is not the temptation to refrain from attempting beguilement and needn't inhibit it. Since setting my imagination to work isn't the same as doing the deed to which this might lead me, it does not meet the same resistance that doing the deed would elicit. The only direct inhibitions to the focusing project would be imperatives ancillary to the temptation and protective of it of the form 'don't rock the boat.' And these prohibi- tions may lack the full urgency of the parent temptation itself. They could motivate more weakly than the better judgment even though it moti- vates more weakly than the temptation. After all, the movement of attention is only something that might cause trouble; it isn't trouble (cf . Mele's Irrationality, ch. 5). It is true that to attend selectively so as to get myself to follow my better judgment is a different and easier act than actually to follow better judgment against the drag of temptation. Because focusing isn't itself the rival of what I am most tempted to do, the temptation won't mobilize the same resistance that it would against a direct rival. However, only qua deployment of attention as such, will it evade the defensive prohi- bition commensurate in force with the force of the temptation. Yet the attending here is not idle; it is to a purpose. It is done in order that one shall not do what one is most compellingly motivated to do and at the time still intends to do. Since the intention to dissuade oneself from A is not the intention not to do A, there seems no outright contradiction between intending A and intending to prevent A. On second glance, however, contradiction does emerge. Schematically: to intend to A is to intend to do what will bring about my A-ing (including what will permit me to A). The intention that</page><page sequence="11">Perverse Preference: Self-Beguilement or Self-Division? 83 I shall not A would prevent me from (intentionally) A-ing. The intention to bring it about that I will not intend A is something that would not bring about my A-ing but prevent it. So intending now to A entails not intending now to take this measure that would bring about the intention not to A. Of course, when confronted with what I must do by way of A-ing I might draw back and refuse, but this would mean withdrawing from the intention to A, which might persist as the wish that A could be accomplished somehow. (It is hard to see how I could intend to A but not intend to do what doing A was the doing of.) Again, I may be subject to conflicting desires and emotions of different kinds and levels (carnal, prudential, moral, etc.), which could urge me towards counter-afcrafa'c measures. However, for an act to be akratic presupposes that whatever the background of enduring ambivalence, some one desire has the dominant motivational force and some contrary valuation has com- manded assent. My ambivalences may subject me to conflicting im- pulses, but for the moment, my intention (and my judgment) is decided. It is, of course, possible to intend to change one's intentions to A without intending not to A (or intending that one shall not A). Whether A is done might not be the point (for instance, my motives for intending A might be unacceptable). In the struggle against akrasia, however, preventing the action is the point; the agent tries selective focusing so that he will not A (e.g., continue to malinger). Suppose it is possible to focus selectively so as to change or thwart the intention to A. If the aim of the focusing is appreciated and its success expected, control of atten- tion should get preempted in favor of temptation, with its currently commanding motivational force. (And the less the expectation of suc- cess, the less the motive for the whole exercise.) This means that the only way attention could drum up support for a flagging better judgment is by focusing on the right things by accident, as when a person is suddenly struck by something he wasn't looking for in a situation, not by a motivated exercise in focusing. How does this work in practice? Here is an example (based on Mele's Irrationality, at 69): While taking a break from urgent work Ian gets glued to the T.V., which is showing a long and engrossing program. The thought that he is dallying unconscionably and that it is vital to go back to work without delay fails to root him out of his chair. Finally, he just orders himself to get moving and walks out, back to work. 5 For the difference in cases of ambivalence, between emotions and desires on the one hand and judgments on the other, see Jennifer Robinson, 'Emotion, Judgment, and Desire/ Journal ofPHilosophy 80 (1983) 731-41.</page><page sequence="12">84 David Pugmire According to the argument developed above, this effort at post-delib- erative self-control (the self-command) should be precluded by the reigning desire to watch T. V., which it is intended to subvert? Why isn't it? Mele says the desire to watch T. V. is directly opposed to the desire to work but not to the desire to issue a self-injunction. Hence the desire to watch will tend more to undermine Ian's desire to work than the desire to command himself to work, which is a distinct desire (Ibid., 71-2). This can make the motivational force of the desire to work weaker than that of the desire to command a return to work. This proposal is hard to understand. Admittedly, issuing the com- mand is not the same act as switching off the T.V., so that the desire to perform it is not the same desire: as the desire to switch off and get to work, the force of which is diminished by the desire to keep watching. The trouble is that Ian's desire to issue the command is not to issue it just for the sake of commanding himself. That desire has itself to be motivated. And what does motivate it is clearly the desire to galvanize himself into action, i.e., to stop watching and get going. But if this latter desire is what explains the desire to utter the command then to weaken it must equally enfeeble the command to give the order. How could Ian's wish to command be stronger than his wish to do what the command is his way of achieving? The desire to order himself into action could derive additional force from factors other than the desire specifically to do the work he is neglecting. The desire to be self-disciplined rather than self-indulgent, his impatience with his weakness in this respect and his fear of his wife's contempt could all prompt him. But the desire these concerns will strengthen is the desire to get back to work, not the desire merely to order himself back. And they would strengthen the desire to order himself back just because they strengthened his desire to get back. Mele suggests a second strategy of self-control in the face of an unwelcome but dominant desire: the direct competition against a desire to order oneself to A would be the desire to refrain from making an attempt at self-control. Not attempting self-control is necessary to con- tinue watching; nonetheless, he can be absorbed by the watching and enjoy it without thinking of or enjoying not attempting self-control. So the desire not to attempt self-control may be weaker than the desire to continue watching. So the desire to impose self-control could be weaker than the desire to continue watching and yet stronger than the directly opposing desire to refrain from self-control. This would also allow him to focus on the gains from self-control to the exclusion of the cost (Ibid., 71-2). In the shadows of his inattention, Ian's desire to impose self-con- trol is free to slink into action. Thus Ian can enjoy the T.V. without a corresponding, and correspondingly intense, determination to prevent its disruption.</page><page sequence="13">Perverse Preference: Self-Beguilement or Self-Division? 85 This is all very well up to the point that an actual intention to try self-control is formed. The puzzle then is how Ian could decide to try out an act of self-control without realizing what its aim is and what it threatens, i.e. the termination of his present enjoyment. And because this enjoyment dominates the present, how could it fail to motivate a corre- spondingly energetic desire for protection? (Try snatching a dog's meal away from him.) Since the desire to continue his present enjoyment is his strongest desire at the time, his desire to prevent anything that he recognizes would terminate it must be more forceful than the desire to do something that he recognizes would terminate it. The relative weak- ness of Ian's desire to refrain from attempting self-control depends on his refraining from attempting it. It is, of course, correct that the act of enjoining oneself to get to work need not face a degree of resistance equal to the force of the desire to keep watching and hence comes more easily than would just walking out. But this greater ease of the utterance of the abstemious command is conditional on the utterance being only a gesture and not a rousing of oneself against one's fecklessness. That is, what would make the com- mand an act of self-control would be that it was meant and that it had its power to effect action, the action most weakly desired. An account of how uttering the command is possible is not an account of how the command can work or be issued to work. This is the real issue. Cases of freezing at the brink (to oneself: Tor God's sake, jumpl PleaseV) show that this is a real problem. Mele, though surprisingly brief on this question, suggests that the act of self-command may invoke a new force, the habit of obedience; and also that the utterances of the command may shift the focus of attention so as to tip the balance of motivational force in favor of a return to work. The force of habit certainly could be a resource of self-control, but it is not available to explain how someone who was chronically akratic (generally or in the kind of case at hand) and not in the habit of responding to self-injunctions could sometimes do so. And someone who is in the habit of obeying admonitions to himself will be either someone who is akratic only in cases too trivial to arouse serious resis- tance or someone who seldom experiences serious temptation. In the latter case, he has no habit of obeying directives not to succumb to serious temptation. The former type of case, in which it is better but not imperative to desist, is the only type for which this strategy could be expected to work.6 Anyway, in serious cases there remains a second 6 Naturally, a person who is generally self-disciplined and apt to heed sober self-in-</page><page sequence="14">86 David Pugmire avenue of explanation: the utterance jolts one into attending to what is at stake. The tendency to couple such injunctions with a reference to one's reasons is suggestive of this ('Don't let her down!' - and suddenly one imagines her dismayed or contemptuous look and then sees oneself through those eyes.) It is easy to see how one could be galvanized by releasing one's attention and redirecting it onto the sobering aspects of current conduct. It is not so easy to see how the utterance of a command-plus-warning could thus liberate attention in the midst of akratic action. Consider Ian's malingering. At the time he utters the command, Ian's desire to prolong his enjoyment of watching is stronger than his desire to act on his best reason and get to work. Uttering the command is not in direct competi- tion with this desire, but letting his mind wander onto the consequence of his present indulgence is in direct competition with it. It means ceasing to attend to and enjoy the program for the moment and ceasing to attend to and enjoy it in the realization that doing so risks - probably ensures - that his watching will be spoiled and terminated. But at the time this act has to be performed; the desire to watch, and so not to interrupt or terminate watching, has the greater force. Yet don't Rude Awakenings happen? And can't they lead people to get a grip on themselves? They do, and they can. But they are possible only where a thought occurs to the agent that can positively influence the force of the desire to act on his best reasons or negatively influence the force of the desire for the act that is inimical to them. This thought must be somehow additional to the thoughts responsible for the stand- ing strengths of the two desires. A new fact, a dawning realization, a fresh perspective on what was known already (perhaps, again, brought on by the experience of committing the akratic action). If there is nothing new about it, its causal powers are already reflected in the current distribution of motivational force between the two desires, and its recurrence cannot break the spell cast by the object of the renegade desire. Only the unanticipated can bring fresh causal powers to bear. But junctions may occasionally meet serious temptation and even succumb to it. Doubt- less his disposition to respond to self-remonstration could rescue him from such slippages, but how often it would is uncertain: someone with the habit of obedience to self-injunctions will usually not be incontinent, for he will presumably tend to back his better judgment, when necessary, by these injunctions that he habitually obeys. That he should be capable of incontinence at all (where even self-injunction fails - 'You idiotl What are you doing? Get a grip on yourself!') suggests that where desire can bring off mutiny against better judgment it may well succeed against self-injunction. The type of temptation that could seriously threaten him with akrasia is the type that may render all his normal resources unreliable.</page><page sequence="15">Perverse Preference: Self-Beguilement or Self-Division? 87 an unanticipated consideration which can give the power of resolution to the issuing of a self-command must constitute a genuine reason rather than a deliberate and transparent psychological artifice. However, this means that one has, in effect, reopened deliberation. I can only be brought up short by something I hadn't thought of before and that I really believe, and the effect of this is to make me think again. V The argument so far has been that the power of an akratic desire over what I do must include a power to subvert any serious attempt to weaken its hold on me. This argument has been presented solely in relation to the respective desires for the continent and incontinent acts themselves, i.e. lower level, first-order desires. Suppose we introduce desires of a higher level, second-order desires concerning my first-order desires. Then, although my desire to act incontinently is stronger than my desire to act continently, I can still want not to want the incontinent option more than I want the continent option. There is nothing contra- dictory (or even unfamiliar) about desiring that the balance of one's desires were the reverse of what it is. Now, perhaps this desire regarding the balance of my (first-order) desires could be incommensurable with the first-order incontinent desire itself, so that neither is stronger than the other. The incontinent desire could prevail over the continent desire without prevailing over the desire that it should not do this. Wouldn't that leave the second-order (continent) desire able to motivate one to try to strengthen the continent desire (e.g. by strategies of beguilement) at the expense of the incontinent desire, even while the latter was the stronger of the two?7 There seems little doubt that incommensurability of a desire with a contrary desire about it is possible. Akratic acts needn't be preferred with a clear conscience; self-contempt and regret at the time are common, and these qualms of the hangdog akrates about his act can plainly extend to his desire for such acts (Tf only I didn't need this'). However, the limit to the sway of a dominant first-order desire over the second-order desire that it should not dominate, itself has a limit. For what exactly is the motivational scope of an admonitory second-order desire? What is it sufficient to motivate? A desire to deflate (or dispel) 7 I am grateful to an anonymous referee of the Canadian Journal of Philosophy for raising this possibility.</page><page sequence="16">88 David Pugmire the primary desire can certainly result in a desire to do something to achieve this, for instance to engage in attentional manipulations. Decid- ing or trying to implement this desire, however, is another matter. What these measures are to achieve is my failure to indulge the incontinent desire. If I realize this (and how else could I intend it?), my attempt is brought into direct competition with my prevailing desire, which is to indulge the incontinent desire. The second-order desire remains incom- mensurable with the first-order desire only as directed at that desire. A desire to do a particular thing that would give effect to it, especially to undo what the first-order desire is the desire to do, is not incommensu- rable with the first-order desire.8 Thus the desire to deflate a desire could produce actual deflationary measures only where I was either oblivious to what these measures threatened or where I was somehow subject to a functional lesion such that I did not always do what my prevailing balance of desires made rational. Only some such hiatus in the motivational efficacy of a desire could give motivational purchase to a countervailing desire that was not downright stronger. Of course, my want to want the continent alternative more than the incontinent one might spontaneously redirect my attention, i.e. produce an aspectual shift directly rather than from an attempt to evoke such a shift in myself. I rue my craving for these chocolates and deplore sinking into this feeding-frenzy. While thus wincing at myself, all of a sudden I am struck with the image of the later Elvis Presley and of myself unrecognizable with obesity and plagued by its complications. I go cold on the chocolates. Psychic grace of this kind is not a matter of doing anything, e.g., of plying myself with these images, and does not amount to a strategy. It confronts me with something about my pigging-out on chocolate that I had not previously taken account of in its full poignance, nor, therefore, akratically flouted. This suggests a reason for skepticism about the very idea of a reversal of motivational balance as between first-order and second-order desires. Could the desire not to desire x (over y ) really be stronger than the desire to desire it if the desire to do x is stronger than the desire not to (to do y instead)? Well, what can motivate the rueful second-order desire in the 8 This is not to deny that there are steps I can take against my weaknesses. I might seek therapy in the hope of lessening my disposition to a given sort of renegade desire, or I might regulate my attention (or movements) so as to prevent the full awakening of this disposition. However, these are ways of avoiding the rise of a stronger renegade desire, not ways of resisting the strength of an aitrasw-inducing desire already awakened to the full.</page><page sequence="17">Perverse Preference: Self-Beguilement or Self-Division? 89 first place? Presumably the prospect of what the desire of x is the desire for (including what this precludes: y), i.e., the prospect of what is at stake. But the wages of x-ing are just what animated the decisive judgment in favor of y, which the desire to x anyway traduces. The delights of x-ing have already once carried the motivational day against the burden of reasons against x-ing. Why should they not do so again? If x is closest to my heart, how can my favorite desire fail to be the desire for it? Unless the look of the options has undergone a shift (as above) it is hard to see how a genuine split between what I most want at t and what I most want to want at t could occur. The impression that it does occur may well trace to the confusion of one's recognition that preferring y to x would be for the best with my actually preferring y to x (see section III, above). (Perhaps this is what is revealed in Augustine's notorious formula, 'Let me be chaste, but not yet.') VI So far, no satisfactory answer has been found to the crucial question as to how the relative strengths of one's desires can fail to accord with one's perceptions of one's best interests. Perhaps additional psychological principles need to be recognized. The closer a desire is to being gratified, the stronger grows the desire for it. Of course, the proximity of gratifi- cation does not alone ensure that the desire will prevail against all odds. However, the akratic prevalence of a desire might be explained by the proximity of its gratification where that combined with elements of the attentional strategy. Mele suggests that many strict akratic actions are adequately explained in terms of: (1) the perceived probity of the rewards of the incontinent alternative; (2) the agent's level of moti- vation to perform the akratic alternative; (3) the agent's failure to make an effective attempt at self-control; and (4) the agent's attentional condition. (Irrationality, 92) In minor cases of strict akrasia, where the balance of motivation in favor of the continent option is marginal or where nothing very much is at stake ('Strictly speaking I shouldn't, but what does it matter?'), this modified proximity analysis is plausible. Resigned to my weakness, I wolf the chocolate bar. (Presumably, experimental psychology tends to be confined to the study of minor types of case). But consider a weakness to which I would be dismayed to resign myself (e.g. incest, betrayal of a friend). It is hard to see how the modified proximity approach could explain major strict akrasia. The reason is this. The selective focusing (#4) that would enhance a desire's power to tempt cannot already draw on that enhanced power.</page><page sequence="18">90 David Pugmire Hence this enhanced power of temptation is not available to prevent the exercise of self-control aimed specifically at blocking selective focus on the charms in prospect. This would leave the degree of one's motivation to act continently both undiminished and free itself to secure selective attention in its favor and forestall the process Mele envisages.9 Naturally, akrasia might still occur, but if it did a shift of motivational balance produced by preoccupation with the seductions of the akratic alternative could not explain how. VII Donald Davidson has argued that the possibility of strict akrasia requires that the renegade desire actually operate in functional isolation from the agent's better judgment: the mind is to be regarded as having two or more semi-autonomous structures. This feature we found to be necessary to account for mental causes that are not reasons for the mental states they cause. Only by partitioning the mind does it seem possible to explain how a thought or impulse can cause another to which it bears no rational relation.10 9 Mele himself accords motivational force to final judgments about what it is best to do: insofar as they issue from deliberation they are motivated by the wish to do what is best, and they will tend to produce the intention so to act in the absence of 'preemptive conditions' (A.R. Mele, 'Akratic Action and the Practical Role of Better Judgment/ Pacific Philosophical Quarterly 72 [1991] 33-47, at 44). Surely the default motivational force of a final judgment must be yet stronger. The full force of the wish to do what is best is not mobilized just by the acceptance that A is for the best but by full insight into what and how it is for the best. This judgment results from appreciating the precise ways in which one's interests would be affected by the actions at hand, as contrasted with just accepting that they would be affected for the best, e.g., on the say-so of a trusted mentor or oracle or received moral precept. Barring schizoid detachment from the person's own perceived interests, this should mobilize desire for the protection of these interests. Naturally the force of this desire could be diminished if 'preemptive conditions' already existed (e.g. in the shape of renegade desires); but their remission at that stage could only be to subvert the deliberation (e.g. its honesty or thoroughness) and allow at best what Davidson terms an 'all things considered' judgment to be struck, rather than the unconditional judgment traduced in the 'strict' akrasia under discussion. This is not, of course, to imply that the default motivation of a final judgment will inevitably issue in the continent intention. The resources of strict akrasia may not (perhaps cannot) be restricted to the mere presence of renegade desires. 10 Donald Davidson, 'Paradoxes of Irrationality,' in R. Wollheim and J. Hopkins, Philosophical Essays on Freud (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1982), 289- 305, at 303</page><page sequence="19">Perverse Preference: Self-Beguilement or Self-Division? 91 Some philosophers look to the idea of disproportionate motivational strength as a substitute for partitioning in account for akrasia: l?y distin- guishing between the motivational strength possessed by a given desire and its evaluative standing, we can account for a broad range of irra- tional actions without resorting to mental division.'11 In light of the foregoing discussion, this confidence would seem misplaced. The undue say of the 'wrong' desire is itself part of what a theory of irrationality must explain. Since it does not account for irrationality, it cannot account for it better than partitioning can. But let us view this dispute more closely. The first question is whether the idea of functionally semi-autono- mous subsystems has genuine explanatory power and the second is whether a desire-valuation imbalance has the advantage over functional segregation in this respect. Mele (Irrationality, 82-3) suggests that the cognitive measures 'taken' by a subsystem to enact a strategy are not needed to explain how the better judgment (Pears's 'cautionary belief')12 fails to elicit the appropriate action. For the cognitive deployments sufficient for that - selective focusing, etc. - just occur as spontaneous reactions to the need for them, which is created by the threat better judgment poses to a desired option. 'The more we want to do something, the more we tend to think about it, to entertain pleasant images of our doing and so on' (Irrationality, 83). Anthropomorphic language hides the redundancy of the partitioning. Does partitioning lack a genuine explanatory role? Let us grant that desires do bias how we envisage the alternatives in prospect, that their power thus to excite our anticipations is proportional to the strength of the desires and that this is non-intentional, a kind of automatic response rather than a stratagem or device. The trouble is that this actually leaves unexplained what partitioning was introduced to explain, viz. how the considerations behind the best judgment should themselves fail auto- matically to evoke their own admonishing thoughts and images. If the agent's mind is equally open to all thoughts about the options confront- ing it, why don't the factors it holds most weighty win the beauty contest? To be sure, the force or motivational strength of a desire can be disproportionate to the value its host assigns to satisfying it. But this merely relocates the problem without solving it. Certainly a particular desire (or kind of desire) may be infused with a special intensity by its 11 J. Heil, 'Minds Divided/ Mind 98 (1989) 571-83, at 581 12 D. Pears, Motivated Irrationality (Oxford: Oxford University Press 1984), 69</page><page sequence="20">92 David Pugmire host's personal history, psychological makeup, culture, or other circum- stances. However, unusual intensity does not make it renegade; because of its origins, its satisfaction may be of special moment for that person and so enter the deliberative equation on the side of the values rather than of bare impulses. But if the latter and the desire is indeed renegade, then the values at stake which are held to override it (and which may have their own special history) must be, on consideration, correspond- ingly formidable. Where one set of considerations really does seem, all things consid- ered, to take precedence, how can the agent's desire to be guided by these fail to be overbearing and hence to gain a more potent hold on his or her anticipatory imaginings? The victories that renegade desires win cannot actually be explained by the power of desire to bias one's picture of the options in their favor. For in open confrontation with a soberly inspired competitor, the representational biasing in its favor must both explain its power to prevail and be explained by its power to prevail. It must have this power antecedently to win control of the anticipatory imagi- nation. Yet that control, and the consequent stoking of the desire is needed to give it superior force over the rationally sanctioned desire. If it is strong enough to gather to itself the resources of biased repre- sentation, it doesn't need these resources in the first place. It is the phenomenon of biasing that drops out of the explanatory picture as redundant!13 Unless desires can get out of proportion to reasons, irrational choice of action is impossible; and so long as the mind is equally open to all the reasons, no such disproportion can arise. The occurrence of strict akrasia, then, requires a mind that is somehow not completely transparent, a mind in which some desires are inacces- sible to some of the reasons relevant to them. This must mean partition- 13 The case of Ian's malingering is instructive. We have seen that the desire to refrain from attempting self-control can only be weaker than the desire to go on indulging if no attempt at self-control is in the offing. This is because an attempt at self-control is an attempt that involves terminating what Ian most desires, and he can be indifferent to that only to the extent that he is indifferent to prolonging his indul- gence (which he isn't). There is one way around this. An intention to try self-control could fail to elicit re-enforcement of the desire to block self-control if Ian did not recognize the intended self-control as a threat to his continued watching. The relation between the intended act of self-control and his enjoyment would have to be opaque to him. As if the self-control were being undertaken by someone else who could conceal it. This would permit strategic focusing in the service of self-con- trol, but it amounts to partitioning. The attentional strategy is only possible on the basis of partitioning.</page><page sequence="21">Perverse Preference: Self-Beguilement or Self-Division? 93 ing of some sort. But where? An akratic is perfectly rational relative to the desire that motivates it, viz., the desire based on one's lesser reason. The act is the satisfaction of that desire. What is irrational is that this desire for the perceived lesser good should be my prevailing desire and dominant motive. It could not attain to this if my unreserved judgment about what is best done had a causal sway over my desires proportional to the reason it gives me for acting in the indicated way. In strict akrasia the weightier reason it gives is recognized all along but vexingly and strangely lacks the power it normally has to mobilize my desires accord- ingly. One's reasons are not the causes they ought to be. The judgment is functionally segregated as a mental cause. This is necessary to allow one's desire to be a sufficient cause of what one does without being a sufficient reason for it. Reference merely to the relative strength of desire is vacuous as an explanation of its prevalence. And recourse to strategies of self-biasing, be they spontaneous or deliberate, do not fill this explana- tory gap where a person has decisive reasons for not seeking what this biasing aims at, i.e. for preventing his mind from turning into the Devil's workshop. An alternative to partitioning might be sought in the idea of incom- mensurability, this time of the first-order desires. That is, the value embodied in the action which the akrates takes has a special hold on him for which the competing good could not compensate him despite its greater over-all importance to him.14 Or perhaps to judge a reason to be the best and to choose to act on a reason are not the same: in deciding what to act on, the principle 'What is most desirable is to be done' needn't be observed and is not by the akrates.15 Perhaps one of these is what happens. Even so, the old problem remains: How can it happen? How could the sway of a special charm prevail over that of the akrates1 s perceived larger interests once the two have been clearly appreciated against one another? How could the akrates' s grasp on what is most desirable fail to become his reason for acting if he is fully mindful of it as he acts? What suspends the integrating principle that the most desir- able is to be done? An answer might have been sought in the incommensurability of first- and second-order wants, but that was a false dawn. The protected motivational remission of a second-order desire does not extend to 14 David Wiggins, 'Weakness of Will, Commensurability and the Objects of Delibera- tion and Desire/ in A.O.

Recall that this problem failed to arise only where the akrates was either unaware of what he intended by his attentional maneuvers or if his mind was functionally segregated to the extent that the reason his dominant akratic intention gives him to desist from attempting self-control is inadequate to cause him to do so. Yet this is what the Partitioners propose.16 If incommensurability (of either kind) has a role to in explaining the possibility of strict akrasia it is not a role that is independent of partition- ing. A full vindication (or even account) of the concept of mental partition- ing is beyond the scope of this paper. The burden of the present discus- sion - negative but not uninstructive - is merely that the attentional approach, which has been offered both as a viable alternative to parti- tioning and as a basis for strategies of self-control in the face of overbear- ing renegade desires, is neither.
