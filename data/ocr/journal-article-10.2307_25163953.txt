London: Royal College of Music, 2007. xii + 224 pp. Illus. ISBN 0-946119-08-2 (paperback). Price: ?35 With this publication the Royal College of Music essentially completes a recent set of catalogues of its renowned collection of historical European instruments. It is preceded by volumes covering the collection's wind instruments (in 1982, with an addenda in 1998) and keyboard instruments (in 2000). A fourth volume addressing the collection's bows for European string instruments has recently been produced in electronic form at http.7/www. cph.rcm.ac.uk/GenCatalogues.htm Overall, this is a handsome-looking book with a large, clean, and well-organized format. A very generous number of photographs of the instruments are included, to which are added a few other relevant images showing performers, patent drawings, and pages from period publications. Forty-eight color photos (spread across sixteen pages) are presented at the beginning of the book, the remaining ones in black and white. Many of the most important instruments are treated with views showing them from the front, back, and sides, often supplemented by close-ups showing decorative or structural details. Where available, photographs of the instruments' interiors are included, along with a number of X-ray images that help reveal bracing patterns and other hidden features. The text of each entry is divided into sections that provide inscriptions on the instrument, its overall dimensions, a description of its materials and construction, commentary that helps explain alterations and useful context about the instrument's history, its provenance, and any references where the instrument has previously been discussed in print. In the introductory section the authors outline the conventions used in their cataloging, along with a glossary of terminology. Indexes at the close of the book list RCM numbers, as well as the names of makers, dealers, repairers, previous owners, institutions, collections, and places of manufacture. Near the beginning of each entry is one further heading called brief description. This rather superfluous section is aimed at providing a succinct depiction of each instrument, but in so many instances the material presented here could have more logically been incorporated (perhaps parenthetically) into the header material at the top of the page. In numerous other instances it simply repeats information that is already patently clear from reading the header. For example, on page 78 we encounter a header that reads 'Neapolitan Mandolin / Domenico Vinaccia, Naples, 1780/ and a brief description that reads 'Neapolitan mandolin with four double courses of wire.' The only new information here is the four double courses, which is self-evident from the adjacent photograph. (It should be noted that in this period the top course of strings on Neapolitan mandolins was actually gut, not wire, as indicated by Corrette in 1772, as well as other sources.) Another questionable practice I would point out is the casual use of terms like 'Renaissance guitar' and 'Baroque guitar' under this same heading (on pages 102, 106, 108, 112, and 118), implying that these are meaningful or well defined species of instruments, which they certainly are not. Creating a cohesive and well-written catalogue of museum artifacts is far more challenging than one might realize. There are countless decisions to be made, and not always good models or precedents upon which to base those decisions. Among the most difficult choices are those regarding terminology, and it seems unlikely that the field of organology will ever come to complete consensus in this area, even in a single language such as English (I myself have chronically struggled with this issue in over twenty years of trying to catalogue a major instrument collection in Boston). We of course have the New Grove dictionaries as a useful starting point, but the labelled diagrams of instruments that they contain do not always provide a necessary level of detail, nor do they cover some of the more unusual species one often encounters. Consistency is the key, and this catalogue's authors seem to have at least achieved that goal. I would, however, question a few choices here. Whereas I suppose it is logical to refer to the front of lutes, guitars, violins, and viols as the 'front' (especially when the back is called the back), this certainly departs from typical terminology in the field, where this component is frequently called the belly. It is often referred to by other terms as well, such as soundboard and table, but almost never</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 349 the front. If consistency was the key here, then why not call the sides the sides, rather than the ribs? Belly, back, ribs, and neck are all anthropomorphic designations, and thus work well together. Among the other conventions that struck me as slightly odd is the liberal use of question marks (both in the headings and in the descriptive texts) to signify some level of uncertainty about makers, places, dates, and materials. There are bound to be a great deal of questions like this in such a catalogue, but I think that at least in the header this sort of problem might have been better handled with the use of qualifiers such as 'probably' and 'possibly,' which provide the reader with a clearer sense of what is being conveyed. I likewise find the use of a question mark immediately preceding the word in question to be very awkward typographically. Despite the liberal inclusion of photographs, the clarity of the images is often rather poor, especially as compared with those in the Royal College of Music's previous catalogue of keyboard instruments. The introduction states that the photographs 'were taken over many years' and by at least five different people. This variation definitely shows, and in the worst of the photos, such as those on page 79 of two late nineteenth-century mandolins, the results are downright murky. Monetary inflation notwithstanding, a picture is still worth a thousand words, and in this day of very good and accessible digital photography it is a pity that more attention and consistency could not have been lavished in this area, though it is likely that monetary factors were at play, as is often the case with museum catalogues. All in all, this is still a very good and useful publication that suffers primarily from some roughness around the edges. One gets the sense that had the authors and publisher been allowed a bit more time to work through certain decisions, a more satisfying result might have been achieved. And speaking of the digital age, the debate continues about whether museums should continue to publish printed catalogues of their holdings or begin to put more of their efforts into computer databases that can readily be made available to the public online. It will be interesting to observe which way things move in the coming years, but for now I know there are many in our field who still greatly value flipping through the pages of a nice book like this one from the Royal College of Music.
