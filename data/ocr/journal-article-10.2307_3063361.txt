<plain_text><page sequence="1">account of the 'aspects litteraires', with particular attention paid to structural techniques in narrative, to the characterisation of the leading Romans (Manlius Vulso, Fulvius Nobilior, Scipio Africanus), and to the several speeches in the book. The 'Notes Complementaires', which cover over a hundred pages of small print, offer detailed guidance on the historical problems, and signal many of the difficulties germane to the history of the text. The editing of the text is less satisfactory; greater concentration on the historical aspects has resulted in less attention to textual niceties. A. has based his editorial approach on that of A. H. MacDonald in the O.C.T. of Books 31-5 (see now also J. Briscoe, BRL 62 [1980], 311), and though considerable problems still remain to be solved in determining the transmission of the manuscripts, the principles on which text and apparatus criticus are based here are acceptable and clear as an intermediate solution. But unfortunately citations of manuscript readings are not invariably accurate or sufficiently detailed. The most important MS, the Bambergensis, is preserved in this book up to 46.4; there are about 50 inaccuracies or significant omissions in the apparatus criticus. Of the three MSS descended from i, the vetus Carnotensis, I have checked the readings of P, and there is a larger number of errors or omissions in citation of this MS than in that of B. The q branch becomes particularly important after 46.4, when we no longer have B; there are striking variations in P especially in word-order which go unreported here. Finally there is omission of significant variants from the lost codex Moguntinus as preserved by Carbach and Gelenius. The text requires correction at 6.7 (comma for full stop), 7.2 (maritimae), 13.11 (quae for qua), 20.4 (circumuectus for circumuentus), 40.7 (uiam for uiarum), 40.11 (primum omitted), 42.8 (decreuit for decreuerunt), 43.6 (words run together), 48.6 (haec omitted), 52.10 (appellet for appellat). At 20.7, 48.16, 51.12 A. prefers ascendere to escendere, but in earlier books escendere is better supported in the older MSS, and is well attested here at 48.16 and 51.12; moreover A. himself prints escendit at 22.1. At 41.13, where A. prefers a tergo against ab tergo in the two MSS which I have checked, the evidence of Packard's Concordance (a hundred examples of ab tergo) tells strongly against him. For Fuluii at 43.1, see Ogilvie's n. in the O.C.T. Livy 12, xvii, which would support Fului. A. prints also retuli (42.8, 51.1) in preference to the more conventional form. Minor corrections and suggestions: 1.9 &lt;regem&gt; restituerent in, claimed by A. as his own emendation, was anticipated by H. J. Mfiller. 14.1: Waddington's Casanem deserves mention. 15.2: C. Miiller's Cabalitis is supported by L. Robert (RP 1939, 180f.) and should be cited. 23.1: Walter (RhM 1939, 37f.) proposed prolap(si eli&gt;si aut debilitati. 38.4: The emendation of Holleaux, ab Halye, is rejected by A. in his Introduction but should none the less have appeared in the apparatus criticus. In the list of corrections to Weissenborn-Miiller's apparatus criticus, the correction at 25.1 is inaccurate, and that at 48.14 is contradicted by A.'s own apparatus criticus; and for 49.5 read 50.1. Since there is as yet no modem critical edition of this pentad, it will be obvious that this is to some extent a pioneering attempt; it will serve as a useful ancillary in the preparation of a more thorough edition, but its own strength lies primarily in its useful historical annotations. University of Glasgow P. G. WA L S H IVANO DIONIGI: Lucio Anneo Seneca, De otio (dial. VIII). Testo e apparato critico con introduzione, versione e commento. (Testi Classici, 8.) Pp. 286. Brescia: Paideia, 1983. Paper. This lively and informative work is a notable addition to the growing number of commentaries on Seneca. After a preface and bibliography, a long introduction (pp. 29-130) discusses first the manuscript tradition, and the original extent of the now truncated De otio; then the date of composition; the addressee; structure; Seneca's view of otium compared with earlier views; sources (Dionigi is suitably cautious about detecting direct dependence on any particular earlier works); autobiographical elements; language and style (an excellent short treatment); and finally the influence of the De otio. The text has an apparatus criticus and facing Italian translation. The commentary (pp. 161-278) deals very fully with all facets of the work, marshalling much detail without losing sight of Seneca himself. Indices of Latin and Greek words give ready access to the splendid treatments of Seneca's diction and philosophical terminology - a pity there is no index nominum or detailed general index to increase further the accessibility of this useful work. 14-2 393 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW</page><page sequence="2">The De otio poses problems, and D. does not shrink from controversy. Two of his views deserve special mention. First, he maintains that the ending of the De otio, as we have it, is complete. He successfully shows that the most commonly used arguments do not suffice to prove otherwise, and he urges that the train of thought at the end of the dialogue as it survives today is coherent and satisfying. But D. dodges vital stylistic considerations: the final sentence of ch. 8 tails off lamely in an unemphatic concessive clause - one misses the characteristic Senecan epigram or rhetorical flourish; also the rhythm is against completeness, being not just a double trochee (which D. notes as rare in his commentary) but a triple trochee, paralleled at the conclusion of a work only at Ep. 31, where an epigram justifies it. (One may also note that the Letters display greater rhythmical freedom at their conclusions than do the longer works.) However, more is at issue, besides the incompleteness of De otio's ending. Does ch. 8, which argues that otium is necessary for everybody, give Seneca's own view, as D. believes, or did he go on to reject that view in the lost part of the dialogue, as Miriam Griffin has argued? It depends how much self-consistency we expect from Seneca, and I think D. shows how Seneca could have endorsed the views of ch. 8. Secondly, D. is keen on spotting personal allusions in De otio, and he is confident about its date, A.D. 62, just before or just after Seneca's retirement from court. But not everybody will accept, e.g., that 1.4 quid agis, Seneca? deseris partes? must refer to Seneca's own withdrawal from politics (or, indeed, to withdrawal from politics at all), or that 2.2 must express his feelings about his own old age. Even if one did agree, one could blame D. for being misleadingly selective with his evidence: take the preface of nat. 3, certainly written not long after Seneca's retirement, where he expresses despair over his wasted life (cf. s. 2 annos inter uana studia consumptos... damna aetatis male exemptae) - how does that square with the more positive evaluation of his own career that D. detects in De otio 2.2? The ultra-autobiographical approach must account for everything. On a couple of matters D. has changed his mind between writing the commentary and the introduction. Whereas the commentary takes it for granted that Serenus is the addressee, the introduction reasonably takes a more sceptical line. The introduction is clear that MS C is just a meretricious descendant of A, but the apparatus cites C too often for comfort, and the commentary occasionally treats C and PQ as independent (pp. 183, 257, 258). The text is conservative (retaining 1.4 eniti manu, 3.1 quam si quis, etc.). D. prints two conjectures of his own: 1.4 bene ac nauiter, for benegnauiter (bene et nauiter Muretus; but what does bene... transfugis mean? In D.'s parallels bene goes naturally with the verb); 2.2 ad alios actus animi (not much better than other attempts on this crux). A few small points: at 4.2 Theiler is surely right that mari ac terris inserta means everything in earth and sea, for the context requires a comprehensive expression, not a reference just to islands and lakes; at 4.2 again, even if sedes deorum is an Epicurean preoccupation, the rest of the sentence justifies sedes here, whereas the position and the anthropomorphism of sedens are awkward; at 5.2, when discussing cupido noscendi in the Lyceum, D. might have mentioned the start of the Metaphysics. When the above holes have been picked, this remains a substantial, scholarly, illuminating commentary. University of Edinburgh HARRY M. HINE G. W. CLARKE: The Letters of Saint Cyprian: Translated and Annotated. (Ancient Christian Writers, 43.) Pp. 379. New York, N.Y., Ramsey N.J.: Newman Press, 1984. ?18. Cyprian's letters are of interest to any student of Christian antiquity because they give a picture of the day-to-day administration of an important African see during the mid-third century, because Cyprian is a man of great interest in himself and particularly for Anglicans, for when the Anglican bishop in the nineteenth century found himself for the first time in situations where there was no Government to appeal to and no precedents to go by, it was to Cyprian's example that he usually turned. In spite of Cyprian's theological shortcomings, his limitless use of the Jewish Law to regulate Christian affairs, his assumption that God was subject to outbursts of bad temper, his deplorable eucharistic theology, his was no bad exemplar to follow. Dr G. W. Clarke, Professor of Classical Studies at the Australian National University, has given us a beautiful and wholly commendable translation of the first 27 of Cyprian's letters and intends to continue the work in several more volumes. The Introduction is useful and concise. The 394 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW</page></plain_text>
