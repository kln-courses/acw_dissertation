The history and trends of museums, and a remedy for their present stasis, in the establishment of branches, are also discussed briefly. S. C. GILFILLAN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS Where Darwin Erred. By CHARLES L. CLAYTON. Boston: Meador Pub- lishing Co., 1933. Pp. 206. $2.00. A genial, but feeble, presentation of the old anthropomorphic theme that a "Supreme Intelligence," or God, is at work in the universe, creating living be- ings according to a preconceived plan. The author assumes that this creation was not accomplished in six days some five thousand years ago, but is a continu- ous process. The main contention of Darwin is thus assumed, but God is put in the place of "natural selection." In fact, Darwin's theory of natural selection appears to be the burr that has stimulated the author to the present kinder- garten effort. Every educated reader knows that the mechanics of evolution have been under investigation by many competent biologists since Darwin, and that the final answers are not yet in. The names of scientists eminent in fields other than biology are brought in to bolster up the author's feeble arguments. We are informed that "Professor Compton recently announced the Heisenberg- Compton theory that an effective intelligence is behind the phenomena of nature" (p. 120). We are also regaled by the author's genealogical tree, traced back to Governor Bradford of the Plymouth colony. It is evident that the "Supreme Intelligence" nodded somewhere between Governor Bradford and Mr. Clayton, for how else can we account for such statements of alleged facts as the following: "The changed condition in the reproductive organs (at and dur- ing sexual maturity) ensues merely from the picture of the opposite sex in the mind of the individual" (p. 191)? A. J. CARLSON UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO Crime for Profit. Edited by ERNEST D. MACDOUGALL. Boston: Stratford Co., 1933. Pp. xx+355. $2.00. "This book is not the result of serious, scientific research in mercenary crime" (p. xiii). But a little of it is. The rest is a strange me1ange of muckraking and exposition of the problem as seen from the point of view of lawyer, educator, business man, theologian, and others. It is especially interesting to the student of crime as showing what various groups think about it. C. C. VAN VECHTEN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS The Cost of Living in the United States in 1931.
