<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICISM PROPHETIC HISTORY AND AGRIPPA D'AUBIGNE'S TRAGIQUES VIRGINIA CROSBY "History [was] God's gift to Israel,"' confirned by the covenant and by his saving acts. These events were actual for each generation, locking together the time of God and the time of man in a joint venture which could be realized at any moment. The Old Testament Hebrews thereby eliminated all barriers between the self and God, and brought both the natural world and history into the existential field. The role of the prophets, as the witnesses of God's word was not only to judge the present-to exhort, to threaten, or to console Israel in God's name-but above all to keep God's promise and his saving acts from slipping back into the past, from losing their viability and activating power. From the eighth to the sixth centuries, beginning with the threatening expansion of the Assyrian empire, Israel felt abandoned by God: His magnalia had come to a standstill. Israel's guilt and God's judgments had created an abyss between His people and the Exodus, the covenant with David, and the other saving events. History, according to the Hebraic sensibility, had therefore come to a stop. To get it started up again required "eschatological renewal."2 Using historical analogies, the prophets spoke of a new Covenant (Jeremiah xxxi:3lff.), a new Exodus (Isaiah xliii:16ff.), a new David (Isaiah xi:l), or a new Zion (Isaiah i:26) as part of a future that could break into the present at any moment. Isaiah called to the people to remember Abraham not by looking back, but by looking toward, or unto him, and brought the future into the present by announcing that God's salvation had already gone forth ("mon salut est venu en avant") (Isaiah ii:2, 5).3 Saturated as he was with Biblical material, capable of reading "tout courant les Rabins sans poincts,"4 Agrippa d'Aubign6 shared this Hebraic grasp of history. In the Tragiques, the poet-prophet uses the standard Calvinist procedure of identifying the Protestant elect with Israel's chosen people, and calls for a new Exodus: 1James Muilenberg, The Way of Israel: Biblical Faith and Ethics, Harper Torch- books (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1965), p. 44. 2Gerhard von Rad, Old Testament Theology, trans.

Le pillier du nuage a midi nous conduit, La colonne de feu nous quidera la nuict. (Fers, R. 521-28)5 In an oracle of promise that precedes the martyrology in Feux, d'Aubign6 makes God's salvation manifest and shows Zion reconquered by the perse- cuted: Voici marcher de rang par la porte dor6e, L'enseigne d'Israel dans le ciel arbor6e, Les vainqueurs de Sion, qui au prix de leur sang Portans Fescharpe blanche ont pris le caillou blanc: Ouvre, Jerusalem, tes magniflques portes; Le lion de Juda suivi de ses cohortes Veut regner, triompher et planter dedans toy L'estendart glorieux, l'auriflam de la foy. (11. 1-8) The New Covenant of the Gospel message, its promise of "joy and light- ness."6 is glimpsed intermittently throughout the suffering of the martyrs in Feux and in Jugement, the final canto. However, d'Aubign6's emphasis throughout the main body of the poem is on the promise of redemption held out by the Old Testament, rather than on the well-defined fulfillment offered by the New.7 This lack of precise detail regarding God's future action, which is necessary to the dramatic suspense of the poem, is also within the prophetic tradition. At the conclusion of Mis&amp;res, the poet-prophet questions God's inaction: Veux-tu long-temps laisser en cette terre ronde Regner ton ennemi? N'es-tu Seigneur du monde, Toy, Seigneur, qui abbas, qui blesses, qui gu6ris, Qui donnes vie et mort, qui tue et qui nourris?

Les fers sont mis au vent: venez sgavoir comment L'Etemel fait i poinct jugement; Vous sgaurez que tousjours son rire ne sommeille, Vous le verrez debout pour rendre la pareille, Partager sa verveine &amp; sa barre de fer, Aux uns arres du ciel, aux autres de renfer. (Fers, 11. 1555-64) In the Tragiques, the Huguenot poet's comparisons of himself with Old Testament figures are numerous: he sees himself as a new David, a liberating warrior, one of God's chosen, emerging as a charismatic leader at a time of mounting anxiety.8 Like the prophets, he too is preoccupied with social in- justice, dedicated to excoriating the sinful and to saving the elect through the power of the word. The Tragiques is an extended prophetic sermon, a series of oracular utterances incorporating diatribes, threats, historical and autobiographical material, satire, lyrical and epic passages, exhortations, and promises.9 D'Aubign's criticism of historical events is occasionally voiced as true prophecy, as in his prediction of the death of Henry IV (Prdface, 11. 319-30); even his "apopheties," as he calls them, are an imitation of the Biblical technique of vaticinia post eventum.l D'Aubigne's assumption of a vatic stance, however, is no mere convention. As defender of the Protestant faith and rescuer of the "captive Eglise" (Miseres, 1. 14), d'Aubign6's aim, like that of the prophets, is to materialize divine action, to expose its move- ment in time and the world, and thus set history in motion. His purpose is to shock, to stir and alarm consciences. Yet he also reveals, in the trials of 8in the PrEface, he fights, like David, his verses are stones (U. 157-62). See also, Princes (U. 45-48). He further states that the power of God has been laid on him to fight tyranny: "... le doigt du grand Dieu me pousse &amp; le combattre" (1. 42), and in La Chambre dore, he speaks with David's prophetic voice (U. 1006-09). 9Though the Tragiques are referred to as an epic, its diversity of genres and styles could more appropiately be subsumed under the term "prophetic sermon; this designa- tion also underscores the purpose of the poem. 1For d'Aubign6s discssion of this technique, see his Aux lecteurs, I, 11.

D'Aubign6 seeks to enlarge faith by showing the chosen that history is with them, that God has not drawn away, but rather He lets Himself be perceived through His activity. As the inter- preter of God's redemptive work, d'Aubign6's prophetic discourse sweeps away any false security, yet keeps war, suffering, and defeat from obliterating all hope of covenant fulfillment. The poet-prophet preaches and speaks forth the word of God, creatively reshaping nature and events according to a vouchsafed revelation of God's will and His judgment of man. In Miseres, the first of the seven cantos of the Tragiques, he plants himself squarely "la oit estoyent les feux des prophetes plus vieux" (1. 27); in other words, at the prophetic center of the universe where man's action and the divine purpose either coincide or collide. Like the Hebrew patriarchs, he stands in the place of divine signs that bring time together, that signify memory of the past, responsibility for the present, and the promise of the future. From there, as he says, "Je tends comme ie puis le cordeau de mes yeux" (1. 28). His vision is unlimited spatially as well as temporally, sweeping across continents and from heaven to earth. It brings everything, from the punishments of God throughout history to the final day of Judgment, into the immediate present and submits it to the glare of purposive history. D'Aubign6's manner of looking at the world, of judging, is covenant- based. His vision directs us to a dramatic man-God relationship in time, but time experienced qualitatively. To the Hebrew, time is a function of the acts it contains; thus, there is not one time, but many-as Ecclesiastes iii affirms. The Old Testament prophets have little or no concern for abstract time; its value is assessed in terms of the theological and ethical viability of the acts that compose the man-God encounter. D'Aubigne also considers time in terms of actions, in terms of whether or not they affirm or deny the historical program of the covenant between God and His people; whether they are directed toward life and God, or toward sin and death; whether they move history along or bring it to a halt. At one point in Feux, God is tempted to forget His covenant and to start over again from zero with His elect: I1 se repentit done d'avoir forme la terre. Tantost il prit au poing une masse de guerre, Une boete de peste et de famine un vent, I1 veut mesler la mer et I'air en un moment Pour faire encor un coup, en une arche reclose, L'eslection des siens; il pense, il se propose Son alliance saincte, il veut garder sa foy A ceux qui n'en ont point, . . 11 (11. 1397-1404) lThis is an echo of a passage of the covenant with Noah (Genesis viii:20-22). 78 FALL 1972</page><page sequence="5">PROPHETIC HISTORY AND D'AUBIGNES TRAGIQUES In La Chambre doree, a wrathful God reverses the natural order of created time, causing the universe to rock and reel: Dieu se leva en courroux et al travers des cieux Perca, passa son chef; t l'esclair de ses yeux Les cieux se sont fendus; tremblans, suans de crainte, Les hauts monts ont croulle: cette Majest6 saincte Paroissant fit trembler les simples elements, Et du monde esbranla les stables fondements. Le tonnerre grondant frappa cent fois la nue; Tout s'enfuit, tout s'estonne, et gemit A sa veue. (11. 139-46) D'Aubigne's Cod is the anthropomorphic God of Israel whose ear, eye, hand are ever-present. Not even Satan with all his wiles can escape His watchful power: "S'il fuit, le doigt de Dieu par tout le monde vole" (Fers, 1. 81). At the conclusions of Feux, however, a threatening divinity leaves the earth in a vision reminiscent of Ezekiel: Ici le haut tonnant sa voix grosse hors met, Et gresle et souffre et feu sur la terra transmet, Fait la charge sonner par l'airain du tonnerre, I1 a la mort, l'enfer soudoyez pour sa guerre. Mont6 dessus le dos des Cherubins mouvans, I1 vole droit, guinde sur les ailes des vents. Un temps, de son Eglise il soustint linnocence, Ne marchant qu'au secours et non a la vengeance; Ores aux deriers temps, et aux plus rudes jours, II marche t la vengeance et non plus au secours. (11. 1123-32) Whether d'Aubign6 actually shows God as physically present or as having turned his eyes away from the earth (Fers, 1. 1), he continues to stress the ceaseless activity of divine will and judgment. The poet's militancy does not rest on the quietude of Pauline grace and the polarity of man and God, but rather on the Hebraic attitude that views man's struggle and God's judgments historically, and as salvific activity. Henri Weber points out that "s'il apparat . . . que la vraie justice n'est pas de ce monde, le r6quisitoire de d'Aubign6 contre les puissants du jour appelle directement a la lutte sur cette terre; il est par la plus revolutionnaire que le [Traite des scandales] de Calvin ou l'on sent davantage une pieuse exhortation a la souffrance dans l'attente de la vie future."12 This is underlined in La Chambre doree: 2Henri Weber, 'invention potique chez Agrippa D'Aubigne," in Rene Fromilague, et al Six Conferences ([Paris]: College de France [Nogent-le-Rotrou], 1964), p. 10. 79</page><page sequence="6">Le bras de l'Etemel, aussi doux que robuste, Fait du mal au meschant &amp; fait du bien au juste, Et en terre ici bas exerce jugement En attendant le jour de peur &amp; tremblement. (I. 1051-54) The scene of this struggle is a "monde a 'envers" that corresponds to the vision of Tsaiah: Voici, l'Eterel s'en va rendre le pais vuide, &amp; l'espuiser: &amp; il reuersera le dessus d'icelui, &amp; dispersera ses habitans. Le pais a est6 profan6 par ses habitans . . . pource que ils ont transgress6 les loix, ils ont chang6 les statuts, &amp; ont enfraint 'alliance etemele. (Isaiah xxiv:1, 5-6) In d'Aubign6's covenant-based system, Nature, man, and God interact simul- taneously and dynamically as part of the historical process. Nature can be a refuge, but it is not envisioned as a force that marshals the universe, maintain- ing order and balance. In Ronsard's Discours des Misgres de ce temps, it is man's irrational thinking that distorts Nature; in the Tragiques it is the sinfulness of the self, of the personality in its relationship with God, that demoralizes the world. Linked to history, Nature reveals man's corruption, as the battle of Moncontour Quand Nature sans loy, folle, se desnature, Quand Nature mourant despouille sa figure, Quand les humains privez de tous autres moyens, Assiegez, ont mang6 leurs plus fidelles chiens. (MisŽres, 11. 485-88) D'Aubigne rarely observes the physical world in and for itself, isolated from the operative power of the divine, for both are either cooperating or struggling together in time. The supra-natural, the wholly other, penetrates even the most realistic passage, as in the description of a brutally massacred P6rigord family in Misgres (11. 372-427). This penetration, the dramatic shock of the encounter of man's deeds and God's judgment, is externalized. It explodes, as in the Bible, within an organic or biological context. D'Aubigne reveals this context in images of cleanliness or filth, fertility or sterility-the negative term being associated with sin, which according to the Old Testament is a destruction of man's psychic wholeness and a failing of his relationship with God. In Vengeances, for example, D'Aubign6 depicts God's judgment in waters that are made flesh and become "devorantes" (1. 300). Catherine de'Medici, in MisWres, is a "pestifere," unclean and in- fectuous from trafficking with the dead (11. 839, 902-16) and thus cut off from God, from life itself. For this image D'Aubigne draws on Numbers, where the warning is clear: 80 RMMLA BULLETIN FALL 1972</page><page sequence="7">PROPHETIC HISTORY AND D'AUBIGNE'S TRAGIQVJS Quiconque aura touch6 le corps mort de quelque personne qui sera morte, &amp; ne sera point purifi6, il a souill6 le pauillon de lEterel: dont telle personne sera retranchee d'Israel: ... (Numbers xix:13) Europe, in La Chambre dor6e, is a woman whose face is dirtied, blackened by the smoke from fires that have burned the innocent victims of Catholic hatred (11. 613-14); Israel, so Amos proclaims, is a fallen, prostrate (and therefore soiled or weakened) virgin (Amos v:2). Isaiah, speaking for God, predicts the sterility of waste and destruction for those who have turned from God's law: Leur racine [sera] comme pourriture: &amp; leur fleur s'en ira t n6ant comme poussiere: ... (Isaiah v:24) Even the mountains crumble under the impact of God's wrath and torn bodies lie scattered in the streets (Isaiah v:25). In much the same vein, and as God's spokesman, d'Aubign6 commands the earth to react to man's corrup- tion: Terre, qui sur ton dos porte t peine nos peines, Change en cendre &amp; en os tant de fertiles plaines, En bourbe nos gazons, nos plaisirs en horreurs, En soulfre nos guerets, en charogne nos fleurs. (Vengeances, 11. 285-88) By being rooted in actuality and in the movement of history, the conven- tional and therefore static symbols of cleanliness, fertility, and their opposites are activated and given power. Cleanliness alone can keep man and the world entire, can prevent its collapsing.13 The Old Testament Hebrews saw that whatever moves away from God moves toward death and oblivion, so that continuity of life depends on cleanliness: Qui est-ce qui montera en la montagne de rEtemel, &amp; qui est-ce qui demeurera au lieu de sa sainctet6? L'homme qui a les mains pures &amp; le coeur net, qui n'aspire point de son ame A fausset6, &amp; ne iure point en tromperie. (Pseaumes xxiiii:3-4) D'AubignE expresses this same concept in Vengeances: I1 faut a ses yeux clairs estre net, pur &amp; blanc, N'avoir tache d'orgueil, de rapine &amp; de sang: ljohannes Pederson, Israel: Its Life and Culture, trans. Aslaug M0ller (4 vols.; London: Oxford University Press, 1926-1940), I-II, p. 491. 81</page><page sequence="8">Car nul n'heritera les hauts cieux desirables Que ceux-li qui seront A ces petits semblables, Sans fiel &amp; sans venim; . . . (Vengeances, 11. 42-47) Like a prophet assuming the burden of God's wrath or weal, d'Aubign6 is in direct contact with the divine law and its force. The poet himself partici- pates in the history-making process, for God has given him his pen (Misres, 11. 53-54), enjoining His chosen avenger to "employer [son] bras fort aux vengeances de Dieu" (Fers, 1. 1420). In Vengeances, the poet asks to be God's messenger, submerging his own selfhood in order to become a vessel for the divine directive: Mets au lieu de ma langue une langue de flamme, Que je ne sois qu'organe A la celeste voix Qui l'oreille &amp; le coeur anime des Frangois. (n. 58-60) In Jugement, the final and apocalyptic canto of d'Aubign6's prophetic sermon, God's voice does indeed speak directly through his messenger, excoriating and threating the worshipers of false gods (11. 223-320). As the recipient of God's spoken word, he realizes the apocalyptic vision of resurrection and the triumph of the just and brings the future into the present of man's experiential involvement with God. The poet-prophet restores the man-God relationship, for his word is truth, destroying appearances and the lie. By giving concrete, objective form to divine judgment, his word reveals the ultimate meaning of an historic event. Thus poetic and prophetic creation, like divine creation, become a saving act: "the word becomes history and history becomes the word."
