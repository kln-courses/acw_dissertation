Dieser Aufsatz erörtert den historischen Gang dieser Verbannung und Leibniz' Bemühen um eine Rehabilitierung der Begriffe Natur, Form und Kraft, wobei er jedoch okkulte, "barbarische" und überflüssige Zutaten zur Naturphilosophie vermeidet. Although Leibniz's achievements in the fields of pure mathematics, logic and metaphysics are subject to a relatively stable set of interpretations, the same cannot be said of his natural philosophy. His belief in the necessity and utility of assuming final Research for this paper was supported by a fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt- Stiftung in 1984-5.

Bum, for example, described him as "the first great protestant against the new metaphysical orthodoxy"2, an orthodoxy he located in the conception of the world as "a vast clock-like machine, set in motion at the beginning by the Creator and thence running merely by operation of its own secondary causes"3. This judgement is somewhat curious, for no one, except possibly Robert Boyle, could have been fonder of the clock metaphor than Leibniz himself. Indeed it was in Boyle's name, and in the name of a philosophy based on mechanical principles alone, that he denounced Newton as one grown tired of reason and weary of light. When Clarke suggested that the gravitational attraction between bodies separated in space proposed by Newton was entirely non-miraculous in virtue of being constant and regular - though admittedly accomplished "invisibly and intangibly" by non- mechanical means4 - Leibniz replied that to the terms invisible and intangible he might as well have added "inexplicable, unintelligible, precarious, groundless, and unexam- pled"5. Claiming, indeed, priority in the discovery of the law of universal attraction6, he continued, despite the urgings of Huygens, to explain celestial motion with the help of vortices7. Newton's own assurance that he would be "far from objecting" were someone to account for gravity by means of the action of subtle matter8 did not prevent Leibniz from assigning to him the doctrine that it was an inexplicable power miraculously superadded to matter9. As such he regarded it as belonging to the same : E. A. Bum, The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science, 2nd ed. London, 1932, p. 201. Elsewhere, however, Burn presents Leibniz in the company of Descartes, Galileo, Boyle, and Locke as a leading exponent of the self-sufficient world-machine theory (p. 92, p. 105), and on p. 289 he notes his boldness in excluding God from all post-creation activity. These examples of indecision can be multiplied from writer to writer. At the extremes of interpretation perhaps lie A. Robinet's Leibniz et Malebranche, relations personelles , Paris, 1970 and J.

My aim in this paper is to try to account for this distinctive pattern of acceptance and rejection in Leibniz's work, an acceptance, which above all implied the existence of an indwelling, invisible, unmeasurable "force of nature", coupled with a rejection of every other variety of active principle known to the seventeenth century. This task will require in turn an examination of his doctrines concerning nature, natural law, and explanation in the physical sciences. Searching for an answer to the question why the notion of a "law of nature" assumes such an importance for the seventeenth century10, Edgar Zilsel remarks in passing that "Ideologies are extremely conservative. They can never be explained by present conditions alone, but mirror the whole past too"11. This remark is equally appropriate to theories of natural law. Leibniz's own doctrine reflects not only his position in a number of celebrated seventeenth-century controversies, but in a set of past disputes, between Aristotle and Democritus, between St. Thomas and the Islamic theologians, between Malebranche and Suárez. In each of these controversies what is at issue is the claim to a particular sort of autonomy and independence on the part of natural things. Their character is nevertheless entirely transformed by the contemporary settings in which they occur. At certain junctures - first with the medieval attempt to synthesize Aristotelian and Christian doctrines, second with the development of a science which made broad assumptions about the homogeneity of matter and the ubiquity of mechanical laws - these transformations are particularly striking, their effects far- reaching. Hence an understanding of the evolution of the argument about nature and its laws is essential to an understanding, not only of Leibniz's theory of nature, but of central elements of his metaphysical procedures. I. In Book II of the Physics, Aristotle enunciates a definition of nature and natural things which provides the basis for all later discussion. The products of nature, he says, animals, plants, the four elements, have within themselves "a principle of motion and of stationariness"12 which differentiates them from products of art, such as coats or beds, which "have no innate impulse to change". A second distinction marks out natural processes as those which, though occurring regularly and reliably "in the same way", are to be distinguished from processes determined by the necessity which governs, for example, the cycle of evaporation and condensation. It is necessary that "what is drawn up must cool, and what has been cooled must become water and descend"13. But neither chance or necessity possesses any explanatory value for the question why our front teeth come up sharp "fitted for tearing", our back teeth "broad and useful for grinding . . ."l4. These distinctions inform Aristotle's conception of 10 E. Zilsel, The Genesis of the Concept of Physical Law, in: Philosophical Review, LI (1942), pp. 245-279. See also M. B.

" ibid.</page><page sequence="4">De Ipsa Natura 151 science as an investigation of the natures of different groups which share a set of common characteristics, that is, of different species. These natures are exhibited in the growth of the individual and in the unfolding and employment of its latent powers. Thus scientific inquiry aims not simply at a static taxonomy of qualities, but at a grasp of the distinctive patterns of growth, development, and behavior in plants, animals, and men. It is usual to characterize Aristotle's conception of nature as "ideological", but such a term disguises the true complexity of his thinking15. Pan of his aim in assigning to natural things a regular and uniform tendency to change is to account for the actions of living creatures without ascribing thought and judgement to them indiscriminately. A process which is accomplished naturally can, he points out, be mimicked by art - by deliberation, craft, skill, intelligence. Thus the workings of nature preserve an analogy with, but do not imply, the exercise of reason16. The spider builds her web naturally, but without planning or intelligence; the elements seek their natural places, but without conscious aim. In other contexts, however, the distinction between nature and art, between the living thing and the mechanical artifact, is employed polemically, against his opponents Democritus and Empedocles. In the Motion of Animals he points out that although there is a certain superficial similarity between an "automatic puppet" or a moving toy running by twisted strings and levers and a living animal, the two cannot be identified. Muscular movement in animals involves, he says, "change in quality", not simply in the relation of pans and is produced by imagination, sensation, and ideas17. From the same perspective he ridicules the claims of Democritus, who, he charges, "uses language like that of the comic dramatist Phillipus, who accounts for the movements that Daedelus imparted to his wooden Aphrodite by saying that he poured quicksilver into it"18. The soul does npt initiate movement through pressure and resistance, as we initiate movement in a mechanical device; rather a product of nature has the capacity, in virtue of its being ensouled, to initiate movement in itself, in a manner appropriate to its surroundings. As compelling as this account is, it gives rise to certain problems with which a number of later commentators concern themselves directly. Although Aristotle speaks of natural things as having a power to move themselves, he introduces it as a matter of logic that a thing cannot move itself; mover and movent must be distinct19. And in Physics VIII, he insists that an animal can be moved only by an external stimulus; even seemingly spontaneous or self-originated movements have their source in the environ- ment20. To be sure, Aristotle's category of motion is unusually broad. It is conceivable 15 See, for a discussion of Aristotle's theory of explanation, M. Nussbaum, Aristotle's De Moto Animalium, Princeton, 1978; J. Mittelstrass, Das Wirken der Natur: Materialien zur Geschichte des Naturbegriffes, in: F.

The suggestion is that, in the case of „self-produced" movement, it is a part which moves the whole. But according to the principle, this part too must be moved by something else. 20 Physics VIII, VI 259 b; RS II. This has been noted by various commentators. See Nussbaum, De Motu, p. 119f.</page><page sequence="5">152 Catherine Wilson that he is thinking particularly of the motion of "generation and corruption" when he stresses that natural things possess an internal principle of movement, of local movement when he stresses that all movements have their external causes. But he certainly does not say this, and significant ambiguities remain in any case. In so far as the movement of animals is explained by imagination and desire, it can, unlike the movement of physical objects through impact, be explained non-regressively: "... the object of desire and the object of thought . . . move without being moved"21. But it is unclear how the natural upward and downward movements of, for example, air bubbles in water or a stone in the air are to be compared with the natural activities of sentient, desiring creatures, and how the distinction between natural and violent motion is to be maintained in the face of the principle that mover and movent cannot be the same thing. The Christian adaptation of Aristotle gave some of these issues an airing, for this particular interpretation of a body of doctrine required at once an exaggeration of its general teleological implications and a subordination of the claims of particular things. For this reason it was never entirely successful. In St. Thomas's writings in particular, the conflict between the Christian conception of the world as a totality governed by Providence for its own ends, and the Aristotelian conception of the world as a collection of more or less independent individual things pursuing their own particular, distinctive, limited ends is especially sharp. In the attempt to reconcile the ancient, and common-sensical view that finite things possess certain natures, in virtue of which they act for their own purposes, with the doctrines of St. Paul and St. Augustine, who present the world as entirely dependent on God for its existence, history and alterations, he employs a number of distinct strategies, some quasi-empirical, some metaphysical. First, developing a suggestion of Aristotle's and deeply influenced by Neo-platonic cosmology, he refers sublunary change generally to celestial influence and assigns the heavenly bodies from which these influences emanate a rank close to the divine22. Second, he argues that the activities of natural things insofar as they are regular and orderly imply the directive power of God. Natural things outside of men and "other intelligent creatures" cannot strive for their own ends; they resemble rather the arrow which is directed to its target by the archer. "Thus just as the arrow's flight towards a fixed point clearly indicates that it is aimed by one having knowledge, so too the regular course of beings of nature that lack knowledge plainly declares that the world is ruled by some intelligent plan"23. Elsewhere however the arrow analogy is exploited so as to stress the motion received and not the giving of the motion. Because natural objects "receive an inclination to their natural ends from their natural movers from whom they derive their forms, powers, and movements", it is evident, he says, "that even things devoid of knowledge can work for an end, and can desire the good with a natural appetite and can seek a divine likeness as well as their own perfection"24. Like all moderate positions, St. Thomas's was remarkably vulnerable to displace- ment by more extreme points of view. On one hand, it faced the logical power of 21 Metaphysics 7 1072 a; RS VIII. 22 Summa Theologia la 115 3; BL XV, p. 101. 23 Summa Theol. la 103; BL XIV, p. 7. 24 Summa Contra Gentiles III XXIV; p. 42.</page><page sequence="6">De Ipsa Natura 153 doctrines which denied to matter per s e or to created things in general any power of activity whatsoever. Noteworthy in this respect were the claims of Avicebron in the 11th century that matter, being infinitely removed from God, is perfectly passive and can be moved only by a spiritual substance passing through ir5, and the brilliant criticism of the sect of Islamic theologians, the Mutakallemim, of the 10th century. On the other side, it had to contend with theories which assigned a wealth of indwelling powers and virtues to created things and obscured the proper hierarchical arrangement by hinting, or explicitly stating, that these powers were available for human exploitation with the help of spirits and demons of all sorts. For St. Thomas's own admission that angels "have a direct control not only over the higher heavenly bodies, but also over the lower material things"26 left open the possibility as well of demonic influence. He himself was not prepared to reject Augustine's conjecture that demons operate by acting on the "seeds" or "seminal virtues" of things27, a paradigm of action lying as far from the possibilities concretely envisaged by Aristotle as that advocated by the Islamic theologians. The Mutakallemim, to whom St. Thomas devotes several long passages in the Summa Contra Gentiles, subscribed to a constellation of doctrines including material and temporal atomism, skepticism about the senses, and the identity of mental conceivability and physical possibility28. From these premises they were able to derive the impossibility of causal interaction and the corresponding impossibility of any natural necessity. Accidents, they argued, cannot travel between substances; a color cannot literally detach itself from one substance and enter another. Hence the apparant transference of a color in a physical operation such as dyeing must be understood as the annihilation of the original substance-with-qualities and the creation of new one29. A similar analysis applies to the "transmission of motion". They assert, Maimonides reports, "that when [a] man is perceived to move a pen, it is not he who has really moved it; for the motion produced in the pen is an accident which God has created in the pen; the apparent motion of the hand which moves the pen is likewise an accident which God has created in the moving hand; but the creative act of God is performed in such a manner that the motion of the hand and the motion of the pen follow each other closely; but the hand does not act and is not the cause of the pen's motion for, as they say, an accident cannot pass from one thing to another . . . There does not exist anything to which action could be ascribed; the real a g en s is God . . ."30. For this sect, the regular course of nature represents the exercise of God's habits, which he may alter at any moment. No substance can possess a principle of movement, 25 Fons Vitae II 9 and 10. 26 Summa Theol. la 110 1; BL XV, p. 5. 27 Summa Theol. la 115 2; BL XV, p. 99. 28 Their views are discussed by Maimonides, Guide for the Perplexed, 2nd ed., tr.

They say God generally acts in such a way that, e.g., the black colour ist not created unless the cloth is brought into contact with indigo; but this blackness, which God creates in the instant when the cloth touches the black pigment is of no duration, and another creation of blackness then takes place", (ibid. p. 124f). The comparison with the "psychological atomism" and skepticism of Hume is striking. 30 ibid.</page><page sequence="7">154 Catherine Wilson or a principle directed to the generation of form. There is no distinction in any case between different substances; milk and iron are made of the same homogeneous atomic matter to which different accidental properties are superadded. The "rationalism" of the theologians assumes fantastic proportions. The intellect, they observe, perceives no reason for a thing to be in one place rather than another, for a thing to have these qualities and not those: "... a man might have the height of a mountain, might have several heads, and fly in the air"31. If God should alter his ways, the earth and the celestial sphere might exchange places, or fire cool and water burn while still remaining fire and water. Man is no more fitted to think by reason of his nature than a bat32. St. Thomas attempts to counter this line of argument with the Aristotelian theory of form and potentiality. "Primary matter" is, he concedes, formless and inactive. But not even the "lowest" body is excluded from activity insofar as it is composed both of matter and of form. Although accidents do not pass from one substance into another, this does not preclude us from saying that they act upon one another. When one body heats another, it is not the identical heat that passes from the first into the second. Rather, the potential heat in the second body becomes actual through its encounter with the first body. "... the natural agent does not transmit its own form into another subject, but reduces the receptive subject from potentiality to act"33. The setting of one body in motion by another involves a similar "reduction", as expressed in the definition of motion so ridiculed by the seventeenth-century writers as an example of scholastic obscurity: motion is "the fulfillment of what exists potentially insofar as it exists potentially"34. Where the Mutakallemim had emphasized God's absolute power at the expense of any intrinsic organization, harmony or unity in the world itself, St. Thomas calls attention to His other attributes. The test of a builder's skill and intelligence is, he points out, the ability of his houses to stand by themselves : what should we conclude about a creation which endured only a moment and needed to be continuously reconstructed? He argues: "If all creatures are utterly devoid of any activity of their own, they themselves would seem to have a pointless existence, since everything exists for the sake of its operation1' . To deny powers to created things is to depreciate the creation and, by implication, the Creator, by denying nature a share in the divine. And, if creatures cannot produce changes, we cannot know their natures, "so that all knowledge in the philosophy of nature would be denied us"36. Though Thomas officially rejects the doctrine of continuous recreation, he sub- scribes to a weaker version of the same thing under the name of divine concurrence. As a house, the product of art, continues to exist by virtue of the products of nature, the stones and wood, which compose it, so the products of nature continue to exist and to exercise their customary powers through the action of God37. The best analogy for this process is the preservation of light in the air by the continuous influence of the sun; 31 ibid. p. 128ff. 32 ibid. 33 Summa Contra Gent.

Ill LXV; P, p. 117.</page><page sequence="8">De Ipsa Natura 155 natural things are preserved by a kind of constant divine irradiation38, a kind of grace. In the same way, although there are truly secondary causes, and it is fire and water themselves which burn and cool and not God in the fire and water, it is God who renders these secondary causes efficacious. So long as the two agencies are understood as belonging to different "orders" there is no difficulty in conceiving both to operate simultaneously39. A number of problems persist. Despite his best efforts, St. Thomas does not adequately clarify the distinction between continuous recreation and divine concurr- ence. He says confusingly: "The cause of a thing must be the same as the cause of its preservation, because preservation is nothing else than its created being"40. On his own theory it is supposed to be a good deal less. Secondly, his analysis of causal interaction still contains implicit reference to influx; indeed, the net effect seems to be the replacement of one process by two, with causal interaction provoking a reduction from potentiality to act. The further claim that primary causes are what render secondary causes efficacious is difficult to reconcile with God's infinite power and wisdom, if the well-built house is indeed the one capable of standing on its own. These problems did not escape the attention of later critics. But the most serious threats to Thomas's attempted synthesis were the byproducts of first, the replacement of the old ontology of matter-and-form with the new ontology of particles-in-motion, second, the attack mounted by the mechanical philosophers on the original distinction between products of nature and products of art, and finally, the destruction of the cosmos as a political entity. II. In the Treatise of Man, Descartes describes a puppet, an automaton, "made of earth", which reproduces all the functions of the living human body without help from the Aristotelian physiological soul or indeed immaterial agencies of any sort. The difficulty he faced was in persuading his readers that this automaton did not simply imitate, badly, the actions and internal physical processes of a human being, but was, in a real sense, a model of the human body, that is, a kind of artificial human body itself. What he accomplished in this regard only sketchily and programmatically, Boyle expanded into a fullscale attack on the entire Aristotelian philosophy of nature. Descartes recognized nevertheless that the case of the human body was the critical one, that a mechanical account of all physiological processes including perception and sensation would imply the rejection of the entire apparatus of forms and qualities. At some points, he simply contradicts, with the assistance of certain supplementary theological principles, the Aristotelian premise: "We see", he says, "clocks, artificial fountains, mills, and other such machines, not lacking in the power to move themselves in many different ways . . .". Why not suppose that this automaton - "made by the hands of God" - may do so as well?41 The power of men to make machines, in other 38 Summa Theol. la 104 1; BL XIV, p. 48. Note that this preservation is sometimes conceived in quasi-physical terms, on analogy with the preservation of meat by salt, and in some cases referred to the influence of the planets, ibid. p. 45f.

J. de Solla Price, Automata and the Origins of Mechanism and Mechanistic Philosophy, in: Technology and Culture</page><page sequence="9">156 Catherine Wilson words, implies the power of God to make better machines. The problem of the source of the motive power for the animal-puppet was solved ingeniously. Rejecting Harvey's interpretation of the heart as a natural pump as absurdly Aristotelian, he appropriated his theory of circulation and derived the circulation of the animal spirits responsible for sensation and motion from that of the blood. The expanding and contracting motion of the heart was itself to be explained by surges in the blood supply brought about by a process akin to fermentation. The human body thus constitutes a hydraulico- pneumatic machine driven by fluids under pressure in the veins, arteries, and nerves "just as you may have seen in the grottoes and fountains of the King's gardens"42. The only difference between "machines made by artisans" and those "which nature alone composes" is that the former "must have some proportion to the hands of those who make them" while the wheels and springs which compose natural bodies are ordinarily too small to be seen43. Once this is acknowledged, it follows directly that "all chat is artificial is also natural . . . [that] it is not less natural for a clock made up of the requisite number of wheels to indicate the hours than for a tree which has sprung from this or that seed to produce a particular fruit"44. These arguments were fortified and extended by Boyle, for continental readers in the Tractates de Ipsa Natura of 1688, earlier in the lengthy English version, the Free Inquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature of 1686, representing some twenty years of reflection and mislaid papers. Like Descartes, Boyle bases his argument for the animal- machine equation partly on an appeal to parsimony45. Elsewhere he attacks the logic of the Aristotelian distinction between "natural" and "violent" motion directly. Given the necessity of distinguishing between mover and movent, he points out, all motion is "violent". On the other hand, an artifact may evidently contain its principle of motion within itself. The motion of an arrow, for example, does not depend on the bow it has left "since it would continue though that were broken, or even annihilated"46. Thirdly, he argues that if nature is an agent governing growth, development, healing, reproduction, and so on, she must be either material or immaterial. If immaterial, it is inconceivable how she can act on matter; if material, it is inconceivable how she can pervade the world, or the body, or act for an end47. The lengthiest and most persuasive sections of the Free Inquiry are, however, those in which Boyle considers, one by one, the effects ascribed to nature - particularly her alleged role in medicine and physiology - and proposes a reanalysis of each in V (1964) p. 9-23; Mittelstrass, Das Wirken der Natur, p. 53ff. What emerges from these discussions is, however, that there is a distinction to be made between the pre- and post-Keplerian and Galilean emplovment of these analogies. 42 ibid.

The scholastic axioms which attempt to characterize her in particular ways, e.g., Nature does nothing in vain, Nature takes the shortest route, Nature abhors a vacuum, all have significant counter-examples which indicate that nothing in particular is being described. "Nature" is, in the end, a non-referring expression. Should one want to refer to the totality of created things one can employ an innocent, theoretically-neutral term such as ,,cosmical mechanism". Boyle stresses repeatedly that mechanical patterns of interaction are the only ones truly intelligible to us, "so that by whatever principles natural things be constituted, it is by mechanical principles that their phenomena must be explicated". If an angel himself, he says, should bring about an alteration in a body "it is scarce conceivable to us men how he could do it without the assistance of local motion". Yet this presentation of the machine as the very paradigm of the intelligible is counter- balanced by the tacit admission that, to the uninitiated, the machine, as a complex arrangement of parts a good many of which are hidden to the eye, is, in some ways, the very paradigm of the unintelligible. Thus it is only, he suggests, their "not being conversant enough with natural and artificial things" which has caused learned men to ascribe inherent and active powers to so many bodies49. Boyle's doctrine is superficially clear enough: God at the Creation "when he first formed the universal and undistinguished matter into the world, put its parts into various motions . . . and ... by his infinite wisdom and power . . . did so guide and overrule the motions of these parts ... as that they were finally disposed into that beautiful and orderly frame, we call the world . . . [and] settled such laws or rules of local motion . . . that, by his ordinary and preserving concourse, the several parts of the universe, thus once completed, should be able to maintain the great construction, or system, and economy of living bodies, and propagate the species of living creatures'0 . But whatever its role in strengthening the frame of reference of seventeenth -century science, this formulation only obscures the problems of force and activity. The conceptual advantages of conceiving the world as a running machine which needed no assistance in the form of spiritual agencies, souls, or occult powers, were to a certain extent offset by the disadvantages of conceiving of it as a machine. Though Descartes's dim intuition of the convertability of mechanical and chemical energy in his fermentation theory of the sanguinary circulation was prophetic, the source of the world's movement was as much a problem as the source of the body's movement. That the world was a machine from the hands of God - indeed a machine in the hands of God - was clear. But what corresponded to the original winding up ? And what did this concourse amount to in an allegedly self- running machine? Descartes's own treatment of the issue was deeply ambiguous. In Le Monde he presents the "initial fillip" theory, supplemented by the principle that God always preserves the same amount of total motion in the universe to ensure a continuous and 48 § VII V, pp. 218ff. Cf. the list of axioms in the Conimbra commentaries: Commentarii in octos libros physicorum Aristotelis (1952) 2, 1, 1, 1. and the even longer list in Alsted's popular Encyclopedia, (1619) where Nature is described in goddess-like terms as "assiduous", "vigilant", "liberal", "munificent", "containing", "never sterile", and so on.

He is not content however to stop there; the Meditations contain a doctrine of continuous recreation appropriated directly from St. Thomas52. Again, when concerned with particular mechanical interactions, his analysis tends to be occasionalistic. Arguing against the scholastic interpretation of qualitative change as involving intension and remission of forms, he insists that we can "very well conceive . . . how the movement of one body can be caused by that of another, and diversified by the size, figure and situation of its pans, but we can in no way understand how these same things . . . can produce . . . those substantial forms and real qualities which many suppose to exist in bodies; nor likewise can we understand how these forms or qualities possess the force adequate to cause motion in other bodies"53. The first section of this interesting passage suggests that causal interaction between particles of matter is transparent to the understanding; the second half of the passage suggests, to the contrary, that force and power are not qualities possessed by particles of matter which they may communicate to one another. How then is causal interaction to be understood? Earlier in the Principles, Descanes had indicated that the "force" we ascribe to bodies on the basis of their resistance to motion and penetration is as subjective, as mind-dependent, as the qualities of color or taste. If bodies invariably moved away from us as we approached them, "we should never feel hardness, and yet we would have no reason to believe that the bodies which recede in this way would on this account lose what makes them bodies"34. The ambiguity is pervasive. Descartes's relativistic definition of motion as the "transference of one part or one body from the vicinity of those bodies that are in immediate contact with it"55 implies that motion is not a quality of a body, but a way of describing its relation to other bodies. Elsewhere however he speaks casually of bodies as "possessing" force and as "transferring" portions of their speed to one another56, as though force and speed at any rate were qualities, and transferable qualities at that. In the Meditations, Descartes had puzzlingly remarked that the distinction between creation and conservation was "a distinction only of reason"57, leaving it open whether the emphasis was to be placed on "only" or on "distinction". The position of Malebranche, though rhetorically stronger, exhibits the same fundamental tension. We speak, he says, of the power of alcohol to produce drunkenness, or of fire to warm; we believe that a billiard ball in motion possesses a "moving force" or "power of action" which it conveys to another on contact. Reason shows us, however, that the notions of cause and power can pertain only to the divine58. That a finite creature should possess such a thing is, he says, "inconceivable". The very terms "power", "nature", "form", "faculty", "quality", and "cause per se" signify nothing: Their defenders "have no clear idea what they are talking about, and what they are talking about is inconceiv- able"59.

Thus motion can only be the continuous recreation of a body in a series of consecutive locations61. Unlike the Islamic theologians, Malebranche attempts to defend simultaneously a theory of natural necessity and an occasionalistic account of motion. Fire, he says, "cannot cool like water ... for since fire is only wood whose parts have been agitated with a violent motion . . . it is impossible for these parts not to communicate some of their motion to the bodies with which they collide"6 . It is thus a necessary truth for Malebranche both that fire should have the particular microstructure it does (instead of being, for example, a special element) and that a body which collides with another body should communicate its motion to it. If that is so - one might be tempted to argue - then fire simple does have a nature and moving particles do have forces. Malebranche's implicit defense here consists in his claim that, as long as matter is conceived as pure extension, there is no conceivable way in which, according to Cartesian standards of clarity and distinctness, a nature or powers might adhere to it or imbue it. This is nevertheless one of the weakest points of his account63. III. The efforts of Boyle and Malebranche were directed in the first instance against contemporary versions of scholastic Aristotelianism; the main target in Malebranche's case was certainly Suárez, the greatest of the 16th century neo-scholastics. Aristotelianism was simply incompatible - particularly in its insistence on a distinction between the physical and the mathematical sciences - with the development of the type of science Malebranche favored64. Yet his references to "paganism" and "idolatry", are not entirely explained by the supposition that orthodox scholastics were his only opponents. As Boyle conceived himself in the Skeptical Chemist and elsewhere as engaged in a three-cornered struggle with Aristotelians on one hand and chemical philosophers, i. e. Paracelsians, on the other, so Malebranche's indirect target was - it is hard not to suppose - magic. His strategy was to place the scholastic writers in an unseemly fraternity by suggesting a conceptual equivalence between the forms and faculties of an established intellectual tradition and the indwelling deities - in the worst case, demons - to which a more peripheral, but forceful tradition ascribed its effects65. He makes this parallel explicit: "If religion teaches us that all the divinities of paganism are merely stones and metals without life or motion, it also reveals to us that all the divinities of philosophy are merely matter and inefficacious wills"66. 60 Eclaircissement XV, RB III, pp. 21 Iff.; LO, pp. 657ff. 61 Entretiens sur la métaphysique, VII, IX; RB XII, p. 163; Eclairciss.

(ibid. p. 218). But to "reduce" an infinity of effects in this way to a finite number of generating principles is to assign a nature. M cf. Aristotle on the distinction between physics and mathematics. The "mixed sciences" : optics, harmonics, geometry, do not include physics in the 17th centurv sense (Physics II, II, 194a; R ID. 65 D.

Walker, Spiritual and Demonic Magic from Fidno to Campanella, London, 1958. 66 Recherche, VI, II, II; RB II.</page><page sequence="13">160 Catherine Wilson Magic, and the chemical philosophy which was often bound to it, nevertheless provided a clear conceptual alternative, and its major representatives, such as Paracelsus and Agrippa, took pains to persuade their readers that their ascription of indwelling powers and virtues to natural things was a particularly Christian move. Paracelsus urges: "Dear Reader, I understand that you believe that when a thing has power and effectiveness (Kraft und Wirkung) it is with the devil's help. Can you not also believe that the Creator of Nature, God in heaven, is also so powerful, that he can give such powers to metals, roots, herbs, stones, and other such things ?"6 The titles of the early chapters of Cornelius Agrippa's De occulta philosophia "Of the Wonderful Natures of Fires and Earth", "Of the Hidden Powers of Things", "How the Powers of Things may be Discovered and Proved through the Principle of Similarity" and so on, express a conception of the magician as one gifted with the ability to discover, beneath the rind and husk of nature, her living core. The implications of this ability are never innocent68. Powers and virtues thus give life and substance to what would otherwise be "dead": The psychological significance of this characterization has been noted by several writers69. They are hidden and imperceptible; their presence is felt in mysterious ways and revealed through mysterious procedures. "Where the goal of seeking is hidden", remarks Paracelsus, "the manner of seeking is also occult". The hidden life of metals is "a secret earthy fatness" of arsenic and realgar, a "mercurial and coagulated poison" of men, "an astral balsam ... a celestial invisible fire ... a tingeing spirit of salt". "The earth of itself is dead!', he tells us, "but the element of it is a secret and hidden life"70. The power and wisdom of God are once more available to be appealed to. Paracelsus asks: "What would man be without a soul ? The soul makes him full. What would a cow be that did not give milk ? ... The use of a thing that goes out of it, this same use is the fulfillment of the thing . . . Why should God want to make such wonderful things when there is nothing in them, but everything stand empty? God has made nothing empty but everything full*'71. One distinctive feature of Paracelsian magical theory was its lack of interest in integrating causal notions with a conception of natural law. The original Aristotelian insight, that it is in virtue of its inner nature that a thing exhibits the behavior it does regularly and reliably "in the same way", does not make a forceful showing in the writing of Paracelsus or Agrippa72. Parcelsus indeed points out that a drug does not 67 Paracelsus, Werke, 5 vols., ed. W.-E. Peuckert, Darmstadt, 1965-1968; Archidoxis magicae V, p. 282. 68 Walker, Spiritual and Demonic Magic, has argued persuasively that the Church preferred to retain a monopoly on magic; in any case, so long as the magician was regarded as having a privileged access to certain forms of power, the issue of social control was a relevant one. 69 R. Lenoble, Mersenne et la naissance du méchanisme, Paris, 1943, p. 162, following G.

The exception is Paracelsus's follower, van Helmont, who has a clear grasp of the connection between the concept of a law of nature and the concept of an inner power. His arguments are nevertheless somewhat curious. He rejects Aristotle's conception of a "final" cause on the grounds that it requires "a mental conceit in things without life". Nor is he satisfied, though, with Aristotle's conception of an "efficient" or "external" cause, which, he argues, is not teleological enough. His example is the case of generation: the father, the "efficient cause" of generation is by no means a sufficient condition, for, despite his activities, generation may not occur. This implies that this role is restricted to inciting activity in what is already predisposed to a certain course of development. The "inward worker" which actually brings about changes in form thus contains within itself "the Types or Patterns of things to be done by itself"74. This "seminal, efficient, disposing principle" is not supposed to require a "mental conceit"; the model for it is the seed, which "contains the whole quiddity or thingliness" of the future plant. Despite Helmont's tireless anti-Aristotelian rhetoric, his general comprehension of the problem of causation is strongly Aristotelian: He says, marking the old distinction: "[Every effect], is produced either from the outward Agent, and is a thing brought forth by Art, or from the outward awakener and nourisher, which is the occasional and outward cause, which not withstanding, hath an efficient and seminal cause within . . ."/5. The Paracelsian theme of the fullness of nature is repeated: "Nature doth not consist of an undetermined hyle or matter, and an impossible one, neither hath it need of such a Principle . . . but order, and life, are in the efficient cause, of necessity. And everything is empty, void, dead and slow unless it hath been constituted or sometimes be constituted by a vitali or seminal principle present with it" 6. The nature of a thing Helmont defines as "the Command of God whereby a thing is that which it is, and doth that which it is commanded to do or act". This, he says, is a "Christian definition"77. But as the archeus is only incited into action by an external agent, Helmont appears as an "occasionalist" who denies the possibility of true transeunt action - albeit one with a more liberal ontology than Malebranche. 73 This is the incomplete side of Paracelsus's otherwise - fruitful theory of "specific" diseases and disease-producing entities: "You should not say: Melissa is a herb tor the womb and Marjoran for the head - thus the ignorant talk. Their action lies in Venus and Luna; if you want it, heaven must be propitious". (Quoted in W. Pagel, Paracelsus, 2nd. ed. Basel, 1982, p. 70.) 4 Onatrike, or Physick Refined, tr. J.(ohn) C. (handler), London, 1662, p. 29; Cf. Cudworth, True intellectual System of the Universe, London, 1678, p. 156": ". . . it is manifest that the Operation of Nature is different from Mechanism, it not doing its work by Trusión or Pulsion, by Knockings or Thrustings, as if it were without that which it wrought upon. But as God is Inward to everything, so Nature Acts Immediately upon the Matter, as an Inward and Living Soul or Law in it". (He gives a reference to Plotinus.) 75 ibid. p. 30. 76 Ibid. p. 28. 77 Thus Oakley's distinction (note 10 above) between "immanent" (Greek-Stoic) and "legisla- tive" Qudeo-Christian) conceptions of natural law is somewhat overdrawn. Helmont is as ready as Boyle and Malebranche to label Aristotle a "heathen" philosopher and to promote his own philosophy as the only truly Christian one. See Oriatrike , p. 20.</page><page sequence="15">162 Catherine Wilson IV. How these indwelling powers and virtues were to be understood as residing within things was not clearly specified by writers of the Paracelsian tradition. It is clear though that they were to be conceived on analogy with the soul, and occasionally as indwelling divinities. This left them, to be sure, open to the charge of anthropomorphism'8. This charge became increasingly relevant and increasingly broadly applicable. For the 14th century scholastic, for example, it was still possible to argue that physical law is to be understood on analogy with civil legislation, that the tendencies of natural things are to be understood on analogy with human striving. So St. Thomas, while admitting that irrational things are not literally bound by law, was nevertheless able to employ the civil analogy: "As man impresses a kind of inward principle of action on the man that is subject to him", he says, "so God imprints on the whole of nature the principles of its proper act." Three centuries later this analogy was wholly untenable. The full, detailed, subtle examination of the theory of law in his widely-read De Legibus by the same Suárez so maligned for his views on nature by Malebranche, was above all responsible for the clear distinction between civil and natural law. Suárez, who is particularly concerned with what in modern terms might be called the performative aspects of legislation, argues that law-giving possesses three separate components79. A law exists first as an ideal conception in the mind of a superior. It is then expressed as a sign in written or spoken form; at this stage it possesses only a symbolic existence. Through being understood and obeyed it comes to regulate the behavior of the inferior subjects. These subjects must not only be rational, in the sense that they are able to grasp the meaning of the sign they have been given, they must form a moral community. Clearly, he says, God - and so by implication any lawmaker - does not impel his subjects physically "but merely imposes an obligation which is of a moral nature and cannot thusbe physically brought about"80. Moral motivation and recognition of the superior-inferior relationship are thus essential for the effective imposition of a law. Mere power, in some abstract sense, is insufficient. This analysis created a serious problem for a mechanical philosopher who wished in the old Aquinian way to speak of God as imposing laws on the world. Having shown that nature does not act, that she and her parts are in no sense like a person, such a philosopher was in no position to exploit Thomas's analogical procedure to explain how God succeeded in imposing his will on inert particles of matter. Boyle himself repeats the assertion that "nothing but an intellectual being can be properly capable of receiving and acting by a law" and refers to a law of nature as a merely "notional" thing81 . But both he and Malebranche continue to conceive of God in orthodox Cartesian fashion as having settled certain laws of nature at the creation. In the Sixteenth Elucidation to the Search After Truth, for example, Malebranche states that God, in the initial moments of the world's history, "so distributed and directed motion to the different pans of matter that He formed from it . . .a work that is conserved and renewed through the most general and simplest law imaginable, that every body is moved in the direction in which it is most pressed and to the extent to which it is most pressed"8 . 78 "Its tendency to conceive of natural forces in human terms, . . . they were to be persuaded, conjured, even browbeaten and threatened . . . was primitive, an atavistic survival from the infancy of mankind'*. C. G. Nauert, Agrippa and the Crisis of Renaissance Thought, Urbana, 1975, p. 238). Needlessly pejorative, perhaps, but the point stands. 79 De Legibus, (1612) Oxford, 1944, I, V. 30 ibid. p. 63. 31 B V, p. 170. 32 Edairass. XVI, RB III, p. 304; LO, p. 718. See also Eclairass. XV, ibid. p. 217. Again the</page><page sequence="16">De Ipsa Natura 163 This law, he goes on to explain, "does not draw its efficacy from matter - a purely passive substance whose motor force is nothing in it or belonging to it . . .". This is of course just Malebranche's familiar refrain. What is striking in this context is his attempt to ground the regularity of the course of nature in a permanently - impressed law of high generality. The idea of a rational science - expressed in Malebranchian language by God's preference for voies simples- assumes precedence here over a pre-existing metaphysical commitment to a nature without characteristics and a God who creates it anew at every instant83. V. Leibniz's earliest philosophical sketches, as is now well understood, were dominated by the idea of reconciling the mechanical philosophy of Hobbes and Gassendi with a purified Aristotle, an Aristotle washed clean of scholastic interpreta- tions and accretions84. On behalf of the philosophia reformata he attacks the naturalists, writers on natural magic and scholastics, Campanella, Agrippa, and J. C. Scaliger, whom he accuses of having ascribed "sense, knowledge, imagination and will to the substantial forms of inanimate things". People who speak of these "incorporeal substances of bodies1', he complains, "cannot explain what they mean without a translation into terms of mind". As a result they anthropomorphize, ascribing to inanimate things wisdom and appetite and supposing that nature can be characterized in terms of what she does, strives for, and avoids. This is "heathen polytheism". A reading of recent philosophers, he states in the Letter to Thomasius, shows that everything in the world can be explained using only the concepts of mind, matter, space, and motion85. Nature is the "timepiece of God's". These doctrines are supplemented by a view he ascribes to the purified Aristotle, namely that only mind can be an ultimate source of motion. Freedom and spontaneity belong to minds and only to minds: all motion has its source in other motion and comes ultimately from God86. Interestlingly, he appears troubled in this letter by the apparent discrepancy between the theory of motion of Physics VII and VIII and the art-nature distinction of Physics II. His solution is to set aside the latter distinction and to concentrate on the theory of external causation of the later books of the Physics. Later, this distinction becomes for him the focus of intense interest. The presence of occasionalist doctrines in Leibniz's earliest work is striking. Already in his letter of 1669 he proposes a doctrine of continuous re-creation which is described with interesting inaccuracy as "a view which has never been heard of till now". There is, he explains, appeal is made to the conditions of a science: "If God did not follow this Law . . . there would be nothing certain in Physics, no principle of experience; in a word, everything from our point of view would collapse into a chaos in which nothing could be understood ..." (Eclairciss. XVI; RB III, p. 304; LO, p. 718). I take issue here again with Oakley, who argues that the metaphysical foundations ot Newtonian science were the results of "renewed and disturbing pressure upon Greek modes of thought (by) the Semitic idea of an omnipotent Creator-God". Christian Theology, p. 452. In fact, the success of the Newtonian science made it able to give up the search for metaphysical foundations in the face of discrepancies such as this one. His point would be better taken with reference to Descartes; unfortunately "modern science" tends to be identified with the Newtonian physics rather than the Cartesian. 34 See esp. K. Moll, Der junge Leibniz, 3 vols. Stuttgart, 1978, I, pp. 17ff. " Letter to Thomasius, April 20/30, 1669, GPI, p. 24; LM, p. 100. S6 ibid.

I have demonstrated instead that whatever moves is continuously created and the bodies are something at any instant in assignable motion, but that they are nothing at any time midway between the instants in motion"0 . That is a view, he says, which will "silence the atheists". Several years later in the Preface to an Edition of Nizolius, Suárez's influx theory of efficient causation is indirectly attacked as a barbarous and obscure distortion of language. The speech of the scholastics, he charges, "abounds with figures. What else are such terms as to depend, to inhere, to emanate, and to inflow?"88. This rejection of transeunt causation is a fixed point of Leibniz's philosophy and represents what he will portray later as the majority position: in the New Essays a certain Father Casati is mentioned as one who steadfastly defended the opposing view "malgré tout Pecóle." By the time of the Discourse on Metaphysics of 1686, however, the preference for an occasionalistic account of sensation is interwoven with an entirely different account. A number of passages are phrased directly after Malebranche. "No external cause", Leibniz says, "acts on us except God alone". "When we see the sun and stars, it is God who has given us and preserves in us the ideas of them and who determines us, through his ordinary concourse actually to think of them at the moment when our senses are set in a certain manner . . ,"89. But he qualifies this thoroughly Malebranchean analysis in the next section: ''The soul must needs have within itself in advance not only the passive capacity of being thus affected . . . but . . . besides an active power by virtue of which it has always had in its nature the marks of the future production of this thought and the disposition to produce it at its proper time"90. The soul has not only the passive power of being affected by God, but an active power by virtue of which it produces its own thoughts. This passage follows the famous assertion that if I could grasp clearly everything contained in my experience of the moment, I could grasp at the same time my entire future. "And this would not fail to happen to me, even if all that there is outside of me were to be destroyed, provided there remained only God and myself"91. There is no doubt that the Discourse as a whole is critical of the Malebranchean conception of the relation between God and created things as involving an absolute power on one hand and an absolute dependence on the other. In § 8, Leibniz argues that the distinction between God and creatures, the independent existence of a created world, requires that the "individual substances" which compose it contain within themselves the grounds for the ascription of all predicates which have proved and will prove true of them92. Such a claim implies not only that the soul is in some sense autonomous, but that God's creation of the world was not the creation of a multitude of material particles; for no mere extended substance could conceivably contain within itself the grounds of truth-claims about it. Leibniz accepts, in other words, the 87 ibid.

As it is not, Malebranche's scheme is false. Twelve years later occasionalism is the direct object of attack in De Ipsa Natura90 '. The paper is intended as a contribution to the debate between J. C. Sturm, whose lengthy textbook, the Physica electiva of 1697 provides a defense and application of the corpuscular philosophy leaning heavily on the work of Boyle, and G. C. Schelham- mer, a well-read, intelligent defender of Aristotle, arguing from the medical point of view. Sturm's account of motion was classically occasionalist. Like Malebranche, he defines it as the "successive existence of the thing moved in different places" and argues that the so-called communication of movement from one body to another is nothing more than God's production of a sequence of arrangements of matter94. The laws of motion are, however, conceived as the result of an original divine command. Leibniz's strategy in his critique is to point out the inconsistency of the Boyle- Malebranche-Sturm doctrine of inert, dead, passive matter with their theory of the instantaneous and permanent institution of the laws of nature by fiat: "It is not enough to say that in creating things in the beginning, God willed that they would observe a certain law in their progression, if His will is imagined to have been so ineffective that things were not affected by it and no durable result produced in them ... if , on the other hand, the law set up by God does in fact leave some vestige of Him expressed in things, if things are so formed by the command that they are made capable of fulfilling the will of Him who commanded them, then we must grant that there is a certain efficacy residing in things, a form or force, such as we usually designate by the name of nature and from which the series of phenomena follows according to the prescription of the first command"95. The significant points in the passage are, taken in order, (1) some vestige of God is "expressed" in created things; (2) these things are made "capable" of "fulfilling" the divine commands; this capability (3) takes the form of a "form" of "force" and (4) is to be identified with the term "nature" in its old, maligned sense. Were substances not endowed in this way, the original command of God could influence the present behavior of created things only in a magical way, across space and time. The alternative is to suppose, and to suppose consistently, that God produces no result lasting more than an instant, a position adopted only by the Mutakallemim, who were on that account willing to dispense with the idea of a theory of natural science. For Leibniz, the refusal to ascribe active force to created things amounted to a denial of the independent reality of the world. The threat of too much autonomy - betrayed 93 Leibniz's paper appeared in the September 1698 issue of the Acta Eruditorum, Sturm's reply the following spring. Sturm, who ran a highly succesful Experimental College in Nuremberg in the early 1670 s, and engaged in a second celebrated controversy with Henry More over Hylarchic Principles and the Spirit of Nature, produced numerous polemical works between 1672 and 1698, including the De naturae agentis idolo (1692) and the De natura sibi incassum vindicata of 1698 which occasioned Leibniz's entrance into the debate. Schelhammer - represented by his Natura sibi et medias vindicta of 1697 -, had, officially, the last word in the Nature vindicatae vindicatio of 1702. The last systematic treatment of De Ipsa Natura is H. M. Nobis, Die Bedeutung der Leibnizschrift 'De Ipsa Natura' im Licht ihrer begriffsgeschichtlichen Voraussetzungen, in: Zeitschrift für philosophische Forschung, 20 (1966), pp. 525-538. His reconstruction differs somewhat from the present one. 94 Acta Eruditorum XVIII (May, 1699), p. 208ff. 95 De Ipsa Natura, G?

The occasionalist disrupts the fundamental relation between creator and created in as damaging a way as Spinoza does in refusing to allow God any power outside of the course of nature. "So far is this doctrine from increasing the glory of God by removing the idol of nature that it seems ... to make out of God the nature of the world itself by causing created things to disappear into mere modifications of the divine substance"96. If force could not be impressed into things, "no created substance, no identical soul would be permanent and hence . . . nothing would be conserved by God, but everything would reduce to certain evanescent and flowing modifications or phantasms, so to speak . . . God would be the nature and substance of all things - a doctrine of most evil repute'*. It is worth noting in this context that the writer who approaches most closely to the doctrine that the world is an evanescent and flowing modification of the divine substance is the same one who rejects Leibniz's notion of force as "a mere shadow of scholastic things1' and challenges the status of "force" and "power" as genuinely referring expressions, namely, Berkeley. His phenomenalism thus deserves to be carefully distinguished from Leibniz's. The question at this point is how Leibniz did in fact conceive of God as having impressed something of himself into things. It is sometimes said that Leibniz regards matter itself as in some way "active", but this is something of a simplification. In the first part of the Specimen Dynamicum he speaks of a natural force "implanted by the Author of Nature" in things and indeed as constituting "the inmost nature of the body"97. But a lump of rock, for example, is not in Leibniz's view "active" in the sense that qua rock it is attempting to develop into something else. Inanimate objects have no tropisms. They do, however, possess, in addition to extension, "passive force", elasticity, and "active force". A body consisting only of extension, without the passive force of resistance or "antitypy" would otherwise communicate all of its motion to another such body with which it came into contact, no matter how large the second body. In fact, we see that as B grows larger and larger, it is less and less displaceable by A. Beyond a given point A will simply rebound from it without displacing it at all98. Elasticity is required to explain why bodies rebound during collision at all rather than simply stopping or shattering99. Vis viva, finally, is what is conserved in all interactions and is measured as the product of weight and velocity squared100. Taking into account the general metaphysical context, then, it is clear why Leibniz assigned such importance to this mv2 - to the extent of characterizing it as the % ibid, GP IV, p. 508t.; LM, p. 502. Descartes himself had made this equation. See Letter to More, August, 1694, AT V, pp. 403-*. 97 Specimen Dynamicum, GM VI, p. 235; LM, p. 435. 98 ibid.

Mv2 is, after all, a measurable quantity; there is no reason on the face of it why it should possess more significance than resistance or elasticity. Yet the vis viva was clearly the point, for Leibniz, at which metaphysics touched physics. This is clearly expressed in the Specimen Dynamicum and with only slightly different wording in the Critical Remarks . . . on the Principles of Descartes: "I fully agree that all the particular phenomena of nature can be explained mechanically if we explore them enough and that we cannot understand the causes of material things on any other basis. But I hold nevertheless that we must also consider how these mechanical principles and general laws of nature themselves arise from higher principles ... ; that there is something metaphysical in them, which is devoid of the concepts which the imagination offers, and which is to be referred to a subject void of extension. For, in addition to extension and its variations, there is in matter a force or power of action by which the transition is made from metaphysics to nature, and from material to immaterial things"101. Force is, for Leibniz, a term referring to something more than a phenomenon given in experience. This is not the case with motion which "taken in an exact sense never exists, because a whole does not exist if it has no coexisting pans"102. Motion, in other words, on Zenonian analysis reveals itself as a mere phenomenon, while force escapes this reduction103. As the unity of the mind stands in contrast to the multiplicity of metaphysically-unreal material substance, force, which exists in a body at a given instant, stands in contrast to motion, which involves the idea of succession. Once again Leibniz's old preoccupation with the problem of identity makes its appearance. If motion were the continuous recreation of a body in a series of contiguous locations, nothing would maintain the identity of that individual from moment to moment; there could be no grounds on which to speak of that individual as the one which is in motion. Should one wish to construct the world out of lasting things, then, force must be the primitive notion and motion the derived one - and not, as Berkeley argued, the other way around. In a remark which stands in direct contradiction to his earlier complaints about philosophers who cannot talk about the physical world without "a translation into terms of the mind" Leibniz argues for a direct analogy between the mind and the remainder of the world. "If we ascribe to our minds an inherent force of producing immanent actions, or, what is the same thing, acting immanently, then nothing prevents che same force from residing in other souls or forms, if you prefer, in the natures of other substances ... - Unless it is believed that in the nature of things which is open to us, our minds alone are active, or that all power of action is immanently and hence vitally, so to speak, coupled with the understanding"104. We may summarize this discussion by noting that Leibniz's theory of activity and natural law is expressed in his philosophy at three different levels. It is in the first instance at the monadic level, the level of individual substance, that the notion of natural law as the command of God finds its application. The monads clearly form a community, in the sense required by Suárez, which can be so regulated. The city of God, as Leibniz puts it, ". . . is a moral world within the natural world". Spirits are able to enter into 101 Critical Thoughts, GPIV, pp. 391; LM, p. 409. 102 Specimen Dynamicum, GM VI, p. 235; LM, p. 436. 103 "Thus there is nothing real in motion itself except that momentaneous state which must consist of a force striving toward change."

This law is promulgated through the specification of the individual concept and realized in the harmonious relations of this kingdom of substances. Their moral autonomy is provided for by the fact that, once created, substances are not limited or determined by any thing external to them. At the second level, the world of physical objects which exist as phaenomena bene fundata, is governed by what are described as "subordinate rules", which, unlike the laws of the "general order" are fully understandable by creatures106. This general order is expressed in the individual substances; it stands in explicit contrast to "nature", which is the object of our investigations. Leibniz's description of nature as a "custom of God" indicates both its transparency to scientific understanding, which seeks to grasp the regularity of sequences of phenomena, and its fundamentally derivative status. Thus, although his physics is "realistic" in the sense of conceiving dynamical laws as dependent on forces actually impressed into corporeal substance; though he likes to conceive of the motion of a physical body as resulting from the removal of constraints on its spontaneous tendence to motion, these laws have nevertheless a kind of surface character, and are stated in terms of concepts which are metaphysically inexact and indeed even "relative to our perceptions"107. Finally, activity and lawlikeness are displayed in the organization of living things and in the organization of the world out of living things. Here the Aristotelian distinction between art and nature reappears in Leibniz's theory of the infinite divine organic machine. Thus: "Each organic body is a kind of divine machine or natural automaton infinitely surpassing all artificial automata. For a machine mady by human art is not a machine in each of its parts; for example the tooth of a brass wheel has pans or fragments which are not artificial so far as we are concerned, and which do not have the character of a machine in that they fit the use for which the wheel was intended. But the machines of nature, living bodies are still machines in their smallest parts, into infinity. It is this that makes the difference between nature and art, that is, between the divine art and ours"1 8. These infinite machines are conceived as distributed throughout nature in such a way that "there is nothing in the universe fallow, sterile, or dead" and every pan of matter resembles "a garden full of plants or a pond full of fish"109. The internal workings of these machines are nevertheless to be explained in purely mechanical terms. Leibniz maintained notoriously that all animals have souls and that these are immortal souls. His conviction here is initially difficult to understand in light of the fact that he argued as a Cartesian against the protovitalist G. E. Stahl. Growth, nutrition, and reproduction all arise from the structure and motion of the animal machine, he 105 Monadology, §. 84, GP IV, p. 621; LM, p. 651. On the civic model in Leibniz, see G.

What function then is the super-added animal soul or "vital principle" suposed to have? It is clear that it plays no empirical role and so cannot be called on in the explanation of animal physiology or behavior. It has nevertheless a metaphysical role to play in making the animal one thing rather than many separate things occupying the same region of space. Leibniz repeats over and over to Arnauld in this connection that the functional organization of the animal body is not sufficient to constitute it as a genuine entity111. As an ensouled machine, the living animal is for Leibniz the very model of a genuine entity, and the substantiality of the world - as he makes clear in the Discourse - depends on the existence of these "true unities"112. As a simple indivisible thing, the soul is necessarily immortal. Leibniz's further, more extraordinary assertion that animals themselves are immortal is evidence of an extreme reluctance to take on the problems of the Cartesian separable soul. So death does not imply the separation of soul and body, nor even a cessation of all physiological functions, "but only a suspension of certain more noticeable ones". The organs of the elapsed animal are merely "enveloped and reduced to a small volume" to await a future state of regro wth and re-elaboration113. The possession of a vital principle thus marks an empirical distinction between portions of matter which are susceptible to this collapsing and unfolding and those which are inert. VI. In his True Intellectual System, Cudworth had poignantly invoked the Aristotelian distinction between art and nature in his attack on Cartesianism. The mechanical philosophers, he charged, make the same mistake as Democritus when they "substitute, as it were ... a carpenter's or artificer's wooden hand, moved by strings and wires, instead of a living hand. They make a kind of- dead and wooden world, as it were a carved statue, that hath nothing vital or magical in it at all .. ."l14. The dead and wooden world of Descartes was in Cudworth 's view to be enlivened by plastic natures, which he describes as all-pervading, as acting "fatally, magically, and sympathetically". It is interesting to note that plastic natures or the "spirit of nature" as conceived by Cudworth and More, play both a morphological role in the growth, healing, and reproduction of living things, and a role in expediting the mechanical laws 110 Opera, ed. Dutens, II, p. 149. Stahl, as T. H. Hall lucidly explains, distinguishes "occasional causes whose function is merely to do (faceré) from efficient causes whose function is to something (ef fie ere). In the latter "a strict reciprocity exists between cause and purpose. Herein the difference lies, according to Stahl, between mechanism and organism". (History of General Physiology, 2 vols., Chicago, 1968, I, p. 361). Cf. Kant (1790): "In ... a product of nature, every part not only exists by means of the other pans, but is thought as existing for the sake of the others and the whole - that is as an (organic) instrument. Thus, however, it might be an artificial instrument, and so might be represented only as a purpose that is possible in general; but also its parts are all organs reciprocally producing one another. This can never be the case with artificial instruments ... a product of such a kind ... is an organized and self-organizing being . . .". {Critique of Judgement, tr. J. H.

What is significant is that the Cambridge Platonists regarded these non-mechanical agencies as distributed through matter and as capable of acting on it and fashioning it. So Anne Conway, for example, contrasts mechanical action with "action of life" which she describes as "a far nobler diviner manner of operation . . . [which] hath in it life and vital virtue"116. This "action of life" accomplishes what mere mechanical action cannot; and it is clearly in this line of development that Newton's "active principles", which conserve the universe, keep the planets in motion, warm the bodies of men and animals, without which the entire universe would "grow cold and freeze . . . and all putrefraction, generation, vegetation and life . . . cease . . ."117 are to be understood. This brings us once more to the gravity question. By the time of the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence, Leibniz had for nearly thirty years accepted that the theory of universal gravitation accounted in a wonderful way for Kepler's Rules, precisely as Newton had shown in the Principia of 1686. But Newton's own position on the status of the gravitational force was notoriously variable. It is true that he insisted to Bentley that he had never maintained that it was "essential and inherent to matter"; it proceeds, rather, he suggests, from unknown causes118. That these causes might turn out to be mechanical was however a possibility that appeared to interest him less and less; in the disclaimer to Bentley it is the implication that gravity is a property of matter he is anxious to avoid. The famous Query 31 appended to later editions of the Opticks hints that it is a non-mechanical super-added power, not simply implanted by God, but in some sense constituting an aspect of the divine omnipresence119. Yet in the Advertise- ment to the second edition of 1717 he had indicated that the cause of gravity was an experimental question. Either, then, Newton considered non-mechanical phenomena to be accessible to experiment: a thesis in direct conflict with the epistemology and 115 ". . . though it be true that the Works of Nature are dispensed by a Divine Law and Command, yet this is not to be understood in a Vulgar Sence, as if they were all effected by the mere force of a Verbal Law or outward Command, because Inanimate things are not Commandable nor Governable by such a Law; and therefore there must needs be some other intermediate Agent and Executioner . . . since not so much as a Stone or other Heavy Body could at any time tau downward merely by the Force of a Verbal Law, without any other Efficient Cause; but either God himself must immediately impel it, or else there must be some other subordinate cause in Nature for that Motion".

Newton was faced with two problems, both insoluble. To make gravity an aspect of God's presence rather than a property of matter itself was to invoke once more the dangerous equation between the all-pervasiveness of the divine and an atheistic materialism. Yet it was an alluring theory, and one which bypassed the difficulties of supposing it an intrinsic property of matter or mechanically explicable. Closely related was the problem how to present universal attraction in an experimental context as a minimalistic hypothesis which barely did more than unify a set of measurements, while at the same time conceiving it as a vector of divine agency. Faced with two such sets of conflicting intellectual requirements he could do no more than stand behind his equations and insist on being left out of philosophical disputes. Leibniz was no less motivated than Newton by the desire to find a bridge between physics and metaphysics, a mark or sign in the realm of nature which testified to the relation it maintained with a supernatural order. The occasionalistic metaphysics of the corpuscularian philosophy - which indeed for Malebranche had served as such a bridge121 - was, Leibniz was able to argue, misleading and dangerous. It failed moreover to give expression to the sense of the autonomy, spontaneity, and life of the natural world which defenders of active principles typically saw as bequests of God. Yet recourse to these active agents was in its own way misleading and dangerous; it threatened to make a science of nature impossible. So Leibniz was led to insist throughout his life that everything that occurs - the movements of the celestical bodies, the growth and reproduction of living things and everything taking place within the bodies of men and animals was "no less mechanical than that which takes place in a watch"122. The vis viva alone was able to give him what he sought. Force, the "inmost nature of body" is secret and hidden: "present everywhere, even when it does not appear to sense". As represented by an empirically-determinable quality, it possesses only a derivative existence. It is primitive active and passive forces which, for Leibniz, are only intelligible, impossible to conceive by means of the senses, which are in turn real. Vis viva, of central importance in the Leibnizian physics as the measure of 120 Newton was especially concerned to disassociate himself from More. On contemporary reactions to More's hylarchic spirit see S. Schaffer, Occultism and Reason, in: A. J. Holland, ed., Philosophy, Its History and Historiography, Dordrecht, 1985 (forth-coming). On More's influence on Newton, however, see Burtt, Metaphysical Foundations, p. 133ff. 121 To those who held this metaphysics it was the dependence of the world on God which itself animated and enchanted it. Seeing, speaking, and moving, for Malebranche, place us immediately in contact with God's mind and God's power. In Boyle's declaration that "God hath not abandoned a masterpiece so worthy of him" (Works V, p. 520), in his conviction that, without the divine concourse, all would be reduced "to a kind of chaos, or confused state of shuffled and depraved things'1, the entire unresolved conflict of this metaphysics is expressed. God's timepiece makes a claim on his consideration through its intrinsic worth and beauty; yet this worth and beauty are contingent on his continuing attention. Newton followed Boyle on this point; the issue is a central one in the Leibniz-Clarke controversv. 122 Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, GP VII, p. 418; LM, p. 715. - For an interpretation of Leibniz which attempts to align him with the Cambridge Platonists against Newton, see C.

Berkeley was in one sense right to call the Leibnizian force a shadow of scholastic things. It is a shadow, its employment a deliberate attempt to restore a tradition123. By on one hand extending the realm of mechanical explanation to the totality of natural phenomena, and on the other restricting it to a metaphysically secondary sphere, Leibniz circumvented the problems which had brought Newton to a standstill, at the price, however, of a thoroughly obsolete theory of celestical mechanics. The subsequent elaboration of concepts of natural law and explanation is a separate subject. Nature, Boyle said, introducing one of those simple but profound inversions, is not what makes things happen in a regular way, but the sum total of things which do in fact happen in a regular way124. With Hume this inversion reaches deeper. Nature is no longer, with the Mutakallemim or even with Leibniz, a habit of God's, but a habit of our own. This extreme relativization, and the accompanying tendency to treat forces and powers not as the dangerous and seductive idols of Malebranche, but as frail, unsound, inconsistently sketched, but perhaps necessary idols, co-exists in an interesting way with the generous expansion, for which the eighteenth-century was famous, of the actual range of active agents125. Long and short-range attractive and repulsive forces, imponderabilia and effluvia, vital principles, all become available for use in explanatory contexts. The history of the relation between metaphysical and empirical conceptions of activity in this period has not been written. 123 "Our age has already saved from contempt the corpuscles of Democritus, the ideas of Plato, and the tranquillity of the Stoics/' he writes in the Specimen Dynamicum, "... now we shall reduce the Peripatetic tradition of forms or entelechies, which has rightly seemed enigmatic ... to intelligible concepts". (GP III, p. 235; LM, p. 436). The connection between force, substance and the Aristotelian conception of nature is made explicit in a fragment of unknown date, De Natura. After re-stating Aristotle's definition of nature as principle of motion or rest, Leibniz comments : "This is obviously absurd and vain, unless illustrated by my discoveries, from which it is demonstrable that whatever is a being in itself, or truly a unity, has some principle within it from which everything that belongs to it naturally and perse comes to pass, by consequence of which it is analogous to the soul; and that is what Aristotle called nature". {Vorausedition zur Reihe VI, Leibniz, Sämtliche Schriften und Briefe, Berlin, 1982, p. 68.) I am grateful to F. Mondadori for showing me this passage. '-4 De [psa Natura, Geneva, 1686, p. 71. 125 A stunning example is Berkeley, who, while retaining a belief that the terms force, cause, and power had no application to finite, nonmental things, was in his old age an enthusiastic anti- mechanist. In Siris he argues that all the motions of nature "whether in animal bodies or in the pans of the system of nature which are not effects of particular wills seem to spring from the same general cause with the vegetation of plants - an aethereal spirit actuated by a mind" (LJ V, p. 122ff). This spirit is not an active cause, "but only an instrument of motion, not ... a help to the Creator but merely a sign to the creature" (ibid. p. 123). Laws of nature are, in general, a "grammar" for the understanding of the world which teach us how to act and what to expect; thus the spectacle of nature is a "coherent, entertaining, and instructive Discourse" (Ibid. p. 120).</page></plain_text>
