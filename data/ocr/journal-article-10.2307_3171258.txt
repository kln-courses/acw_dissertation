Earth Window, 1967 Mark Linder Sitely Windows: Robert Smithson's Architectural Criticism Mark Linder is an assistant professor of architecture at Syracuse University. To talk constantly 'about seeing' is a linguistic problem not a visual problem. All abstract concepts are blind, because they do not refer back to anything that has already been seen. The 'visual' has its ori- gin in the enigma of blind order - which is in a word, language. "The Artist as Site-Seer; or, A Dintorphic Essay," 1966-67' In the early 1960s, a poignant and paradoxical image became almost a fixture of formalist discourse, in effect announcing a crisis, or at least a peculiar impasse, in modernist criteria and claims for transparency, advance, and accessibility. Critics as different as Colin Rowe, Clement Greenberg, Donald Judd, and Michael Fried each explored the formal irony of an empty framed surface; either a wall or a canvas.2 Each offered an interpretation of a "blank" picture to support their diver- gent attitudes toward space, surface, materiality, vision, and anthropomorphism. Each attempted, with varying degrees of explicitness, to reinvent the Albertian trope of painting as a window in a wall by recombining that figure's three ele- ments: window/wall/picture.3 A few years later, these concerns reached a simultaneously metaphorical and formal sublation, or translation, in the works and writings of Robert Smithson. His attack on the for- malist conventions of pictorial space, from Alberti to Fried, led him to propose versions of what he variously called "three-dimensional physical perspective," "enantiomorphic Assemblage 39: 6-35 ? 1999 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 7</page><page sequence="2">torft A !r I~mm</page><page sequence="3">assemblage 39 perspective," or "crystalline and collapsible space."4 Most important, Smithson arrived at his reconfiguration of formal- ism through an engagement with architecture, a trans- disciplinary' exchange that has been largely overlooked in the numerous accounts of his artwork, writing, and intellectual significance.6 Like many of the "literalist" artists in his circle, Smithson's interest in architecture had been growing since the early 1960s.7 Beginning with allusions in his earliest writings to curtain walls, movie houses, suburban developments, and "science-fiction-type architecture," through his subsequent curatorial and critical conflations of architecture and lan- guage, to his own quasi-architectural projects in 1969 and 1970 - including Partially Buried Woodshed, the Hotel Palenque lecture, his proposals for a "Cinema Cavern" and "dearchitectured" sites - Smithson's writing and then his work became increasingly involved with specifically architec- tural concerns. In doing so, Smithson not only devised a wholly original form of art - the non-site - but introduced new modes of architectural criticism. Thus it is not a mere coincidence that Smithson's emergence as a major figure in the New York art world of the mid-1960s coincided with a unique architectural collaboration. More or less simultaneously, in the second half of 1966, Smithson not only embarked on a prolific period of writing and staged his first one-man exhibition of sculpture, but began on the first of July what would be a one-year contract as an "artist-consult- ant" to Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton Engineers and Ar- chitects (TAMS), one of the firms responsible for the initial planning and design of the new Dallas-Fort Worth Airport.8 The opportunity to work on the airport project came on 17 June 1966, when Smithson appeared at the Yale School of Art and Architecture in a symposium entitled "Shaping the Environment: The Artist and the City."9 Walther Prokosch, a partner at TAMS, was in the audience and approached Smithson about the possibility of working with his firm. As spelled out one month later in a letter of agreement from Prokosch, Smithson would receive $400 per month plus expenses for "rendering consultation and advice" and was expected to "be available from time to time for discussions with members of our staff [and] for field trips to the site."'1 While the collaboration with TAMS was sporadic and some- thing of a marketing ploy on the part of the architects, it seems nonetheless to have been a catalyst for Smithson's de- velopment. Smithson had begun to exhibit his self-described "mature" sculpture in 1966." But the concerns of these and previous works - artificial materials, critiques of vision and perspective, crystalline forms, and the "new monumentality" - while implicitly architectural, do not explicitly engage the issues of site, scale, interior space, the basic conventions of architectural representation. Nor do they engage the building elements and processes that would begin to characterize his thinking during and after his role as an artist-consultant, a period that can be bracketed by his two most famous essays, "Entropy and the New Monuments" (published in June 1966) and "The Monuments of Passaic" (published in De- cember 1967).12 Smithson's imaginative understanding and increasing knowledge of architecture - whether of "the slurbs," Park Avenue, Central Park West, or the specific pro- posals he made for the Texas "air terminal site"-- was funda- mental to his reconfiguration, and evasion, of what he called "the rational categories of 'painting, sculpture and architec- ture."' Smithson's works and writings trace an intensive effort to relate or combine incommensurable modes of representa- tion - primarily perspective, photography, and mapping, but also an increasingly competent use of plans and occasionally sections - to portray spatial ideas that were specifically ex- cluded or repressed in the then dominant pictorial formalist discourse of Greenberg and Fried." 8</page><page sequence="4">Linder 2.

From the dooms of 'modernism,' something cries out for the Miss- ing Dust, then fades into the printed word and photograph. The Dust is leaving us with 'pop' art and Clement Greenberg's visual Puritanism. Soon there will be nothing to stand on except the webs of manufactured time warped among throbbing galaxies of space, space, and more space. "The Iconography of Desolation," 1962 Each of Smithson's first three published writings contains references to architecture. In May 1966 Smithson published "The Crystal Land" in Harper's Bazaar. Illustrated with a single photograph of one of his "mirrored crystal structures" of 1965, the essay describes the suburban architecture, land- scape, and infrastructure of New Jersey in terms of crystalline repetitions of form." The narrative leads from his first en- counter with Donald Judd's "pink-plexiglass box" of 1965 (which "suggested a giant crystal from another planet") to his joint "excursion" with Judd, Nancy Holt, and Julie Judd to New Jersey, where "the entire landscape has a mineral pres- ence. From the shiny chrome diners to glass windows of shopping centers, a sense of the crystalline prevails."15 Acting out what could be described as a version of Dali's paranoid- critical method, Smithson encounters crystals everywhere, from the ice in his ice cream to the car radio's "row of five plastic buttons in the shape of cantilevered cubes," and fi- nally in the "countless cream colored square tiles on the walls" of the Lincoln Tunnel as the four artists reenter New York City. Yet Smithson is on the lookout here not only for the "abstract" architecture of "crystalline structures," but for ordinary buildings that might catch his imagination, includ- ing "a gray factory" in the Great Notch Quarry that "looked like architecture designed by Robert Morris" and the New York City skyline and "high-tension towers" juxtaposed against the quarry's "cracked, broken, shattered" cliffs. In various interviews, Smithson has explained how "crystal- line structures" inspired his first sculptures, and how later, during his work as an artist-consultant, that interest "gradu- ally grew into" a concern with the crystal-like grids of carto- graphic "mapping structures."'6 Smithson often referred to his interest in "mapping material" as developing from his work on the airport project. In an interview in 1969 Smithson traced an autobiographical path from dealing with "the scale of a raw crystal" to "drawing lines and grids over the world" to the non-sites that "return to the raw material where the ab- stract lattices and grids encompass the raw material."17 Speak- ing in 1972 about his wall-mounted mirror sculpture of 1964, Enantiomorphic Chambers, he says: I was dealing with grids and planes and empty surfaces. The crystal- line forms suggested mapping. . . . In other words, if we think of an abstract painting, for instance, like Agnes Martin's, there's a certain kind of grid there that looks like a map without any countries in it. ... So I began to see the grid as a kind of mental construct of physical matter, and my concern for the physical started to grow.s8 Yet it was only in retrospect that Smithson claimed to have be- gun to think in terms of abstract mapping systems before the airport project. Crystals did serve as the pretext of his earliest 9</page><page sequence="5">assemblage 39 sculptures and published writings, but the interest in maps would come later, through his involvement with the airport. Architecture had emerged only as a subtext in his thinking prior to his contract with TAMS. For example, one year be- fore "The Crystal Land," in a catalogue essay on Donald Judd's work, Smithson described his friend's early "plywood and aluminum structures" as "Mannerist" manipulations of "matter" and "mass" and concluded: "By such means, Judd discovered a new kind of 'architecture,' yet his contrary meth- ods make his 'architecture' look like it is built out of 'anti- matter."'"9 That same year, in an "artist's statement" in the catalogue of the art show at the American Express Pavilion at the New York World's Fair, Smithson struck a similar tone and suggested that his own plastic painting Quick Millions "might be an anti-parody of science-fiction-type architecture, or slippery forms and spaces, but I doubt it."20 Smithson's "doubt" may have been somewhat disingenuous, or at least intentionally ironic. "Entropy and the New Monu- ments," written only months later, begins with wry references to science-fiction architecture - this time with no disclaimer. The essay's opening sentence offers an intriguing assertion: "Many architectural concepts found in science-fiction have nothing to do with science or fiction, instead they suggest a new kind of monumentality which has much in common with the aims of some of today's artists." An example appears in the article's epigraph (taken from Eric Temple Bell's science- fiction novel, The Time Stream), which describes a desert filled with "thousands" of inscribed cylindrical monuments: "broad, low pillars" that formed "long parallel avenues." Further into the essay, Smithson offers several contemporary architectural images of the "new monumentality," including "the slurbs, urban sprawl, and the infinite number of housing developments," "the discount centers and cut-rate stores with their sterile faGades," "the 'moderne' interior architecture of the new 'art-houses' like Cinema I and II," and finally, the much denigrated architecture of Park Avenue known as 'cold glass boxes,' along with the Manneristic modernity of Philip Johnson. The Union Carbide building best typifies such architec- tural entropy. In its vast lobby ... [t]he sleek walls and high ceil- ings give the place an uncanny tomb-like atmosphere. There is something irresistible about such a place, something grand and empty. This kind of architecture without 'value of qualities,' is, if anything, a fact. From this 'undistinguished' run of architecture, as Flavin calls it, we gain a clear perception of physical reality free from the general claims of 'purity and idealism.'21 Art is sometimes put in the lobbies of office buildings. . . . Every- body loves the Seagram Building and hates the Pan Am Building. "Untitled (Site Data)," 1968 The effort here to recuperate the architectural aspects of Smithson's work is also an attempt to revise the standard story, advanced in part by Smithson but especially by those who followed him - critics, artists, and landscape architects - which maintains that the primary importance of his work on the airport project is that it launched the practice known as earthworks. A different path can be traced, however, that reveals the intricate and specific architectural concerns that are fundamental to his art and his criticism. In six major es- says published in the eighteen-month period starting just be- fore his year as an artist-consultant,22 Smithson reconceived the representational and spatial possibilities of the Albertian trope as both an aesthetic figure and an architectural prob- lem.23 This was a pursuit that had begun as early as 1964 with the "split and reversed vanishing point" of his Enantiomor- phic Chambers24 and that would culminate near the end of 1967 or in early 1968 with his invention of the non-site - a composite artwork that he described as "a three-dimensional logical picture that is abstract, yet represents an actual site."25 Smithson acknowledged that the non-sites were a direct out- growth of his involvement in the airport project and, more spe- cifically, his concern with the design of the terminal building. 10</page><page sequence="6">Linder 4. Non-site, Oberhausen, Germany, 1964 I was interested in capturing the sense of expanse and remoteness outside of the room space. The experience of my work had to take place both indoors and outdoors. I got interested in the earthworks as a result of that airport project. The non-sites came as a result of my thinking about putting large-scale earthworks out on the edge of the airfield, and then I thought, how can I transmit that into the center? The terminal was there, yet there was no evidence of these things out there, so I thought of putting television out there and transmitting these things back in, and telescopes. That became a kind of miniature universe, that sort of fit into my concerns of mapping. And the converging lines, the polarities led into an inter- est in three-dimensional physical perspective.26 The non-sites (all produced in 1968) are Smithson's most elegant and complex version of a reconfigured formalism. Each non-site "represents" an actual site in a "backwater" or "fringe" area and consists of three parts: documents (maps, photographs, descriptive text) of the site, mineral samples (sand, rocks, slag) from the site, and a fabricated, compart- mentalized bin that "contains" the samples and functions as an index of their position on the site. First, Smithson selected an actual site, based on his own recollections and supple- mented by geographical and geological research; he then traveled to the site, gathered the samples, and placed them in the bin. Finally, the documents, the bin, and the samples would be installed in an otherwise empty gallery on both the wall and the floor.27 The name "non-site" - like the title of Smithson's recently published 1967 essay "The Artist as Site-Seer" - uses the term "site" as the double of sight; that is, the pure visuality that in Greenberg's and Fried's criticism ultimately entails the complete erasure of architecture's efficacy and effects. In another recently published text, written in 1968, "A Provi- sional Theory of Non-Sites," Smithson explains that he con- siders his non-sites as an alternative to the pictorial tradition and describes his work in terms of a shift to the production and construction of "logical pictures": "By drawing a dia- gram, a ground plan of a house, a street plan to the location 11</page><page sequence="7">assemblage 39 5. The Gallery Interior as a Tragic Site, ca. 1966. ? Estate of Robert Smithson. of a site, or a topographic map, one draws a 'logical two- dimensional picture."'28 A logical picture "differs from a natural or realistic picture in that it rarely looks like the thing it stands for. It is a two-dimensional analogy or metaphor - A is Z." The non-sites extend this application of technique into the third dimension: "The Non-Site (an indoor earth- work) is a three-dimensional logical picture that is abstract, yet it represents an actual site." In this way, the non-site can be understood literally as a reconfigured "window" that is both vertical and horizontal, more a map than a picture, more material than visual, more diagrammatic than pictorial, 29 and as architectural as it is sculptural. Smithson's interest in the window is not simply as a metaphor for a picture, but as an "architectural detail" that, if understood abstractly as a (non) site, potentially combines line and letter, text and image, space and time, art and architec- ture, art and criticism into a kind of "building." A simple ex- planation that Smithson gave in an interview in 1970 confirms that he conceived of the non-sites as architectural: "In a sense, my non-sites are rooms within rooms."" Thinking in architec- tural terms allowed Smithson to evade not only the limitations of the medium of painting, but also what he saw as the reduc- tion of space in pictorial art to a perceptual phenomenon. Per- sistently critical of the understanding of space he discerned in Greenberg's criticism (one in which space is "represented" 6. Hexagonal Barricades for Killing the Space in One Small Room, n.d. ? Estate of Robert Smithson. visually through pictorial illusion), Smithson suggested that space in the non-sites is a matter of linguistic and formal struc- tures (or, more provocatively, a structure of linguistic and for- mal matter). The window-structure of the non-site invokes perspective, but it is not pictorial. Rather, it is "a three-dimen- sional picture which doesn't look like a picture.""31 While a pictorial window - for Alberti as well as Greenberg - con- nects an "inside" with an "outside" through the devices of perspective, framing, and/or flatness,32 the non-site provides a more specific, and more abstract, connection between the "outskirts" (the actual site) and the "interior" (the gallery).33 In other words, the non-site is involved in a dialectic with the ac- tual site that it documents, indexes, samples, and contains: There's a central focus point which is the non-site; the site is the unfocused fringe where your mind loses its boundaries and a sense of the oceanic pervades, as it were .... This is a map that will take you somewhere, but when you get there you really won't know where you are. In a sense the non-site is the center of the system, and the site itself is the fringe or edge.34 Smithson has explained that he had begun to think of space in this way early in his involvement in the design of the Dallas-Forth Worth air terminal building: The terminal complex might include a gallery (or aerial museum) that would provide visual information about where these aerial sites are situated. Diagrams, maps, photographs, and movies of the projects under construction could be exhibited - thus the terminal 12</page><page sequence="8">Linder complex and its entire airfield site would expand its meaning from the central spaces of the terminal itself to the edges of the air fields.35 Clearly, the conceptual apparatus for the non-sites emerged while working on the airport project. But the non-sites also achieve an aspiration Smithson had articulated as early as 1965. In a brief explanation of his plastic crystal sculptures, his "mirrored crystal structures," Smithson claimed that "the commonplace is transformed into a labyrinth of non-objec- tive abstractions."36 Three years later Smithson would make a similar claim for the non-sites, but in a less enigmatic and more sophisticated form, explaining that the dialectic of site and non-site produces a space of metaphorical significance. It could be that 'travel' in this space is a vast metaphor. Everything between the two sites could become physical metaphorical material devoid of natural meanings and realistic assumptions.37 In other words, Smithson conceived of the space of the non- sites as "fictional," and opposed it to the "natural," "realistic," and "mythical" space of pictorial art.38 The same could be said of his criticism, which was not only full of references to science fiction, but mimicked its narrative modes. In essays such as "The Crystal Land," "The Iconography of Desola- tion," and "The Shape and the Future of Memory," he at- tempted to construct a kind of fictional space by combining diverse cultural references - skylines and quarries, factories and sculpture, the museum and the strip - and by assem- bling seemingly unconnected technical terms, statistics, reli- gious symbols, literary references, quotations, and popular images.39 In this way, Smithson could make literal connec- tions across assumed or familiar categories of information to portray a surprisingly encompassing and strange fictive world. Architecture appears constantly in these early writings, but his criticism would first become literally windowlike several months after he began working as an artist-consultant.40 "Quasi-Infinities and the Waning of Space," published in November 1966, consists of four carefully designed pages. In the center of each is a framed "block of print." The main text scrolls through those four blocks, with the footnotes to this text and various epigraphs appearing as smaller (usually un- framed) blocks in the "ultramundane margins": the inter- mediate (fringe) zone between the central blocks and the edges of the page. These notes and epigraphs range from conventional annotations to photographs ("reproduced reproductions") and mathematical ratios ("indeterminate information"), all of which operate as windows not only to the outside of the article (like all footnotes), but also to its inside - the central blocks of print - by offering partial views and "glances" into Smithson's often opaque text.41 The page becomes a kind of bin, containing visual and textual samples and operating as a fictional index of fictive space. Smithson's interest in architecture is obvious in the first few footnotes of "Quasi-Infinities," which include architectural drawings and small photographs of buildings or parts of buildings.42 But the significance of the essay lies as much in its graphic architecture of quasi-windows as in the meanings of its images and words. "Quasi-Infinities" predates Leo Steinberg's lecture at the Museum of Modern Art on his notion of "the flatbed picture plane" by only four months. Using Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol as examples, Steinberg explained the flatbed as a new mode of representa- tion that abandons the humanist implications (sight) of the Albertian picture on the wall as a kind of"window" opposite our bodies and offering views of nature. It is replaced with a horizontal "bed" that, based as it is on the printing press, re- ceives reproduced cultural images and information (site). Steinberg's ultimate claim is that the flatbed announces a "radical shift in the subject matter of art, the shift from nature to culture," an idea with numerous affinities to Smithson's thinking and practices. Not only did both write their criticism in explicit opposition to Greenberg's notion of modernism, but Steinberg offers some very Smithsonian examples to illus- trate his position. 13</page><page sequence="9">assemblage 39 a will to "expression" ,t not ( Ireenberg-Alrlr~ .b~uraCI but representaional.

Opening spread from "Quasi-Infinities and the Waning of Space," Arts Magazine, 1966 14</page><page sequence="10">Linder Steinberg argues that prior to modernist abstraction and the emphasis on the flatness of the canvas, the humanist picture represented the world as an interior space in which one might "juxtapose a doorway or window view with a framed painting, and next to that, a mirror filled with reflection. These three kinds of image serve as an inventory of the three possible roles assignable to the [vertical] picture plane."431 One exists behind the picture plane, the second is integral to it, and the third appears before it. He then explains that the modernist notion of painting has reduced what were once three possibilities to just one and thus has banished the representation of a world from among painting's aims. But Steinberg discerns a return of the world on the flatbed pic- ture plane, arguing that "post-Modernist" artists have "in- vented ... a pictorial surface that let[s] the world in again. Not the world of the renaissance man who looked for the weather out of the window; but the world of men who turn knobs to hear a taped message, 'precipitation probability ten percent tonight,' electronically transmitted from some win- dowless booth."44 Smithson's "Quasi-Infinities" exemplifies Steinberg's model, not by being windowless, but by conflating the flatbed and the window. The printed page is treated as a peculiar kind of window or, perhaps, even a hyper-window not unlike the relatively recent conventions established for the computer screen (which Smithson would certainly be excited to learn now takes its most advanced form as a liquid crystal display). As "printed-matter," Smithson's criticism is unabashed about its status as a flatbed picture plane.45 But it also constructs an extreme abstraction and invites a radical spatial confusion: it is an attempt to portray "visual time" and to configure "mixed media." Smithson thus deploys a radically different pictorial logic, but in this case, it is a radically different pictorial logic of the essay.46 As an implicit window, "Quasi-Infinities" is one of the first instances of a particular kind of architectural criti- cism that is not simply about architecture, but implicitly ar- chitectural in its media, its content, its siting, and its form. All language becomes an alphabet of sites, or it becomes what we will call the air terminal between Dallas and Fort Worth. "Towards the Development of an Air Terminal Site," 1967 Eight months later, in the same issue of Artforum as Fried's "Art and Objecthood," Smithson published "Towards the De- velopment of an Air Terminal Site," the first of two signifi- cantly different articles in art magazines recounting his role as an artist-consultant. In his later, much shorter article, entitled "Aerial Art," Smithson's account is more descriptive than in the earlier essay, which, by comparison, seems a rambling and eclectic collection of ideas.47 But if understood in terms of the kinds of textual combinations that are made so explicit by the graphic structure of "Quasi-Infinities," the seemingly awkward writing and idiosyncratic illustrations begin to structure an intricately interrelated context for Smithson's startling and ambitious remarks (which might otherwise be dismissed as hyperbolic metaphors). The most significant of these remarks is his statement of an "aim" as an artist and a writer "to recon- struct a new type of 'building' into a whole that engenders new meanings." An awareness of Smithson's fictive modes allows an understanding that he is proposing a general ap- proach - "building" - that, conceivably, could be applied equally to art, architecture, or criticism: What is needed is an esthetic method that brings together anthro- pology and linguistics in terms of 'buildings.' ... Art at the present is confined by a dated notion, namely 'art as a criticism of earlier art.' . . . Criticism exists as language and nothing more.48 One example of this approach involves the "problem" of the "ac- tual meaning of an air terminal and how it relates to aircraft": Perhaps someday aircraft will be named after crystals. . . . The enormous scale of the runways will isolate such aircraft into 'build- 15</page><page sequence="11">assemblage 39 ings' for short spaces of time, then these 'buildings' will disappear. The principle runways will extend from 11,000 feet to 14,000 feet, or about the length of Central Park. Consider an aircraft in the shape of an enormous 'slab' hovering over such an expanse. Near the end of the article, Smithson examines the window as another example of such a "building": The rational category of 'painting' was derived from the visual meaning of the word 'window' and then extended to mean 'wall.' The transparency of the window or wall as a clear 'surface' be- comes diseased when the artist defines his art by the word 'paint- ing' alone. . . . 'Painting' is not an end, but a means, therefore it is linguistically an out-of-date category.49 By making this explicit connection between painting and win- dows, Smithson implies that architecture, like art, is "con- fined by a dated notion" - the window in the wall as a kind of picture. Furthermore, it is significant that Smithson's rejec- tion of painting is not primarily formal or aesthetic but "lin- guistic." For Smithson, it is "language problems" that prevent the integration of fields such as "art, engineering or architec- ture."5' He is preoccupied with the effects of what he calls "diseased words and outmoded criteria." Instead of accepting the categorical distinctions among painting, sculpture, and ar- chitecture, he chooses to view such words as "linguistic de- tails" and maintains that "without linguistic awareness there is no physical awareness," to which he adds the Wittgensteinian axiom: "Usage precedes meaning." Wittgenstein is lurking in Smithson's attitude toward language, not only in terms such as "criterion," but in his conflation of architectural construc- tion and the construction of meaning: As one becomes aware of discrete usages, the syntax of esthetic communications discloses the relevant features of both 'building' and 'language.' Both are the raw materials of communication and are based on chance - not historical preconceptions. Linguistic sense-data, not rational categories, are what we are investigating.51 Smithson's treatment of words as a kind of building material recalls the parable of the builders near the beginning of Philo- sophical Investigations,52 and in some fairly general ways, his critical approach is similar to Stanley Cavell's version of ordi- nary language philosophy.53 All three writers arrive at surpris- ing understandings of ordinary expressions and terms by manipulating seemingly obvious terms. As Cavell explains it, the philosophers of ordinary language (Wittgenstein, G. E. Moore, Gilbert Ryle, and J. L. Austin) asked "what meaning, or use" seemingly "ordinary questions" might have. "The sur- prising result was that their results were surprising."54 In fact, Smithson's writing exemplifies what Cavell terms "philosophi- cal criticism - a criticism in which it is pointless for one side to refute the other."55 Instead of offering arguments, the critic will have to say: this is what I see. Reasons - at definite points, for definite reasons, in different circumstances - come to an end. ... The problem of the critic, as of the artist, is not to discount his subjectivity, but to include it; not to overcome it in agreement, but to master it in exemplary ways. Then his work outlasts the fashions and arguments of a particular age. That is the beauty of it.56 Thus Smithson extended the philosophical examination of ordinary language into an artistic use of ordinary artifacts, as though aiming to make art philosophical, to make philosophy literally an art, or to treat artifacts a "linguistic objects." Smithson's friend and dealer, Virginia Dwan, has said that he had this - call it an uncanny ability to take the most mundane things and make them seem - well, make them seem fantastic and intensely exciting. Like the Golden Spike Motel, for example, that dumpy nowheresville kind of place with linoleum rugs and strange heaters up high on the wall. To Bob, the Golden Spike was not just a dump, it was an adventure, a place of mystery, so strange and ex- citing one would swear he was in a science fiction world.57 This concern with finding "surprising results" in otherwise or- dinary places (whether buildings or language) provides one way to understand Smithson's claim near the end of "Towards the Development of an Air Terminal Site" that painting is im- plicated in and perpetuates a "world-view [that] imitates that architectural detail - the window." By concluding his essay with a discussion of an "architectural detail," he reveals his in- 16</page><page sequence="12">Linder terest in applying his "esthetic method" to architecture and demonstrates that he is not satisfied to merely subvert paint- ing. In this case, he identifies a literal element of architecture as the "linguistic detail" that is most deeply infecting "the ra- tional categories of 'painting, sculpture and architecture."' Most important, it is an ordinary kind of contemporary archi- tecture that inspires Smithson's alternative approach. The linguistic meaning of a 'wall' or 'window,' when emptied of rational content, becomes surfaces, and lines. The most common type of window in the modern city is composed of a simple grid system that holds panes of clear glass. The 'glass wall' is a part of many standard stores and office buildings. By emphasizing the transparent glass we arrive at a total crystalline consciousness of structure, and avoid the clotted patchy naturalistic details of 'paint- ing.' The organic shapes that painters put on the 'canvas-pane' are eliminated and replaced by a consciousness that develops a new set of linguistic meanings and visual results.58 This enthusiasm for curtain wall buildings is a reprise of the passage published one year earlier in "Entropy and the New Monuments" in which Smithson wryly praised "the much denigrated architecture of Park Avenue known as 'cold glass boxes."' Yet in "Towards the Development of an Air Termi- nal Site," Smithson not only praises these buildings, but fur- ther proposes that "the surfaces and lines" of curtain wall architecture offer a model for the new art. 'Sculpture,' when not figurative, also is conditioned by architec- tural details. Floors, walls, windows, and ceilings delimit the bounds of interior sculpture. Many new works of sculpture gain in scale by being installed in a vast room. .... The walls of modern museums need not exist as walls, with diseased details [paintings] near or on them. Instead, the artist could define the interior as a total network of surfaces and lines.59 An early draft of "Towards the Development of an Air Termi- nal Site" is more revealing. It shows how, at first, Smithson saw the window as something so mythical it should be avoided. The exact installation of art shows makes one conscious of the ac- tual walls rather than any 'portable walls' smeared with gas-like color. The actual walls establish a regular limit that makes the art objects in the site highly distinctive. Through a precision of instal- lation the art objects all but vanish. .... This experience does not imitate any architectural detail like 'windows' or 'walls,' but instead makes clear mental and material structures .... It is not the art ob- ject we apprehend but the entire site .... This means we do not want 'windows' or 'walls' in the air terminal. The window like the painting is a diseased detail that has a rational origin. The wall is an oversized version of both. We must see only surfaces and lines.60 But then, swerving from the reductive implications of "sur- faces and lines," Smithson claims that compared to a painting, "any actual window is much better to look at - mainly be- cause most of them are simple grid systems that hold surfaces of transparent glass. So that, even a window really isn't a win- dow. A wall is in effect an opaque window. Thinking about windows evokes an infinite array of window meanings."61 Visiting a museum is a matter of going from void to void. Hallways lead the viewer to things once called 'pictures' and 'statues.' Anach- ronisms hang and protrude from every angle. Themes without meaning press on the eye. Multifarious nothings permute into false windows (frames) that open up onto a verity of blanks. "Some Void Thoughts on Museums," 1967 The final paragraphs of "Towards the Development of an Air Terminal Site" are by far the most elaborate and explicit in- stance of Smithson's interest in windows, walls, and pictures. Yet from 1964 to 1968 in both his artwork and his criticism it is possible to trace several themes that involve a critique of "that architectural detail - the window." As early as 1964, Smithson began to pursue a recuperation of perspective not as a perceptual device, but as a representational technique.62 His Enantiomorphic Chambers was an attempt to construct "an external abstraction of the eyes," as if literally mapping and "entering the field of vision. It's like a set of eyes outside" of one's body. His motive was to offer a "depersonalization" of sight (or, more enigmatically, to make an "actual structure of two alien eyes").63 He wanted "to deal directly with the 17</page><page sequence="13">assemblage 39 8.

I'm interested in zeroing in on those aspects of mental experience that somehow coincide with the physical world.64 In 1965 Smithson constructed several internally mirrored boxes, similar to fixed, table-height kaleidoscopes, each en- titled Mirrored Vortex. Either individually or in aligned sets, these prismatic objects (with three or four sides) produced a kind of mise-en-abyme as one gazed down into them and saw one's image reflected in facets to infinity.65 Other untitled pieces made of mirrorized Plexiglas in 1965 had the opposite structure. Like wall-mounted or prone crystals, these mir- rored crystal structures produced a fragmented (but not a multiple) image that, if viewed as a unified image (like a painting or an object), would be disorienting in the ex- treme.66 A 1964 drawing that depicts a triangular version of the Mirrored Vortex as well as two mirrorized Plexiglas sculp- tures includes annotations that make explicit connections to perspective. Smithson describes one of these Plexiglas pieces, made up of two tetrahedrons with a single shared axis of sym- metry joined at their bases, as having a "double vanishing point - exists as a solid rever[s]al of traditional illusionistic perspective - infinity without space." At the top he writes: 10. Pointless Vanishing Point, 1967. ? Estate of Robert Smithson. "The entire room that the piece is in, is absorbed by the piece." There are also two other explicit connections to archi- tecture in the drawing. Near the bottom of page Smithson observes: "In the words of Jorge Luis Borges, I have set out 'to design that ungraspable architecture." In the upper-right- hand corner he notes that he is "working on a set of 24 blocks or slabs with mirrors on them, with these I can make an end- less vari[e]ty of mazes, toy hotels, tiny corridors ect. [sic]."67 Cryosphere, included in the 1966 "Primary Structures" exhi- bition, apparently is the result of this work with "blocks" and 19</page><page sequence="15">assemblage 39 "slabs." The most complex of his mirror boxes, Cryosphere consists of six identical "solid hexagonal modules" each with twelve mirrors. According to Smithson, there are also twelve "invisible" modules and thus "66 2/3% of the entire work is invisible." He invites his audience to "invent your sight as you look. Allow your eye to become an invention."'68 By 1967, while still writing about and working with mirrors (and glass, but in ways that had more to do with using their reflective surfaces as a material and less to do with perspec- tive),69 he would conceive and fabricate an entirely non- reflective and opaque fiberglass sculpture entitled Pointless Vanishing Point. Similar in its echelon form and geometric progression to other works such as Gyrostasis (1968), Shift (1967), Alogon (three versions, 1966-67), Plunge (1966), and the various "strata" pieces - Leaning Strata (1968), Glass Strata (1967), and Mirror Strata (1966) - Pointless Vanish- ing Point is the only one of these pieces to deal explicitly and solely with perspective.70 This piece seems to have achieved a condensation of the issues and problems of perspective and space that interested Smithson, but without resorting to the interactive effects and didactic purposes of Enantiomorphic Chambers or the Mirrored Vortex pieces. In a short contemporaneous essay, "Pointless Vanishing Points" (which was not published until 1978), Smithson traces an idiosyncratic set of connections between Pointless Vanishing Point and the work of 1964. He begins by charac- terizing art since Rembrandt (the painter who "spoiled the straight line") as having undergone a gradual loss of the "arti- ficial factor of perspective," which has been "smothered" and "muddle[d]" in the painting of the last four centuries. "And in our own times, perspective is swamped by 'stains' and puddles of paint." Almost certainly, Smithson is referring not only to abstract expressionism, but to more recent work such as that by Jules Olitski as well as Friedl Dzubas, Morris Louis, or Kenneth Noland; that is, the artists most strongly supported by Greenberg or Fried.7 The remainder of Smithson's essay weaves a deliberate confusion of perspective technique with the facts of binocular vision, a conflation that he suggests has been the actual historical consequence of the ways perspective had mediated the logical conflicts between two modern conceptions of space: physiological (or "visual space") and artificial (or "surveyor's space").72 Smithson ex- plains that our "eyes do not see" the artificial space that the surveyor imposes ... on the landscape he is surveying, and in ef- fect produces perspective projections along the elevations he is mapping. In a very non-illusionistic sense he is constructing an il- lusion around himself because he is dealing directly with literal sense perceptions and turning them into mental conceptions.73 As a consequence of the pervasiveness of perspective, the problems engendered by this conflation of two kinds of space tend to be overlooked. The rationalizing and naturalizing of perspective has turned seeing - which "is mainly three di- mensional and dualistic in conception" - into something that "is two dimensional and unitary." As a result, "we tend to forget the actual stereoscopic structure of our two eyes or what I will call 'enantiomorphic vision' - that is, seeing double." For Smithson, the virtue of what he calls "enantio- morphic perspective" is that it "negates any central vanishing point" and "abolish[es] the central fused image." Pointless Vanishing Point achieves a different objective: rather than de- nying our habits of vision, it is a literal representation and condensation of conflicting spatial logics.74 These are just the most explicit of the examples to be found in both Smithson's criticism and his artwork that emulate or operate as models (of various versions) of an abstract win- dow, one that evades pictorialism while, at the same time, reconfiguring certain formal problems posed in Greenberg's and Fried's criticism, from the fundamental notion of the "canvas-support" to the concepts of "deductive structure" and compositional "syntax."" One of Smithson's earliest essays ridicules "Clement Greenberg's visual Puritanism,"76 and his 20</page><page sequence="16">Linder notebooks as well as his published articles include numerous quotations from Greenberg's 1961 book Art and Culture.77 Smithson's "Quasi-Infinities" offers explicit criticism of Greenberg's "anthropomorphizing of space," and two re- cently published articles - "The Pathetic Fallacy in Aesthet- ics" and "What Really Spoils Michelangelo's Sculpture" (both written during the time of his work on the airport project) - are extended critiques of Greenberg and, to some extent, Fried. All 'formal' criticism and art is based on representational space and its reduction. The latest 'formal advance' to come out of this 'reductive tendency' has to do with the 'framing support.' 'The picture-support,' as it is also called, is interesting as a critical muta- tion of Greenberg's space speculations, but should not be consid- ered abstract by any stretch of the imagination. Yet, the dubious seriousness and pretended rigor of Fried's criticism tends to keep the 'space' myth going.78 Smithson summarized "Greenberg's space speculations" in similar terms in "Quasi-Infinities" (parts of which appear to be revised extracts from "Pathetic Fallacy"), and in one of the most prominent marginal notes (at the top of the second page), he insists that painting, in Greenberg's sense, is not abstract, but representational. Space is represented. Critics who interpret art in terms of space see the history of art as a reduc- tion of three-dimensional illusionistic space to 'the same order of space as our bodies.' (Clement Greenberg - Abstract, Representa- tional, and so forth.) Here Greenberg equates 'space' with 'our bodies' and interprets this reduction as abstract. This anthropo- morphizing of space is aesthetically a 'pathetic fallacy' and is in no way abstract.79 Despite his constant and decisive dismissal of Fried and Greenberg, Smithson mentioned in a 1969 interview that he considered Fried "a more interesting adversary" than other writers of his generation such as Barbara Riese or Joseph Kosuth.80 In his 1968 essay "A Sedimentation of the Mind: Earth Projects," Smithson satirizes Fried's articles on Olitski and suggests that both Olitski and Fried ("the artist or critic with a dank brain") have a predisposition toward "melting, dissolving, soaking surfaces that give the illusion at times of tending toward a gaseousness, atomization or fogginess. The watery syntax is at times related to the 'canvas support."'8' Here, as in his other writings, Smithson does not attempt to debate with Fried; rather, he offers a knowing evasion of pic- torial formalism by promoting the seeming attraction to "dry- ness" that characterizes not only his non-sites but the work of his contemporaries for whom, he suggests, the "desert is less 'nature' than a concept" that has replaced the pastoral land- scape as both a literal and metaphorical site for artworks.82 The passage on Fried and Olitski in "A Sedimentation of the Mind" is one of the clearest examples of how Smithson's mode of criticism offers (dry) "fictions" as alternatives to the "myths" on which more widely accepted interpretations such as Fried's are based. In fact, Smithson announces the impor- tance of fiction immediately prior to the "wet" and "dry" passage: "Poe's Narrative ofA. Gordon Pym seems to me excellent art criticism and [a] prototype for rigorous 'non-site' investigations. ... His descriptions of chasms and holes seem to verge on proposals for 'earthwords."' Two years earlier, in a brief essay (published only recently) on "Philip Johnson's aw- ful proposal for Ellis Island," Smithson suggests: "This could also be a monument to Edgar Allan Poe's Roderick Usher. It may well be that Poe was really an architect and only in- vented the detective story to make ends meet. Poe's ideas for structure and artifices abounded throughout his work."83 Both "Sedimentation of the Mind" and his numerous non- sites of the same year are parallel examples of "earthwords"; both are "physical metaphorical material" and fictive forms that conflate building and language. Both Smithson's non-sites and his criticism of 1968 thus can be seen as summations of the subjects and techniques that he explored in the period that began with the writing of "Entropy and the New Monuments" and ended with the publication of "The Monuments of Passaic," a time when Smithson's architectural thinking grew much more explicit, specific, and deep.84 While the earlier es- 21</page><page sequence="17">assemblage 39 say exemplifies the "new monumentality" in terms of architec- tural images, the later essay not only identifies, but represents and elaborates upon specific architectural forms and instances of the new monumentality by "fictionalizing" them. In the case of Passaic, its infrastructural monuments were "made physical" by photographing and writing about them,85 thus en- acting not only Smithson's often stated conviction that lan- guage is a form of matter, but also his less-known and more elusive assertion that "photographs are the most extreme con- traction" of matter.86 Using black-and-white snapshots taken with his cheap Instamatic camera, Smithson illustrated a hy- brid narrative - equal parts science fiction, anthropological reportage, and wry travelogue. In other words, in "Passaic" Smithson's fictive criticism achieves the kind of monumental- ity that he only alluded to in "Entropy and the New Monu- ments." However striking or lucid Smithson's architectural metaphors and images are in "Entropy," they do not become "physical" until after he begins to work with the architects and engineers on the Dallas-Fort Worth project. Art today is no longer an architectural afterthought, or an object to attach to a building after it is finished, but rather a total engagement with the building process from the ground up and the sky down. "Aerial Art," 1969 Unfortunately, relatively little evidence - models, drawings, meeting notes - remains of Smithson's collaboration with Prokosch, but Smithson's initial interest in the terminal building (as opposed to the airport site) is clear from the ar- chitects' account of their first meeting, when Smithson "indi- cated that [he] would probably wish to study the problem in [his] own studio in model form or otherwise."8 In at least one interview Smithson recounts how initially the architect ... asked me if I would participate in the building of the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, in terms of trying to figure out what an airport is. They would provide me with all the mapping material, and we had interesting discussions. I made models of possible air- ports. But I became less and less interested in the actual structure of the building and more interested in the processes of the build- ing and all the different preliminary engineering things, like the boring of holes to take earth samples. ... So I was interested in the preliminary aspects of building.88 More important, two of the earliest drawings which remain from the collaboration are crude architectural drawings of the terminal. Both show the central transportation axis unique to that airport's design: one is a plan drawn at the pe- culiar scale of 1 inch to 350 feet, showing echelon-shaped terminals strung along the main axis, and the other is a sec- tion of a multistoried ziggurat drawn on graph paper, show- ing volumes dedicated to "cargo," "concourse," "check in," and "bag claim." But as the project developed, Smithson grew frustrated with what he saw as the burdensome amount of statistics and computer analyses involved in planning the huge project.89 He became more interested in the "mapping material" that was provided to him by the architects.90 This led him to work on the airport site rather than the terminal building.91 In this shift of interest from the building to the site lies the opening for those who see Smithson's involvement in the Dallas-Fort Worth project primarily as the origin of earth art. It is true that his retrospective remarks do focus largely on site issues, and in several interviews Smithson explained that the airport experience was the time he "began formulating [his] ideas on earthworks" or that he "got interested in the earthworks as a result of that airport project."92 Perhaps the most interesting example is the opening paragraph of "Aerial Art," which first refers to the relationship between sculpture and architecture - "Art today is no longer an architectural afterthought, or an object to attach to a building after it is fin- ished, but rather a total engagement with the building pro- cess from the ground up and the sky down." - but then slips 22</page><page sequence="18">Linder 12.

Estate of Robert Smithson. into a landscape metaphor: "The old landscape of naturalism and realism is being replaced by a new landscape of abstrac- tion and artifice."93 But as Smithson proposes to "develop" it, this "new land- scape" would include the terminal building at its center: the building would relate to the land around it (runways, perim- eter fences, parking lots, and so on) in the same way the non- sites relate to their sites. Such a proposal, Smithson claims, "begins to shape an esthetic based on the airport as an idea." The straight lines of landing fields and runways bring into exist- ence a perception of 'perspective' that evades our conceptions of nature.... The landscape begins to look more like a three-dimen- sional map than a rustic garden .... The rational structures of buildings disappear into irrational disguises and are pitched into optical illusions .... The terminal complex might include a gal- lery (or aerial museum) that would provide visual information about where these aerial sites are situated. Diagrams, maps, photo- graphs, and movies of the projects under construction could be exhibited - thus the terminal complex and its entire airfield site would expand its meaning from the central spaces of the terminal itself to the edges of the air fields. Smithson used strikingly similar terms to describe the Pine Barrens Non-site, the hexagonal form of which is derived from three intersecting, unpaved, and nearly invisible run- ways at the center of its site. Parallactic perspectives have introduced themselves into the new earth-projects in a way that is physical and three dimensional. This kind of convergence subverts gestalt surfaces and turns sites into vast illusions. The ground becomes a map. The map of my Non- Site #1 (an indoor earthwork) has three vanishing points that lose themselves in a pre-existent earth mound that is at the center of a hexagonal airfield in the Pine Barrens Plains of New Jersey.94 So, less than a year after his contract with TAMS was termi- nated, Smithson had proposed a "new type of building," but one that is an obvious inversion of the situation in Texas. Rather than the terminal containing the gallery (a room in a building), the terminal has been replaced by the non-site, 23</page><page sequence="19">assemblage 39 13. A Heap of Language, 1966. ? Estate of Robert Smithson. which is installed in a gallery (a room within a room). Thus, whereas in "Towards the Development of an Air Terminal Site" the conflation of painting, sculpture, and architecture had been contained by "that architectural detail - the win- dow," in "Aerial Art" the window is reconceived in terms of the non-site, which was itself a result of the collaboration on the airport project. "Language" is replaced by "three-dimen- sional logical pictures" made up of "diagrams, maps, photo- graphs, and movies" - that is, a more heterogeneous language that is both literal and abstract. The architectural sources of the non-sites have been obscured by those who understand Smithson in relation to landscape and landscape painting. Eugenie Tsai, for example, neglects the connections to the discipline of architecture, as in her explanation that Smithson "grew familiar with aerial photo- graphs, maps and models, and his involvement in the plan- ning process heightened his awareness of potential ways to redefine . . . the representation of landscape.95 But Smithson's artwork and writing make clear that this heightened awareness was "of potential ways to redefine the representation of" archi- tecture; that is, the peculiar conflation of abstraction and lan- guage, artifice and matter, sight and site that occurs in build- ings as well as in the models, plans, sections, and other architectural representations that produce them. Also instrumental in this autodidactic process is Smithson's ef- fort to relate architecture and language. Influenced by writers such as Borges and Barthes, Smithson thought of writing as a kind of building. In turn, he began to think of artworks as a kind of architectural writing, an approach that became ex- plicit during the time of the airport project. Smithson's famil- iarity with architectural processes and modes of representation clearly helped him to elaborate the terms of the architecture/ language analogy, and ultimately contributed to his innova- tive reconfigurations of architectural concepts such as "site" and "window" in the non-sites and his later building projects. The architectural "precedent" that dominated Smithson's thinking was the Tower of Babel. Smithson's transmutation of this mythic image into a kind of "ruined" writing is exem- plified by his essays, but is portrayed even more concisely in 24</page><page sequence="20">Linder his famous 1966 drawing A Heap of Language. Drawn, or written, on graph paper, it arranges a list of 129 phrases and words in the form of a ziggurat with twenty levels or lines. Each of these phrases and words "represents" an attitude to- ward the use of language as well as "signifies" building ele- ments that, heaped together, form a monument. At the top of the "Heap" is the word "Language"; at the bottom is a string of several words and phrases: "hieroglyphic neologic word coiner argot billingsgate pidgin English orthoepy terminology theosaurus [sic] cipher." This artwork can be understood in many ways: as a pyramid made of word-bricks (or, a labyrinth of babbling-bricks),96 a foreshortened perspective of "Lan- guage," a geological fiction, or a "section" of a literal Tower of Babel that is at once a source and site of language as well as a commentary on the compacted nature of meaning.97 Smithson's commitment to the literal and material aspects of language would only increase over time. In June 1967, the month "Air Terminal" was published, he helped to curate a show at the Dwan Gallery entitled "Language to be Looked At and/or Things to Be Read."'9 In the press release (which he wrote "anonymously" under the pseudonym Eton Corrasable) Smithson's aphorisms explain his interest not only in conflating writing and art, but also the visual, the ma- terial, and the linguistic in art. "Here language is built not written. .... The scale of a letter in a word changes one's vi- sual meaning of a word. Language becomes monumental be- cause of the mutations of advertising." An early draft is more explicit: "Artists don't write, they build with words."99 Smithson reiterated his position five years later in a signed, handwritten note (dated 2 June 1972) at the bottom of a copy of this press release: "My sense of language is that it is matter and not ideas - i.e., 'printed matter.""0' A more elaborate example is the opening paragraph of his 1968 essay on the writings of other artists, "A Museum of Language in the Vicinity of Art," which pursues an elaborate mixed metaphor treating art criticism as a kind of linguistic labyrinth with "strange corridors of history" and "full of bottomless fictions and endless architectures and counter- architectures."'0' Smithson pictures criticism as "a mirror structure" with "dangerous stairways or words, a shaky edifice of fictions" where "language 'closes' rather than 'discloses' doors." The paragraph ends with a warning to the reader: The entire article may be viewed as ... a monstrous 'museum' constructed out of multi-faceted surfaces that refer, not to one sub- ject but to many subjects within a single building of words - a brick = a word, a sentence = a room, a paragraph = a floor of rooms, etc. Or, language becomes an infinite museum, whose center is everywhere and whose limits are nowhere.102 Smithson's collapsing of architecture and language makes it possible to understand that were it not for the physical and lit- eral limitations of the various sites in which his work appeared - for example, the pages of magazines as opposed to the walls and floors of galleries - there would be no clear distinction between his uses of media in the criticism and in the artworks. An entry in a notebook (ca. 1966) plays out this complexity: A 'magazine' is a place that remains unchanged even when dis- torted. Thin planes of pressed pulp form a stratum a little less than a 1/4 of an inch high. The left edge of the place is pierced normally by two wires, this in turn allows the place to be folded over, thus forming what looks like a stack of 'paper' on the right edge. It is possible to mistake the stack for thin glass but this rarely happens. As is most often the case, one becomes accustomed to the 'paper' because it is not breakable. Although, if this so-called 'magazine' were to be made of metal, chances are someone would mistake it for a geological formation. They might even think of the 'pictorial' matter as some sort of fossil. The top or cover for [the] most part is of many colors. Angles in the shape of abstract designs seem to spell out something, for instance in a red rectangle on a certain 'magazine,' in white marking one sees LIFE.103 In a short piece written in 1968, Smithson outlines a similar, explicitly architectural, fiction in a rudimentary list of seven "Recent Site Developments," beginning with "the urban apartment" and including "the suburban house," "the art mu- 25</page><page sequence="21">assemblage 39 14. "Ultramoderne," Arts Magazine, 1967 seum (modern)," and "the urban office building." Smithson explains his interest in these sites in a prefatory paragraph: The following 'site data' is an attempt to locate 'structural' meanings by observing building sites within a kind of abstract anthropology. Each site should stand entirely as 'the critical object at zero degree, a site empty but eternally open to signification.' (Roland Barthes - On Racine.) How each site pertains to art shall be described accord- ing to its physical limits. The definitions are apparent rather than actual, or you might say 'reconstructed appearances.' 104 The final category, "the industrial site," includes five subcat- egories of which the last is "air terminals." Unfortunately, while Smithson wrote paragraphs elaborating the first catego- ries on the list, he did not complete notes for the last. But it is clear, even in the paragraph on the first category, that his passage on windows in "Towards the Development of an Air Terminal Site" would have been an appropriate conclusion. 1. The urban apartment. The room configuration is random and largely determined by pictures and windows. As a dwelling place it has its origin in the 19th century. Within this dwelling the occu- pant attempts to 'live' according to the myth of individualism. He decorates it with memory traces of the 19th century notion of'na- ture' and 'reason.' For him 'painting' is not a linguistic category but something personal, intimate, private. 'Painting' is his false window that looks back to 'impressionism. As the scare quotes suggest, what Smithson means by impres- sionism is not a style of painting. Rather, as he explained in various other fragments of writing, impressionism is nothing less than the entire ideology of pictorial art. In fact, Smithson first introduced his idiosyncratic definition of impressionism in his discussion of windows in "Towards the Development of an Air Terminal Site": "The impressionistic* world view imi- tates that architectural detail - the window. The rational cat- egory of 'painting' was derived from the visual meaning of the word 'window' and then extended to mean 'wall."'"05 That Smithson expresses his contempt for "impressionism" not only in terms of an "architectural detail" but in the context of some of his most elaborate discussions of architecture, reinforces the claim that his development from 1966 to 1968 should be understood as an explicit assimilation of normative aspects of architecture to devise new art forms; namely, the non-site. The Ultramoderne of the thirties transcends Modernist 'historicistic' realism and naturalism, and avoids the avant-garde categories of 'painting, sculpture and architecture.' "Ultramoderne," 1967 In what is perhaps his most architecturally intense essay, "Ultramoderne," Smithson claims (and thus reveals his own aim as an artist) that "many builders in the thirties ... trans- formed the window into an art form." Over the summer of 1967, at the end of his contract as an artist-consultant and only months before he would produce his first non-sites, Smithson took the photographs for and wrote the text of a wild excursus on the art deco architecture of Central Park West. In the ar- chitecture of the 1930s he sees the window, partnered with the mirror, as "a privileged post for site-seers of transmodernism." What Smithson terms the "ultraist view through the ultra win- dow" is a reconfiguration of Steinberg's "inventory of three roles for the picture plane" (window/painting/mirror). In ef- fect, Smithson has applied his new "esthetic method" to the windows, mirrors, and brickwork of 1930s architecture. The ingenious details of these seemingly stylized buildings are not "diseased" but linguistically robust. In prose that seems close to an epiphany, Smithson presents the "infinite array of win- dow meanings" he had glimpsed somewhat earlier in curtain wall architecture. He suggests that the art deco architecture of the 1930s is actually more timely than Greenberg's notion of the avant-garde. In Smithson's words: "There are two types of time - organic (Modernist) and crystalline (Ultraist)." As in all his criticism, but perhaps in "Ultramoderne" more than anywhere, the most confusing issue is whether Smithson is ex- plaining his own work or describing his favorite buildings: 26</page><page sequence="22">Linder 15. Earth Window, 1967 16. Three Earth Windows (under broken glass), 1967 27</page><page sequence="23">assemblage 39 Unlike the realist or naturalist, the Ultraist does not ... 'make' his- tory in order to impress those who believe in one history .... Rep- etition not originality is the object. It is not an accident that 'the mirror' is one of the more widely used materials of the thirties, and that the faqades of buildings contained countless variations of brickwork. Repetition and serial order run constantly through the buildings of that paradigmatic period. The window reminds us that we are captives of the room, by suggest- ing both flight and confinement. The ziggurated frameworks that contain certain windows show a keen awareness of the window - as a 'thing in itself.' This is the direct opposite of the International Style where the window has no meaning other than function. Form does not follow function in the Ultramoderne cosmos of fixity and facets. The corner window is a right-angled boundary that involves the idea of the double or a 'split-window' from which there is no escape. The 'window' and the 'mirror' are secret sharers of the same ele- ments. The window contains nothing, while the mirror contains ev- erything. Consider them both, and you will find it impossible to escape their double identity. The 'ultra-window' is a privileged post for those 'site-seers' of trans-modernism. The window doubles as an open and closed space, and this is accentuated in many thirties build- ings. Many builders in the thirties such as Helme, Corbett, Harrison, Sugarman and Burger transformed the 'window' into an art form.106 But we have to return to Dallas-Fort Worth to find the most direct evidence of Smithson's interest in windows. Of the thirteen drawings that remain from his work on the airport project, three - each dated 1967 and entitled Earth Window or Three Earth Windows - depict in plan and section versions of a construction that would emit light through horizontal squares seemingly cut into the surface of the earth and filled with crushed glass. In Three Earth Windows, each square is a different size and composed of a different number of similar units or panes. Nine, sixteen, and twenty-five smaller squares of glass are illuminated from below with stadium lights. Build- ing on his new knowledge of construction processes, the draw- ings entitled Earth Windows show concrete foundations, including weep holes to drain the flat surface. Another drawing shows his attempt to install his and other art- ists' proposals for the airport project for a 1967 exhibition. This 17. Airport site map, 1967 drawing is related to the earth windows and itself operates as a proto-non-site. Smithson's perspective depicts maps, objects, and drawings all deployed in a grid or in series on the floor, the wall, and what appears to be a mantle. In this way, Smithson has sited representations in the gallery and fictional- ized them as three-dimensional "physical metaphorical mate- rial." Thus, by the end of 1967, on the verge of his invention of the non-site, Smithson had reached a point in his thinking and writing where he not only employed architecture in his work and his criticism, but built his work and criticism as a sit- ing of architecture. Through his collaboration with architects on the airport project, Smithson's interest in and understand- ing of architecture - translated through his criticism and re- alized in his artwork - enabled him to devise entirely unprecedented modes of representation and a hybrid identity for the artist that would have been inconceivable without the architectural knowledge - from documents to monuments - he gained as an artist-consultant. It remains for architects to recuperate his offerings. 28</page><page sequence="24">Linder Notes References to Smithson's writings will cite the first published version.

These three sentences occupy an interesting "site" in Smithson's writ- ings. The essay, "The Artist as Site- Seer; or, A Dintorphic Essay," in Tsai, 74-80, is one of Smithson's most mannered: there is an endnote for each sentence. Tsai notes that the final five footnotes (71-75, in- cluding those for these three sen- tences) "have either been lost or never completed."

The term "transdisciplinary" is intended to apply to practices that view the exchange of concepts and techniques across disciplines in terms of translation. Such an ap- proach is distinct from more perva- sive notions of interdisciplinarity that endorse the crossing of disci- plines as a means to establish shared methods or concepts. Rather, as Homi Bhabha suggests, transdisciplinary work "happens at the edge or limit" of one's own discipline. "It is not an attempt to strengthen one foundation by draw- ing from another; it is a reaction to the fact that we are living at the real border of our own disciplines, where some of the fundamental ideas of our discipline are being profoundly shaken. So our inter- disciplinary moment is a move of survival - the formulation of knowledges that require our disci- plinary scholarship and technique but demand that we abandon disci- plinary mastery and surveillance."

Another key source is the numerous articles in the special issue of Arts Maga- zine 52 (May 1978): 96-144, on Smithson's work. 7. "Literalism" was Michael Fried's apt term for the work of artists such as Donald Judd, Robert Morris, and Tony Smith. Though intended as a derogatory label, the traits Fried identified as literalist - objecthood, duration, presence, theatricality, scale - are all distinctly architec- tural. The dictionary definition of literalism - "representation without idealization" - might well serve as Smithson's motto. Among the literal- ist artists who began to engage archi- tecture are Dan Graham, who had been photographing "typical subur- ban houses" beginning in "late 1965," although most of the photo- graphs are dated 1968. The article in which they first appeared, "Homes for America," was published in Arts Magazine (December 1966-January 1967): 21-22. On the chronology of the photographs, see Dan Graham, Rock My Religion, ed. Brian Wallis (Cambridge, Mass.: The MIT Press, 1993), 21. Graham also wrote a re- view of three quasi-architectural group shows ("Scale Models and Drawings" at Dwan, "Macrostruc- tures" at Richard Feigen, and "Ar- chitecture Sculpture, Sculpture Architecture" at Visual Arts) titled "Models and Monuments: The Plague of Architecture," Arts (March 1967): 32-34. Sol LeWitt, who worked for a time for I. M. Pei, published an short article titled "'Ziggurats': Liberating Set-backs to Architectural Fashion," Arts Maga- zine (November 1966): 24-25. 8. In Smithson's words: "I invented this job for myself as artist-consult- ant." See Paul Cummings, "Interview for the Archives of American Art," in Holt, 152. Smithson almost always noted his experience as an "artist-con- sultant" in the bios, however brief, he submitted to publications and galler- ies, beginning as early as May 1967 on a form for the Whitney Museum documenting their purchase of Alogon #1. Under the heading "Occu- pations other than artist" (one of the few categories he filled out) he wrote: "Bookstore clerk - 8th Street Bookshop, P.A.L. Teacher, "artist consultant" to Tippetts-Abbett- McCarthy-Stratton (engineers and ar- chitects)." See AAA 3832/982; also see AAA 3833/238, 449. 9. The symposium was sponsored by the Yale Art Association and was the School of Art and Architecture's of- fering for Alumni Week activities. Smithson's panel included Brian O'Doherty, John Hightower, and Paul Weiss. See AAA 3832/869-70, 892, 894-96. 10. The initial contract ran from 1 July to 31 December 1966 and was 29</page><page sequence="25">assemblage 39 apparently renewed for a second six- month term, after which Prokosch tactfully informed Smithson that the architects' contract with the Air- port Board no longer included funds for his position. See two let- ters from Walther Prokosch, AAA 3832/902 (20 July 1966) and 3832/ 999 (29 August 1967). 11. "I would say I began to function as a conscious artist around 1964-5. I think I started doing works then that were mature. I would say that prior to the 1964-5 period I was in a kind of groping, investigating pe- riod" (Cummings, "Interview for the Archives of American Art," 146). 12. "Entropy and the New Monu- ments," Artforum (June 1966): 26- 31, is ostensibly a review of the "Primary Structures" show at the Jewish Museum (27 April-12 June 1966), the first major exhibition of literalist sculpture, but Smithson had written it at least one month be- fore the show opened. 13. The continuous tradition of what I term pictorial formalist criticism in the English language began with Roger Fry's essays on "post-impres- sionism," persisted in Clement Greenberg's medium-specific mod- ernism of the 1940s and 1950s, and culminated in Michael Fried's revi- sion of Greenberg in the 1960s in es- says such as "Art and Objecthood," Artforum (June 1967), and "Shape as Form: Frank Stella's New Paint- ings," Artforum (November 1966). 14. This would be the theme of Smithson's contribution to the 1966 Yale symposium. "I guess a lot of my thinking about crystalline struc- tures came through there because I was discussing the whole city in terms of crystalline network" (Cummings, "Interview for the Ar- chives of American Art," 152). 15. The article is a result of a trip "to go rock hunting in New Jersey." This excursion is the prototype of the "site-selection" trips he would take with friends as part of the production of his non-sites. The first site-selec- tion trip was in December 1966 to the Paterson quarry with Nancy Holt and Robert Morris during which Holt took the well-known photo- graphs of Smithson and Morris scal- ing a chain-link fence to enter the quarry. The second trip was in April 1967 to the Pine Barrens and Atlan- tic City with Holt, Morris, Virginia Dwan, and Carl Andre. The third, unaccompanied trip was in October 1967 to Passaic. See Lawrence Alloway, "Sites/Nonsites," in Hobbs, Robert Smithson: Sculpture, 41. 16. Cummings, "Interview for the Archives of American Art," 147. 17. Schmidt, "Four Conversations," 96. This logic is first presented in "Towards the Development of an Air Terminal Site," Artforum (June 1967): 36-40, Smithson's first pub- lished account of his work on the Dallas-Fort Worth project. In this essay, Smithson moves from the ob- servation that "the maps that survey- ors develop from coordinating land and air masses resemble crystalline grid networks" through a discussion of Alexander Graham Bell's "prefab- ricated, standardized and crystal- line" kites and outdoor observation station (which Smithson called "lin- guistic objects") to the speculation that "we will someday see ... air- craft that will be more crystalline in shape" (37, 40). The last page of "Towards the De- velopment of an Air Terminal Site" is strikingly similar to the fifteen "new" segments of "The Artist as Site-Seer" (see n. 1 above): "The syntax of communication both in 'language' and 'buildings' can be identified with what we call the rel- evant features of structure. (76) The features common to buildings for example are windows, floors, walls, doors, stairs, etc. (77) Just as the features common to language are paragraphs, sentences, punctuation, words, etc. (78) In other words, buildings communicate a syntax the same as language. (79) This syntax may be entirely devoid of memories or it may be 'diseased' by them. (80) For example, the 'window' [scratched out: 'is diseased when it'] becomes that homeless architec- tural detail - the 'painting.' (81) The painting suffers according to the degree of paint on the surface. (82) The more a painting exists as a surface, the less it has to do with paint.' (83) Language is also dis- eased when too much expression fills the syntax. (84) Expressionism and Impressionism share a similar value. (85) Both those values tend toward a private rather than a pub- lic idea of the site. (86) The Impres- sionistic value 'paints on glass' so to speak and prevents, what I consider the more interesting value of trans- parence. (87) Material by seeking transparence, avoids the sicknesses of detail or meaning. (88) Here the usage of material proceeds [sic] old meanings. (89) It is the way the art- ist uses the site, rather than what the site means - be this building or language. (90)" 18. Cummings, "Interview for the Archives of American Art," 149. 19.

Another essay, "What Really Spoils Michelangelo's Sculpture" (1966-67), is an extended response to Clement Greenberg's contention in Art and Culture that "what really spoils Michelangelo's sculpture is not so much its naturalism as, on the contrary, its unnaturalistic exaggera- tions and distortions, which place themselves more in the context of pictorial illusion than in that of sculptural self-evidence." Smithson uses this quotation as one of his two epigraphs and writes in the first para- graph: "His [Michelangelo's] 'fig- ures' are geometric edifices, more like buildings than human beings." The essay ends: "In Michelangelo's cosmological system of figures the 30</page><page sequence="26">Linder direction is downward toward infin- ity.

Norvell, "Robert Smithson: Fragments of an Inter- view," in Six Years: The Dematerial- ization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972, ed. Lucy Lippard (New York: Praeger, 1972), 87-90: "The site se- lection is by chance. There is no willful choice. A site at degree zero, where the material strikes the mind, where absences become apparent, appeals to me, where the disintegrat- ing space and time seems very appar- ent. Sort of an end of selfhood ... the ego vanishes for a while." For more extensive descriptions and commentary on the non-sites, see Anthony Robbin, "Smithson's Non- site Sights," Art News (February 1969): 51-53, Hobbs, Robert Smithson: Sculpture, 104-27, and Alloway, "Sites/Nonsites," 41-46. 28. Smithson, "A Provisional Theory of Non-Sites," 364. 29. Smithson may have been react- ing specifically against Greenberg who explained the progress of mod- ern painting as away from the leg- ible diagram toward techniques of illusion: "Whereas space in depth in the abstract or near-abstract art of the 1920's and 1930's had been a matter largely of 'diagram' and asso- ciation, in the painterly 1940's and 1950's it could not help becoming once again a matter more of trompe- l'oeil illusion. Not that space in depth became deeper - not at all - but it did become more tangible, more a thing of immediate percep- tion and less one of 'reading"' (Greenberg, "After Abstract Expres- sionism," 24). 30. Norvell, "Robert Smithson: Fragments of an Interview," 88. In the Cummings interview, Smithson offers this explanation of his move from making sculptural objects to constructing non-sites: "I began to see things in a more relational way. In other words, I had to question - where the works were, what they were about. The very construction of the gallery with its neutral white walls became questionable. So I be- came interested in bringing atten- tion to the abstractness of the gallery as a room, and yet at the same time taking into account less neutral sites, you know, sites that would in a sense be neutralized by the gallery" (Cummings, "Interview for the Ar- chives of American Art," 155-56). Usually Smithson's explanations were more sophisticated, even enig- matic. For example, in his essay "A Sedimentation of the Mind," he writes that the non-site "actually ex- ists as a fragment of a greater frag- mentation. It is a three-dimensional perspective that has broken away from the whole, while containing the lack of its own containment" (Robert Smithson, "A Sedimenta- tion of the Mind: Earth Projects," Artforum [September 1968]: 50). 31. Smithson, "A Provisional Theory of Non-Sites," 364. 32. The most didactic of the non- sites in regard to the conventions of painting is the Mono Lake Non-Site, which takes the form of a rectangu- lar loop, mimicking the ecologically unique shoreline of the volcanic lake and resembling an empty pic- ture frame. For Clement Greenberg on the inside and outside of paint- ing, see "Our Period Style," Parti- san Review (November 1949): 1136: "inside and outside are interwoven. The artist no longer seals his figure or construction off from the rest of space behind an impenetrable sur- face, but instead permits space to enter into its core and the core to reach out into and organize the am- bience." Also see idem, "Abstract and Representational," Art Digest (November 1954): 7: "The picture has now become an object of liter- ally the same spatial order as our bodies and no longer the vehicle of an imagined equivalent of that or- der. It has lost its 'inside' and be- come all 'outside,' all plane surface [and] the abstract... picture ... re- turns [the spectator] to that space in all its brute literalness." 33. While Smithson's remarks refer specifically to fringes and interiors, it should be noted that the general center/edge dialectic is also at work in Fried's notion of deductive struc- ture. See Fried, Three American Painters, 41-42, and idem, "Shape as Form," 18, 24. 34. See Michael Heizer, Dennis Oppenheim, and Robert Smithson, "Discussions with Heizer, Oppen- heim, Smithson," Avalanche 1 (Fall 1970): 63. The Cummings inter- view ends with a similar but less specific speculation: "it got me to think about large land areas and the dialogue between the terminal and the fringe of the terminal - once again, between the center and the edge of things. This has been a sort of ongoing preoccupation with me, part of the dialectic between the inner and the outer" (Cummings, "Interview for the Archives of American Art," 156). For more on this "preoccupation," see William Lipke, ed., "Fragments of a Conver- sation" (1969), in Holt, 168. 35. The quotation continues: "In fact, the entire air terminal may be considered conceptually as an artifi- cial universe, and as everyone knows everything in the known universe isn't entirely visible. There is no reason why one shouldn't look at art through a telescope" (Robert Smithson, "Aerial Art," Studio Inter- national [April 1969]: 180). 36.

Eva Schmidt, who edited and annotated "Four Conversations be- tween Dennis Wheeler and Robert Smithson," mentions that Smithson derived the fiction-myth dichotomy from a theory first proposed in 1965 by Frank Kermode (in Tsai, 125). See Frank Kermode, The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction (New York: Oxford Univer- sity Press, 1967), 39. Smithson may have been attracted to this book because it was first presented as a lecture series titled "The Long Per- spective," at Bryn Mawr College in October and November 1965. Kermode distinguished between myths - "which presuppose total and adequate explanations of things as they are and were" - and fic- tions - which "can degenerate into myths whenever they are not con- sciously held to be fictive .... Fic- tions are for finding things out, and they change as the needs of sense- making change. Myths are the agents of stability, fictions the agents of change. Myths call for 31</page><page sequence="27">assemblage 39 f / 'I" P05 , too 18. Perspective drawing for Pointless Vanishing Point, 1967. ? Estate of Robert Smithson. absolute, fictions for conditional as- sent." The forms of fiction that most inspired Smithson were popular science fiction and the writings of Jorge Luis Borges. In his writings, Smithson referred to the theories of Roland Barthes more often than Kermode's. For more on Smithson's notion of fiction, see, for example, "A Museum of Language in the Vicinity of Art," Art International (March 1968): 24: "When the word 'fiction' is used, most of us think of literature, and practically never of fictions in a general sense. The ra- tional notion of 'realism,' it seems, has prevented esthetics from com- ing to terms with the place of fic- tion in all the arts. Realism does not draw from the direct evidence of the mind, but rather refers back to 'naturalistic expressiveness' or 'slices of life.' This happens when art competes with life, and esthetics is replaced by rational imperatives. The fictional betrays its privileged position when it abdicates to mind- less 'realism.' The status of fiction has vanished into the myth of fact. It is thought that facts have a greater reality than fiction - that 'science fiction' through the myth of progress becomes 'science fact.' Fiction is not believed to be part of the world. Rationalism confines fic- tion to literary categories in order to protect its own interests or systems of knowledge." For Smithson's most explicit rejection of natural- ism and realism, see "What Really Spoils Michelangelo's Sculpture," 71-73: "Could it not be that great art has a 'knowledge' of corruption while 'natural' art is innocent of its own cor- ruption because it is mindless and idealess? ... Mindless abstraction is not abstraction, it is merely realistic naturalism without any figures ... Stylistic criticism, with its overused categories of 'painting, sculpture, and architecture,' fails to see beyond real- ism and naturalism." 39. See Robert Smithson, "The Ico- nography of Desolation" (ca. 1962), in Tsai, 61-68, idem, "The Shape and the Future of Memory" (1966), in Holt, 211, and idem, "The Crystal Land," Harper's Bazaar (May 1966): 72-73. 40. Smithson, "Quasi-Infinities and the Waning of Space," 32-36. Some parts of this text are fragments that had been discarded from other writ- ings or that appear in various places in his notebooks. Much of the writing in "Quasi-Infinities" is culled from "The Pathetic Fallacy in Esthetics," in Flam, 337-38. Also, one page in a notebook (probably from 1966) has the title "The Magazine as Quasi-Ob- ject" and includes this statement: "If we consider magazines in terms of space and form we discover rectangu- lar sheets composed of strata" (AAA 3834/84). 41. Smithson wrote in "A Sedimenta- tion of the Mind," 50: "A great artist can make art by simply casting a glance. A set of glances could be as solid as any thing or place, but the so- ciety continues to cheat the artist out of his 'art of looking,' by only valuing 'art objects."' 42. The opening sentence reads: "Around four blocks of print I shall postulate four ultramundane margins that shall contain indeterminate infor- mation as well as reproduced repro- ductions." In the galleys the first sentence reads: "Around a series of inaccessible abstractions, I shall con- struct an inaccessible system that has no inside or outside, but only the di- mension of reproduced reproduc- tions" (AAA 3834/1060). 43. Leo Steinberg, "Reflections on the State of Criticism," Artforum (March 1972): 41. This essay is based on a lecture at given at the Museum of Modern Art in March 1968. It was republished with addi- tions to the beginning of the essay as "Other Criteria," in Other Crite- ria: Confrontations with Twentieth- Century Art (New York: Oxford University Press, 1972), 55-91. 44. Steinberg, "Reflections on the State of Criticism," 49. 45. In his published writings, Smithson first mentions "printed- matter" in "Entropy and the New Monuments," 29: "Like the movies and the movie houses, 'printed mat- ter' plays an entropic role. Maps, charts, advertisements, art books, science books, money, architectural plans, math books, graphs, diagrams, newspapers, comic books, booklets and pamphlet from industrial com- panies are all treated the same. Judd has a labyrinthine collection of 'printed matter,' some of which he 'looks' at rather than reads. By this means he might take a math equa- tion, and by sight, translate it into a mental progression of structured in- tervals. In this context, it is best to think of 'printed-matter' the way Borges thinks of it, as 'The universe (which others call the library),' or like McLuhan's 'Gutenberg Galaxy,' in other words as an unending 'li- brary of Babel."' 46. Douglas Crimp has written that Rauschenberg's "combines" employ "a radically different pictorial logic." See "On the Museum's Ru- ins," in The Anti-Aesthetic, ed.

An early example of such a "building" is "The Domain of the Great Bear," which Smithson de- scribed in Cummings, "Interview for the Archives of American Art," 156: "In 1966 I did an article with Mel Bochner on the Hayden Plan- etarium which, once again, was sort of an investigation of a specific place; but not on the level of sci- ence, but in terms of discussing the actual construction of the building; once again, an almost anthropologi- cal study of the planetarium from the point of view of an artist." 49.

Wittgenstein's Philosophical In- vestigations begins (S2-21) with the famous parable portraying "a tribe" whose "whole language" includes only "the words 'block,' 'pillar,' 'slab,' 'beam."' A few paragraphs later, to support his notion that such a primitive language is possibly a whole language, Wittgenstein intro- duces the claim that "for a large class of cases - though not for all - in which we employ the word 'meaning' it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language" (Philosophical Investiga- tions, trans. G. E. M. Anscombe, 3d ed. [New York: Macmillan, 1953]). 53. Perhaps the best examples occur in "A Sedimentation of the Mind," where, for example, Smithson writes: "Look at any word long enough and you will see it open up into a series of faults" (49). 54.

Smithson, "Pointless Vanishing Points," 209; Schmidt, "Four Con- versations," 104. 65. Smithson wrote a final paragraph to "Pointless Vanishing Points" that is not included in Flam or Holt: "My Three Sided Vortices of 1966 may be viewed as three-dimensional examples of Leon Battista Alberti's idea of perspective as 'an intersec- tion of the pyramid by a vertical plane' (see Perspective by G. Ten Doesschate M.D.) or what Euclid called a cone, except in the case of my Vortices the pyramid is inverted and made of mirrored vanishing points that converge into a central per- spective. As a result the planes of the vanishing points are reflected into a multiplication of faceted frag- ments, that radiate from a center point - all this is contained within a steel box, or a cubic camera obscura. The Four Sided Vortices extends this triplex conception to quadruplex conception. All these vortices evade photography, because the inside of the vortices are partially eclipsed by the outside. Only when the camera enters the vortices in an aerial position can the inside be seen, and the camera is reflected in the mirrors" (AAA 3834/45-47). 66. Smithson's "A Short Description of Two Mirrored Crystal Structures" reads in part: "Both structures have symmetric frameworks, these frame- works are on top of the faceted mir- rored surfaces, rather than hidden behind the surfaces. The frameworks have broken through the surfaces, so to speak, and have become 'paintings.' ... Each framework supports the re- flections of a concatenated interior. The interior structure of the room sur- rounding the work is instantaneously undermined. The surfaces seem thrown back into the wall. 'Space' is permuted into a multiplicity of direc- tions. One becomes conscious of space attenuated in the form of elusive flat planes. The space is both crystal- line and collapsible. In the rose [-col- ored] piece the floor hovers over the ceiling. Vanishing points are deliber- ately inverted in order to increase one's awareness of total artifice" (328). 67. The drawing, Three Works in Metal and Plastic, 8.5" x 11", ink on typing paper, is also reproduced in Tsai, 152. See as well AAA 3834/96 (probably 1966): At the end of a short paragraph titled "The Morphology of Mirrors," Smithson scratched out: "The mental architecture of the South American Jorge Luis Borges gives us many clues about the look- ing-glass world." 68. Robert Smithson, "The Cryo- sphere," in Primary Structures (New York: Jewish Museum, 1966), n.p. 69. Smithson's notebooks are filled with remarks on mirrors. See his let- ter of 12 October 1967 to James Fitzsimons (AAA 3832/1002-4) as well as "An Infinity of Mirrors" (AAA 3834/92) and "A Morphology of Mir- rors" (AAA 3834/96) in a 1966 note- book. The latter reads in part: "This will be an attempt to consider mir- rors apart from their function. The content that each one of us sees ev- ery morning in the mirror will not be our prime concern. Instead, we shall consider the mirror as a formal or structural medium. Spatially speaking the mirror surface is pre- cise but ungraspable, extensive but impenetrable." 70. Pointless Vanishing Point, Lean- ing Strata, and Shift were all shown in Smithson's March 1968 show at the Dwan Gallery. Also, Smithson included a photograph of Plunge in "Towards the Development of an Air Terminal Site," cropping it to suggest that the upper-left-hand cor- ner was a vanishing point. Photo- graphs of Alogon have similar, but less contrived implications. 71. He may also be recalling Greenberg's exhibition at LACMA in the spring of 1964 and his cata- logue essay "Post Painterly Ab- straction," which was additionally published in Art International (Summer 1964): 63-65. See, for ex- ample, Smithson's mention of "Post Painterly Abstraction" in his essay "Abstract Mannerism" (1966-67), in Flam, 339. 72. In "Towards the Development of an Air Terminal Site," 37, Smithson extends these logics to what he calls 33</page><page sequence="29">assemblage 39 "aerosurveying" of a "high altitude satellite. The farther out an object goes in space, the less it represents the old rational idea of visible speed. The stream-lines of space are re- placed by the crystalline structure of time." He also relates it to all sorts of grids, including "our city system of avenues and streets. In short, all air and land is locked into a vast lattice." 73. Smithson, "Pointless Vanishing Points," 208. 74. In Robert Smithson: Sculpture, 103, Robert Hobbs describes Lean- ing Strata as one of several projects in which Smithson "conflates two systems for representing space- perspective and cartography." Mihai Craciun, in a student project at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, has suggested that a similar reading of Marcel Breuer's trapezoi- dal windows at the Whitney Mu- seum (completed 1966) is possible. 75. Smithson was an attentive reader of Greenberg and Fried, al- though most of his more elaborate remarks and critiques of their posi- tion were not published in his life- time. An obvious exception is his "Letter to the Editor" written in re- sponse to "Art and Objecthood" and published in the October 1967 Artforum, in which Smithson sati- rized "Fried, the orthodox modern- ist, the keeper of the gospel of Clement Greenberg" who "is trying hard not to fall from the 'grip' of grace." Directly contradicting Greenberg's loathing for manner- ism, Smithson credits Fried with having "set the critical stage for manneristic modernism." He thereby turns the tables on his ad- versaries and recuperates formalism in his otherwise heretical criticism. See Greenberg, "After Abstract Ex- pressionism," 25: "Badness becomes endemic to a manner only when it hardens into mannerism." 76. Smithson, "The Iconography of Desolation," 64. 77. Smithson also mentions Green- berg in "Donald Judd," "Abstract Mannerism," "Ultramoderne," "Outline for a Yale Symposium: Against Absolute Categories" (1968), in Holt, 218, and "Frederick Law Olmsted and the Dialectical Landscape," Artforum 11 (February 1972): 62-68. 78. Smithson, "Pathetic Fallacy in Esthetics," 337-88. Also see Bruce Kurtz, "Conversation with Robert Smithson on April 22nd, 1972," The Fox II (1975): 72: "You're supposed to not even think of the wall that the painting is hanging on. You're supposed to just respond metaphysi- cally to the painting in terms of color, line, structure, you know, and talk about the framing support, but forget about where you're standing, where you are and the ambience of the entire space." 79. In "The Pathetic Fallacy in Es- thetics," which contains several par- allel phrases to "Quasi-Infinities," Smithson makes a direct connection between Greenberg and Wilhelm Worringer's ideas of abstraction and space: "As Worringer pointed out in his Abstraction and Empathy any will toward space is not an abstract concern. Critics who interpret art in terms of space see the history of art as a reduction of three-dimensional illusionistic space to 'the same order of space as our bodies' (Greenberg-- Abstract, Representational and so forth). Here Greenberg equates 'space' with 'our bodies' and inter- prets this reduction as abstract. The fallacy here is a self identification with space, that is less abstract than the so called representational 'Old Masters.' The closer one gets to space as a measure of man the less it has to do with the abstract." 80. This remark is edited out of published versions in Tsai and Flam. See AAA 3833/1127. Also see AAA 3833/1105: "In terms of Michael Fried, even though he's an adversary of mine, I respect the syn- tax of his delivery." 81. Smithson, "A Sedimentation of the Mind," 109. 82. Smithson refers to an article on Caro "with photographs of his sculp- ture in settings and landscapes that suggest English gardening. One work, Prima Luce 1966, painted yellow, matches the yellow daffodils peeking our behind it, and it sits on a well cut lawn.... Somehow, Caro's work picks up it surroundings, and gives one a sense of a contrived, but tamed, 'wildness' that echoes the traditions of English gardening.... The traces of weak naturalism cling to the back- ground of Caro's Prima Luce." He then satirizes "Clement Greenberg's notion of 'the landscape"' and "Angli- cizing tastes" (ibid., 46). 83. Robert Smithson, "Colossal Nullifications (Part I)" (1966), in Flam, 331. 84. Apparently aware of Smithson's query in "The Monuments of Passaic" - "Has Passaic replaced Rome as the eternal city?" - Smithson's friend Howard Junker sent him a copy of an excerpt from Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown's Learning from Las Vegas, published in Architectural Forum in March 1968, three months after "Passaic." See AAA 3832/832-41. Also see AAA 3836/306-9, which consists of marked-up galleys for an article (source unknown) titled "Bedding Down in Bali, Brasilia, or Bimini" that includes excerpts, some of which discuss airports, from George Nelson, "Architecture for the New Itinerants," Saturday Re- view, 22 April 1967, 30-31. 85. The artifacts that Smithson iden- tifies as "The Monuments of Passaic" - concrete abutments, bridges, waste pipes, parking lots, and so on - would normally be cat- egorized as infrastructure, a particu- larly interesting terminology considering that soon after the ar- ticle appeared he would write a letter to Martin Friedman, the director of the Walker Art Center, describing his own artwork as "infraphysical" (which he opposed to his use of the word "metaphysical" in an earlier conversation, with its implications of the idealism of conceptual art, which he did not support). Smithson explained: "By infra I mean an order that is not visible to the natural eye, but rather an order that remains hid- den until it is made physical by the artist." See undated draft of letter (probably early 1968), AAA 3834/49; Smithson would receive a letter in reply dated 5 March 1968. AAA 3832/1053. Smithson's use of certain prefixes is consistent enough to sug- gest clear meanings in his criticism. "Ultra" suggests his notion of man- nerism and the literary or metaphori- cal dimension of materials. "Quasi" implies various hybrid conditions or confusions with affinities to Rauschenberg's "combines." "Infra" relates to what Smithson called "contraction"; that is, raw physicality and literalness. In "A Museum of Language in the Vicinity of Art," Smithson coined the term "infra- criticism" to characterize the writing of several artists in his circle; his es- say discusses the writings of Dan Fla- vin, Carl Andre, Robert Morris, Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt, Ad Reinhardt, Peter Hutchinson, and Dan Graham, as well as Andy Warhol's interviews. 86. Norvell, "Robert Smithson: Fragments of an Interview," 89. In this interview, Smithson calls both 34</page><page sequence="30">Linder the non-site and photography "con- tractions" and implies that ordinary language should be understood conversely as an expansion. 87. See the letter from Prokosch, 20 July 1966, AAA 3832/902. 88. Cummings, "Interview for the Archives of American Art," 152. In "Towards the Development of an Air Terminal Site," one paragraph explains Smithson's fascination with the early parts of the building process and two photographs of dif- ferent dams at different stages of construction illustrate how build- ings move from a "discrete stage" as a "work of art" (during construc- tion) to a functioning "utility." 89. Kurtz, "Conversation with Rob- ert Smithson," 73: "Architecture is built by computers. People have all these statistics going on in their heads, so that they'll do something based on that level, completely de- tached from any kind of physicality of the site." 90. Cummings, "Interview for the Ar- chives of American Art," 152. At a symposium for an exhibition titled "Earth," at the White Museum, Cornell University, on 6 February 1969, Smithson's opening statement was: "I first got involved in the earth project situation when I was con- tracted to do some work for an architectural company as an artist consultant, and they asked me to give them suggestions on what to do with sculpture and things like that. I felt it was wrong to consider sculpture as an object that you would tack onto a building after the building is done, so I worked with these architects from the ground up. As a result I found myself surrounded by all this material that I didn't know anything about - like aerial photographs, maps, large- scale systems" (in Holt, 160). 91. As a result, the architects decided to terminate Smithson's contract sev- eral months before they learned that the Airport Board would terminate theirs. Also see the letter from Prokosch dated 21 December 1967, AAA 3832/1017, granting permission (but also disclaiming financial or other responsibility) to Smithson to publish an article and to stage an "Airport Sculpture" exhibition to tour Europe. 92.

In December 1966, Mel Bochner staged an exhibit titled, "Working Drawings and Other Vis- ible Things on Paper Not Necessar- ily Meant To Be Viewed As Art" at the Visual Arts Gallery of the School of Visual Arts, New York University. Smithson, as well as Flavin, Judd, LeWitt, Andre, Eva Hesse, "and poet Dan Graham," among others, were invited to participate. See the letter from the Visual Arts Gallery dated 10 October 1966, AAA 3832/ 922.: "The objective of the exhibi- tion is to present such divergent visual phenomena as working draw- ings by artists, industrial drawings, engineering plans, musical scores such as those by John Cage, math- ematical diagrams, computer data sheets and programs, and certain graphic poetry. The premise is to present work which is not based on preconceived aesthetic assumptions common to most visual art. . . . Most of the material will be in black and white, blueprint or zerox [sic]." 99. AAA 3834/170. 100. AAA 3834/182. 101. Smithson, "A Museum of Lan- guage in the Vicinity of Art," 21. 102. Ibid. Four years later, Smithson would offer a more con- ventional, but parallel critique of actual museums: "Museums, like asylums or jails, have wards and cells - in other words, neutral rooms called 'galleries.' A work of art when placed in a gallery loses its charge, and becomes a portable ob- ject or surface disengaged from the outside world. A vacant white room with lights is still a submission to the neutral" (Robert Smithson, "Cultural Confinement," Artforum [October 1972]: 32). 103.

Robert Smithson, "Untitled (Site Data)" (1968), in Flam, 362- 63. In another piece of writing, Smithson opposes these two terms: settings are the stage for "happen- ings," while sites are "empty or ab- stract settings," such as "landscapes without the look of history," "build- ings' (suburban factories, rectilinear interiors and exteriors) hard, impen- etrable surfaces," or "museums without painting and sculpture, lots without cars, shopping centers with- out commodities, office buildings without business activities" (Robert Smithson, "Sites and Settings" [1968], in Flam, 362). 105.

The asterisk in the quotation refers to the essay's single footnote, which reads: "Impressionism is a popular theory derived from 'sym- bolist theory.' It has nothing to do with individual artists. I use the word 'impressionism' according to its recent linguistic mutation. The original meaning of the word is less important than its recent usage. We are not concerned with what 'im- pressionism' was but rather with what it is today. But it should be re- membered that symbolist theory is prior to impressionist theory."
