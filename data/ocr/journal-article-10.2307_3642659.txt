<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BEGINNINGS OF THE USE OF CLAY IN TURKEY* By DENISE SCHMANDT-BESSERAT University of Texas at Austin Palaeolithic assemblages in the Near East do not yield any clay artifacts. During the Mesolithic period clay objects begin to appear as rarities but with the begin- ning of the Neolithic one witnesses a proliferation of uses of clay for architecture, house furnishings, firing devices, containers, and a variety of objects. Suddenly the villages seem to consist entirely of clay. I have been puzzled by the seemingly long indifference of man towards a material as easy to work with and as accessible as clay, followed by a sudden floruit. I have tried to find out more about the beginnings of the use of clay and have studied Near Eastern clay collections looking for answers to three questions: (1) When did clay begin to be used? (2) What is the evolutionary pattern of the first uses of clay? (3) What gave clay its sudden importance? I first tackled these problems in the Zagros and in Syria.1 The present paper is a review of the first evidences of the use of clay in Anatolia. (1) THE DATE OF THE EARLIEST CLAY ARTIFACTS INANATOLIA It is around 8500-8000 B.C. that clay artifacts make their appearance in Anatolia at Beldibi.2 Beldibi is a cave site where a long sequence of occupation can be followed from lower Palaeolithic to Chalcolithic. The earliest clay artifacts appear in layer B, levels 8-9, for which there is unfortunately no C14 dating available; the date 8500-8000 B.C. is in fact an educated guess. A date around the middle of the IXth Millennium for the appearance of the first evidence of the use of clay is certainly not surprising and, on the contrary, is perfectly in accordance with the rest of the Near East, in particular the Zagros and Syria, where the first clay artifacts were evidenced at Tepe Asiab3 and Tell Mureybat,4 both belonging to this range of time. What is surprising is that the earliest clay artifacts of Beldibi consist of a conspicuously evolved pottery which does not give the impression of the beginning of a craft. At Tepe Asiab, for instance, the earliest clay objects are minute hand-modelled clay figurines, and lightly fired beads and geometric objects. At Mureybat clay is first used as mortar and plaster for architecture. In both the Zagros and Syria, pottery appears only one millennium after these first attempts at working clay. It somehow does not seem likely that in Anatolia the potter's craft could have developed without any preliminary stage of clay manipulation and it seems obvious that we are missing the true beginning of the use of clay. The first dated clay artifacts in Anatolia are found at Aplkli Hiiyiiuk and *For acknowledgements see p. 199. 1Denise Schmandt-Besserat. "The Use of Clay before Pottery in the Zagros."

We have, therefore, to admit that the first question concerning the date of the first use of clay in Anatolia cannot yet be answered satisfactorily. At the present time no open-air IXth Millennium settlement has been excavated or even located in Anatolia and it is probably there that the answer is still lying. This answer will either confirm the Beldibi findings, or more likely, provide them with a meaningful origin. (2) THE EVOLUTION OF THE USE OF CLA YIN ANATOLIA Clay has numerous properties, four of which were utilized early: (1) It is a plastic material which can easily be moulded into a variety of objects and be worked by the artist in relief or in the round; (2) its hardness and resistance when dried make it similar to stone and therefore it can be used in architecture; (3) it is an insulator against heat, frost and sun radiation, as well as against pests such as insects and rodents, and therefore is useful for storage of goods; it can be fired and used for watertight containers; (4) it is a fireproof material ideal for building hearths, ovens and kilns. The earliest evidences of the use of clay in Anatolia appear at a stage in which all these properties are already fully recognized and utilized. This again suggests that we are lacking information concerning a first stage of experimenta- tion with the properties of clay. Therefore I propose to divide the evolution of the use of clay in Anatolia into three phases: Phase I: prior to 7500 B.C., adaptation state, yet unknown. Phase II: 7500-6800 B.C., featuring a wide use of clay for geometric objects, figurines, containers, architecture, heating and storage units. Phase III: 6800-5800 B.C., exhibiting improvements and increases in the use of the previous technologies, the appearance of stamp seals, wall reliefs and household furnishings. It is during this phase that clay is generally adopted in all sites. Phase I The pottery of Beldibi consists of a reddish ware tempered with grit and shell.7 The walls vary in thickness ranging between 1 5 and 1 cm. Some sherds are thoroughly baked while others exhibit a black core. Hardness is likewise inconsistent, ranging from hard to soft. The specimens are mostly small bowls and jars with thick bottoms and plain rims (Plate XXIVa). The earliest pottery in the Zagros is at Ganj Dareh Tepe,8 level D, dated c. 7500 B.C., where simple goblets of a crumbly untempered light-brown ware have been found. The origin of the Beldibi ware, as we stated above, is presently a puzzle. It does not seem likely that the pottery craft had developed in the Beldibian culture, as earlier levels do not evidence any use of clay. It seems to be a sudden intrusion of a fully evolved Neolithic product in a remaining late Palaeolithic or Mesolithic assem- 6H. (ambel and R. J. Braidwood, "An Early Farming Village in Turkey."

We are left with the hypothesis that the technique of making pottery containers may have been borrowed by the Beldibian cave dwellers from some other yet unknown culture. The beginning of our Phase I therefore remains unknown and only hypothetical. Phase II This phase has yielded the earliest well-dated clay artifacts known presently in Anatolia and extends between c. 7500 and 6800 B.C. Seven sites have been studied for this period. Three of them, Beldibi (Stratum B), A§ikll Hiuyuik, Hacilar (Aceramic I-VII)9 in southern and central Anatolia, and (ay6on Tepesi (I-VI) in the Piedmont, have yielded clay remains while the remaining sites: Karain (Stratum II),10 Belbapl (Stratum 11)," Carkini and Okiizini12 have revealed none. Architecture Architecture represents quantitatively the first most substantial use of clay in Anatolia. While Beldibi is a cave dwelling with no visible inner structure, A§ikh Hiiyiuk, Cay6nii Tepesi, and Hacilar are full-blown villages where perman- ent housing involves clay in various fashions. Aikll Hiiyik represents the earliest architecture of Anatolia involving clay almost exclusively; unfortunately the site is known only from surface collection and observation of eroded sections above a river. We know it was already an elaborate brick architecture. The walls of the houses were built with a double row of bricks c. 60 cm. wide and 5-5 cm. thick. The floors were covered with a hard, burnished plaster, which curved up the wall probably forming a dado.13 Samples of the floors should be processed in an attempt to determine whether the material was clay or whether it was gypsum (involving the heating of Ca S04 . 2 H2 O to a temperature of 100-200°C) or lime (involving the heating of Ca C03 to a temperature of about 900°C). At (ayonii Tepesi the houses are also built of mud bricks but this time laid upon stone foundations, and clay is also used for plastering floors. A building with a grid foundation was probably prepared with a filling of vegetable matter levelling the grid before the addition of a thick clay floor (Plate XXIVb).l4 In a later phase, the floor of a buttressed building with a single room was built in an elaborate terrazzo technique. It consisted of red pebbles on a reddish background and was enhanced by two pairs of white parallel lines at both ends of the room.15 9 J. Mellaart. Excavations at Hacllar, Vol. I.

The house walls were 20-30 cm. thick, built of a single row of greenish clay bricks measuring c. 72 x 28 x 8 cm., and laid in a black mortar (Plate XXVa). Bonding was frequently used at the corer. The walls were probably faced with clay. The floors were prepared with a base of small pebbles or stones, covered with a thin layer of fine red stained clay; replastering was frequently done and several superimposed layers are often found. The courtyard walls had stone foundations and were built with a double row of bricks; their floors were covered with a simple layer of clay.16 Phase II thus exhibits a fully developed architecture involving sophisticated techniques such as brickmaking, bonding and terrazzo floors. Similar techniques are used at a comparable date in the Zagros except for terrazzo floors, which appear only c. 6300 B.C. in Tepe Guran M.17 The lack of excavation of earlier sites prevents us from tracing the origins of architecture in Anatolia. Like in the Zagros, wattle and daub may have been followed by simple methods, such as simply packing clay, piled with clay slabs and pise. Usage of mud bricks is one of the main components for the formation of mounds, and it is to be expected that the sites with most surviving architecture are most conspicuous and should attract excavators first. Stone walls of course also led to the formation of mounds, but the stones were used again and again and the mounds did not get so high. There is no doubt that once a greater variety of sites has been investigated in Anatolia, other building techniques will emerge from this period and possibly earlier. House Furnishings The only house furnishings made of clay consist of raised clay platforms in Hacllar, where saddlequers and mortars were embedded to facilitate grinding of the cereals.18 Storage Facilities In Hacilar, bins are usually found in the courtyards.19 In a house of level II, a circular depression in the floor was probably used as a basin; the surrounding area was left in reserve in a rectangular surface c. 6 ft2 on the red stained floor.20 In Hacilar VI, rectangular clay bins were lined against the wall of a house (Plate XXVb), and in the same level a cupboard was built of clay. The access to the stored items was through peep holes (Plate XXVIa). Heating Units Little emphasis has been given so far to the discovery of clay as a refractory material. It was, however, an important step which led to the mastery of fire in ovens and kilns and allowed the progress of numerous crafts such as pottery and 16J. Mellaart.

The preparation of the domestic hearth with clay was one of the simplest methods of utilizing this property. At Hacilar the hearths were simple depressions in the house floors, prepared with a bed of stones and pebbles lined with clay and surrounded with a mud-brick curb plastered with clay both inside and outside; in level IV the structure seems to become even more elaborate and to have had wooden posts around it.21 In level II a rectangular feature surround- ed with a curb represented a double hearth (Plate XXVIb). Ovens were probably a familiar feature in each household and they may have been opened at the top just like modern Near Eastern bread ovens. At Hacilar the ovens were generally laid on an oval or rectangular plan over a pebble and stone base lined with clay (Plate XXVIIa). They were grouped with the hearths on the courtyards.22 Fire boxes with thin clay partitions to hold the burning coals were present in level VI (Plate XXVIIb). The use of clay as a refractory material probably implied the realization of the hardening effect of firing. It certainly occurred as early as the VIIIth Millennium B.C. in the Zagros and even as early as 25,000 B.C. at Dolni Vestonice in Europe.23 Clay Objects The number of clay objects recovered for this period is low when compared to the rich clay assemblages of contemporary Zagros. None appeared in Beldibi, A§lkll Hiyiuk and even Hacilar. There are only a few beads, figurines and geometric objects at qayonui Tepesi. Figurines Anthropomorphic figurines of several types occur at CayBnii Tepesi. The only published example represents a female sitting on square buttocks. She has no head, no arms and the torso is reduced to a blunt tip over a rounded belly and a sharply incurving back. No breast or sex is indicated but the thighs are definitely feminine; the two parallel legs are usually broken but seem to end as rounded or pointed stumps at the height of the knee.24 This type is very similar to the "intermediate seated" samples from Jarmo.25 Animal figurines are more common than human figurines.26 A double-wing base object consisting of a small round hump, centred on an elongated flat base is present in the assemblage of (ayonui Tepesi.27 Such objects have been found in a number of Near Eastern sites. At Tepe Asiab they are made of two pieces, the centre piece being long and pointed;28 they are called "T-shaped figurines" 21Ibid., pp. 71-2. 22Ibid. 23B. Klima.

They all await an interpretation.32 Geometric Objects Little attention has been paid so far to a series of puzzling, minute objects moulded into definite geometric shapes such as spheres, cones, tetrahedrons, discs and cylinders, and suggesting a precise purpose (Plate XXIXa). Geometric objects found at Cay6ni include several spheres and cones33 carefully made and exhibiting regular features and smooth surfaces. The spheres, usually ranging between 5 mm.-l cm. in diameter were probably rolled between the palms of the hand. The cones, usually 1-2 cm. at the base and in height, were probably shaped between the top of the fingers: they have a perfectly flat base, flaring sides and a blunt tip. The clay used for their manufacture is consistently fine and there is nothing to suggest any tempering. The surface colour is highly variable ranging from buff and reddish to gray and black, suggesting firing in a hearth with variable atmosphere, oxidizing at the periphery, and reducing in the median. Analysis on Zagros samples exhibiting the same characteristics deter- mined a firing teniperature of 400-500°C, which is within the range of temperature achieved in a hearth and thus supports the above assumption.34 The firing of the small objects suggests that their particular function required a certain permanence. The fact that numerous identical objects have recurrently been found in many sites in the Near East makes them very puzzling. Generally they are made of clay as previously described, but isolated examples are made of stone, and a series of three spheres, seven discs, and one cylinder made from ochre were found in Beldibi B, levels 9-8.35 The following chart plotting their occurrence shows three striking characteristics: (1) They have a very wide distribution in time and are found with consistency from the IXth Millennium B.C. in Tepe Asiab and Ganj Dareh Tepe to the IVth Millennium B.C. in Susa. (2) They have a wide distribution in space and were found from Beldibi in southwestern Anatolia to Anau on the eastern side of the Caspian Sea (a distance of about 1,400 km.) and as far south as Jericho in Palestine and even Khartoum in the Sudan. (3) They may be found in great number. For instance, the 29 F. Hole, et al. Prehistory and Human Ecology of the Deh Luran Plain.

The only reaction they have stirred was an occasional wonder on the part of their finder, such as C. S. Coon describing the five cones from Belt Cave as "looking like nothing in the world but suppositories";38 and D. Evett classifying those from Tal-i-lblis under the heading "mystery objects".39 The cones, spheres, discs and various other shapes, although they recurrently occur together, have never been seen as belonging together; they are sometimes assigned different functions such as "nails", "polishers", "plugs", "gaming pieces", or "female symbols" for the cones, "slingstones" or "marbles" for the spheres, and "potlids" for the discs. Solutions to this riddle may be provided by the bullae found in the archives of Susa,40 in Nineveh,41 Warka,42 Tchogha Mish,43 Shah Dad,44 and Tepe Yahya45 (Plate XXIXb). These bullae, which date from the IVth Millennium B.C., are spherical clay envelopes as big as a tennis ball, enclosing the small geometric objects: cones, tetrahedrons, spheres, 3/4 spheres, oval pellets, discs, cylinders, etc. They represent records of transactions, and each geometric object within is a calculus standing for a specific item while its size and number expresses the quantity of the exchange. The calculi reveal the existence of a three-dimensional system of recording information before the development of writing. No bulla is yet known to have existed prior to the IVth Millennium, but calculi identical in shape, size and technique of manufacture are consistently found loose (they may have been kept in perishable containers such as skin bags) as far back as the IXth Millennium B.C. This dis- closure implies that the five millennia of history characterized by writing could have been preceded by another five millennia characterized by a three- dimensional system of recording. Transition between the two systems is tangible on a few bullae where, for double checking or for easier reading, the shape and number of the calculi enclosed was represented on the surface of the bulla by impressed circular and conical marks. These conical and circular marks, obviously the pictographs of the former calculi, were used to express on the clay tablets the sophisticated Mesopotamian arithmetic as late as the IIIrd Millennium B.C.: one small cone stood for one, a circle was 10, a big cone was 60, a cone over- stamped with a circle was 600, a big circle 3,600, a big circle over a small circle 36V.

Conclusions for Phase II In summary, 50% of the eight sites studied for the period between 7500- 6800 B.C. yield clay remains. Although they represent the earliest clay artifacts in Anatolia known today, these four assemblages are in no way suggestive of an experimental state for a new raw material. On the contrary they evidence an extensive use of clay and each function fulfilled shows developed features: geometric objects have a repertory of well established types and subtypes; figurines present several variations of a probable earlier prototype; pottery containers still present solely at Beldibi are fully functional; architecture involves sophisticated techniques and materials such as bricks, bonding, and terrazzo floors; clay is used as a refractory material for ovens and as an insulator for storage bins. The total information compiled in the four sites certainly outlines satis- factorily the main uses of clay during Phase II; however the picture is still most incomplete, and it is hard to believe, for instance, that at a site such as Hacilar where clay is abundantly used in architecture, the assemblage should not include any clay objects. (ayonu Tepesi alone presents an harmonious assemblage where clay is used for multiple purposes varying from simple minute objects to more imposing architectural features. Phase III The third phase, extending c. 6800-5800 B.C. is characterized by the general adoption of clay in sites known for this period, namely the five cave sites of Belba§i (Stratum II),47 Beldibi (Stratum B), Karain (Stratum I), (arkin and Okitzin48 and the seven open-air sites of (ayonii Tepesi (V-VI), Baradiz (Stratum II),49 Can Hasan Mound III,5° Suberde (Strata III-II),51 (atal Huyiuk (levels XII-VI),52 Klzllkaya,53 Erbaba,54 Mersin55 and Tarsus.56 46Maurice Lambert.

In one instance they were found grouped together with weapons and figurines in a pit near shrine E VI B 12.57 Some of these spheres seem to be as big as 5-10 cm., and it is almost certain that these particularly large examples did not belong to the category of calculi and assumed another function.58 At Suberde six spheres vary between 0*6 and 2-3 cm., and two additional specimens are made of whitish material, one of which is topped with a cylindrical neck.59 Another sphere, 1 cm. in diameter, and a biconical ball occur in Can Hasan.60 The biconical objects are generally referred to as "sling missiles" in the literature. Parallels are found in Jarmo,61 but mostly occur in IV-IIIrd Millennia sites such as Anau,62 Tal-i-lblis63 and Tepe Yahya.64 Thirty- three cones were found in various parts of the two prehistoric layers at Suberde and vary in height from 0-8 to 3 cm. with a maximum frequency measuring 1- 7-22 cm.65 One of the cones ends with a tip shaped like a bird's head; this variety occurs in several Near Eastern sites such as Ganj Dareh Tepe,66 Tell Ramad67 and Tepe Yahya.68 Other interesting features are wide grooves impressed on the sides of two cones, which probably meant either additional specification on the quality of the item presented or a fraction or multiple of the number expressed; such grooves are also frequent on cones at Ganj Dareh Tepe,69 on spheres at Jarmo70 and on discs at Chaga Sefid.71 Two other cones are represented at Can Hasan, one of them measuring 2 4 x 2* 1 cm.72 Four complete cylinders and 13 additional fragments occurred at Suberde.73 They are roughly made and the complete ones are 2-3 cm. long and 1-2 cm. wide. Among the calculi, complete cylinders are rarest, probably because their shape makes them so breakable. Figurines A small number of figurines occur in each open-air site except in Baradiz 57J.

At Suberde at least four examples represent small boars with pinched up spines and pointed legs and are 4-7-2-4 cm. long.74 At Can Hasan caprids 2-4 cm. long are figured standing on small stud-legs.75 There are at least two dozen caprids and cattle figurines from qatal Hiiyiik. They are 3-8 cm. long and include details such as ears, tails and long horns.76 One cow was represented crouching with the back legs extended on the side in a naturalistic position.7 The colour of the figurines varies between buff, red, brown and black. Although no analysis has yet been made for verification, all excavators note that they appear to have been baked. The figurines were found scattered in various parts of the sites except in (atal Hiiyiik where they were deposited between bricks in housewalls.78 Anthropomorphic figurines are still rare. A single example at Suberde is reduced to a torso 6 x 3 cm.; the breasts are represented and cross-hatched incisions on the back probably indicate a garment. A peg-hole visible in the neck suggests that there was a head of a different material.79 At Can Hasan two figurines are also very schematic; one of them is reduced to a roughly rectangular bar 2 7 x 1-7 cm. bowed at the rear and with two knobs representing the breasts. The second example consists of a long neck 3-5 x 1-2 cm. ending with a flat head and pointed nose.80 At (qatal Hiiyiik several types of figurines are repres- ented. The first appears in level IX with two small sitting figures 2 cm. high, very carefully moulded and blackish in colour. They have a squirrel-like head, no arms, and their pointed legs are stretched parallel.81 Others are crude figurines with featureless head and outstretched arms, standing on a flat base.82 A second type is a composite figure with squarish shoulders and large buttocks.83 Several naturalistic figurines of this period in Catal Hiyiik are executed in stone, but only a single example occurring in level VI is made of clay. It is the well-known little figurine decorated with red-painted rosettes, possibly suggesting a garment (Plate XXXa). The figure is fattish with large buttocks and heavy legs, hanging breasts and round belly. It is represented sitting and though unfortunately the head is missing, it is the only example of this period to have hands and feet represented. It is a model of fine execution - the clay is particularly fine and the colour uniformly light buff.84 Stamp Seals Seals make their appearance in (atal Hyyiik VI, where they are represented by three examples. The first was found associated with a burial, and is of oblong shape with a somewhat intricate motif including parallel and curved lines. The two others are round; they are provided with a knob for prehension, presenting a 74Ibid., p. 51. 75 D. H. French. Personal communication. 76J.

Sherds are still rare in Tarsus, (atal Hiyiik, Baradiz, and Klzllkaya. They occur in small number in the earliest level at Suberde and quickly disappear. They are totally absent in the two important open-air sites of Can Hasan and (ayonui Tepesi. The potteries found in the different sites share many characteristics. Of course all are handmade and the qatal Hiuyiik containers are described as being "built up with coils on a flat base and the walls of the vessels beaten thin by a paddle against a wooden block held inside".87 All the wares are mineral temper- ed, with the exception of the potteries of Suberde III, which are heavily vegetable tempered and represent the first evidence of vegetable temper in Anatolia.88 Beldibi and Belbali have a special shell and chalk temper.89 The colour of the wares varies from red and orange to grey and black with a majority of light grey and buff shades in {atal Hiiyiik. The usual surface treatment is burnishing, polishing or at least smoothing, with the exception of Suberde, where the vessels are left rough and gritty. Slips are rare and only an occasional red, washy slip is reported for the Kizilkaya ware90 - it is at the same time that slips also make their appearance in the Zagros at Tepe Guran91 and Ali Kosh.92 The walls of the vessels of Suberde are as thick as 1 5 cm., but otherwise potteries of the other sites are usually c. 5 mm. thick, with some cooking ware as thick as 1 cm. in Karain. The hardness of the different wares is highly variable and some sherds are soft at Karain and Beldibi, but even at these sites the majority are very hard. The firing is mostly incomplete and black cores are a usual feature except in Beldibi, where they become exceptional at this level. The shapes are mostly small bowls and jars with simple straight rims with one instance of everted rim at Suberde; one or two oval vessels occur at Catal Hiyiik93 and bag-shaped jars at Kizilkaya.94 Decorations of nail incised patterns are frequent in Mersin95 and Tarsus.96 The only other ornaments are primitive painted motifs found very rarely at (atal Hiiyiuk.97 Knobs for prehension are present on small jars, and the Beldibi pottery frequently has handles.98 85J.

In this phase several building techniques are practised, among which bricks are still most common. In Can Hasan brick buildings, faced on the inside with clay plaster, co-exist with dwellings of simply packed and pounded clay. The rooms vary in size from 7 to 1 25 m. The sizes of the brick also greatly vary and range from a maximum measurement of 80 x 40 x 10 cm. to 40 x 30 x 10 cm. The preparation of the clay involved the addition of vegetable matter, thus representing the earliest evidence of the use of tempering in Anatolian architecture.99 At Suberde the houses of level III, which represents the earliest occupation, were built with a single row of bricks measuring 60 x 40 x 6 cm. laid in a layer of light brown clay mortar, 4 cm. thick; walls and floors were left unplastered; clay rubble bearing long vegetable impressions suggests a clay and cane roofing. On the contrary, in the following level - level II - two buildings measuring respectively 2 50 x 2 m. and 5 25 x 2-80 m. were built with layers of reddish brown clay 7 cm. thick alternating with layers of light brown clay 4 cm. thick.10° In (ayonui Tepesi bricks continue to be used.'01 A house model may provide us with the replica of an actual dwelling. The model represents a rectangular, single-story building covered with a flat roof.102 At Catal Hiiyiuk, the village was built like a citadel with houses grouped around courtyards or small lanes and entered only through the roofs; they thus presented an unbroken succession of blind walls, and the clay architecture played here the additional function of settlement fortification.103 The houses were rectangular and consisted of a main room varying between 11 25-42 m.2 and sometimes one or two adjacent subsidiary rooms. The foundations were set with up to six rows of bricks sunk below floor level. The superstructure, c. 3 30 m. high, was built with a timber frame filled up with bricks of a standard size: 32 x 8 cm., represent- ing the first evidence of the use of a wooden mould for their manufacture. The material used for the bricks was greenish clay mixed with a great quantity of straw temper, while the mortar, which was used lavishly in 6 cm. thick layers, was made of blackish clay including a quantity of ashes and occupation debris. These details may suggest that the bricks were made near a clay deposit, such as next to the river, while the mortar was made of the clay material available at the place of construction. The walls were faced with a fine buff clay plaster which was regularly renewed. In level VIII, the accumulation of more than 100 layers had reached a thickness of 10 cm., equivalent to half the thickness of the wall itself. Red paint was generally applied in the northeast corner and often on the main central wall.104 Floor covering was realized with various techniques in the different sites. In Can Hasan and Catal Hiiyiik floors were plastered with a layer of plain white clay pounded over a smooth earth foundation; some were painted with red ochre in Can Hasan III and holes for drainage were sometimes included at Catal 99D.

They consisted of three successive layers: a base of clay loam 10-15 cm. thick; a plaster, also 10-15 cm. thick, made of plaster and small stones; a finish, of fine plaster, c. 1-2 cm. thick. Quantitative analysis of the ratio of calcium to magnesium was performed on several samples by Littmann to determine if the plaster involved lime; however no firm conclusion could be drawn, and the material could be clay naturally rich in limestone.107 Wall Reliefs Anthropomorphic and animal representations at (atal Hiuyuik are in this phase no longer confined to small figurines in the round, but they invade the surface of the house walls in low, high or cut-out clay reliefs. The high reliefs appear in level X and continue throughout the levels. The subjects represented are felines made of solid clay mixed with straw, and mostly bulls and rams heads moulded in clay and covered with plaster. In the lower levels they have moulded horns but actual hor cores appear after level VIII. Except for the bulls heads, each subject generally follows an assigned disposition along the walls, and the rams, for instance, were as a rule placed on the east wall. From level VII on, female figures appear, made of clay moulded on bundles of reeds. They are represented running with flowing hair or more frequently with legs stretched out, interpreted as giving birth to a bull, or just suggested by breasts represented singly or by pairs horizontally or vertically arranged. Cut-out figures in sunken relief appear in level IX; they initially represent animal heads and only after levels VII and VI B develop into entire bulls and anthropomorphic figures such as a two- headed twin "goddess".108 House Furnishings The use of clay for house furnishings makes considerable progress during this phase. A bench plastered with clay, 30 cm. wide and 45 cm. high, was situated along a wall in Suberde III.109 After level XI at (atal Hiiyiuk, clay platforms designating the working, sitting, and sleeping areas were placed in a fairly constant disposition in the shape of an L, with a long platform along the east wall, and a smaller and higher one in the northeast corer. They were plastered and frequently surrounded by a red-painted rounded curb.110 In a number of buildings, small brick pillars were set up on the main platform and topped with the horn cores and frontal of a wild bull. These pillars developed after level VI into longer benches.l' Storage Facilities Storage facilities become more'important and in (atal Hiiyuk they con- stitute small cubicles adjacent to the main rooms. The cubicles were usually furnished with clay bins, c. 1 m. high, arranged in pairs or in a row. The bins 15 Ibid., p. 61. 106 D. H. French. Personal communication. '07E. R. Littmann.

In addition, clay boxes were used to store small loose objects such as knuckle bones and stone tools."2 A large bin was also included in the setting of the main room and was generally placed in the northeast corner.1l3 Fuel was stored in a deep and low recessing niche in the south wall, next to the fireplace.14 Offerings may have been laid in a clay box found directly to the right of a ram's head in E VI 10 and in a basin in front of a bull's head in VII 10.15 In Suberde III, a series of clay bins 30 to 40 cm. high, half embedded in the floor, consisted of mere bottomless clay cylinders with carefully shaped rims. The walls were c. 2-4 cm. thick and the paste they were made of was heavily vegetable tempered. It is possible that they were fired in situ.16 Thirty-three pieces of thick baked vessels may represent similar containers in Can Hasan.117 Firing Units The addition of larger kilns next to the usual domestic ovens at (atal Hiuyik marks a new step in pyrotechnology. They were provided with a dome chamber preceded by a separate firing chamber. The dome chamber was probably completely closed during the firing process and necessitated demolishing and rebuilding for each firing. The kilns may have been used to bake pottery.1l8 Also at Catal Hiiuyik one or several ovens were placed in line along the south wall of the houses. They were plastered with a white or buff clay and subsequently polished. Their top was flat and as no chimney seems to have been provided, the smoke must have escaped through the entrance on the roof."9 In level V a large oven 1-5-1-8 m. with bricks set on edges was built in a courtyard and may suggest a bakery.120 The hearths at Catal Hiyiik were always situated along the south wall next to the ovens and kilns, near the ladder; they were round or square and measured c. 1 m.'2' As in Can Hasan, they were lined with clay and provided with a curb to prevent the spilling of ashes.122 (Plate XXXb). Conclusions for Phase III The use of clay in Phase III has increased in quantity with its generalized use in architecture, and has been extended to several new functions such as house furnishings, wall reliefs, kilns and stamp seals. The major event to be emphasized for this phase is, however, the adoption of clay in 100% of the open-air sites as well as 100% of the cave sites; indeed from this period on, no site was excavated in Anatolia that did not yield clay artifacts. Interesting comparisons can be made on the different uses of clay in the two kinds of habitats. At open-air 12 Ibid., pp. 62-63. 113 . Mellaart. op. cit., 1962, p. 47. "4 J.

Personal communication. 148</page><page sequence="24">THE BEGINNINGS OF THE USE OF CLAY IN TURKEY sites the settlers lived in houses made of clay - the foundations and walls, the mortar and plaster, the floors and roofs. These agriculturalists and hunters arranged their houses with clay platforms which may have been used variously for sitting and sleeping. They stored their crops in clay cubicles, niches, bins and boxes. They produced heat to overcome the winter cold, bake bread, and manufacture their crafts in clay hearths, ovens and kilns. They moulded female and animal representations in relief on the house walls, or as small figurines. They used clay seals and kept records with clay cones, spheres and cylinders used as calculi. These people, however, probably still used mostly vegetable, skin, wood or bark containers to gather, mix, and cook their food. Clay containers were not manufactured at Can Hasan; they were experimented with but soon discontinued at Suberde and were rarities on other sites, except for Mersin. This is of course very surprising as cooking was done in hearths, ovens and kilns which normally require fireproof utensils. On the contrary, whenever the cave dwellers used clay it was exclusively as pottery containers, which they built into functional shapes, adding convenient features such as prehension knobs and handles and firing them into hard wares. It would be interesting to know if these diverse uses of clay reflect the different needs brought about by the adoption of two new ways of life: agriculture and pastoralism. (3) THE REASONS FOR THE ADOPTION OF CLA YAS A RAW MATERIAL The reason for the sudden success of the use of clay in the Neolithic period is not easy to explain. As clay is commonly found in nature, it certainly could not be alleged that it was first noticed in the Neolithic period. As it is easy to model and does not require any other tool than the hand to be worked, it cannot be considered either as the consequence of a new technological achievement. However, the adoption of a new raw material could be viewed as a solution for arising needs. Indeed major economic changes occurred simultaneously with the first evidences of the use of clay, namely a more intensified food collection and the beginning of plant and animal domestication, which limited people's mobility and eventually bound them to a sedentary way of life. Sedentariness meant the depletion of the resources and the loss of climatic advantages of various vegetation zones, and ushered re-adaptation problems to local environments. First was created the need for permanent habitat in favourable locations next to the fields and pastures where natural shelters or traditional building materials may not have been avail- able. Second and no less crucial was the necessity of storage to accumulate food to face the lean season. Both problems could have been solved by materials such as wood and stone; however, archaeological remains show that clay was preferred in most cases. Once achieved, sedentariness allowed for the multiplication of the group belongings, kept otherwise minimal by nomadic people, and made possible the use of fragile items such as clay objects. Also sedentariness certainly foster- ed the achievement of comfort and decoration of the houses, as their prolonged use made efforts worthwhile. Unfortunately, too little is known of the beginnings of the use of clay and of sedentariness in Anatolia to be certain that their appearance coincides. It can only be pointed out that the characteristics shared by the first clay-using sites are: (1) same approximate date; (2) permanence of occupation; and (3) similarity in use (architecture, storage, heating units, house furnishings, and small objects in open-air sites and pottery containers in cave sites). The study of the beginnings of the use of clay in the Zagros, which is better documented, supports the fact 149</page><page sequence="25">ANATOLIAN STUDIES that the plotting of the early clay findings closely follows the pattern of seden- tariness.l23 Parallels could also be drawn with Europe, where clay was used as early as 25,000 B.C. at Dolni Vestonice for modelling animal and female figurines and building ovens,124 or in several Upper Palaeolithic French caves such as Le Tuc d'Audoubert where clay wall reliefs or animal figures in the round were modelled.125 In both cases the surrounding ecological niche provided the hunters with an unusual abundance of food resources year-round and allowed permanence of occupation - as long as 800 years in Dolni Vestonice. In contrast, seasonal sites such as Pincevent (France), which was excavated with utmost care, did not yield any clay remains. A further argument could be drawn from present day hunters and gatherers such as Bushmen, Australian Aborigines and Pigmies, who trade guns, knives, and metal containers but have never adopted clay: it is heavy, cumbersome and fragile and just does not suit their way of life. Sedentariness may thus be the decisive factor for the use of clay by man. In turn, it certainly could be rewarding to evaluate how much the factor of sedentariness was facilitated or in some cases even made possible by the use of clay. CONCLUSION This paper has attempted to shed light on when, how and why clay was suddenly used in great quantity in Anatolia during the Holocene, after a seeming- ly complete non-utilization during the Pleistocene. I have to acknowledge that none of these questions can be fully answered because of the lack of information concerning the period extending between the X and VIII Millennium B.C. in this area. It can merely be stated that clay began to be used at an unknown date prior to 7500 B.C. As for the evolution of the use of clay, as we have seen, it may be divided into three phases, among which Phase I (before 7500 B.C.) is still hypothetical, representing the unknown beginnings of the use of clay. In Phase II (7500-6800 B.C.), at the present state of our knowledge 50% of the sites visited yield clay artifacts, which represent the earliest clay findings to date in Anatolia. The most diversified clay assemblage was recovered in the open-air site of Cayonii Tepesi, where forthcoming reports will state that it was used in architecture, for storage and heating facilities, figurines and geometric objects such as cones and spheres. These may represent a three-dimensional system of recording preceding and announcing writing by 5000 years. Beldibi is the only cave site of this phase attesting the use of clay for pottery containers. In Phase III (6800-5800 B.C.) clay reaches 100% of the sites. The trend between different utilizations of clay in the different habitats becomes striking: open-air sites add to the previous list of house furnishings wall reliefs, kilns and stamp seals, but pottery containers are still rarities. On the other hand clay is used exclusively for pottery containers in the caves. This difference may be due to the chance of excavation or could express the various needs of different economies. And finally, the reason for the adoption of the use of clay as a raw material may correspond to the forsaking of nomadic life, for which it was not suitable. It may have played a major role in the adoption of sedentariness as a way of life. 123 Denise Schmandt-Besserat. op. cit., 1974. 124B. Klima. op. cit., 1962, p. 199. 125H. Breuil.
