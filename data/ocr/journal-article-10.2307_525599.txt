Brian Morris is a prolific writer with unusual strengths, combining natural history (folk classifications, human disease concepts and etiologies, med- ical botany, mushroom identification) and broad study of religion (see, e.g., Anthropological Studies of Religion [1987], Western Conceptions of the Indi- vidual [1991], Anthropology of the Self [1994]) with a lifelong love of Malawi. As a sequel to The Power of Animals (1998), in which he described the rich ethnozoology of Malawian peoples, Animals and Ancestors addresses the Malawian "sacramental attitude to animals" (1) and the importance of ani- mals to a variety of Malawian religious practices. As in the previous volume, the author matches a rather curmudgeonly review of established literature with nuanced ethnographic synthesis. Morris seeks to write accessibly for both specialist and generalist read- ers. He proposes "a kind of ramble across an ethnographic terrain" (27), for the most part writing collectively of Malawians rather than addressing ethnic differences. In a long first chapter arguing issues of personhood, Morris discusses a Malawian "phenomenological attitude to animals" (35) and contrasts anthropomorphic with theriomorphic thinking-that is, attributing human traits to animals and vice versa. He finds an "essential continuity between humans and animals" (40), suggesting that "humanity and personhood can only be understood in terms of a dialectical relation- ship with animals" (42). A descriptive chapter on childbirth and womanhood says little of human-animal relations, defying the promise of sections like "Animals and Liminality." Instead, Morris presents a rather old-fashioned review of ethnography, with no first-hand accounts or Malawian voices to confirm or counter his own authority. The book's best accomplishment is its descrip-</page><page sequence="2">88 African Studies Review tions of rituals of the Nyau Society practiced by Chewa and several other Malawian groups observing matrilineal descent. The "matrilineal puzzle" of men seeming to be strangers to their biological offspring is played out through the animal characters of Nyau, as young men manipulating enor- mous zoomorphic masks dramatize their own distancing "kinship" with ani- mals versus women's "affinity" with them. The few murky photos of Nyau costumes hardly do justice to such vibrant expression. Morris's last chapters concern Malawian concepts of divinity, ancestral spirits, rain deities, and territorial cults. The latter are well known from the writings of Matthew Schoffeleers (e.g., River of Blood [1992]), whose works Morris reviews with those of other Malawianists. Morris occasionally spices his account with his own experience, such as hiking in an area devastated by floods attributed to the fierce subterranean serpent spirit Napolo, but this reader is left wishing two things: that Morris had written more of his book in such a refreshingly first-hand manner, and that he had then extended his discussion to include other central African ethnography out- side the arbitrary political boundaries of Malawi. Luc de Heusch's demon- stration of structural similarities between serpent deities of Luba peoples of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (whom Morris notes are culturally and historically related to Malawian peoples) and other Bantu-speakers comes to mind (see de Heusch's The Drunken King or the Origins of the State [1972/1982] and Rois nis d'un Coeur de boeuf [1982]). A far more egregious omission is Morris's neglect of the writing of Stuart Marks about human-animal relations among Bisa people of Zambia, especially Large Mammals and a Brave People (1976). Marks is virtually the only author other than Morris who has explored these issues so deeply in central Africa or elsewhere on the continent, and it is hard to imagine why Morris ignores his work. Despite these reservations, Animals and Ancestors is well worth reading for its overview of animal-human relations in Malawi and the opportunities it presents for others to make cross-cultural comparisons.
