<plain_text><page sequence="1">matter of state. M. Lauriol deals at length and objectively with this conflict, but in general he devotes far too much space to the 'petite histoire' of La Beaumelle's life at the expense of a proper analysis of the works which seem to be brought in incidentally and only tentatively assessed. The story unfolded is one of failure if measured by La Beaumelle's ambition. It was, however, worth telling for the vistas it opens up on French Protestantism and an early upbringing in the Cevennes, for the light thrown on Voltaire's activities and character, and on the inter- play of personalities in the world of politics, government, society, as well as on publishing and publishers in the middle of the eighteenth century. EXETER ROBERT NIKLAUS Jean-Jacques Rousseau: quatre etudes. By JEAN STAROBINSKI, JEAN-LOUIS LECERCLE, HENRI COULET, and MARC EIGELDINGER. (Langages) Neuchatel: A la Baconniere. I978. 123 pp. This publication reproduces the text of four lectures given at the University of Neuchatel in 1978 to commemorate the bicentenary of the death of Rousseau. Given the other work of these four distinguished Rousseauists, the volume is perhaps slightly disappointing; but if none of the studies can be seen as a major contribution to scholarship, each in its own way offers stimulating perspectives on Rousseau's work. In 'Le Pacte pedagogique dans Emile', for example, Professor Coulet argues ingeniously that the principal pedagogical importance of Ernile lies in the role of the tutor and his relationship with the child; this is based on a contract which can become explicit only when the child finally 'reconnait dans la conscience de son gouverneur le modele de sa propre conscience' (p. 73). I doubt, however, that M. Coulet is justified in attributing so much importance to the 'contract' by which the tutor initially became responsible for Emile, and which was in reality only an afterthought on Rousseau's part. In contrast to the intellectual dexterity of Professor Coulet's study, Jean-Louis Lecercle's 'La Femme selon Jean-Jacques' is simple and straightforward. In practice, he argues, Rousseau's ideal woman was neither Emile's Sophie, nor even Julie, but Madame de Warens, or at least his view of her. It is only with Professor Lecercle's conclusion that I would take issue: whereas Rousseau the theoretician accepted the narrow traditionalism of his time, his indulgence towards Madame de Warens's sexual irregularities, Lecercle claims, reveals a more generous and more modern conception of woman. The other two studies are both devoted to Rousseau's autobiographical works. The central theme of Jean Starobinski's 'La Mise en accusation de la societe', Rousseau's certainty of his own innocence and his consequent accusation of other people, is hardly original; but admirers of Professor Starobinski will not be sur- prised to find that the theme is given a fascinating new look, with many illuminating asides. He establishes, for example, a convincing parallel between Rousseau's own mental attitudes and his political thought: the volonte generale is a social version of the individual conscience, a subjectivity of the moi collectif. I particularly liked M. Starobinski's discussion of the dangers inherent in Rousseau's trust in the in- dividual conscience. Convinced of his own purity, he sees evil as the result of a universal conspiracy formed by his enemies; the political equivalent was the Terror. The final study, 'Les Reveries, solitude et poesie' by Marc Eigeldinger, is part of the introduction to a facsimile edition of the manuscript of the Reveries, published 892 Reviews</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 893 elsewhere. In the first part, M. Eigeldinger wonders whether the Reveries might be an early version of the nineteenth-century journal intime, but concludes that the form of the work is not truly that of a journal, though it prefigures the genre by its thematique, its exclusive preoccupation with the moi. The study ends with a subtle and perceptive examination of the nature of the ecriture poetique in the Reveries, showing that writing is for Rousseau 'un acte ontologique' (p. 115), not merely the record of an experience, but an experience in itself, which seeks to achieve the poetic fusion of the interior and exterior worlds. All in all, we must be grateful to the University of Neuchatel for making the text of these lectures more widely available.. D. JIMA P. D. JIMACK UNIVERSITY OF STIRLING Michelet's Poetic Vision: A Romantic Philosophy of Nature, Man, and Woman. By EDWARD K. KAPLAN. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press. 1977. ?I2.50. This work sets out to synthesize the views which Michelet expressed in writing on such diverse subjects as natural history, the psychology of love and woman, the 'sociology' of the people, and historiography. The earlier chapters excel in relating Michelet's notion of natural science to currents of ideas in the first part of the nineteenth century, especially the debate over evolution between Cuvier and Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire. Michelet prefers Saint-Hilaire to Cuvier because he upholds freedom against determinism, biblical and other. His science is romantic, but by no means wholly unscientific. It is romantic partly because it is teleological, in the sense that primitive forms of life prepare more 'advanced' forms, like man, of course. The result is, to use Professor Charlton's term, another 'secular religion'. Yet it is important to recognize, as this book does, that Michelet's feeling for nature is deep and genuine, even when it leads him to be fanciful. But he can also intend to be more scientific than one thinks he is being. There is a chapter in La Mer entitled 'La Mer de lait' because of the mucus in the sea - grist to Bachelard's mill, perhaps, if not to Sartre's. For Michelet, it is scientifically exact that sea- water is a mucus. In that case, Bachelard's 'imagination materielle' would not seem to be really applicable here. In general, Professor Kaplan does an expert job in distinguishing between fact and imagination in Michelet's science. What this suffers from, indeed, is not imagination but what the author rightly calls Michelet's 'relentless anthropomorphism'. But, of course, without the anthropomorphism there would be no secular religion. What comes over strongly from this work is that, for Michelet, man's attitude towards animal creation should be compassionate and that his society should learn from nature to be pacific and benevolent. But where is the place of poetic vision in such a scheme of things? Let this question be answered by three examples. The aesthetic creativity of the nightingale's song in L'Oiseau, it is pointed out, reflects the evolutionary process towards freedom, or the song itself is to be seen as a symbol of man's need to transcend his earthly condition. Secondly, a similar process is to be observed in Michelet's conception of history. According to this, France's development towards unity is apprehended as being that of a person growing in freedom as he shakes off the restraints of geography. This goes some way towards explaining why, for Michelet, the French Revolution was a religion. Thirdly, from creativity in history we pass to that of the historian's self. As is</page></plain_text>
