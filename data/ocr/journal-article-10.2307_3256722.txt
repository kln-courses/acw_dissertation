One would not compare it to The Writing Master, The Thinker, the Lady with a Setter Dog, or the Signora d'Arza (to select only from our collection), but the variety and lustiness of this youthful work give it a particular and perhaps more gen- eral appeal.

They therefore replaced the human victim by an anthropomorphic effigy into which were inserted models of the vital organs and fluid red pigment to simulate blood. The plot and the manner of performance of the play have changed from time to time as the various Lamaist sects in turn achieved LAMAIST PRIEST ROBE A GIFT OF CHINESE AND LAMAISTIC TEXTILES Probably the most weird masked carnival to be found anywhere in the world is the Mystery Play of Tibet, popularly known as the Devil Dance, or, by the unsophisticated Tibetans, as the Dance of the Red-Devil Tiger. The latter is the name by which the play was designated before the advent of Buddhism, and the motive was apparently to expel the old year with its demons of ill luck and to propitiate with human sacrifices the war god and the guardian spirits. Under Buddhism the Lamas could no longer coun- supremacy, and it is interesting to note how cleverly the Lamaists have twisted the ritual here and there to benefit themselves under the guise of this religious ceremony. Thus the effigy, which represents the enemy of Tibet and of Lamaism and which is very properly destroyed at last, is used to con- vey to the people a vivid conception of the manner in which devils attack a corpse and to impress on them the necessity for priestly services to guard it and its soul. An accurate description of the ritual which enters into the Mystery Play is almost impossible since so few persons qualified to interpret its in- tricacies have actually seen the perform- I53</page><page sequence="2">BULLETIN OF THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART ance. Those who have reported on it are greatly at variance, but from their descrip- tions we can get a general idea of the procedure. On the thirtieth day of the first moon a huge crowd of spectators gathers in the court- yard of each important Lamaist temple and waits for hours as patiently as their more volatile Western neighbors await the ap- pearance of their latest hero. Suddenly a shrill bugle proclaims the commencement of the play. An invisible orchestra strikes up a wailing air and out from the temple comes a group of priests richly garbed in silk and brocade, preceded by attendants swinging censers. The priests execute a stately dance to slow music and return to the temple. Then into the midst of the spectators, who press eagerly forward, a group of beings, half human, half devil, hurl themselves, their faces covered with death's-head masks and their costumes with licking red flame and skeleton motives. In their hands they carry fearsome long-lashed whips, swords with skull hilts, and other ghastly symbols. These are the demons which signify the endless oppression of man by the powers of evil. Chief among them, and the last of the group to appear, is the Red-Devil Tiger, who wears a grotesque animal mask instead of a death's-head mask and a more elaborate costume. The demons dance to wild music with strange steps and gesticulations, lashing out at the spectators as they come close in their eager- ness to see. They approach the effigy, circling ever nearer and nearer, brandishing their swords and weapons and continually threatening to cut it to bits. Finally the priests offer them food and drink and they are subdued-for the time. As the demons rest from their strenuous efforts, from the temple emerges a strange procession of dancers, wearing vestments of many colors and huge ghastly bird or animal masks. They dance to the slow and measured cadences of the music and their heads loll from side to side in time with the move- ments of their bodies. The demons then usurp the stage again, and thus the play goes on for hours. Finally the effigy is cut to pieces, and not only is the enemy of Tibet disposed of for another year, but the priests have emphasized the need of priestly protection for the dead and incidentally have assured themselves, as the protectors, a substantial income. From one of these quaint masquerades comes the Devil-Tiger costume exhibited this month in the Room of Recent Acces- sions. It is shown with a Lamaist priest robe of rich brocade (illustrated above) which may conceivably have been used in a Mystery Play also-certainly it is theat- rical in appearance-and a Chinese imperial theatrical robe for a warrior. These cos- tumes are the gift of Mrs. Edward A. Nis, who has for several years permitted them to be here on loan. The Devil-Tiger costume is made on a foundation of red felt, with white satin damask appliqued in such a way that the red foundation makes the skeleton and flame design. A supplementary skirt of velvet, silk, and brocade proclaims the identity of the wearer, for here is the tiger himself-mottled skin, ferocious coun- tenance, and claw-tipped feet. The horrific bull mask of gilded papier-mache is topped by antlers, inappropriate but impressive, between which are attached streamers of varicolored brocade with little bells at the ends. The protruding eyes, distended nos- trils, and gaping mouth would strike terror to the strongest heart, and the effect on the superstition-ridden Tibetans must have been exactly what the Lamas intended it to be. The Lamaist priest robe, on the other hand, is an altogether delectable concoc- tion, the skirt and sleeves fashioned from strips of red, green, and yellow brocade gorgeously patterned with the pao hsiang hua (often incorrectly called the lotus), pomegranate, fingered citron (Buddha's hand), and other motives in a blaze of colors. The triangular sleeves and the rich showiness of the robe mark it as theatrical, and it must have been worn either by one of the Lamas in the Devil Dance or by an actor impersonating a Lama on the Chinese stage. Very similar in effect to several other robes in the Museum collection is the Chinese imperial theatrical robe for a war- rior. In detail, however, it varies consider- ably. Plain gold brocade takes the place of I54</page><page sequence="3">BULLETIN OF THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART the heavy gold embroidery used to simulate chain armor on the shoulders, breast, and skirt; dragon panels of brocade with ap- plique scroll patterns above and below, in- stead of showily embroidered satin panels, make up the lower skirt; and the brilliant colored-glass buttons are entirely lacking. As a compensation for its lower pitch, the robe is in almost perfect condition, in marked contrast with the others, which are noticeably worn. In addition to the three costumes, the gift includes a symbolic Buddhist parasol (one of the "Eight Precious Things") made of pleated strips of brocade attached to a satin ground and topped by a gilt-bronze standard, and a pair of Lama's shoes of pigskin with gay red and blue satin damask tops. These things are authentic and inter- esting details for any study of Buddhism and Lamaism, and the gift in its entirety represents a distinguished selectiveness in collecting. PAULINE SIMMONS. A GROUP OF SPANISH TEXTILES The Museum has recently assembled, by purchase from several sources, a small col- lection of textiles, Spanish in origin or association, comprising a variety of weaves, mainly of the sixteenth century. They are exhibited this month in the Room of Recent Accessions. Of these one of the most important and certainly one of the most interesting exam- ples is a border of green stamped wool vel- vet (illustrated) bearing the arms of Philip I I of Spain (1527- I 598). This piece, with two others in the collection, belongs to a class of wool velvets which are generally considered to be Spanish but which more probably were brought into Spain from Flanders prior to and during the reign of Ferdinand and Isa- bella, especially since they do not agree in measurement with the meticulously detailed ordinance regarding the manufacture of wool fabrics in Spain issued by the Catholic kings.1 Owing to their having been made at one time in the Netherlands, the name 1Pedro Miguel de Artifano, Catalogo de la Exposici6n de Tejidos espaioles, p. 20. Utrecht is invariably attached to wool vel- vets of this type. In this particular piece the arms are used as part of the design; inclosed in an ogival framework, they rise like a floral ornament from a vase form. Alternating with this is a similar ogive filled with flowers centering around a four-petaled rose; below is a row of ogives framing conventionalized pome- granates. The piece is about nineteen inches wide and was evidently intended to be used as a border, since the design runs along the length of the material. The pat- tern shows clearly by the joinings of the de- sign the size of the plate from which it was embossed. On the shield are the arms of Castile, Le6n, Aragon, Sicily, Granada, Austria, Bur- gundy, Brabant, Flanders, and Tyrol, en- circled by the Order of the Golden Fleece and surmounted by a royal crown. On either side is a sheaf of arrows, the badge of Queen Isabella, who was, in her own right, sovereign of the kingdom of Castile. Judg- ing from the arrows it would seem that the piece could not be dated later than the end of Isabella's reign, but the design of birds, pomegranates, and flowering vases definitely places it near the middle of the sixteenth century. The apparent conflict is removed when it is considered that the armorial de- vice, because of its great prestige, was used long after Isabella's death in 1504, as late even as the era of Philip IV.2 The four- petaled flower is sometimes interpreted as the Tudor rose, and therefore related to Mary Tudor of England, one of the four wives of Philip II, but aside from the fact that the motive is found scattered elsewhere throughout the pattern with no special prominence attached to its position, it ap- pears in Valencian tiles of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, tiles that were exported, it is interesting to note, to Flanders. The second piece of Utrecht velvet, also green, has a pattern of interlaced rondels filled with arabesques. This design is some- times found combined with the arms of 2 For this and other information acknowledg- ment is made to Jose Ferrandis Torres, Co- director of the Museum of Decorative Arts and Keeper of Numismatics, Instituto Valencia de Don Juan (Osma), Madrid.
