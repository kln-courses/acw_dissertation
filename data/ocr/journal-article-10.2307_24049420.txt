The account of this repe 28 ti.</page><page sequence="9">baums: Inscribed Buddhist Tablets from Merv tition in the Mahavastu (III 62.8-9) preserves an early Sanskrit version of the ye dhaimä formula: ye dharmä hetuprabhävä hetun tesäm tathägato äha tesäm ca yo nirodha evamvädi mahäsramanah Other Sanskrit versions (such as the one on the Merv tablets) exhibit different Sanskritization strategies (using, in our case, hy avadat in place of äha)} Skilling 1999 proposes a typology of the variants of the formula. The Buddhist tradition and modern scholarship have generally taken the ye dharmä formula as equivalent to the formula of Dependent Arising, one of the two central insights of the Buddha (the other being the Four Truths),8 and the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims Xuanzang and Yijing report on the Indian Buddhist custom of producing copies of the formula on objects that would assume the status of relics and could be installed in stüpas (Skilling 2005: 693). Modern archaeology has provided ample confirmation for this practice in India itself (see Boucher 1991 for further refer ences,· Sander 2002 is a notable example on a cop per plate), as well as in Southeast Asia (Skilling: 1999, 2003) and in the Northwest (Taddei 1970; Vertogradova 1990; Strauch 2000). Inscriptional combinations of the ye dharmä formula with other doctrinal formulae (the bodhipaksika dharma in the case of the Merv tablets) are also known from other parts of the Buddhist world. One of the Maunggun gold leaves (6th-7th c. c.e.; Tun Nyein 1898-1899; Finot 1912), for instance, contains the ye dharmä for mula followed by (1) the four rddhipäda, (2) the four samyakpradhäna, (3) the four smrtyupa sthäna, (4) the four äryasatya, (5) the four vai säradya, (6) the five indriya, (7) the five caksu, (8) the six asädhärana, (9) the seven bodhyanga, (10) the äryästängikamärga, (11) the nine lok ottaradharma, (12) the ten bala, (13) the fourteen buddhajääna and (14) the eighteen buddha dharma. Items 3, 2, 1, 6, 12, 9, 10 from this list, in this order, constitute the bodhipaksika dharma·,9 see Bronkhorst 1985 for a wider dis cussion of the relationship of the bodhipaksika dharma to other lists of doctrinal terms. Con versely, the Sri Ksetra gold leaves (5th c. c.e.; Falk 1997) and the Nakhon Pathom stone inscription (ca. 6th-7th c. c.e.; Skilling 1997: 123-33) com bine the full pratltyasamutpäda formula with the bodhipaksika dhaima, illustrating the equiva lence of the former with the ye dhaimä formula. The Merv tablets are the only example so far of a combined ye dhaimä and bodhipaksika dhaimä inscription, in the Northwest or anywhere else, and they deserve special attention for the juxtapo sition of these formulae with their iconography, and because of the rich information that is avail able for their secondary ritual use in the relic de posit next to the Gyaur-kala stüpa. Notes 1. It is a pleasure to present this article as a small token of gratitude to my teacher Richard Salomon, in appreciation of his scholarship and humanity, and in happy recollection of our travels to Central Asia in 2005 and 2006 that brought us closer to the enigmatic objects of this study. 2. The manuscript sheets remain unedited in the Grabar Scientific Conservation Center in Moscow (Vorob'eva-Desiätovskaiä 1983: 69; Vertogradova 1998: 202). 3. According to Vertogradova 1998: 201-2, ten tab lets were found. Vertogradova goes on to state, incor rectly, that three anthropomorphic figures are depicted on each tablet. 4. It is unclear whether the rubbing reproduced in Pugacenkova and Usmanova 1995: p. 69, fig. 18 is of the same tablet. 5. Von Hinüber 2004: p. 996, fn. 18 transcribes the first two lines of the inscription. 6. Von Hinüber 2004: p. 996, fn. 18 similarly reads the last aksara as st(*e), but reconstructed the phrase on the basis of Tablet 1 only as (*ye dharmahetupia bhaväjs t(*e)säm, deviating from the expected formula. 7. Alsdorf 1968: 64—66 compares this verse (printed as prose in Oldenberg's edition) with its Sanskrit parallels and discusses metrical problems in its various versions. 8. A notable different opinion is that of La motte 1958: 547 who refers to the formula as the "stance fameuse communiquee autrefois par Asvajit ä Säriputra et qui resume si bien les quatres verites saintes," presumably influenced by the presence of the word niiodha. 9. The ten bala of the tathägata here take the place of the five bala of the shorter formula. References Alsdorf 1968 L. Alsdorf.
