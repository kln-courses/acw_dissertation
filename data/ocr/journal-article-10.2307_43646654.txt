<plain_text><page sequence="1">HOMER AND EURIPIDES' TROADES 1 JOHN DAVIDSON Abstract Like all other Greek poets, Euripides falls under the shadow of Homer. The Troades is closely bound up with the Iliad, in that it represents the fulfilment of Troy' s fate so clearly foreshadowed in the Homeric epic. It is not so much a question of linguistic echoes as of situational allusion associated especially with the figures of Andromache and Asyanax, widow and son of Hector. While Homeric and 5th Century values are clearly in tension, as can also be seen in the formal debate between Hecabe and Helen (which also draws the Odyssey into the intertextual nexus), and while Euripides may well to some extent be ironizing and critiquing, he appears at the same time to be offering an impassioned Homeric sequel to the Iliad itself. The first stasimon of Euripides' Troades begins with the words: dcjLKpť ļuoi "IÀiov, d&gt; / Moûoa, Kaivôv Cļivcov / aioov oùv ôaKpuoiç anôàv éTriiaíôeiov. This opening rings a clear epic or quasi-epic note which is then echoed later in the stasimon by further epic verbal features such as the tmesis àvà ô' eßoaoev (522), the genitive ending in Àívoio (537), the epithets Çeoiróv (533), KeÀaivóv (539) and jueÀaivav (549), and perhaps the unaugmented aetpov (546), if this conjecture is correct.2 For the moment, we shall leave aside the question of whether this epic flavour is introduced simply to underline the epic significance of what the chorus are singing about, or whether the whole point in fact is to highlight a radically different approach to epic concerns. Whatever the reason for Euripides' strategy here, there is little doubt that attention is being drawn, at least momentarily, to the epic tradition. So in the mean time we shall just use the passage as a gateway through which to approach the whole question of Euripides' relationship to this epic tradition, specifically as represented by the Homeric texts. Of course, when the question arises of a connection between 5th Century Tragedy and Homer, the initial focus is more likely to fall on Sophocles or Aeschylus, rather than on Euripides. In the case of Aeschylus, we have impressed on our minds the comment attributed to him in Athenaeus (Deipn. 8.347e), that his tragedies were merely slices from Homer's banquet. As for Sophocles, there are the ancient testimonia, in the anonymous Life and elsewhere, which characteristically present him as ' OjiripiKÓç or ' OjuripiKCOTaTOÇ. With 1 This study is a significant expansion of one section of my article 'Euripides, Homer and Sophocles', Illinois Classical Studies 24-25 (1999-2000) 1 17-28. 1 offer it here in memory of Kevin Lee. The text of the Troades used in this paper is from J. Diggle (ed.), Euripidis Fabulae vol. 2 (Oxford 1981). The text of the Iliad is Martin L. West (ed.), Homerus Ilias (vol. 1 Stuttgart and Leipzig 1998, vol. 2 Munich and Leipzig 2000). BICS-45 - 2001 65</page><page sequence="2">66 BICS-45 - 2001 regard to Euripides, on the other hand, we tend to think primarily in terms of the second half of the 5th Century, and of sophists, Thucydides, Aristophanes, and the orators. For Euripides too, however, Homer was a ubiquitous shadow, poetic, educational, culture transmitting, call it what you like. So it seems valid to explore the connection between Homer and Euripides as a phenomenon in its own right while not, of course, forgetting that it is only part of a much wider nexus which for that matter includes works of visual art3 as well as literary texts.4 Immediately, however, we come face to face with a major problem in being so daring as to talk about the relationship between Homer, and Euripides or any other 5th Century author. This is the vast amount of lost literature which, if we possessed it, would inevitably modify any construct of intertextuality that we might develop. The problem is clear at the outset, even in the arguably simpler case of Sophocles. Sophocles may well have been ' OļurļpiKog. However, if we are to believe the judgement attributed to Zoilos, again as recorded in Athenaeus ( Deipn . 7. 277e), Sophocles also derived pleasure (e%aipe) out of the Epic Cycle , so as even to compose whole dramas following its story-lines. Now, there are complex issues here involving, among other things, distinctions which might need to be made between poetic style and subject matter. Nevertheless, given the loss of most of the Epic Cycle , it remains true that when, in Sophocles, we find a particular feature which seems 'Homeric', or more specifically 'Iliadic' or 'Odyssean', such a feature may have been appropriated as Sophoclean indirectly in the first instance via the lost works of the Cycle. Euripides too must have been familiar with the Cycle.5 For all that, with regard to the Troades at least, there does seem to be a case for regarding the Iliad as especially influential. As N. T. Croally6 has recently emphasised, given not only Homer's authority in general, but also the fact that it was Homer who had bequeathed war as the appropriate scenario for an examination of human experience, Euripides' own treatment of war in a directly Trojan context was bound to be marked by a strong Iliadic impulse in particular. It is now time to test this hypothesis in detail. The first, and obvious point to make, is that in the Troades there is very little direct quotation of Homer, or very little unambiguous poetic allusion to the Homeric texts, call it what you like. All that Richard Garner7 can come up with is the expression ôoúÀeiov quepa v (7r. 1330), used in lament by Hecabe, which appears to echo the Homeric ôouÀiov 3 See Michael J. Anderson, The Fall of Troy in early Greek Poetry and Art (Oxford 1997) 179-265, for a thorough discussion of Dioupersis iconography, which must have been an important part of this nexus in specific connection with Euripides' Troades. Excellent recent discussions of aspects of Euripides' relationship with Homeric and other texts include Froma I. Zeitlin, 'The Closet of Masks: role-playing and myth-making in the Orestes of Euripides', Ramus 9 (1980) 51-77, Simon Goldhill, Reading Greek Tragedy (Cambridge 1986) 138-67 and 244-64, Froma Zeitlin, 'Euripides' Hekabe and the Somatics of Dionysiac Drama', Ramus 20 (1991) 53-94, Charles Segal, Euripides and the Poetics of Sorrow (Durham and London 1993) passim , Judith Mossman, Wild Justice (Oxford 1995) 19-47. 5 An acknowledgement of the importance of all of the early epics wisely leads Anderson, The Fall of Troy (n. 3 above), to take not the Iliad and Odyssey as the starting point for his analysis of material concerned with the Fall of Troy, but rather the wider 'Ilioupersis episodes'. For a statement of his position, see 10-1 1 . 6 N. T. Croally, Euripidean Polemic: The Trojan Women and the Function of Tragedy (Cambridge 1994) 50. 7 Richard Garner, From Homer to Tragedy (London and New York 1990) 165 and 253 n. 53.</page><page sequence="3">JOHN DAVIDSON: HOMER AND EURIPIDES' TROADES 67 iVap which Hector imagines as being in store for Andromache (//. 6. 463).8 Garner also notes the phrase V8Ki3cov aļievrļva Kaptļva, used four times in the Odyssey (10. 521, 536; 1 1. 29, 49) as the possible model for Hecabe's self-description veKiiœv ajuevTļvov aya X'ia ( Tr . 193). The commentaries of Werner Biehl,9 K. H. Lee,10 and Shirley Barlow11 add little to Garner, and what we do find is for the most part already at one stage removed from the kind of specific allusion which Garner focuses on. Perhaps the closest thing to an allusion as such, noted by Lee, is the chorus' metaphor describing the death of Priam (|iéAaç yàp õooc KaxeicaAi)- / iļre úávaTOÇ, Tr. 1315-16), which is certainly reminiscent in particular of the depiction of Erymas' death at the hands of Idomeneus (öavcnrou ôè 'xéXav vé&lt;poç àji(peKáA,ui1íev, //. 16. 350). In the Euripidean context, the further description of Priam's ôávairoç as ooioç àvooíoiç CKpayaîoiv (1316) serves to underline the already inherent contrast between the killing of a warrior in battle, and the murder of a defenceless old man at an altar. A number of other possible points of semi-direct contrast between the Euripidean and Homeric texts are noted by Barlow. In speaking of Hector, Andromache says: oè ô' a&gt; (píÀ' vĒKiop, eï%ov avôp' àpKoûvxa ļuoi / Çuvéoei yévei ttàoiîtcoi ie icàvôpeiai ļLieyav (Tr. 673-7 4). This recalls her appeal at II. 6. 429-30, "ĒKTop, àxàp ov ļuoi éoai 7raTf)p Kai TüÓTVia jiīļTTļp / i1Ôè KaaíyvTiTOç, ai) ôè ļuoi ôaÀepòç 7uapaicorrrļ&lt;;, Euripides replacing four 'people' nouns with four impersonal, abstract nouns.12 In Hecabe's speech after the exit of Cassandra, the queen requests to be taken OTißaöa Ttpòç xaļiai7rerrļ / TOxpivà te KpīļčteļLiv', cbç Tueaoûo' á7ro(púap¿) / ôaKpúoiç KaTaÇavôeîoa (507-09). Barlow's note on this is worth quoting in full: krēdemnon is a woman's head-dress and refers here to a place for the head i.e. the stony ground which must be her pillow. But the word also has, from Homer, metaphorical connotations of the rocky battlements which crown Troy (see II. 16. 100, Od. 13. 388). And the adjective petrina invites that association, so that we have here a double image of stony ground as headrest for Hecuba and also rocky battlements destructive to anyone who is flung from them. Although perhaps far-fetched, this is, nevertheless, an ingenious suggestion.13 Barlow also comments on Hecabe's description of Helen as Kaotopi Acoßav (Tr. 132), referring to II. 3. 242 where Helen speculates that one reason for the non-appearance of her brothers before the walls of Troy may be that they are aïo^ea ôeiôiÓTeç Kai óveíôea nóXX' 8 Euripides uses the exact Homeric version at Andr. 99 and Hec. 56.

Segal, Poetics of Sorrow (n. 4 above) 173, who comments: 'Euripides here draws on the Homeric analogy between breaking the krēdemnon (veil) of the city's towers and tearing the krēdemnon that protects a matron's chastity'. Segal also (269 n.13) points to II. 22. 469-72 with the analysis of Michael N. Nagler, Spontaneity and Tradition: a study in the oral art of Homer (Berkeley and Los Angeles 1974) 45ff.</page><page sequence="4">68 BICS-45 - 2001 â ļnoi éoTiv. She also draws attention to the hapax ouvapioxeiícov at Tr. 804-05 (used by the chorus to characterize Telamón as he accompanied Heracles in the earlier attack on Troy), noting that the uncompounded àpioxeuco is common in Homer, being used at //. 6. 208, for example, to define the heroic ideal, as spelt out by Hippolochus to his son Glàucus, and as then duly related by Glaucus to Diomedes. But there is certainly no case here for any direct or significant link between the Troades and the Iliad.14 Barlow finally notes the Homeric epithet iTTTioßoTOV, applied by the chorus to Argos (Tr. 1086), to which can be added Homeric-type epithets such as xaÀKeyxéíov (Tr. 143) and xaÀKeojLiT10Topo&lt;; (Tr. 272), a hapax in each case.15 Lee, additionally, draws attention to the Homeric feminine form "IÀioç (Tr. 123), Tragedy normally using the neuter vIAiov. There is also the phrase Çeoxòv A,ó%ov (Tr. 534), of the Trojan Horse and its occupants, which recalls the context at Od. 4. 271-73 where the phrase iTtTTGH evi šeoTCÍH is used. Otherwise, Lee only notes the phrase Kuaveav ¿tù vaûv (Tr. 1094) which recalls the Homeric epithet KuavÓTrpanpoç,16 as well as speculating that the only example in tragic trimeters of the word Xi'xvr' in the sense of 'sea' (Tr. 442)17 may be due to the fact that it occurs in the course of Cassandra's summary of the trials awaiting Odysseus, originally described in the Odyssey. 18 Finally, Lee accepts Denniston' s demonstration that the expression outcd 0fļ is often used in Homer to introduce an indignant question, with the result that the third stasimon of the Troades , which starts with this very combination, should also be punctuated as a question, as following Homeric precedent. Barlow, however, wants to take the words as a statement, preferring the policy of most previous editors.19 Lee also observes that Hecabe's words at Tr. 1242-45 appear to echo the Homeric sentiment (II. 6. 357-58 and Od. 8. 579-80) that the gods send humans woes in order that they may become a subject for song.20 As far as actual language is concerned, then, Euripides is certainly not, in the Troades , going out of his way to draw attention to details of the Homeric texts.21 Where he does, however, ally himself more closely with Homer, is in the more general area which we might call situational allusion, and it is this aspect which we will now examine more closely. 14 The same applies to Hecabe's address to a Cassandra already in absentia : oïaiç ëÀuaaç ouļi (popaîç ãyvei)|ia oòv (Tr. 501). Barlow raises the possibility that this may be taken as reminiscent of the Homeric Àûoe ôè 7tapůevvr)v fcavTļv (Od. 11. 245). While the concept, or at least its expression in poetry, certainly goes back to Homer, a direct link between the Homeric text and Euripides seems highly unlikely. Lee cites one of no doubt many intermediary texts: Àúoi K8V x«Awòv ťxp' řjpcoi rcapúevíaç (Pi. I. 8. 48). 15 Euripides also uses the hapax xaÀKéoTrÀoç (Hel. 693), as well as ôopiiiiíoTtop ( Andr . 1016), and KaÀÀÍTieTCÀoi (Tr. 338). 16 Euripides' use of keàccivóç and fje'Àaiva in the first stasimon has already been noted above. Homer often uses the word with this meaning. Gerson Schade, 'EURIPIDES, TROADES 442', RhM 141 (1998) 206-08, makes the not entirely convincing case that the word Àí|nvr| here should rather be taken as referring to the Underworld lake. 19 She is unable to print this, of course, since she is using Diggle's 1981 OCT text which keeps the question option. 20 Cf. eg. Justina Gregory, Euripides and the Instruction of the Athenians (Ann Arbor 1991) 176-77 and 182 n. 46. 21 The many 'Homerisms' noted in Biehl's commentary (n. 9 above) are for the most part further individual words or phrases of a general nature which show Euripides employing an inherited vocabulary rather than making any kind of pointed or specific allusion to the Homeric texts.</page><page sequence="5">JOHN DAVIDSON: HOMER AND EURIPIDES' TROADES 69 The situation which Euripides in fact dramatizes in the Troades, namely the sack of Troy after its capture, with the concomitant killing of Trojan males and enslavement of Trojan females, is foreshadowed throughout the Iliad and indeed predicted there. Thus, at the beginning of Iliad 12, the poet momentarily looks ahead to the aftermath of Troy's destruction, when the Greeks have gone home and the defensive wall for their ships, built without the offering of hecatombs, will be obliterated in a watery deluge. In Iliad 20 too, Hera makes it very clear to Poseidon, who fears that Aeneas will be slain by Achilles, that he can worry about Aeneas if he likes, but that she herself and Athene have sworn never to ward off the day of evil (kcckòv iļ|uap) from the Trojans ({ jnr|õ' otīot' av Tpoitļ ļiaAepan 7ii)pi nàoa ôár|Tai / Kaiopevrļ, Kaíaxn ô' aptļioi uîeç ' A%ai6)v}, 316-17).22 At the same time, the brutal behaviour of the Greeks, as seen in the action of the Troades , is signposted by passages such as that in which Achilles asks his mother Thetis that he be allowed to win glory and to make some Trojan or Dardanian woman lament bitterly while wiping away with both hands the tears from her tender cheeks (II. 18. 121-24), or again that in which Agamemnon castigates Menelaus (on the point of taking the Trojan Adrastus prisoner) with the words: t£&gt;v (i.e. the Trojans) ļniļ tiç imeiopiîyoi ainbv õÀeôpov / xeípáç ô' r||Li8T8paç, ļūļ0' ov ti va yaoTépi jniÍTrip / Koöpov éóvTa cpepoi (II. 6. 57-59). The consequences of the destruction of Troy are also foreshadowed from the point of view of the victims. Thus Phoenix, in his appeal to Achilles in Iliad 9, while relating the story of Meleager, makes Meleager's wife remind him of the misfortunes which befall a captured city - death for the men, fire for the city itself, enslavement for the women and children (II 9. 591-94). More specifically, in Iliad 17, when Hector is encouraging his allies to help him seize the body of Patroclus, he tells them that he collected them from their cities to save Trojan wives and innocent children from the war-loving Achaeans (II. 17. 222-24). Then again, at II. 16. 830-33, he taunts the mortally wounded Patroclus with his mistaken belief that he could sack Troy and lead off the women into slavery. Even closer to home, so to speak, in Iliad 6, Hector tells Andromache that he knows deep down that one day Troy and Priam and his people will be destroyed (II 6. 447-49). He then goes on to say that what affects him even more than the prospect of his mother's, father's, and brothers' woe at that time is the thought of Andromache's grief when she is led off into slavery (II. 6. 450-65). In similar vein Priam, when pleading with Hector in Iliad 22 not to face Achilles, enunciates his own vision of disaster - his sons being killed, his daughters dragged off, his chambers looted, innocent children thrown to the ground, his daughters-in-law being hauled away, he himself murdered and torn by dogs (II. 22. 62-7 1).23 Finally, in Iliad 24, Andromache, lamenting over the body of Hector, expresses doubt that their son will reach manhood, and goes on to say: 7ipiv yàp ttóàiç rjôe kcct' ccKpr|ç / 7iépoeTai* īļ yàp oÀcoÀaç cttíokoixoç, oç tc 1LUV auTfļv / púoice', e%eç ô' odó%ouç Keôvàç Kai, vifaia Téicva. / aí 22 At //.21. 369ff., the river Xanthus, appealing to Hera to make Hephaestus remove his fire, says that he will swear the same oath. 23 Anderson, The Fall of Troy (n. 3 above) 158, describes Hecabe's catalogue of loss (7r. 474-99) as 'an unmistakable adaptation of Priam's Ilioupersis vision in Iliad 22 ...', and he continues: ' ... the two speeches are motivated by analogous dramatic stimuli. Priam discloses his vision as a final plea to his son Hektor, and Hekabe delivers her speech in response to the loss of her daughter Kassandra. In adapting the design from the Iliad, Euripides has granted Hekabe the epic roles previously granted to her husband.'</page><page sequence="6">70 BICS-45 - 2001 ô' r¡Toi záxa vrļuoiv oxifoovTai yÀaípupriioiv, / k«' ļnev éycb |ueTà Tfļiov ob ô ' aí, T8KOÇ, rļ* 61LXOI aínrji / ítyeai, ëvûa K8V ëpya àeiicea épyáÇoio / àôÀeúcov Tipo âvaiciroç aļLi8iA,i%ou, r¡ Tiç ' Axaiôv / piiļiei xeipòç èXiòv ànò Ttupyou, Auypòv õÀeôpov ... (//. 24. 728-35). It is clear, then, that the Troades represents the realization of the future clearly outlined in the Iliad. Of course, it is also true that many post-Iliadic texts (such as the Little Iliad and I liou Persis of the Cycle, Stesichorus' Iliou Persis and a number of non-extant tragedies) specifically dealt with the actual sack of Troy and its aftermath, so that Euripides' Troades has to be seen in relationship to them as well. Thus if lost texts were recovered, a much more complicated intertextual dynamic would no doubt be revealed. Moreover, the picture might well be further importantly modified if we possessed the Alexander and Palamedes which Euripides produced along with the Troades in 415 BC.24 However, it still seems reasonable to assume that the Iliad has special significance for Euripides as the overarching text, so to speak, for the concerns with which he is dealing in the Troades.25 We can pursue this line of approach further in terms both of situational similarity and development, and also of situational contrast. In the introduction to her commentary, Barlow26 finds particular significance for the Troades in the recurring themes of ships, walls, and fire, themes used both symbolically and literally as generators of action.27 A comparison with the Iliad is instructive. The Homeric military conflict is played out in a space bound by the Greek ships at one extreme and the walls of Troy at the other. The ships have brought the invading Greeks to Troy, and they are the key to their departure home. There are, indeed, moments when consideration is given to launching them and abandoning the attack on Troy. The aim of the male Trojan warriors is to reach the ships, to set fire to them, and they come tantalizingly cióse to this under Hector's leadership. In the Troades , the ships have become the destination of the female Trojans, but for very different reasons. They are to be dragged off to the ships unwillingly and taken away to exile and slavery. As in the Iliad , the ships stand at the opposite end of the conceptual spectrum, in relation to Troy, being the means of conveyance to alien Greece.28 Images of fire are common in the Iliad. The battle in general is said to rage like fire, and individual warriors are likened to fire. At II. 8. 508ff., Hector orders the burning of fires through the night to prevent the Greeks from attempting to set sail under cover of darkness. It becomes Hector's preoccupation to set fire to the ships. In the Troades , it is not the firing of ships, but the firing of Troy itself, which marks the play's conclusion, a conclusion foreseen for Troy specifically in passages like II. 20. 313-17 (Hera laying down the law to Poseidon), and II. 17. 736ff. (the simile of the spread of fire through an unnamed city), 24 Ruth Scodel, The Trojan Trilogy of Euripides (Göttingen 1980), demonstrates a range of interesting connections between the Troades and the other two plays. 25 The same conclusion about the special status of Homer vis-à-vis Euripides is also reached by Croally, Euripidean Polemic (n. 6 above) 50, and Mossman, Wild Justice (n. 4 above) 21. 26 Barlow, Trojan Women (n. 1 1 above) 32. 27 Elizabeth Craik, 'Sexual Imagery and Innuendo in Troades' in Euripides, Women, and Sexuality, ed. Anton Powell (London and New York 1990) 1-15, takes a Freudian view of the associated imagery. 28 At Tr. 687ff. too, Hecabe admits to never having been on a ship, before using the imagery of sailors on a rough sea to describe her response to serious troubles.</page><page sequence="7">JOHN DAVIDSON: HOMER AND EURIPIDES' TROADES 71 reinforced most directly by the image used, at II. 22. 410-1 1, to highlight the shrieking and lamenting response of Hecabe, Priam and the entire Trojan community to the moment when the slain Hector is tied to Achilles' chariot and dragged through the dust: toh ôè ļiaĀiOT' ap' 8Tļv evaAiyiaov, ùç ei cnraoa / vIÀioç òcppuóeooa nvpx o|uúxoito koct' aicpriç. As Adrian Poole puts it,29 this image 'marches straight into Euripides' play'. In the Iliad, the walls of Troy apparently offer safety to the Trojans. At II. 16. 702ff., with a little help from Apollo, they are able to thrust back the assault of Patroclus. At II. 18. 273- 76, Polydamas tells the Trojans that the city will be well guarded by its walls. At II. 22. 56, Priam begs Hector to retire within the protection of the walls and not face Achilles. The Troades opens with Poseidon proclaiming that his goodwill towards the Trojans has never failed from the time that he and Apollo built the walls of their city. These same walls are now doomed, and the play ends with Hecabe lamenting their final destruction.30 The figure of Andromache is clearly one of the most significant points of contact between the Troades and the Iliad. At Tr. 645ff., Andromache complains to Hecabe that her reputation for being a good wife to Hector has ironically resulted in her being picked out by Neoptolemus, the son of Hector's killer Achilles. In the Iliad , devoted wife that she is, in contrast to Helen, Andromache is first sighted in Book 6, not in her home, but with Astyanax and a nurse on the walls of Troy, weeping. When she encounters Hector at the Scaean Gate, she expresses her fears for his safety and for her future in the event of his death. After Hector's departure, she returns home and leads her female attendants in lament. In Iliad 22, she is seen on the walls responding to the sight of Hector's body being dragged away, and bewailing the lot in store for the fatherless Astyanax. In Iliad 24, she is seen lamenting over Hector's body. The Troades presents the final stage in this progression, when the city has fallen and her fears have become realized. Croally31 draws attention to Hector's words at II. 6. 490-93 when he says to his wife: &amp;XX' 8iç OIKOV ioûoa to o'auTfļg ëpya KOļuiCe, / íotóv ť r'XaKávr'v re, Kai à|i&lt;pi7i;&lt;Uoioi K6À6U8 / ěpyov éttoíxeoôai* TióXejuoç ô' avôpeaai ļneA/iļoei / 7iâoi, inaAioxa ô' é^ioí, toi ' IÀían èyyeyáaoiv, words which are echoed by Telemachus to his mother Penelope at Od. 1. 356-59, but with jnûôoç substituted for TîôAejjoç. In the Troades , there is no 'home' for the women to go to.32 For the women of Troy, TróÀejuoç and jiûûoç are their primary concerns. Astyanax too becomes a crucial part of Euripides' portrayal of the aftermath of the Iliad. Like Andromache herself, he is first seen in the Iliad on the walls of Troy, the walls from which his mother fears he may later be thrown to his death, the fate which actually befalls 29 Adrian Poole, Total Disaster: Euripides The Trojan Women', Arion 3 n. s. (1976) 257-87 (278). 30 Croally, Euripidean Polemic (n. 6 above) 193-94, notes that the emphasis on walls makes Troy of the Troades significantly similar to Troy of the Iliad where walls are frequently mentioned and the idea of the polis as walled enclosure is pervasive. He also notes, however, that the sacredness of Troy and its walls, so often reiterated in the Iliad, is only referned to once in the Troades (122). This confirms the departure of the gods from Troy, and the fact that the city has been destroyed. 31 Euripidean Polemic (n. 6 above) 201-02. 32 Ultimately, of course, Andromache does find other homes and new domestic environments in Greece.</page><page sequence="8">72 BICS-45 - 2001 him in the Troades .33 Perhaps subtly ironic too is the little touch by which Euripides makes him cling to his mother in fear of the Greek soldiers. In the famous passage in Iliad 6, it is his nurse to whom he clings, when afraid of the crest on his father's helmet. In the Troades too there is no longer any nurse to turn to.34 In the Troades , the child is isolated with its mother, as defenceless and vulnerable, as alone as she is.35 There is also an interesting detail by which the Euripidean Talthybius, after Astyanax's murder, tells Hecabe that he has already washed the child's wounds, in the waters of the Scamander no less, a detail which recalls Homer's piece of information that Hector called the child Scamandrius, the name Astyanax being used by others. This detail too cannot but bring to mind the washing of the corpses of Sarpedon and Patroclus, and in particular the words to Priam of the disguised Hermes, who is escorting him, about the washing of Hector's wounds.36 There is more. Euripides introduces Andromache together with Astyanax into the Troades in a cart,37 alongside Héctor' s bronze weaponry. Hector himself is often seen in the Iliad, of course, riding in his chariot , and at IL 8. 185-90 Andromache is said by Hector to have looked after his horses. In Iliad 24, though, it is in a cart38 that Priam brings back Hector's body. There is an added poignancy, then, in the Troades , for a cart to be the conveyance for Hector's widow, fatherless son and empty armour. This same armour itself has been put by Achilles on to his chariot at II. 22. 399. Hector's shield, moreover, becomes the bier for the dead Astyanax whom Andromache herself is not given leave to bury.39 As she tells Astyanax (752-53), Hector himself will not be coming back with his spear to save him. 33 Seth L. Schein, The Mortal Hero (Berkeley/Los Angeles/London 1984) 190, draws attention to the fact that whereas in the Iliad the posited motivation for Astyanax's murder is the likely anger of some Greek whose brother, father or son had been killed by Hector, in the Troades the actual motivation is Greek fear that he might grow up to avenge his father and city. 34 In the Little Iliad , as we know from Fr. 21 Iliades Parvae (Bernabé) = Fr. 20 Ilias Parva F (Davies), a nurse still featured. Neoptolemus snatched the child from this nurse and threw him from the walls. 35 With regard to Astyanax, Ra' anana Meridor, 'Euripides' Troades 28-44 and the Andromache Scene', AJPh 110 (1989) 17-35, argues unconvincingly that Euripides does not want his audience at first to be reminded of Astyanax's fate, hinted at in the Iliad, and spelt out in the Epic Cycle. This is one reason, the argument goes, for just a brief reference to Andromache in the first epeisodion and the total silence about her in the prologue. For the same reason, it is alleged, though Priam's death is stressed, his killer is not named - the tradition had Neoptolemus responsible for the deaths of both Priam and Astyanax. The argument continues that when Andromache does enter, with Astyanax, the focus is placed firmly on her wifely role, rather than on her maternal role, and on herself and her fate. Thus the audience can readily identify with the hopes expressed by Hecabe for Astyanax's future, which makes the subsequent announcement that Astyanax is to be killed unexpected and shocking. So much for the argument. Given the tradition, however, it seems rather that the audience would still expect Astyanax to be killed, and the sight of him clinging to his mother would give added poignancy to the whole scene and clothe Hecabe's hopes for the boy's future with tragic irony. 36 Also in connection with Astyanax, Talthybius orders Andromache to accept the army's decision about Astyanax's fate, without causing trouble. He threatens that, if she does make the army annoyed, Astyanax may be denied burial rites. This threatened loss of due burial, of course, is also applied to Hector in the Iliad. Croally, Euripidean Polemic (n. 6 above) 75 n. 9, points to II. 11. 451-55 where Odysseus gloats over the dead Socus because he will not receive burial at the hands of his parents. 37 The chorus describe her as ÇeviKOÎç érc' õxoiç (569), and then say à7ti1VT1ç vcátoioi (peprji (572). 38 Both ā'iaĶa and aTufjvr| are used to describe this. Though it is Hector's helmet which features in the Scaean gate episode in Iliad 6, attention is also drawn to his shield when he retires from the battle to return to the city (117-18). For a recent, most sensitive discussion of Astyanax's death, see M. Dyson and K. H. Lee, 'The Funeral of Astyanax in Euripides' Troades' JHS 120 (2000) 17-33.</page><page sequence="9">JOHN DAVIDSON: HOMER AND EURIPIDES' TROADES 73 There is, moreover, a further irony in that Andromache reminds Hector at II. 6. 414ff. that her father Eëtion was killed by Achilles who, however, baulked at the prospect of despoiling him, but burned him along with his armour. At Tr. 1133ff., Talthybius tells Hecabe that Andromache has begged Achilles' son Neoptolemus to give up Hector's shield as a coffin for Astyanax. Like his father, Neoptolemus now has certain scruples about carrying off the armour as loot. In Eëtion' s case, the whole armour was released. In Astyanax' s case, pathetically, the release is only of the body-bearing shield, that same shield which, as Talthybius notes, had protected the living body of Hector, as well as inspiring fear in his Greek enemies. Many other links of this nature can be identified. In some cases, what was seen in miniature in the Iliad is seen worked through in full in the Troades. Thus, for example, whereas Priam took specified treasure to the Greek camp to ransom Hector's body, Poseidon in the Troades prologue tells of all the Trojan gold going to the Greek ships. While in the Iliad, moreover, Achilles' 'triumph' over Hector is seen in the context of predictions that he himself is doomed to die soon, the entire action of the Troades is seen in the context of the divinely appointed destruction looming over the heads of all the apparently triumphant Greeks.40 Again, although much of Cassandra's role in the Troades looks back, at least from our limited perspective, rather to Aeschylus' Agamemnon , we need to remind ourselves that it is Cassandra who, at IL 24. 700ff., notes the return of Priam with Hector's body in the cart, and makes it known with a cry to the whole city. Cassandra's exit in the Troades clears the stage for the arrival of Anromache in her cart. With regard to Cassandra too, Talthybius lays a certain stress on Agamemnon's sexual desire for her, as his comment at 1. 255 (ëpœç éxóÇeuo' aikòv évûéou KOptļg) shows. Again, at 413-15, he says: ó yàp liéyioTog tûv IlaveM/nvcav âvaÇ, / ' Arpecoç &lt;pttoç Traí«;, TT10Ô' ëpcoT' éÇaipeTOV / ¿laiváôoç ímeorry It is easier to understand Agamemnon's motivation, perhaps, when we recall Homer's description of Cassandra as most beautiful of the daughters of Priam (II. 13. 365) and as ÍK8ÀT1 xpuafji ' A(ppoôvuT]i (II. 24. 699).41 Even the figure of Talthybius himself can be seen to have a certain Homeric colouring, which goes beyond the one-dimensional Homeric Talthybius figure, when his sinister entry with the corpse of Astyanax is placed alongside the escort duty of psychopompos Hermes in relation to the body of Hector. Intriguing facets of the god Poseidon, as seen in the Troades prologue, can also be brought into play. The Homeric enemy of the Trojans has,42 under Euripides' strategy, become their 40 T. Sienkiewicz, 'Euripides* Trojan Women : an Interpretation', Helios 6 (1978) 81-95 (88-90), compares Hecabe' s reflection of Troy past and Troy present (Tr. 146-52) with the two cities on Achilles' shield in the Iliad - the city at peace with joyful song (II. 18. 491-96), and the city under siege (II. 18. 509-21). In Homer, the two cities have separate identities. In Euripides, however, the contrast is between different temporal stages of the same city. What is visual contrast on Achilles' shield and verbal contrast in the Iliad becomes ironic contrast, both verbal and situational, in the Troades. 41 Ruth Scodel, "The Captive's Dilemma: sexual acquiescence in Euripides Hecuba and Troades' HSCPh 98 (1998) 137-54, discusses the sexual relationships between victors and captive women in the two plays, in relation to the Iliad. 42 Pace J. Fontenrose, 'Poseidon in the Troades' ArQN 1 (1967) 135-41, and 'A Response to Wilson's Reply on Troades' AVON 2 (1968) 69-71.</page><page sequence="10">74 BICS-45 - 2001 friend.43 At II. 20. 293ff., however, Poseidon already feels sorry for the Trojan Aeneas.44 Moreover, his agreement to help Athene's plan to destroy the Greek ships on the return journey brings to mind the Homeric scenario by which Poseidon is said to have Zeus' per- mission to (//. 7. 459-63), and will in fact (II. 12. 27ff.), destroy the Greeks' defensive wall (after the war) with a deluge. Finally, the meeting and conversing on the part of two deities coming from opposite 'camps' is reminiscent of the similar encounter between Athene and Apolloat//.7.22ff. In the light of all this, it seems reasonable to conclude that at a fairly uncomplicated level Euripides is constantly working with Homer, as it were, both building on or developing aspects of the Iliad in his own treatment of the story of Troy, and also playing up ironic and/or poignant situational contrasts. But can we go further than this? Can we isolate some more general, universal principle at work in the relationship between Homer and Euripides? This is not so easy to do. Let us turn to Sophocles for a moment, by way of comparison. Of Sophocles' surviving plays it is, of course, the Ajax which has the most direct connection with the Iliad, with its Trojan setting and explicit echoes, especially in the scene between the hero and Tecmessa. Bernard Knox45 argued that the Homeric echoes in the Ajax were designed to underline the point that the dated and unsatisfactory heroic code had disappeared finally with the death of Ajax. Criticism since then, however, has rather stressed the differences between the tragic drama and its epic forerunner, even in the figure of Ajax himself, as highlighted by Sophocles' reworking of the Homeric material.46 At the same time, it has been stressed that it is not just a simple case of contrast between heroic epic and problematic contemporary tragedy, but rather a more subtle process described by Simon Goldhill47 as 'the interpénétration of ideas, this dialectic whereby the values and characterization of the heroic past and contemporary world clash with, undermine, illuminate each other'. We would be well advised to bring at least something of the same caution to bear in connection with Euripides. Perhaps the question can be most conveniently addressed through a consideration now of the debate between Hecabe and Helen in the Troades. We immediately confront Homer here, both through Helen's argument that she is not responsible for the war,48 a view expressed to her by Priam at II. 3. 164, 49 and through the vexed question of whether the reconciled Menelaus and Helen of the Odyssey can be read into the conclusion of the scene. 43 Poseidon is also said to be favourable to the Trojans at/7 1414-15. 44 This point is made by J. R. Wilson, 'Poseidon in the Troades: a Reply', ArQN 2 (1968) 66-68 (67). 45 Bernard Knox, 'The Ajax of Sophocles', in Word and Action (Baltimore and London 1979) 125-60 (144-45), originally in HSCPh 65 (1961) 1-37 (20-21). 46 See eg. R. P. Winnington-Ingram, Sophocles: An Interpretation (Cambridge etc. 1980) 18-19, and P. E. Easterling, 'The Tragic Homer', BICS 31 (1984) 1-8. 47 Goldhill, Reading (n. 4 above) 161. Euripides, of course, goes much further than Homer, in making Helen add that she actually saved Greece from enslavement, the fate which would have followed Athene's or Hera's victory in the Judgement of Paris. 49 C. W. Amerasinghe, 'The Helen Episode in the Troiades', Ramus 2 (1973) 99-106 (105), emphasizes that Euripides has in mind the Helen of the Iliad for whom, he suggests, Homer engages all his audience's sympathy.</page><page sequence="11">JOHN DAVIDSON: HOMER AND EURIPIDES' TROADES 75 Most critics nowadays would probably agree in general with Vernanťs formula which has tragedy confronting 'heroic values and ancient religious representations with the new modes of thought that characterise the advent of law within the city-state.'50 The question, though, is how in fact this is to be applied to the specific case of the debate between the two captive women. An extreme position is adopted by George Gellie,51 for whom the scene displays the shallowness and hollowness of Helen, and he writes: 'Helen's self-defence depends primarily on an old-fashioned reading of myth, a child's version of the old Homeric and cyclic stories'.52 Homer is thus, in Gellie's view, acting as a sort of refuge for the Helen of the Troades , but it is a refuge which the scene dismantles, leaving Helen looking foolish. So, as Gellie continues, 'Homer lives on but he has to live with a Hecuba who is better at just one thing - at seeing past the special truths of poetry to the nasty unpoetic causes of things.'53 The majority viewpoint, however, would not see things in such black and white terms. Michael Lloyd,54 for example, takes the position that there is nothing implausible about Helen's emphasis on the àpxA of the Trojan War, and that her arguments, which seek to show that the guilt is widely spread, are quite reasonable. Lloyd's Helen is not taking refuge in Homer. Rather, she is simply arguing from a different standpoint from Hecabe, using some Homeric-type arguments perhaps, but as part of a wide-ranging case structured on 5th Century principles of sophistic and/or forensic argumentation. Somewhat differently, Waltraut Desch55 suggests that while Helen pleads in terms of the unpurified myth which, for Euripides, has become brittle, it seems uncertain whether the grounds on which Helen and Hecabe argue are really incompatible with each other, since Hecabe rejects neither the concept of anthropomorphic gods nor the fact of the Judgement of Paris.56 So it becomes rather complicated. Is it a case of Homeric approach versus 5th Century approach, with the latter showing up the deficiency of the former (Gellie)? Or is it Homeric approach, but Homeric approach argued plausibly and convincingly in a 5th Century way,57 50 See eg. J.-P. Vernant and P. Vidal-Naquet, Tragedy and Myth in Ancient Greece , trans. Janet Lloyd (Brighton and Atlantic Highlands 1981) 4. 51 George Gellie, 'Helen in the Trojan Women' in Studies in Honour ofT.B.L. Webster Vol. /, ed. J. H. Betts, J. T. Hooker, and J. R. Green (Bristol 1986) 1 14-21. Ibid. 116. 53 Ibid. 118-19. 54 Michael Lloyd, 'The Helen Scene in Euripides' Troades' CQ 34 (1984) 303-13. Cf. also his book, The Agon in Euripides (Oxford 1992) 99-1 12. 55 Waltraut Desch, 'Die Hauptgestalten in des Euripides Troerinnen', Grazer Beiträge 12 (1985) 65-100 (83). 56 Of course, if we read the crucial emendation où for ai in line 975 (as Diggle does, followed by Barlow-Lloyd accepts it too), then Hecabe does reject the Judgement, but she still talks in anthropomorphic terms (if idealized) of the deities. Similarly, Heracles in the HF, while being made to dismiss the 'immoral' traditional stories of myth as àoiôô&gt;v ... ôi5ott|voi Àóyoi (HF 1346), is still made to 'accept' as a 'reality' a phenomenon such as Hera's vendetta against him. This is not the place, however, to go into the whole contentious issue of Euripides' attitude towards deity as such. 57 In any case, we also have to take into account the fact that, irrespective of who was arguing, whatever arguments were being used would inevitably be framed at least largely in a 5th Century manner, because that was the way in which Euripides would write a debate. For a recent, succinct discussion of the Troades debate and the question of its possible relationship with Górgias' Encomium of Helen, see Desmond Conacher, Euripides and the Sophists (London 1998) 51-58.</page><page sequence="12">76 BICS-45 - 2001 versus 5th Century approach (Lloyd)? Or is it Homeric approach versus modified Homeric approach (Desch)?58 On the question of a connection with the Odyssey , Gellie's view is that Odyssey 4 is an inextricable part of the fabric of the Euripidean scene, and he argues that the Odyssey has in fact already been made part of the story through Cassandra's earlier predictions about the trials awaiting Odysseus.59 Arising from this is his point that one of the worst aspects of the scene is that Helen and Menelaus, the two empty people, are going to come through the whole disaster unscathed to be the contented couple of Odyssey 4. At the other extreme, Lloyd60 argues that since, in his view, there is no indication in the play itself that Menelaus is not going to kill Helen when they get back to Greece, the usual story of an eventual reconciliation and happy life together again, as found in the Odyssey , is simply not relevant: '... we are not entitled to make use of our knowledge of the story if nothing is made of it in the play.' The assumption that 'nothing is made of iť, however, appears to be unsound, and Lloyd's approach seems to be discredited by a variety of specific factors, taken in conjunction with the general Homeric nuances of the play.61 In the later discussion in his book,62 Lloyd modifies his position, leaving the question open. Croally also takes this more balanced view: It will not really do simply to assert that the audience will remember Homer and therefore assume Helen has won, nor that we can ignore Homer altogether ... the Euripidean version must necessarily and permanently grate against the mythical and literary traditions, leaving the question unresolved.'63 This is more subtle, in a sense, than Gellie, and quite plausible, though we might also call it fence sitting.64 In the end, whether we adopt the Gellie view or the modified Lloyd/Croally view, there is no doubt that Homeric and 5th Century visions, values, and viewpoints are in tension in the debate between Helen and Hecabe, as well as throughout the play as a whole. 58 There are, of course, further variations on these approaches. For example, Hugh Lloyd-Jones, The Justice of Zeus (Berkeley/Los Angeles/London 1971)150-51, lays emphasis on the idea that already in Homer the gods work through human motivations. Thus, even by Homeric standards, both Helen and Hecabe are 'right' when they argue that Aphrodite and 'vanity and lust' respectively was the driving force behind Helen's elopement with Paris. He concludes, however, that 'Hecuba is justified in brushing away Helen's excuses, not because Helen has spoken untruthfully when she has blamed the gods, but because here as in Homer mortals cannot evade responsibility for an action on the ground that it has been prompted by a god'. 59 Cf. Gregory, Instruction (n. 20 above) 180-81 n. 21. 60 'The Helen Scene' (n. 54 above). 61 Compelling arguments for the view that Euripides is indeed letting his audience know that Menelaus will not kill Helen are given by A. Maria van erp Taalman Kip, 'Truth in Tragedy: when are we entitled to doubt a character's words?', AJPh 1 17 (1996) 517-36 (534 n. 23). Cf. also Scodel, The Trojan Trilogy (n. 24 above) 98, and Scodel, 'The Captive's Dilemma' (n. 41 above) 152, with n. 27. This particular issue is not addressed by T. C. W. Stinton, 'The Scope and Limits of Allusion in Greek Tragedy', in Greek Tragedy and its Legacy: Essays presented to D. J. Conacher , ed. M. Cropp, E. Fantham, and S.

Croally, Euripidean Polemic (n. 6 above) 150, also points to the possible relevance of the Odyssey for an assessment of one of Hecabe's arguments, in noting that Hecabe minimizes the wealth of Sparta (Tr. 993) when she argues that Helen was lusting to immerse herself in eastern extravagance, whereas Odyssey 4 testifies to the magnificence of Menelaus' palace.</page><page sequence="13">JOHN DAVIDSON: HOMER AND EURIPIDES' TROADES 77 Let us return now to our point of departure, the opening of the first stasimon of Euripides' play: à|Li(pí ļioi ... ¿TtiKrjôeiov. Noting the epic flavour of the appeal to the Muse, Lee65 comments: ťIt is probable that the subject suggested this beginning to Euripides'. Then, explaining the adjective kccivídv, he notes that for the chorus, it refers to songs that are different from the ones sung previously, especially the songs of joy mentioned later in the stasimon. Then he adds: The word has also an extra-dramatic sense: the present song is 'new' when compared to the well-known epic treatment of the subject'.66 Barlow's comment67 is worth quoting at length. After also duly noting the epic flavour of the stasimon's opening, she goes on to say: Why should the poet wish to echo those features here? Not only because the theme of the Trojan war is an epic one, as Lee says, but because an epic beginning signals something important, grand and impressive, and the chorus wish to register some familiar credentials for this. But they then go on to imply in their subsequent words, kainõn humnõn , that the old forms and themes are to be told in a new way and the Muse pressed into service for a new kind of song. This is the lyric lament for Troy's destruction seen uniquely not through the eyes of warriors, but through those of a group of women. Their account is not the traditionally heroic one of glorifying war, yet it deserves, the poet implies, to be as important as epic in what new things it has to observe. There is, of course some irony too in this implied measuring of old attitudes against new ones. Reasonable as it sounds, Barlow's approach does not quite seem to work, especially if we think in terms of the Iliad. Barlow sees the comparison as being between male-warrior- oriented Epic Poetry as a genre and Tragedy, or more particularly a female-oriented Euripidean Tragedy. But we need to be more specific, for the comparison to have any real bite. The 'new' song of the chorus incorporates the notion of female lyric lament in a war setting, within the context of tragic drama. What it may also appropriately be set off against, given the epic indicators within the stasimon, is surely the notion of female lament within an epic context. Now, it may well be true that the most compelling picture of grief and lament in the Iliad is that of the warrior Achilles, both alone and on occasion in a context of general warrior solidarity, mourning the death of his friend and companion Patroclus. However, the Iliad also has a number of most powerful and poignant pictures of female grief.68 There is, of course, lament from the Greek side, Thetis leading the Nereids at II. 18. 37ff., Briseis at II. 19. 282ff. grieving for Patroclus and also her husband slain by Achilles, and her brothers, the women with Briseis likewise recalling their own sorrows. 65 Lee, Troades (n. 10 above), note ad loc. 66 There are several avenues of possible extra-dramatic significance for the word Kaivóç. Emily A. McDermott, 'Double Meaning and Mythic Novelty in Euripides' Plays', TAPhA 121 (1991) 123-32, argues that it is among words or phrases sometimes used by Euripides as a marker of his departure from the received mythic tradition. In specific connection with Tr. 512, Luigi Battezzato, in an unpublished paper, suggests that the song is 'new' because it inaug- urates the 'new' Greek genres that are created by the destruction and appropriation of Phrygian/Trojan culture. There could also be a potential connection with the concept of the special popularity of the 'latest' song, at Od. 1. 351-52. 67 Barlow, Trojan Women (n. 1 1 above), note ad loc. 68 For a summary discussion of women's laments in Homer, see Gail Holst-Warhaft, Dangerous Voices. Women's Laments and Greek Literature (London and New York 1992) 108-13. The Troades is not dealt with in this book.</page><page sequence="14">78 BICS-45 - 2001 More directly relevant, however, are the expressions of female grief on the Trojan side. In Iliad 6, when, despite his wife's tears, entreaties, and premonitions of disaster for Troy, Hector picks up his helmet with the horse-hair crest, Andromache returns home, often turning round and weeping. Once home, she leads her many female attendants in lamentation for Hector, while he is still alive (//. 6. 498-500). Iliad 22 presents the lament of Priam for Hector (408ff.), but also the lament of Hecabe (405-07 and 430-36), in the latter passage leading the lament of all the Trojan women.69 Her lament is then picked up by Andromache in an extended passage (460ff.) which concludes with the final line of Book 22 àç ë(pcczo kAccíodo', ¿Til ôè oxeváxovTO yvvaÎKeç (22. 515).70 At IL 24. 166-68, Iris finds Priam's daughters and daughters-in-law in lament, and the final part of the Iliad , from the moment when Cassandra catches sight of the returning cart (699ff.), details the lament of Troy, on the part both of unspecified women, and also in particular of Andromache, Hecabe and finally Helen herself,71 before Priam initiates preparations for the actual funeral pyre. The lament of the women, moreover, is not only for Hector, but also for Troy. Given all this, quite apart from what may or may not have occurred in lost Cyclic epics, poems by Stesichorus, Phrynichus' Capture of Miletus or whatever, the chorus in the first stasimon of Euripides' Troades are not raising a new uniquely female group lament over Troy. Euripides is building on, capitalising on the already existing poignancy of female lament in Epic, even if this is a relatively minor aspect of the Iliad, whereas in Euripides' hands it has become central.72 Euripides is in fact still being thoroughly Homeric, albeit in a tragic/ dramatic context. This seems to be what emerges primarily from this particular comparison. To conclude, then. It has been said in jest, though with considerable insight, that Euripides must have written at least Book 6 of the Iliad. Let us express this slightly less paradoxically. Euripides, in the Troades , may well be offering a critique of the phenomenon of war and/or of human behaviour. He may well also be involved in the intellectualizing or rationalizing of situations which runs parallel to the emotional responses to them. Thus, whereas in Iliad 24 there is only space for a distraught response on the part of the Trojans to Hector's death, Euripides makes Cassandra offer a logically argued case ( Tr . 386ff.) for the advantages which the Trojans in general have enjoyed over the Greeks, and for the glory and reputation to be enjoyed by Hector and even Paris as well.73 69 With regard to Hecabe, at Tr. 147 she herself says that she will lead off the lament, which in fact echoes her role in Iliad 22. Cf. Gregory, Instruction (n. 20 above) 162. For a most insightful discussion of how Homer in fact postpones Andromache's lament here by making her a belated receiver of the bad news, see Charles Segal, 'Andromache's Anagnorisis: Formulaic Artistry in Iliad 22. 437-76', HSCPh 75 (1971) 33-57. 71 For a brief analysis of the structure of these three laments at the end of Iliad 24, see M. Alexiou, The Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition (Cambridge 1974) 132-33. 72 Croally, Euripidean Polemic (n. 6 above) 245, gets things better in perspective than Barlow when he states that the extra-dramatic 'newness' of the chorus' song consists in the fact that this treatment of war is quite different from epic treatments because it is seen almost entirely through the eyes of women. 73 Moreover, as Croally, Euripidean Polemic (n. 6 above) 245-46 usefully points out, Cassandra is made to ignore the conventional advantages and glory issuing from military victory and thus disallows the possibility of singing about conventional epic themes. Through Cassandra, the play self-consciously distinguishes between tragic discourse, of which Cassandra is a part here, and epic, from which she is inherited.</page><page sequence="15">JOHN DAVIDSON: HOMER AND EURIPIDES' TROADES 79 So Euripides may well be intellectualizing. He may well also be problematizing Athenian ideology, he may well be locking sophistic horns with traditional modes of thought, he may well be dramatizing the tensions which arise from the interweaving of Homeric and 5th Century story-lines, approaches and insights. For all that, however, we should not be too quick to accept without modification the 'ironic contrast' designation. As John Gould74 has written of tragedy in general: For however much it is true that the relation of fifth-century theatre to the world of the Homeric epic is repeatedly an ironic and ambiguous one, still we should be all too obviously wrong to conclude that the heroic imagery of Homeric epic could not be handled by the fifth-century dramatists except ironically and was without directly accessible meaning to fifth-century audiences. It seems most reasonable to apply this even to Euripides. So while we can still validly say that in the Troades Euripides is setting off the epic past against the tragic present, he is at the same time offering an impassioned Homeric footnote, no, let us say an impassioned Homeric sequel, to the Iliad itself.
