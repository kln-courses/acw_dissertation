Sept Early archaeological sites in East Africa have traditionally been interpreted as home bases, suggesting that by two million years ago hominids had developed ranging behavior more similar to the subsistence patterns of modern human hunter-gatherers than to the individualistic foraging characteristic of other primates. This interpretation rests on assumptions about contrasts in the debris-producing behavior of primates and humans that have never been tested ethnoarchaeologically. To explore alternative behavioral processes that could have contributed to the forma- tion of early archaeological sites, field research was undertaken on the ranging patterns of a small population of wild chimpan- zees living along the Ishasha River in Zaire's Virunga National Park. This riparian habitat is comparable to the paleoenviron- mental contexts of many early archaeological sites in East Africa. Maps of the distribution of the nesting and feeding debris pro- duced by these chimpanzees formed patterns spatially analogous to concentrations of artifacts found at the early sites. These data raise questions about how the ecological structure and resource configuration of this habitat conditioned the spatial redundancy of the chimpanzees' debris patterns and the extent to which analogous processes may have helped to pattern the Plio/Pleisto- cene archaeological record. i.

Born in i955, she was educated at the University of California, Berkeley (A.B., 1977; Ph.D., I984), and was Visiting Professor at Harvard Uni- versity in i985-86. Her research interests are Plio/Pleistocene archaeology in East Africa, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, wild plant foods, chimpanzee ranging patterns, and early homi- nid paleoecology. She has published "Plant Foods and Early Hominids at Site FxJjso, Koobi Fora, Kenya" (Journal of Human Evolution 15:75I-70), "Vegetation Studies in the Semliki Valley, Zaire, as a Guide to Paleoanthropological Research: A Prelimi- nary Report," edited by N. Boaz (Virginia Museum of Natural History Memoirs I:95-124), and "Archaeological Evidence and Ecological Perspectives for Reconstructing Early Hominid Subsis- tence Behavior" (Archaeological Method and Theory 4:I-56). The present paper was submitted in final form 30 Ix 91. While every human culture defines "home" in a differ- ent way (see, e.g., Rybczynski I986), the spatial focus of many human social and economic activities is unique among the primates (cf. Hediger I977, Groves and Sa- bater Pi I985). Archaeologists have sought evidence for the origins and development of our unusual nesting be- havior in the earliest traces of cultural debris. Early ar- chaeological sites in East Africa have been interpreted to suggest that by two million years ago hominids made stone tools, ate meat, and had foraging strategies and ranging patterns that set them apart from the living Afri- can apes (Isaac I984). The concentrations of artifacts and animal remains that formed these Plio/Pleistocene sites have been viewed as early hominid "living sites," "camps," or "home bases" (e.g., Isaac I97I, Leakey I971), suggesting that hominids returned to central places after foraging, perhaps to seek refuge from carni- vores or to share food. Popularized by Isaac (I978) as the "food-sharing" or "home-base" hypothesis, this explana- tion of early sites implies that Plio/Pleistocene hominid tool makers were behaving in ways more similar to the cooperative foraging and camping patterns of modern human hunter-gatherers than to the individualistic for- aging and nesting behaviors characteristic of apes. Recent "middle-range" archaeological research pro- grams in East Africa have used taphonomic and other actualistic studies to reevaluate the home-base interpre- tation of early archaeological sites by investigating alter- native physical and behavioral processes that could have contributed to site formation (cf. Isaac I984). Ethnoar- chaeological research, in particular, has documented the debris patterns of modern human foragers in different settings, such as at butchery sites and seasonal camps, and compared them with patterns in the early sites (e.g., Bartram, Kroll, and Bunn I 99 ). Because early hominids were unlike living humans in many fundamental ways, however, it is important to seek a broader ethological framework than this for investigating the behavioral processes that formed the earliest archaeological sites. Since we have inherited many physiological and behav- ioral traits from an African hominoid stock, our knowl- edge of living African apes has been used to develop models of early hominid behavior (Wrangham I987). I87</page><page sequence="2">i88 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 33, Number 2, April 1992 Early archaeological evidence has often been compared with the behavior of living chimpanzees, in particular, because of chimpanzees' close evolutionary relationship to humans, their intelligence and technological skills, and their omnivorous diets and large ranges in savanna habitats (e.g., McGrew, Baldwin, and Tutin I98I, Kort- landt I986, Potts I987, Wynn and McGrew I989). This paper discusses the results of field research on the rang- ing patterns of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in eastern Zaire that was designed to test models of the formation of early archaeological sites in East Africa. Revisiting the Home-Base Model When Glynn Isaac developed the home-base model to explain the formation of sites such as FxJj i ("KBS") at Koobi Fora or FLK-Zinj at Olduvai Gorge (Isaac I97I, I978), three features common to these sites were critical to his argument: i. The artifacts recovered from the sites had been transported there artificially, often from separate raw- material sources, suggesting repeated visits to each site, perhaps by different individuals. 2. The bones associated with the artifacts came from different species of animal and different individuals of the same species, suggesting that meat was transported to the sites for several feeding episodes. 3. The sites were anomalous concentrations of debris, suggesting at the very least a coincident spatial focus for debris-producing activities and perhaps food-sharing as well. Challenged to consider alternatives to the home-base model of early site formation (cf. Isaac I980, I984; Bin- ford I98I), researchers have subsequently focused on each of these interrelated categories of evidence. Reconstruction of the processes that led to the con- centrations of artifacts at the sites has involved micro- sedimentary analyses of the site context, taphonomic and refitting studies of the artifacts, and identification of the sources of their raw materials. Water transport has been eliminated as a major agent of stone accumula- tion at many of the early sites, although artifacts in most cases have been rearranged or partially winnowed (Kau- fulu I983, Kroll and Isaac I984, Potts I988, Schick I986). Excavated artifacts can therefore be studied as "Stone Age visiting cards," marking the locations of stone manipulation across the ancient landscape (Isaac I98I). For example, sites in Bed I Olduvai contain arti- facts that have been transported as much as io km from their source (Hay I976; Potts I984, I988), and evidence that stones were transported at least 2-3 km is present at many of the early sites (Harris I978, Schick I987). There is no doubt that early hominids selectively transported raw materials and artifacts, producing both diffuse scatters of debris and site concentrations (Isaac I98I, I984; Potts I984; Schick I987). Potts, however (I984, I988), has focused attention on a weakness of the original home-base model-the assumption that artifact concentrations represented sites of social activity. His asocial alternative, the "stone-cache" hypothesis, sug- gests that concentrations could have formed if hominids were stockpiling transported stones in their foraging ter- ritories to serve as centralized tool sources for antici- pated food-processing needs such as butchery. While his hypothesis is not dependent on social interaction and usefully focuses on the costs and benefits of transport, it is based on the idea that hominids made deliberate decisions to concentrate artifacts. It therefore may as- sume an unnecessary degree of premeditation in hom- inid technological strategies (see Isaac I98I, I984; Binford I985; Schick I987; Potts I988:28I-82). More parsimoniously, stone artifacts could have become con- centrated as a result of a series of ad hoc decisions for tool use and discard at the site or could have been aban- doned in the course of other activities that would have recurred in the same locality but not have required tool use, such as feeding in a patch of fruit trees. Archaeologists now realize that the mere association of stones and bones is not sufficient grounds for claim- ing hominids as the main agents of site formation (cf. Binford I98I, I985; Isaac I984; Potts I988; Bunn I99I). Bones can accumulate on African landscapes through many natural processes. For example, Tappen (I990) has shown that isolated savanna trees frequently used as sleeping sites by lions in Zaire's Virunga National Park are surrounded by dense patches of fragmented bone from diverse animal species, with a skeletal-part repre- sentation that mimics aspects of early site assemblages. Blumenschine (i 986a, I989) has found that lions and leopards frequently abandon carcasses near tree-lined streams in the Serengeti, although only leopards have been observed to exhibit a fine-grained redundancy in their use of space and carcass discard patterns (Cavallo and Blumenschine I989). Water-margin habitats may also be sites of high natural mortality where animal bones can accumulate, often in dense concentrations (e.g., Dechant-Boaz I982). Because many of the bones found at early sites show extensive carnivore gnawing and breakage, researchers have searched for criteria for identifying the hominid contribution to these faunal as- semblages (cf. Hill I989, Binford, Mills, and Stone I988, Blumenschine I988, Marean and Spencer I99I). Cut- marks and hammerstone damage on at least some of the bones at these early sites prove that hominids were exploiting meat and marrow resources (e.g., Bunn I986; Bunn and Kroll I986; Potts I984, I987; Shipman I986; Blumenschine and Selvaggio I988). Skeletal-part fre- quencies strongly suggest that carcass parts were trans- ported to the sites by either carnivores or hominids (e.g., Bunn and Kroll I986, Shipman I986, Potts I987, Blu- menschine I986b). Although proof that hominids were the main importers of bones has so far eluded research- ers (Sept I992), even if they were the sites need not have been home bases. More than any other aspect of the early sites, their "coincident concentrations of bones and artifacts" (Isaac I984:27) were central to their initial interpretation as living floors; the pattern of artifacts and bqne debris was</page><page sequence="3">SEPT Was There No Place Like Home? I i89 seen as analogous to the debris patterns at modern hu- man camps, and so the processes that formed these de- bris patterns were assumed to be analogous as well. But that was a dangerous assumption. A site's location and local habitat structure may at- tract activities that would be likely to produce faunal remains or cultural debris. For example, the riverine sed- imentary environments in which sites were preserved may have been the "Hilton hotels" of early hominids (Isaac I978b:239)-prime refuge and resource zones for exploiting certain plant foods (Sept I986) or scav- engeable carcasses (Blumenschine I986a, I989). Local- ized resources within these zones, such as trees used for shade or sleeping refuges, could have been "common amenities" used by various feeding carnivores, as dis- cussed above, and by stone-flaking hominids lured by a shady refuge or seeking the bits of meat and marrow left at the site by previous visitors (Isaac I980, I984; Potts I984, I988). One could argue, intuitively, that such coincident uses of a grove of trees by carnivores and hominids would have been infrequent and unlikely to result in the formation of the dense concentrations of bone and stone that characterize some of the early sites. But such an argument would be impossible to test with the current range of actualistic evidence. For example, while shade is clearly an important constraint on the ranging pat- terns of both African open-country hunter-gatherers (e.g., Bartram, Kroll, and Bunn I99I) and carnivores, the spatial co-occurrence of the shaded activities of modern foragers and carnivores cannot be used to gauge the geo- graphical patterning of such activities in the Plio/Pleis- tocene, which had a very different community structure. Similarly, the few studies of modern foragers scavenging from carnivore kills in Africa have not yet documented an example of scavenging in the same place twice (O'Connell, Hawkes, and Blurton Jones I988, I990; Bunn, Bartram, and Kroll I988), but that does not neces- sarily mean that early hominids would rarely have revis- ited scavenging sites. Because modern hunter-gatherers such as the Hadza have such a wide range of subsistence opportunities available to them, including the use of modern hunting technology, vehicles, trade, gardening, and herding, it is perhaps surprising that scavenging is considered a cost-effective strategic option. However, even given the historical contingencies that shaped current hunter-gatherer socioeconomic patterns (e.g., Schrire I984, Wilmsen I989), studying the pro- cesses through which modern foragers create patterns of garbage has been fundamental to the development of alternative models of prehistoric site formation (Schiffer I987, Bunn I99I). Hunter-gatherers often return to camps where they share food and activities, and ethnoar- chaeologists have documented that these central places can be characterized by clustered patterns of refuse, with a diversity of artifacts and food remains that tends to increase with the length of occupation and the range of activities undertaken (e.g., Yellen I977, Binford I978, Fisher I987, Bunn, Bartram, and Kroll I988, Kent I99I, Bartram, Kroll, and Bunn 1991). Still, some patterns of camping produce few physical traces and have conse- quently limited archaeological visibility (Kent i99i, O'Connell, Hawkes, and Blurton Jones 199I, Marshall I990, Bartram, Kroll, and Bunn I99I), and, in contrast, debris accumulating at hunting blinds and other fre- quently used activity sites may mimic the debris pat- terns at camps (e.g., Binford I978, Brooks and Yellen I987, Crader I983). Therefore patches of garbage are not unambiguous signals of home-base behavior even among modern hunter-gatherers. Because ethnoarchaeological work has emphasized variability in both the patterns and the processes of arti- fact and bone accumulation, understanding the interre- lationships between activities and residue patterns from a wider range of behavioral and ecological contexts has become a research priority. Yet even if studies of hunter-gatherers were significantly expanded, our eth- noarchaeological criteria for interpreting the distinctive patches of debris at early sites would still be stubbornly biased towards modern human behavior patterns. To paraphrase Isaac, we have been using the early sites, fo- cused through the lens of ethnoarchaeology, as a mirror by which to obtain more or less familiar images of our- selves. Plio/Pleistocene archaeologists face a challenge (Isaac I986:237): Can we conceive of patterns of behavior and adapta- tion that could lead to the formation of familiar- looking patterns of archaeological evidence, and yet which were behaviors unfamiliar to us in that they were structured differently from recent and present- day human ones? Can we then figure out predictable differences in the archaeological evidence that will distinguish the various possible behavioral models? The research described below is an attempt to move in this direction. Comparing the Debris Patterns of Humans and Chimpanzees Early sites have been interpreted as home bases not only because of their apparent similarity to modern human camps but also because of the differences that they sug- gest from the patterns of feeding and ranging of other primates, particularly the African apes. In the first place, apes have very different patterns of tool making and meat eating than are evidenced at the early sites. Al- though capable of learning to flake stone (Wright I972; Gibbons I99I; R. Sevcik and N. Toth, personal commu- nication), they do not flake stone tools in their natural habitat, and only chimpanzees in West Africa are known to use hammerstones and stone anvils (Sugiyama and Koman I979; Boesch and Boesch I98I, I984; Kortlandt I986; Kortlandt and Holzhaus I987; Tomasello I990). No ape has been known to butcher or feed off the carcass of a large animal, and the fragmented bones of the small and often immature animals that chimpanzees do prey upon (Boesch and Boesch I989, Wrangham and van Zin-</page><page sequence="4">I90 I CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 33, Number 2, April 1992 nicq Bergmann Riss I990) have a low probability of be- ing preserved in the fossil record. Second, archaeologists have assumed that apelike feeding and ranging would not create clusters of debris analogous to early site concentrations. "Other non- human primate patterns include wide-ranging individ- ual trajectories with periodic social groupings, but with- out recurrently occupied spatial foci" (Kroll and Isaac I984:6). For example, Isaac's sketches of the day ranges of !Kung and chimpanzee (e.g., I983:533-34) contrast chimpanzees dispersed across the landscape with hu- mans returning to a central place and juxtapose the hu- man pattern with a plan of the Olduvai site FLK-Zinj. But the concentrations at early sites were judged to be human-like rather than apelike almost by default; there is no ethnoarchaeological record of apes that links their foraging, tool-making, or sleeping behaviors to corre- sponding patterns of debris. Apes rarely produce artifacts that would survive archaeologically and "do not create long-lasting concentrations of litter in their daily lives" (Kroll and Isaac I984:4); consequently their debris pat- terns have not been studied. Chimpanzees do, however, produce ephemeral debris: every time they weave and break branches to make a nest or fish for termites with twigs, they leave artifacts at the activity site; often when they feed they leave a residue of stems, seeds, nut shells, or even the hairs and bone fragments of small animal prey behind. To compare models of the behavioral processes that may have led to the formation of early sites, we need to un- couple the specific types of debris being produced from the patterns of that debris. In the same way that ethnoar- chaeological studies of modern humans who use metal cooking pots and weapons can be used to develop mod- els of the activity patterning at Stone Age archaeological sites (e.g., Yellen I977, Fisher I987), studying the spatial patterns of chimpanzee activities that produce debris, durable or ephemeral, can help archaeologists systemati- cally explore alternatives to the existing behavioral models of early site formation. Isaac's abstract image of chimpanzee ranging patterns has been supported by maps of actual chimpanzee day ranges published from sites such as Gombe (e.g., Goodall I986:2I%2-I5, 2I7-22) that show chimpanzees moving independently and sleeping in different nests every night. These maps trace trajectories that sometimes re- semble a loosely woven fabric of wanderings and some- times converge and spin into single strands along well- travelled paths. Given such gauzelike patterns, it is difficult to imagine opportunities in which chimpanzees could create concentrated patches of debris. But time is missing from these travel maps. They record pathways but not the spatiotemporal relationships of activities or social interactions. As samples of the activities of focal individuals, such maps do not document how frequently different locations are visited by chimpanzees through time or the variable intensity of debris-producing activi- ties across the landscape. In fact, chimpanzees are known to return to localized groves of nesting trees and favorite feeding sites in a range of different habitat types. At Gombe, for example, Goodall (I960:456) noted that "although the place cho- sen [for nesting] depends upon where the apes happen to be feeding at dusk, there are certain 'nesting sites' where the presence of old nests, in varying stages of decay, shows that the tree or group of trees has been used on several occasions." Kasakati Basin chimpanzees repeat- edly used certain sections of riverine forest for nesting, particularly during the rainy season (Izawa and Itani I966, Suzuki I969), and "bed site concentrations" were localized in the arid Ugalla area (Itani I979, Nishida I989). Favorite nesting localities near seasonal resources were also noted in West Africa at Mt. Assirik, Senegal (W. C. McGrew, personal communication), and in Ga- bon, where a small group of chimpanzees was reintro- duced to a restricted wild habitat and researchers (Hladik I973:405, my translation)2 observed a certain conservatism in choice of nest locations corresponding to the regular use of portions of the area in connection with fruiting cycles. Thus the an- imals return day after day to a point near the place where they were in the morning, and one finds rather significant groups of nests concentrated at certain points and sometimes in the same tree. Because of the heterogeneous distribution of food re- sources in their habitats, chimpanzee foraging patterns often involve "the intensive use of isolated patches of fruit" (Ghiglieri I984:76), and seasonal patches of food resources may draw repeated visits of foraging parties (e.g., Wrangham and Smuts I980, Wrangham I986, White and Wrangham I988). In West Africa chimpan- zees at several study sites return habitually to particular groves of trees in their forests, importing stones to use at these "workshops" for cracking nuts or hard fruits and reusing individual stone and wood hammers already there (e.g., Sugiyama and Koman I979; Boesch and Boesch I98I, I984; Kortlandt I986; Kortlandt and Holz- haus I987). Several studies have noted the presence of different types of organic tools, such as leaf wadges and sticks, apparently discarded by chimpanzees at feeding sites (e.g., Yamagiwa et al. I988, Sugiyama I985, Sabater Pi I974, Nishida and Hiraiwa I982). Bermejo, Illera, and Sabater Pi (I989) have plotted the regional distribution of a range of tool types used in one region of Mt. Assirik, including honey sticks, leaf stalks, and stone hammers and anvils. None of these chimpanzee studies, however, has pro- duced systematic geographical samples or maps of these nest and tool distributions at a fine-grained scale that can be usefully compared with the early archaeological record. Whether the cumulative pattern of debris dis- carded by wild chimpanzees is easily distinguishable 2.

I i9I from the pattern of remains left behind by early homi- nids is the question that my field study of wild chimpan- zees in eastern Zaire was designed to answer. Mapping the Physical Residues of Chimpanzee Behavior A small population of chimpanzees lives along the Isha- sha River, which forms part of the national boundary between Zaire and Uganda (0o 37' S, 290 39' E) and sepa- rates two national parks-the Virunga National Park in Zaire and the Rwenzori National Park in Uganda. Our initial census estimates based on nest counts suggest that somewhere between io and 25 chimpanzees inhabit the study area (Steklis et al. n.d.); habituation of the chimpanzees to human observers will be necessary be- fore we can make more precise estimates of the size and structure of this population. The Ishasha is a small, perennial river which drains highlands in eastern Zaire and southwestern Uganda and flows north into Lake Rutanzige (ex-Edward). The Ishasha meanders along its lower course, supporting a multistoried gallery forest; this lush, green ribbon of trees winds through the open grasslands and thickets of the surrounding floodplain and plateau and provides habitats for several primate species in addition to the chimpanzees (Rowell I966). The sharp boundary be- tween the gallery forest and the surrounding grasslands is maintained in part by grazing and browsing pressure from large herbivores, particularly from hippos and ele- phants, and in part by frequent bushfires and controlled burning by park officials (Lock I977, Delvingt I978, Mertens I983, Verschuren I986, Mugangu-Trinto I990). With a mean annual rainfall of 750 mm and an average of seven dry months a year, the Ishasha environment is extremely dry in comparison with other current chim- panzee habitats (cf. Collins and McGrew I988, Steklis et al. n.d.). It is, however, similar in many ways to the semiarid riparian habitats in East Africa where archaeo- logical sites were preserved two million years ago. The Ishasha is a small river with an active alluvial plain in a lowland Rift Valley setting. The semiarid seasonal rainfall regime and lowland equatorial temperatures are comparable to paleoclimatic reconstructions for the early Olduvai and Koobi Fora and probably support simi- lar wooded grassland, bushland, and gallery-forest vege- tation types (e.g., Vincens I982, Bonnefille I984, Kappel- man I984, Cerling and Hay I986, Sept I986). In I989 our team surveyed a series of 35 belt transects along a io-km section of the river on the Zaire side (see Steklis et al. n.d.). Each transect ran east-west, roughly perpendicular to the river's course, cutting from the sa- vanna through the forest to the west bank. These tran- sects were monitored during two seasons, in I989 and I990, to provide preliminary descriptions of the floristic composition and basic canopy structure of the forest. We recognized two major types of semideciduous forest in our survey area: ( I) a "primary" closed-canopy gallery forest along the river banks, dominated by tree species such as Cynometra alexandrii C.h. Wright (Caesalpinia- ceae), Pterygota mildebraedii Engl. (Sterculiaceae), and Chrysophyllum albidum G. Don (Sapotaceae), and (2) a dry, or sclerophylous, "secondary" forest, forming the ecotone between the primary forest and surrounding wooded grasslands and bushland and characterized by small trees of the Ebenaceae family and understory thickets dominated by species from the Capparaceae and Euphorbiaceae. These 35 transects also provided the basic sampling framework for my mapping of the cumulative distribu- tion of physical traces of chimpanzee activities in the forest. Surveys were done in the June-August "dry" sea- sons of i989 and I990. Each transect was surveyed three times: July i989, July I990, and August I990. Because the forest width varied along the river, total transect lengths also varied and sampled the forest types in pro- portion to their occurrence in addition to a standard sample of the savanna. Two transects (23 and 24) sam- pled points along the river with no gallery forest on the west bank. Chimpanzee nests found within 25 m north or south of the transect line were described and mapped, using a hipchain or tapemeasure and compass; thus nest posi- tions were recorded to the nearest meter within a so-m belt for each transect. Other physical traces of chimpan- zee activities, such as fresh feces or fresh feeding resi- dues with toothmarks, were mapped if they were en- countered within 5 m of the transect line-a io-m belt sample. No evidence of chimpanzee tool-use or meat- eating residues was observed. Nests were the type of physical residue created by the Ishasha chimpanzees that we observed most frequently. While we were unable to observe any nest-building be- havior, chimpanzees at other sites are known to con- struct a new nest to sleep in almost every night, and they often build day nests as well. Chimpanzees typi- cally take less than five minutes to weave together branches, sometimes intertwining adjacent trees, to make a sturdy platform which can then be lined with soft leaves and twigs as bedding (e.g., Goodall I960, Izawa and Itani I966). Nests may be relatively durable, but they are artifacts with a built-in obsolescence. In an arid habitat in Tanzania, Kano (I972) estimated that chimpanzee nests lasted six months. Ghiglieri (i 984:32-3 3) monitored nest longevity in the Kibale For- est, Uganda, and found it to vary from i5 to 2o2 days, with an average longevity of iii days (N = 28). Along the Ishasha, nests that were fresh when first observed were monitored to establish their rate of disin- tegration and allow us to estimate the relative ages of older nests on the transects: nests were green when fresh, began to turn brown as the leaves on their broken branches dried, and finally dropped all their leaves, sometimes retaining only dry woven branches to mark their presence. Forty-nine nests that were monitored for their entire duration lasted from 2 to i 6 weeks, with an average of 7.8 ? 3.4 (normal distribution). On average, nests built during the rainy season (April-May I990) dried and fell apart more slowly than nests constructed</page><page sequence="6">I9 2 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 33, Number 2, April I992 during the dry season. As in the Kibale Forest (Ghiglieri I984:5 a), nests constructed in one of the favorite nesting tree species with large, tough leaves, Chrysophyllum albidum, were particularly durable. All the nests built in July I989 had disintegrated by the time we returned to the transects in July I990, pro- viding a renewable set of potential nesting sites for the chimpanzees to choose from. This meant that we could watch nests accumulate in the forest, and the longevity of the nests gave us a reliable indirect means of sampling the frequency of chimpanzee use of their habitats even though we were unable to follow the unhabituated ani- mals. In the following analyses, nests were grouped into relative age categories: new (retaining green leaves on broken branches) and old (leaves completely dry or fall- ing off). On average, nests from the monitored group were classified as "new" for three weeks and "old" for four and a half weeks. Other types of residue, such as feces or feeding debris, were much more ephemeral than nests and so were much less likely to be observed on one of our transect surveys unless we passed through the forest within a day or two after the chimpanzees had been there. While we collected chimpanzee feces when encountered throughout the forest for dietary analyses, only 9 of the 76 fresh fecal samples we collected were encountered on the transects at the times we were formally sampling them. Also, because sympatric species such as baboons (Papio anubis) and red tail monkey (Cercopithecus as- canius) were feeding on many of the same fruits being eaten by the chimpanzees, in most cases it proved im- possible to assign a scatter of feeding residues to chim- panzees in particular, except in a few cases of direct ob- servation or where large incisor marks were diagnostic of chimpanzee feeding, leaf wadges were found, or feed- ing debris was associated with chimpanzee nests or feces (cf. McGrew, Baldwin, and Tutin i988). Therefore cur- rent records of feeding and fecal traces are still unsys- tematic, pending more regular behavioral observations, and are not reported on here. Once the Ishasha chimpanzees have become habitu- ated to the presence of human observers it will be possi- ble to follow them and map their discard behavior much more comprehensively. It will be particularly important to establish how this ranging and discard behavior varies over a seasonal round in relation to the productivity and distribution of resources. However, even the current pre- liminary round of etho-archaeological investigation re- veals some intriguing patterns of chimpanzee nest dis- tribution during the I989 and I990 dry seasons that have important implications for the interpretation of early ar- chaeological sites. The Ishasha River forest has a heterogeneous distribu- tion of resources available to chimpanzees, and this in- fluences the chimpanzees' ranging patterns and distribu- tion of debris. For example, the dominant tree species in the canopy change along the length of the river. At the northern end of our study area the forest is dominated by Cynometra alexandrii, an emergent with a broad crown and tender, compound leaves.

During July I989 chimpan- zees were feeding on the immature fruit of these Cyno- metra, opening the young legume pods and scraping out the immature seeds with their incisors, and many of their nests were also concentrated in this part of the forest. This is reflected in the distribution of nests en- countered in the forest on the different transects (fig. I). During July I989 most of the nests sampled occurred in the northern Cynometra forest, particularly on transects 2 and 6. In I990, although the Cynometra were not fruit- ing, chimpanzees were still frequenting this part of the forest in July, nesting in many of the same trees and feeding on the fruit and leaves of other species. How- ever, they were more often nesting in the central and southern section of the study area, feeding especially on the abundant fruit of the large dominant Pterygota mildebraedii. Despite feeding on Pterygota, chimpan- zees rarely nested in them, perhaps because their high crowns or large, leathery leaves made nest building dif- ficult. Instead, nests were frequently placed in adjacent, smaller trees. Overall (N = ioi), nest height (based on clinometer estimates) averaged I3.5 ? 6.i m, compara- ble to that observed at other chimpanzee study sites in East Africa, but in six Pterygota the nests were higher (average 2I.3 ? 5.3 mi). This differential use of certain sections of the forest for nesting can be seen in figure 2, where each bar repre- sents the density of nests identified on one transect, pro- ducing a cumulative graph of all the samples taken in July I989, July I990, and August I990. For this graph the number of nests per hectare was calculated as an average density along the entire transect length. The dis- tribution is uneven: only io of the 33 forested transects had nest densities above the calculated average of five nests per hectare, and i6 had no nests at all. Overall in the I989 and I990 dry seasons, nests had accumulated at much higher average densities in the northern half of the forest than in the south. What is also striking about this distribution is that at least four or five separate epi- sodes of nest building were recorded on several of the transects (e.g., transects 6, 8, I2, 20), judging by the rela- tive ages of the nests sampled. However, there was con- siderable variability in nest positioning along any one transect, with a general tendency for nests to be con- structed relatively deeper in the forest at points where the forest is broad. Notably, in I989 four nests were built in large, isolated Pterygota trees in the wooded grasslands of the distal floodplain more than ioo m from the forest margin. The number of nests that had accumulated through August I990 in so-m2 (I/4-hectare) segments of the forest transects (fig. 3) shows how localized the nest building tended to be. Over 70% of the I04 sampled quadrats were empty, and 8 5 % of the total contained two or fewer nests (table i), creating a highly skewed distribution of nest frequencies. Seventy-five percent (98/I3I) of the nests were recorded in only io% of the quadrats. Also, while quadrats sampled primary forest and dry forest</page><page sequence="8">I94 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 33, Number 2, April I992 I I U 9-16/QUADRAT 5-8 3-4 ED 1 -'.2 F 0V QUADRATS =50o x 50 meters FiG. 3.

Etho-archaeological Comparisons From an archaeological perspective, the dry-season nest- ing activity patterns of the Ishasha chimpanzees are spatially redundant; the chimpanzees apparently refre- quented some spots in the forest and ignored others. Is the scale of this patchiness comparable to that noted for the early sites? Kroll and Isaac (i984) characterized the Plio/Pleistocene archaeological record as a three-tiered hierarchy of spatial patterning: (i) localized concentra- tions of objects (artifacts and broken bones), forming (.2) a site-sized "cluster of clusters" that would (3) "appear as a concentrated patch in a regional configuration that i ncluided oth er h igh -densi ty patch es, surroun ded by vast TABLE I Cumulative Frequency of Nests by 50-mr2 Quadrat Quadrat Number of Primary Dry Cumulative Nests Forest Forest Total Percentage 0 32 4I 73 70.2 I 3 6 9 78.8 2 5 2 7 85.6 3 I I 2 87.5 4 I O I 88.5 5 I I 2 90.4 6 2 0 2 92.3 7 0 I I 93.3 8 3 0 3 96.2 9 2 0 2 98.I IO -I 0 I 99.0 I7 I 0 I I00.0 I3I 52 52 I04 NOTE: Mean nests per quadrat i.260 + 2.822, s.e. 0.277, variance 7.96i; a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test against a Poisson distribution with the same mean produced a Z score of 4.264 with a two- tailed probability of o.

This characterization also effectively describes the spatial patterning of the physical residues of Ishasha chimpanzee behavior. At a fine-grained scale, a chimpanzee nest or gnawed fruit may be indirectly analogous to the localized concentra- tions of conjoining artifacts or bone fragments that form the "atomic particles" (Isaac I98I) of the archaeological record. While the residues are very different, they reflect short-term episodes of comparable activities-feeding, manipulating objects, sleeping-constrained both by features of local habitat and by socio-ecological context. For example, a plot of one of the high-density northern transects (transect 6), drawn against a measured profile of the forest canopy, maps the cumulative distribution of a sample of nests at a scale comparable to that of many of the early site excavations (fig. 4). This is clearly a clustered pattern of nests, judged visually or by an index of dispersion3 (Hodder and Orton I976). On paper the Ishasha chimpanzees have created both scatters and patches of ephemeral debris along the length of the for- est, and their densest patches of debris are comparable in size to the earliest archaeological sites. Kroll and Isaac (I984:I3) caution that archaeological patterns could have formed as "the cumulative prod- ucts of behavioral events that were spaced through time"-time-averaged aggregates. Best estimates of the 3. Clustered distributions yield an index of dispersion, (v/m) x (N - r), greater than I (Hodder and Orton I976). The 25-mr2 quadrats yielded an index of dispersion of 62.55 (d.f. I5) and the 5so-m2 quad- rats an index of 40.4 (d.f. 4), which is probably significant compared to the chi-square of i2.5 (d.f. s) (o.o0g signif.), although this is too small a sample with cell frequencies too low for a reliable chi- square statistic.</page><page sequence="9">SEPT Was There No Place Like Home?

The distributions of chimpanzee de- bris along the Ishasha certainly accumulated as time- averaged aggregates, but only in a dry-season context. For the next round of research it will be critical to inves- tigate what happens to the apparent patchiness of chim- panzee nesting behavior when records are kept for an entire annual cycle and for several years. Chimpanzee use of the Ishasha habitat may vary so much in different seasons that the overall nesting pattern ultimately may appear more uniform, or, alternatively, the pattern may become more redundant and the "concentrations" of de- bris even larger. Unfortunately, archaeologists have been unable to identify the seasons during which the Plio/Pleistocene sites formed, although a seasonal bias to the archaeological record would significantly skew our models of early hominid subsistence behavior (Speth I987, Gutin i988). If the chimpanzees had left durable residues of their manipulative activities wherever they constructed a nest, for example, sites could have been buried and pre- served by the overbank sediments of the Ishasha River. Such "sites" would not have formed as a result of home-base behavior or other communal activity pat- terns; they would have formed because something about the local forest structure and composition-perhaps fruit density or canopy height-favored frequent reuse of the locality for chimpanzee nesting or feeding and debris accumulated there through time. Therefore this research supports arguments that early archaeological sites could have formed as by-products of a system of subsistence and ranging very different from a home-base or central-place foraging system.</page><page sequence="10">I96 | CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 33, Number 2, April 1992 This is not to say that early hominids had chimpan- zee-like ranging or subsistence behavior. One should not use chimpanzees as simple analogs or "referential mod- els" (Tooby and DeVore I987, Potts i987) for early hom- inid behavior (see, e.g., Tanner I987; Susman I987; McGrew I98I, i99ia) any more than one should study living hunter-gatherers as mere vestiges of prehistoric times (Headland and Reid I989, Bettinger i99i). If noth- ing else, early hominid transport of stone artifacts and large mammal foods was distinct from any patterns of tool use or meat eating known for living chimpanzees. But chimpanzee ethology can provide a context "within which to investigate organizational relationships among sets of variables relevant to the formulation of models for prehistoric situations" (Hutterer i989:57). If we can- not escape "the tyranny of the ethnographic record" (Wobst I978), we can at least expand its frame of vision in trying to develop alternative behavioral models for the formation of early archaeological sites. The research on chimpanzee behavior reported here demonstrates that there is more than one way to create a patch of debris; archaeologists are challenged to refute the hy- pothesis that early sites accumulated at favored locales through independent episodes of individualistic feeding and nesting behavior. I hope, however, that this research can also contribute to the development of more appropriate archaeological sampling strategies for the Plio/Pleistocene exposures in East Africa. Beginning with the "scatters-between-the- patches" research of Isaac and Harris (i980) at Koobi Fora, Plio/Pleistocene researchers have adopted a re- gional "landscape-archaeology" approach (e.g., Isaac I980, I98I; Potts I989, I990; Blumenschine I989; Stern I99I) that examines the evidence for activity patterns preserved at excavated sites in their regional paleoeco- logical context with a view to reconstructing the "land- use" or ranging behavior of early tool-making hominids (cf. Sept i992). Unfortunately, all the excavations of primary-context archaeological sites at Koobi Fora would fit into just one of the smaller transects through the Ishasha forest, and the area of landscape archaeology sampled can be measured in meter-squares, not hec- tares. Obviously, the sedimentary exposures limit the type of sample possible, but the relatively small-scale sampling strategies of these "landscape" programs may be incapable of detecting the patchiness in chimpanzee habitat use. Similarly, current reconstructions of the paleoenvironmental contexts of early archaeological sites are coarse-grained and typological. If we want to understand why early sites formed where they did, we will need to attempt paleoenvironmental reconstruc- tions that are more sensitive to the attributes of the habitat that would have directly influenced hominid be- havior (Sept I986, i992). Conclusions Most of the Ishasha chimpanzee nests identified were built in just a few spots in the forest, and these com- pound nesting sites were most frequently located in the closed-canopy primary forest. This raises many socio- ecological questions about the causes of such patterning: i. To what extent have the resource distribution and the canopy structure of the forest influenced ranging and nesting patterns? 2. What is the effect of inter- and intraspecific compe- tition for food resources on these patterns? 3. What are the effects on them of territoriality, group size, and population density? 4. How does predation risk influence the choice of nesting localities? 5. Do learned traditions of habitat use and "mental maps" of resource availability lead to any of the appar- ent spatial patterning in nesting behavior? At the moment these questions cannot be answered because of the limited sample of direct behavioral obser- vations and the preliminary nature of ecological studies of the Ishasha forest (Steklis et al. n.d.), but they point to directions for future socio-ecological research. Continuing research along the Ishasha will allow us to compare the resource structure of the habitat with the chimpanzees' use of it. I suspect that the particular resource configurations of a semiarid riverine forest hab- itat contribute to the apparent redundancy in the Isha- sha chimpanzees' nesting behavior. It would be fasci- nating to conduct similar etho-archaeological studies in different types of chimpanzee habitats to test this hy- pothesis and document the variability in chimpanzee debris patterns. Such studies could provide an important new data set for the development of models of site for- mation processes in comparable paleohabitats. Eventual habituation of the Ishasha chimpanzees will allow fine-scale mapping of the residues of their feeding and any tool-use or other manipulative behaviors as they oc- cur. By studying the dynamics of the activity processes that lead to the cumulative patterns of ephemeral resi- dues, these etho-archaeological studies should contrib- ute to the middle-range theory of early archaeological site formation. In the interim, these preliminary data emphasize the importance of carefully considering behavioral alterna- tives to the home-base interpretation of early archaeo- logical sites. While early hominid stone-tool makers clearly had more archaeological visibility than modern chimpanzees, it remains to be seen whether they used their ancient habitats in ways that could be easily distin- guished from the ranging behaviors of modern apes. There may indeed have been no place like "home" dur- ing the Plio/Pleistocene. Comments BARBARA J. KING Department of Anthropology, College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Va. 23I85, U.S.A. i6 x 9I My reaction to Sept's paper can be summarized easily- the logic and conceptual framework are compelling but</page><page sequence="11">SEPT Was There No Place Like Home? I97 the data are not. The "etho-archaeological" approach that Sept discusses has enormous potential nonetheless. It is exciting to read of a primatological project designed specifically to test hypotheses about hominid behavior; few primatologists have done this (although in the I960s fieldwork on nonhuman primates used savanna baboons to model early hominid behavior and since then many primatologists have speculated about various aspects of hominization using monkeys and apes as a basis for comparison). Methodologically, Sept is on solid ground. In fact, her article is brimming with interesting ideas that could be turned into testable predictions; as such it is a gold mine for graduate students contemplating field projects to complement the one described. Yet the fact that the article reads, in places, like a fundable grant proposal is not entirely a good thing. When one gets down to it, in fact, only the uneven distri- bution of chimpanzee nests in the area sampled by Sept over two dry seasons supports the article's central con- tention. The Ishasha chimpanzees are not yet habitu- ated, so no bouts of tool-using or meat-eating behavior were observed, and neither feeding nor fecal debris could be unambiguously assigned to chimpanzees. Sept herself admits that in general her data are preliminary and in particular use of the habitat by chimpanzees "may vary so much in different seasons that the overall nesting pattern ultimately may appear more uniform." At this stage, then, Sept's solid framework rests on very little in the way of hard evidence. I am surprised that her results are offered in a major article rather than, at this point, in a research report or note. These comments aside, when behavior of the chim- panzees can be taken into account the questions posed by Sept in her concluding section can be pursued. The factors she mentions, including resource distribution, inter- and intraspecific competition, population density, predation, and learned tradition, probably all do contrib- ute to the spatial pattern observed (if in fact this pattern is upheld by further study). She might look into whether the chimpanzees abandon nests at intervals that corre- late with increased risk of parasite infestation from ac- cumulated feces near the nests, as Hausfater and Meade (i982) suggest for savanna baboons. Further, Goodall (i990) observes that chimpanzees appear able to recog- nize abandoned nests as evidence for use of an area by conspecifics. At first this may not sound impressive, but in fact it differs markedly from the behavior of monkeys, which routinely ignore tangible evidence of the presence of conspecifics or predators (Cheney and Seyfarth I990 and personal observation). Does this cognitive ability of chimpanzees, undoubtedly a learned response, affect ranging patterns too? Despite my belief that a search for continuities and quantitative rather than qualitative differences between apes and hominids or humans (Gibson I99I, King i99i) is the most fruitful approach, I predict that it will be possible, eventually, to show that early hominids used their habitats differently from chimpanzees. Foley (I 987) rightly emphasizes that use by early hominids of large- package foods such as carcasses (whether acquired through scavenging or hunting and whether accompa- nied by real food sharing or not) implies some sort of change in social behavior, since carcasses probably be- came the focus of intense social activity. It makes good sense to turn such speculations into testable predic- tions, however, and Sept should continue to do so. W. C. MCGREW Scottish Primate Research Group, Department of Psychology, University of Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland. 24 X 9I Genuine interdisciplinary collaboration between prima- tology, especially of the African apes, and palaeoanthro- pology, especially in archaeology and ecology, is long overdue. There has been much talk but little action, and most of both has come from primatologists speculating rather than from palaeoanthropologists taking nonhu- man primates seriously (McGrew iggib). Sept provides an exemplary piece of trail-blazing (literally) research in that she extends actualistic ethno-archaeology to apes. However, even she sometimes falls into well-worn traps. Generalizing about other primates is always tricky, and the claim that humans are unique in spa- tially focussing their social and economic activities does not hold up. Hamadryas baboons habitually use their cliff-face sleeping sites not just for sleeping but also for grooming, basking, etc. Pygmy marmoset families may concentrate their subsistence (and territorial defense) on a single exudate-producing tree. Similarly, to go on di- chotomizing hominids versus carnivores as if (e.g.) they were the only two potential agents for modified bones omits a third alternative, the Pongidae (great apes). Until archaeologists make the effort to analyse the bone frag- ments left after a chimpanzee kill and meat-eating epi- sode, they will never be in a position to compare these with what turns up in the archaeological record. Sept is astute in pointing out that when lithic raw materials are found to have been transported up to IO km from their source this need not have been a single, goal-directed journey. As Boesch and Boesch (i984) have shown, chimpanzees daily carry stones for short dis- tances in their nut-cracking activities. Over decades, or centuries, or millennia, concentrations of such stones may have built up accordingly. This is a topic ripe for computer modelling, and specification of which "by- products of other behaviors" is needed to pursue this. Sept is right to point out that focussing of chimpanzee life in both space and time must be studied, preferably in unprovisioned populations in open habitats. This has been attempted at Mt. Assirik, in Senegal (Baldwin, McGrew, and Tutin I982, Tutin, McGrew, and Baldwin i983). Studies on manipulated populations must be taken with care: Hladik's (I973) chimpanzees were re- leased and artificially provisioned on a small island, so it is not surprising that they repeatedly reused resources. That chimpanzees must be studied year-round, espe- cially in highly seasonal environments, is a key point of Sept's. Baldwin, McGrew, and Tutin (I98i) showed many differences between dry and wet seasons in chim- panzees' nest-building. For example, rainy-season nests</page><page sequence="12">I98 | CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 33, Number 2, April 1992 were built higher than dry-season ones, though at all times of year Mt. Assirik's nests were lower than those so far reported for Ishasha. Similarly important may be interannual variation; Sept combines data from two years to produce overall results (e.g., on nest heights), but such pooling of data requires prior demonstration of homogeneity. Having produced a pioneering piece of work using the chimpanzee as an alternative analogue, Sept then rejects such "referential models," following Tooby and DeVore (i987). Putting aside the vexing issue of whether or not referential models can ever be disentangled from concep- tual ones or vice versa (see Stanford and Allen [I99I] for a pithy discussion), this seems unnecessarily harsh. Referential models have their drawbacks (no species is another species), but they have one big advantage: Liv- ing organisms can provide us with both behaviour and artefacts, while concepts supply neither. JIM MOORE Anthropology Department oioi, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, Calif. 92093, U.S.A. 2I X 9I The idea behind middle-range studies is to look closely at modern processes for clues to the past; those clues may stimulate ideas, challenge (often implicit) assump- tions, suggest analogies, reveal (testable) homologies, and formally test existing hypotheses. Sept's approach scores on most counts; I found her paper tremendously stimulating in its approach to basic questions about our old hominid homes. She clearly states the problem: "the spatial focus of many human social and economic activi- ties is unique among the primates," and we would like to know when and how the behavior originated. There is, however, a danger in this phrasing; the reader might easily miss the significance of "primate" and infer that the search for home's origin is an aspect of the search for what divides human from nonhuman (see, e.g., Isaac's [I978a] interchangeable use of "ape" and "nonhuman" in his presentation of the home-base hypothesis and Cartmill [I990] on the dangers of such a search). We should keep firmly in mind that carnivore dens also can be spatial foci for social and "economic" (food sharing) activities (e.g., Fentress and Ryon I982, Malcolm and Marten I982, Mills i989). Substituting stones for teeth, such carnivore activities may be archaeologically (and perhaps behaviorally) indistinguishable from the sorts of behaviors implied by putative early hominid home bases. That chimpanzees have preferred nesting areas is not surprising; many primates do. During a study of Guinea baboon sleeping-site behavior, a single kapok tree was occupied by members of the study troop for 92 of I33 nights (Anderson and McGrew I984; see references therein for discussion of sleeping-site fidelity among monkeys). If this were as far as it went, the paper would be no more than a redundant "cautionary tale for inter- preting early archaeological sites." However, it goes well beyond this. Regularities in nest/den-site preference among animals are common, but in general one expects them to be explicable by very immediate ecological fac- tors. (For example, Anderson and McGrew's tree was of a species preferred by baboons for its physiognomy, and the individual was especially large.) It is trivial to note that chimpanzees at Ishasha prefer nesting in riparian forest (they haven't much alternative), but it is quite surprising to see a finer-grained pattern that has no obvi- ous functional ecological explanation. For me this resonates with reports of potential regular- ities in the orientation of chimpanzee nests on slopes (Groves and Sabater Pi i985) and my own as-yet unquan- tified impression that chimpanzees in Ugalla nest on hillsides substantially more frequently than would be expected if nest sites were randomly distributed across apparently suitable habitat. I expect that ecological ex- planations for these fine-grained patterns will be found, but they do not seem likely to be based on food distribu- tion or substrate suitability. If analogous fine-grained patterns can be documented among modern bone accu- mulators (e.g., lion kills within riparian woodland [cf. Blumenschine I987]) and in the archaeological record, comparing patterns promises to be more enlightening than detailed taphonomic analyses of single sites have been to date. The landscape-archaeological approach that Sept advocates involves a lot of digging but is worth it. Three technical points need to be mentioned: First, in comparing Ishasha with other sites, Sept refers to "seven dry months a year" without defining a "dry" month. Second, an annual mean rainfall of about I,81O mm for Gombe is the best 20-year (i968-87) figure available for the site, but it includes a period of very high reported rainfall (I976-82, mean ca. 2,500 mm) bracketed by drier years (mean ca. I,430 mm) and there is a possibility that part of the higher figure is artifactual (Moore n.d.). Third, the statistical analysis in table i seems premised on nests' being built independently of each other, which is problematic; nest surveys have great difficulty distin- guishing, for example, an individual returning nightly to a quadrat for a week from a party of seven stopping for one night. Table i demonstrates that chimpanzees nest in groups and/or reuse quadrats, the two being difficult to disentangle. Since the I7 nests in the second quadrat of figure 5 come from at least four nesting episodes it is clear that reuse is occurring, but quadrat use may not be significantly skewed in the current sample. Finally, I take issue with Sept's caution against "refer- ential models," which stems from Tooby and DeVore's (i987) extended critique. Tooby and DeVore consider "conceptual" models, based on theoretical principles, superior to "referential" models, based on analogy with single species such as chimpanzees. They go on to con- clude, for (just one) example, that scavenging without hunting "is not a realistic mode of existence," noting that "hunting only opposes the hunter to game animals, which are intrinsically far less dangerous than preda- tors" encountered when scavenging (P. 22I). They should try conceptualizing a sated leopard fighting for</page><page sequence="13">SEPT Was There No Place Like Home? I I99 its leftovers and a healthy warthog fighting for its life; on the basis of my own chance field encounters, I have no doubt which I'd prefer as a source of food. Nothing is gained by labelling a model "conceptual" or "referen- tial." Models are good, bad, or (most often) a bit of each; the distinction that Tooby and DeVore draw is artificial and misleading (Stanford and Allen i99i). Models and approaches should be evaluated on the basis of what ver- ifiable insights they yield and what testable hypotheses they generate; Sept's "etho-archaeology" promises to be very successful at both.' JAMES D. PATERSON Department of Anthropology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alta., Canada T2N iN4. 28 x 9I While the acceptance of ethologically derived informa- tion in the world of archaeologists is overdue and Sept's data are certainly relevant, there remains an overtone of anthropomorphic uniqueness in most such activities. I have two major comments and a few minor ones. The definition of "home" still requires work. Sept's "spatial focus for many social and economic activities" may serve to separate Pan from Homo, but there are some circumstances under which it would fail to do so for Homo and Papio. As an example I offer the two troops of baboons which resided on the southern side of the Kazinga Channel in Ruwenzori National Park in I970-7I. They had only two groves of Acacia sieberi- ana-one of four trees, the other of seven-available for their use, and thus these two clusters served as "homes" for the two troops. Each grove was the center of a sub- stantial portion of the troop members' social activities, both morning and evening, and during the flowering and fruiting seasons was also economically important. Both groves had very substantial debris and fecal deposition patterns. Since many cercopithecine populations dem- onstrate this form of "homelike" use pattern, perhaps this is one situation in which comparisons between hu- mans and monkeys might be of greater utility than in- terhominoid comparisons. In any area which has been occupied by a primate species for a long time, there will be not only an etholog- ical link between activities and debris pattern but an ecological link between the tree species and the pri- mates. The primates themselves are important agents in the dissemination of seeds-deposited in feces-and thus are partly responsible for the pattern of the plant community. It is a feedback cycle, not a one-way link, and the ecological interaction patterns are at least as important as the ethological for the provision of alterna- tive insights. Unconscious examples of these relation- ships in modern Homo can be seen in the proclivity for creating small savanna grasslands around "homes" in forested areas and the generation of small forests around homes in grassland savannas. These are practices which may reflect a preference for ecotonal conditions in hom- inids. Among the minor items: Cynometra as a favoured nesting tree might be a seasonal phenomenon, since, in the Budongo Forest, where this species is the climax, that part of the forest is only used by chimpanzees dur- ing the Cynometra fruiting season. The difference be- tween Cynometra and Pterygota as employed for nesting is a focus of attention, and a reference is made to the height of the latter, but the former is, at least in Bu- dongo, equally as tall. Perhaps the difference relates more to the leaf structure and the relative comfort of nests constructed in the two species than to the height above ground? Since there was an evident bias on the part of the chimpanzees towards the northern study re- gion, was this in any way correlated with distance from the Ishasha Ranger Station on the Uganda side of the river? In relation to the potential predator problems, I would like to have known whether these chimpanzees were acting in their normal ebullient, noisy fashion or were quieter or more secretive. This would be reflective of the realities of the predator-prey relationships as well as the possibilities of superabundant resources. Overall, I applaud the application of ethological per- spectives to hominid evolutionary and archaeological problems. This paper is definitely a worthwhile exercise, and I support Sept's statement that "there is more than one way to create a patch of debris." However, the "home" issue remains unresolved, in my view; there may indeed have been places like "home" during the Pleistocene, but they may not have been used by homi- noids. KAREN B. STRIER Department of Anthropology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wis. 53706, U.S.A. 23 X 9I The attribution of home-base activity to Plio/Pleisto- cene hominids from the archaeological record depends on two implicit assumptions: (i) that hominids were responsible for stone and bone assemblages and (2) that early-hominid sites reflect behaviors, such as food shar- ing, that differ fundamentally from those observed in other primates. Sept's analysis of chimpanzee nest con- centrations explicitly decouples these assumptions and raises provocative questions about what characterizes a home base. Sept concludes that Plio/Pleistocene hominid sites may have been formed by the same activities that lead other primates to differential use of their habitats. Thus she supports the first assumption insofar as it is plausi- ble that hominids rather than taphonomic or other forces created these sites; but confirming this assump- tion does not imply the second-that hominids engaged in any extraordinary social activities. Extant primates feed and sleep in areas of dense food resources, and hamadryas baboons retire to communal i.

These behavioral patterns are usually interpreted in terms of foraging economics and predator avoidance, respectively. Large fruiting trees or protected sleeping areas may be regarded as temporary or permanent "central places" that define the foraging radius of these primates. Without convincing data that hominid sites were not also established around impor- tant food resources, the most parsimonious explanation is that they were. Sept argues that the only way to evalu- ate whether hominid sites were any different from those of other primates will be to analyze the paleoecological contexts in which they occurred. While it is highly appropriate to consider the effects of ecological variables on ranging behavior, the social opportunities available when primates aggregate for eco- logical purposes should not be underestimated. Unfortu- nately, the preliminary nature of Sept's data precludes exploring the social implications of chimpanzee nest sites and, by inference, hominid sites. Ishasha chimpan- zee nesting sites may reflect a variety of socio-ecological patterns, including large temporary aggregations in re- sponse to the proximity of rich food resources, repeated use of an area by the same individuals, coordinating their foraging activities, or sequential use of the same area by different, autonomously foraging individuals. These patterns need not be mutually exclusive over time, but distinguishing between them has important implications for what chimpanzee and hominid sites represent. Similarly, it is critical to know what chimpanzees do at these sites, apart from evident resting and feeding. Do they opportunistically establish or reestablish social relationships when they are "camped-out" at concen- trated food resources, or are social factors themselves at least partially responsible for the aggregations? Finer- grained comparative behavioral analyses are as impor- tant as ecological analyses to elucidating the behavioral significance of chimpanzee and hominid sites, and they should not be neglected. Sept emphasizes the small number of hominid sites represented in the archaeological record. Assuming that Plio/Pleistocene hominids exhibited as much intraspe- cific behavioral variation as most modern species inhab- iting ecologically different habitats, it is correct to be cautious in extrapolating from a handful of sites to any species more generally. Nevertheless, the archaeological record indicates that at least some of these hominids had undergone a major shift to include predation on large vertebrates and tool use. Whether this shift was accom- panied by a corresponding shift in social behavior, such as food sharing, is still not resolved. Comparative ap- proaches such as that adopted by Sept challenge archae- ologists to identify components of hominid sites that provide more precise evidence of social activities than mere aggregations or debris concentrations. If chimpan- zee nest sites are, in fact, no different from hominid sites, we must either call them home bases or redefine home bases in a way that encompasses what are believed to be uniquely hominid activities. SHIGEO UEHARA Faculty of General Education, Sapporo University, 3-7-3-I Nishioka, Toyohira-ku, Sapporo, 062 Japan. 28 x 9I This paper clearly demonstrates that chimpanzee nests in the Ishasha River area are concentrated in just a few spots in the forest, which indicates that such debris con- centration does not necessarily mean the existence of "home." However, the evidence for this tentative con- clusion is extracted only from chimpanzee nesting pat- terns. From a chimpologist's point of view, the most striking aspect of the debris concentrations in many Plio/Pleistocene archaeological sites is the mixture of various artifacts used for different purposes and their possible materials and animal remains such as crushed bone fragments. Wild chimpanzees occasionally carry some types of tools up to some 500 m (e.g., Uehara i982, Boesch and Boesch I984) to a place where they use them for feeding on particular food items, but they never carry tools to a place where they stock them for reuse or to a place where they make tools from them. Moreover, they never transport food items to a place where they con- sume them with the aid of tools. Thus debris concentra- tion produced by chimpanzee tool use seems to provide more intriguing data for etho-archaeological compari- son. With the current information, it is too soon to draw a negative conclusion about the traditional interpreta- tion of early sites. ANDREW WHITEN Scottish Primate Research Group, Department of Psychology, University of St. Andrews, St. Andrews, Fife KYi6 9JU, Scotland. 4 XI 9I Sept is surely right to underline Isaac's (I986) stricture that interpretation of early archaeological sites all too easily becomes a mirror for images of some present-day human behaviour patterns. Seeking a broader ethologi- cal framework offers hope of correcting this, and Sept breaks new ground with a demonstration of how such research must proceed. I would urge her, however, to take a wider perspective yet. Having professed the value of a broad framework, she focusses not only her research project (which is rea- sonable) but also virtually all her discussion and cita- tions on one non-human primate-the common chim- panzee. I suggest that the next most important group to bring into the framework is the savannah baboon, Papio spp. The behaviour of African apes has long been impor- tant in reconstructing hominid evolution because of the close phylogenetic relationship between them and us. Baboons have figured importantly for the different rea- son that they exploit the savannah habitat which early hominids preferred in the niche separation which left the other African great apes in more forested habitats. Of course, as Sept emphasises for chimpanzees, modern primates, including baboons, should not be thought of</page><page sequence="15">SEPT Was There No Place Like Home? j 2oi as simple analogs for hominid behaviour. The behavioral ecology of early hominids must be envisaged rather as approximating to that of an animal with something like the behavioural and mental tendencies of a chimpanzee interacting with the ecological constraints we see op- erating for baboons. The importance of this is that, as soon as we focus on the latter, we see very clearly the sort of non-random use of terrain which Sept has so painstakingly docu- mented for forest chimpanzees. My students and I have studied baboons at the west, south, and east of savannah baboons' range (Sharman I98I, Whiten, Byrne, and Henzi I987, Barton et al. n.d.), and at each site baboons have been found to utilise repeatedly just a handful of specific sleeping sites. This appears to be a common pat- tern for baboons, and the reason seems fairly obvious: refuges providing protection from predators-some- times tall trees such as fever trees, sometimes inaccessi- ble cliffs and kopjes-are generally in short supply in savannah woodland. Thus whatever the tendency of chimpanzees (or the common chimpanzee-human an- cestor) to accumulate debris, this is likely to have been intensified automatically by a shift into drier, savannah habitat. The pattern of baboon foraging is very different from Isaac's picture for chimpanzees. Members of the group typically forage together (sometimes with temporary fission into smaller parties followed by fusion, usually later the same day) and repeatedly return to the same sleeping site before moving to another for one or a series of nights. This could reasonably be called central-place foraging, the central place shifting at longish intervals relative to repeated nightly returns to the same base-a pattern observed in hunter-gatherers such as San (Lee I979). However, baboons leave only faeces and a few perishable food remains at such sites. Chimpanzees con- strained in the same way would leave only nests in addi- tion, as is indicated by Sept's study. Although baboons and chimpanzees are predatory, kills are consumed near the site of capture. Carnivory debris does not accumu- late at baboons' bases preferentially. Thus, it would ap- pear that Sept has a long way to go to demonstrate the relevance of the sleep-site-based debris accumulation of chimpanzees (or baboons) to the archaeology of early hominid sites, which by contrast involve large mammal carcasses and stone tools. At present there is nothing to suggest that a shift towards greater carnivory, larger prey, or butchery would lead primates like these to accu- mulate additional debris (meat, tools) alongside that ex- isting at sleeping-site "bases" (nests, faeces). What is required is primate behavior which suggests some continuity with the hominid patterns. One possi- bility would be a tendency, with greater frequencies of carnivory in a predator-rich savannah environment, to retire repeatedly to scarce refuges to consume prey. However, at the two sites where we have studied ba- boons in habitats frequented by leopard and lion, prey (hares or small antelopes) is typically consumed on the ground. It would be interesting to know if arboreal con- sumption occurs at sites with very high predator risk. Carnivory is mostly terrestrial for chimpanzees also, ac- cording to Teleki (1 98 I), although here there is less pred- ator risk. Another possible basis for continuity would be scav- enging on large mammal kills, given that increasing evi- dence points to this as the precursor of hunting in homi- nid evolution (Blumenschine I99I). Given a clumping of both kills and refuge trees near limited water sources, debris piles could naturally accumulate. But, once again, the discontinuity is more striking than the continuity. Although baboons will scavenge, it appears to be rare and limited to small prey, large-mammal kills (e.g., by lions) being actively avoided when encountered (Strum I98I, Whiten and Blumenschine I99I). Chimpanzees likewise seem to avoid scavenging (Teleki I98I). Things might have been different for a chimpanzee-like primate already proficient with sticks and tools to wield against predators and extract nutrients (e.g., marrow [Blu- menschine 1991]) abandoned by large carnivores, but that is speculation. The evidence as it stands is of marked discontinuity. Although this may help us little in reconstructing the actual continuity which must have occurred in hominid evolution, it does suggest that any transition to large-mammal scavenging, let alone hunt- ing, would be a drastic, perhaps desperate, tactic for a chimpanzee-like creature in baboon-like ecological cir- cumstances. But perhaps that implication is really the key to what happened under the ecological pressures of the Pliocene. RICHARD W. WRANGHAM Department of Anthropology, Peabody Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. 02I38, U.S.A. 2I X 9I Analysis of the degree and causes of nest clumping will be a valuable contribution to chimpanzee behavioral ecology, which has paid little attention to factors affect- ing choice of sleeping sites. Because the average party can be expected to include five or six nest-building chimpanzees, more evidence of the timing of indepen- dent nesting events is needed to show that nest clump- ing is a real phenomenon. However, it seems likely enough in a habitat with limited patches of suitable sleeping trees. Establishing the constraints on chimpan- zee choices of nest locations may therefore suggest com- parable influences on hominid sleeping sites. Before any strong conclusions can be drawn, however, it will of course be necessary to develop a model of the hominid bed. Can much be done without this step? Sept leaves hanging the issue of exactly how the home-base model would be challenged by the discovery of nest clumps analogous to Plio/Pleistocene hominid debris sites. Nest clumping would indicate, she says, that debris patches can arise by "independent episodes of individualistic feeding and nesting behavior." This is in contrast to the home-base or central-place foraging</page><page sequence="16">2021 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 33, Number 2, April I992 model. But what is the contrast? The idea that hominid archaeological sites could have arisen through repeated returns to sleep in a limited area seems close to the concept of a home base or central place for foraging. Is Sept suggesting that hominid debris sites could have arisen solely from their merits as sleeping sites, without regard to foraging issues? It may be worth developing the hypothesis that tree-nesting hominoids develop central foraging places that optimize sleeping and foraging bene- fits, i.e., with foraging benefits not necessarily max- imized. Would this challenge the home-base model? (In theory, nests of different individuals could accumulate in the same patch, so that no one chimpanzee would regard the patch as a home. But the fact that habituated chimpanzees in other areas are known to focus their range use on individual core areas suggests that if nests do prove to clump over time, individuals are tending to return there.) I'm doubtful that other hominid-like examples of chimpanzee activity have much to offer "etho- archaeology." Tools and meat eating are the obvious possibilities. The distribution of termite stem-tools seems unhelpful because it undoubtedly closely reflects the distribution of worked mounds. At least in the chim- panzee sifes where I have worked (Gombe National Park, Tanzania, and Kibale Forest Reserve, Uganda), any tendency for chimpanzee meat eating or bone dropping to recur in particular places is vanishingly small (per- sonal observation). Two technical points: First, Sept assumes that each nest represents a single use. This is a fair conclusion from the published literature, but there have been few opportunities for those working in dry habitats to evalu- ate the frequency of nest reuse. My own experience shows that reuse of nests can be common. In Gombe I observed I 3 8 night nests being made by focal adult male chimpanzees (Wrangham I975). During wet-season months, when fresh leaf was abundant, all nests were built in virgin sites, but during the dry season 26 out of 84 nests (30.9%) were existing (green) nests to which the chimpanzees added fresh material. The interval for reuse of a nest may be as short as i2 hours (a male once re- turned to sleep in the nest he had left that morning) but is typically several days. In support of the idea that trees with fresh leaves are scarce in the dry season, an evergreen species (oil palm [Elaeis guineensis]) was selected as a nesting site fre- quently in the dry season (35.7% of 84 nests) but rarely in the wet season (3.7% of 54 nests). Low availability of good nest trees was also indicated when flushing of new leaf led to the temporarily very frequent selection of cer- tain species, e.g., Combretum molle, as nest trees. By contrast to Gombe, Kibale Forest is less seasonal and has higher tree diversity, and reuse of nests is much less common. I have seen so-ioo nests being built in Kibale and have yet to see one reused. These examples suggest that long dry seasons and low tree species diversity would each contribute to a high frequency of nest reuse. Since the Ishasha area shows both characteristics, we can expect that with further data Ishasha chimpanzees may prove to nest more patchily than appears from Sept's study. Second, as a minor quibble I would suggest that when chimpanzees ate Pterygota mildebraedii they were eating the seeds and/or seed-wings. While it is botani- cally accurate to say, as Sept does, that they were eating the fruit, it is ecologically significant that chimpanzees are seed predators on this species (as on Cynometra alex- andrii). A precise account of feeding behavior is impor- tant from the perspective of etho-archaeology also. True fruit-eating yields seed remains: seed predation does not. Reply JEANNE M. SEPT Bloomington, Ind., U.S.A. 25 xi 9I I thank the commentators for their balanced, thoughtful assessments of my article. Overall I am encouraged to see that my attempt to broaden the ethological perspec- tive from which early archaeological sites have tradi- tionally been interpreted is welcomed by biological an- thropologists, and I appreciate the very useful technical comments. This reply is focused on and organized by general themes common to a number of comments. The data considered. Several commentators (King, Moore, Strier, Uehara, Wrangham) highlight the prelimi- nary nature of the data discussed. Without question a richer and more informative behavioral record of use to archaeologists could be compiled if the animals were already habituated, and I think that observations of ha- bituated animals in this unique savanna habitat could make an important contribution to chimpanzee behav- ioral ecology. Unfortunately, habituation will probably take several more years. Meanwhile my Zairois col- leagues have continued to sample the transects at sea- sonal intervals during I990-9I, and these longer-term records should be available soon. It is worth emphasizing that in addition to recording nests, the study was designed to document the location and content of indirect evidence of chimpanzee activity when encountered, including feces, food remains, leaf wadges, etc. For example, in most cases when groups of fresh nests were encountered they were adjacent to or surrounded by fresh feeding remains such as partially gnawed fruits. On two occasions the remains of gnawed fruits were found in the nests themselves (midnight snacks?!), having been transported there from trees at least 50 m away. Statistical analysis of the distribution of these residues was not included here because the sam- ple of remains clearly attributable to chimpanzees was too small. My response to King and others who feel that the publication of the nest data alone is premature would be that, rather than producing new insights into the behavior of an isolated population of chimpanzees,</page><page sequence="17">SEPT Was There No Place Like Home? 1203 my goals were to open an interdisciplinary dialogue on what I perceive as an epistemological weakness in ar- chaeological argument and to take a first empirical step towards addressing the methods and theory relevant to this problem. I agree that details of chimpanzee feeding or manipula- tive behaviors defined by socio-ecological context need to be explicitly linked to debris patterns. Studying the chimpanzee behavioral processes that produce different residual patterns will be a critical step before such data can be compared effectively with the results of tradi- tional ethnoarchaeological studies or significantly shape inferences about the behavioral processes that led to the formation of the prehistoric patterns we recognize as sites. On this point Moore, Strier, and Wrangham raise the interesting issue that without direct observations of nest building a grouping of nests could be attributed to the activities of either one or several individuals at dif- ferent points in time. From the relative ages of the nests observed at Ishasha I could point to different nest clus- ters that probably formed through group nesting epi- sodes and through repeated but socially independent vis- its to sites by single individuals or small groups. Two or three of the nests we recorded did look as if a fresh bed had been built on an earlier nest platform, so this type of behavior also probably occurs at Ishasha, as Wrangham usefully suggests, but I suspect at low frequencies. As habituation proceeds it will be interesting to discover if there are any attributes of the spatial arrangement or relative positioning of the nests which might correlate with the social context of nest construction. Such in- sights, linking behaviors to physical correlates which might be preserved in aspects of the archaeological rec- ord, will help archaeologists to refine their tests of alter- native hypotheses for the behavioral processes that con- tributed to early archaeological site formation and might also move us closer to Wrangham's proposed hominid- bed model. Similarly McGrew can be assured that if any Ishasha chimpanzee is observed feeding on animal remains, I will try to be there with a tape measure and a collecting bag, and, in the interim, I would encourage primatolo- gists working in the field with habituated animals to describe, collect, and mark the location of such remains as well. At Ishasha I have already laid the groundwork for this type of study by mapping the background distri- bution of bones on the modern landscape surface while recording species and body-part frequencies, surface modification, etc. When and if a chimpanzee drops a bit of bone in our study area, it will be interpreted in its taphonomic and ecological context. While Wrangham and Whiten note that chimpanzees and baboons tend to consume their small prey at the kill site, direct observa- tions of this are still rare, and occasional notes of carcass or carcass-part transport have appeared in the literature (e.g., Hasegawa et al. I983, Hiraiwa-Hasegawa et al. I986). Rather than just noting that modern primate be- havior does not produce the large concentrations of bones that occur at some primary-context early archaeo- logical sites (something we already know) we might study the variation in consumption patterns by prey spe- cies and habitat type from a taphonomic perspective. For example, chimpanzees often consume their prey com- munally, and Boesch and Boesch (I989:569) have noted apparent differences in "butchering habits" and sharing between different populations of chimpanzees. How do these different feeding patterns affect the resulting dis- tributions of abandoned bone fragments, particularly in comparison with patterns of small-carcass dismember- ment and processing by modern human or protohuman foragers? Subsequently, when chimpanzees have dis- carded the remains of a small carcass, how often are the bones likely to attract and be disturbed by scavengers? In what ways other than species representation do the remains of chimpanzee prey differ from the small- animal remains preserved at a site such as FLK-Zinj at Olduvai? And, to follow Whiten's point about the im- portant effect of habitat, would the very patchy nature of resources along the Ishasha River lead to spatially redundant hunting (or scavenging) patterns more than would be likely in less restricted chimpanzee habitats such as the Gombe woodlands or the Kibale forest? It is well established that early hominids acquired and handled different animal foods from apes or monkeys today, although I would argue with Whiten's view that scavenging was the likely "precursor of hunting in hom- inid evolution" (see Sept i992 and recent reviews of the archaeological evidence for hunting and scavenging in Potts I988 and Bunn i99i). I also strongly disagree with his implication that because of this behavioral "discon- tinuity" there is little that archaeologists could learn about early hominid behavior by studying the meat- eating behaviors of primates that rarely scavenge. As should be clear from points raised in the preceding para- graph, I feel that archaeologists' ability to diagnose the unique socioeconomic context of early hominid meat and marrow eating can only be strengthened by system- atic studies of the carcass-processing and discard pat- terns of chimpanzees or other living primates. Home bases and central-place foraging. Isaac (e.g., I984) came to use the terms "home base" and "central place" interchangeably, borrowing Orians and Pearson's (I979) definition of central-place foraging and focusing on the behavior often characteristic of modern humans, denning carnivores, nesting birds, and so on-returning to a spot carrying a prey item or a load of food for the purpose of provisioning (food sharing). By this definition baboons and chimpanzees are not strict central-place foragers because they do not systematically transport food back to their refuges, and food transport costs do not affect their foraging patterns (although tool transport costs may [see Boesch and Boesch I984]). Yet, as refuging foragers, their ranging decisions must balance the some- times conflicting demands of getting access to patches of food and water or limited refuges while maintaining social contacts and avoiding predators. The numerous comments that baboons often use their habitats even more redundantly than the Ishasha chimpanzees</page><page sequence="18">204 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 33, Number 2, April I992 strengthen one of my basic points: a spatial focus for debris-producing activities, such as feeding or nest building, may have as much to do with the ecological attributes of the location as with the socioeconomic or- ganization of the litterers. King, Uehara, and Wrangham imply that I am ready to reject the home-base model. This is an overstatement, and in many ways the Ishasha data complement the pa- leoenvironmental scenarios implicit in the home-base model and its offshoots. For example, documenting that large omnivorous primates tend to refrequent certain sections of a riparian habitat for nesting and feeding or socializing supports aspects of both the "stone-cache" hypothesis of Potts (I988) and the "favored-place" hy- pothesis of Bunn (i99i). If spatially redundant nesting and feeding debris is to be expected in habitats with this type of resource structure, the Ishasha data "challenge" the home-base hypothesis in the sense that archaeolo- gists need to demonstrate the behavioral integrity of early assemblages without founding their arguments upon the spatial coincidence of the materials. Can we imagine a behavioral mechanism that could account for the occasional transport of stone or bone to favorite patches of fruiting or nesting trees without invoking co- operative foraging and food sharing? As Uehara notes, documenting the diversity of remains at early sites and reconstructing their likely transport costs through actu- alistic studies will clearly be central to testing this; sys- tematic records of the accumulating residue patterns of the Ishasha chimpanzees should serve as an instructive point of contrast. Modeling. My suggestion that we should try to avoid using chimpanzees as simple analogs or "referential models" for early hominid behavior clearly hit a nerve with two reviewers (McGrew and Moore), while others thought that my focus on chimpanzees was too narrow or ignored arguments based on behavioral "continuities" (King, Paterson, Whiten). In this context I would note that archaeologists have long debated the appropriate use of analogy in prehistoric reconstruction (cf. Binford I981, I987; Wylie I985; Gifford-Gonzalez i99i), distin- guishing between simplistic "formal" analogies based on pattern similarities and "relational" analogies pre- ferred because they focus on structural or processual links. My goal in this study was to move towards devel- oping a relational comparison of the ways in which the ranging patterns of chimpanzees and modern human for- agers are constrained by the structures of their habitats and the effects of these constraints on debris patterns. I heartily endorse the suggestion of Moore, Paterson, Strier, Whiten, and Wrangham that we can use behav- ioral data from several primate species, including ba- boons, to model how hominids would have balanced the costs and benefits of predator avoidance and foraging in patchy habitats (see Sept I984), particularly in terms of the ranges of predator risks and dietary items that are already documented at archaeological sites (e.g., scav- enging opportunities and relative prey sizes). I chose to focus on a population of savanna chimpanzees rather than another species such as the hamadryas baboon or the pygmy marmoset (cf. McGrew) because the scale and complexity of Ishasha chimpanzee habitat use are particularly relevant for comparisons with an archaeo- logical record created in comparable habitats by large- bodied, omnivorous, tool-using hominoids. On the basis of locomotor evidence alone we suspect that early homi- nids had diverged from apelike ranging behaviors, and the bone debris at archaeological sites bears witness to clear dietary differences between modern chimpanzees and the early hominid stone-tool makers. But the extent to which the concentration of debris at archaeological sites was conditioned by the interplay between habitat structure and socioeconomic organization remains an open question. I think that we will be better able to address this question and create testable hypotheses for the archaeological record with an understanding of how the feeding and nesting behaviors of large, omnivorous primates such as chimpanzees come to be patterned across the landscape.
