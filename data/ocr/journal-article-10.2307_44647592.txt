Fort Worth, TX ABSTRACT This paper describes the results of a re- search program to investigate the crash impact behavior of helicopter composite structures designed to meet the U.S. Army's crashworthiness requirements specified in MIL-STD-1290 . The program included design, fabrication, and crash testing of two full-scale composite helicopter cabin sections. The drop test conditions for the two cabin sections were representative of the 42 ft/ s vertical crash impact velocity requirement specified in MIL-STD-1290 assuming the landing gear had slowed the aircraft from 42 ft/s to 30 ft/s prior to fuselage contact. Roll attitudes of 0° (flat) and 20° were used in the two cabin drop tests. Test results from both drop tests indicated that the strong protective shell struc- ture around the occupants remained intact; struc- tural deformation was restricted to the areas designed to crush and absorb energy; and most important, the excellent post- test condition of the cabin protective shell structure and the performance of specially designed energy-absorb- ing components demonstrated that the Army's crashworthiness requirement could be met by a composite structure. The KRASH computer program was used for the crash impact analysis of the cabin sections. Load-deformation characteristics of key energy- ab s orbing components were derived from design support test data and used as input to the KRASH analysis. Based on the good crash impact performance of the composite cabins and the comparison of analytical and test results, KRASH proved to be a useful and reasonably ac- curate analysis tool for the design of helicopter composite structures to meet the Army's crash- worthiness requirements. EXTENSIVE CRASHWORTHINESS STUDIES for metal air- craft structures have been conducted in the past. Early in 1960, the U.S. Army Transportation Com- mand (now the Applied Technology Laboratory, U.S. Army Research Technology Laboratories, USAAVRADCOM) initiated a long-range program to study aircraft crashworthiness that culminated in the issuance of a Crash Survival Design Guide (1)* and the associated MIL-STD-1290 (2). A comprehensive crashworthiness criterion was first applied to a production metallic airframe in the Army UTTAS program in the early 1970' s. The second production metallic airframe designed to a comprehensive crashworthiness criterion was the Army's AAH program in the mid- 1970 's. Recent crashworthiness experience gained with the crash testing of the YAH-63 during the summer of 1981 (3) along with actual crashes of the UH-60 in the field indicate that metallic helicopter airframes can be built to comply with the Army's crash- worthiness requirements . In recent years, composite materials such as graphite, fiberglass, boron, and Kevlar have been used more extensively in the design of aircraft components, both structurally and nonstructur- ally, due to their potential for cost and weight savings and corrosion resistance. It is reason- able to assume that the helicopter industry will have large numbers of production aircraft with major structural components, such as the fuse- lage, wings, empennage, blades or landing gear, constructed of composite materials in the near future. Currently, under the Army's Advanced Composite Airframe Program (ACAP) , all-composite helicopter airframes are being developed that are required to meet MIL-STD-1290 crashworthiness requirements . During this initial stage of development of composite helicopter structures, it is partic- ularly appropriate to investigate the crash im- pact behavior of composite materials before large numbers of composite aircraft are in the field. This paper describes the results of a contracted R&amp;D program conducted by Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (BHTI) for the U.S. Army Applied Technology ^Numbers in parentheses designate reference at the end of paper. 3.117 0096-736X/84/9203-01 17$02.50 Copyright 1984 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">3.118 J- D. CRONKHITE Laboratory that was directed toward the investi- gation and evaluation of methods and concepts for the design of composite airframe structures that can comply with current Army crashworthiness requirements. Under this program, two full-scale composite cabin sections incorporating special crashworthy features were designed, fabricated, and tested under vertical crash impact conditions representative of those specified in MIL-STD- 1290. Design support testing was conducted to develop the energy- absorbing structure concepts used in the cabin sections. In addition, the KRASH (4) analysis was used in the design of the cabins and was compared with test results to evaluate the method as a useful tool in the design of crashworthy composite structures. Further details of the work described in this paper can be found in Reference 5. DESIGN OF CABIN TEST SECTION When designing the airframe to protect occupants in a crash, two fundamental guidelines to consider are: first, that a protective shell be maintained around the occupied area and, second, that the structure be crushable and absorb energy, thus reducing decelerative forces on the occupants and large masses. (These and other crashworthy design considerations are listed in Figure 1.) When applying composites to a crashworthy airframe structure, entirely dif- ferent design concepts may be required than are used with conventional metal structures. As illustrated in Figure 2, composite materials exhibit low strain-to-failure compared to such metals as 2024 aluminum, a ductile metal that can tolerate rather large strains, deform plastical- ly, and absorb a considerable amount of energy without fracture. Because of this difference between composites and metals, crash energy absorption for composite structures may not come directly from the material stress-strain behavior as it can with metals, but rather through innova- tive design. In order to investigate approaches and pro- cedures for designing a composite structure -that could meet the Army's crashworthiness require- ments specified in MIL-STD-1290 , two full-scale composite cabin structures were designed, built, and tested. As illustrated in Figure 3, the cabin sections were derived from BHTI 1 s ACAP helicopter airframe design and incorporated special energy- ab s orbing structure developed using design support testing. The composite cabin protective shell structure, as shown in Figure 4, consisted of primarily three full bulkheads tied together with redundant roof beams, a strong floor, and side skins. Below the floor were two zones of crushable structure; the first was located under the forward bulkhead, and the second under the aft bulkhead and fuel tank. The crushable structure was specially designed to absorb maximum amounts of energy while control- ling the loads to the protective shell structure. Frangible structure was used under the cabin floor to prevent excessive heaving loads that may cause failure of the floor structure. The composite materials used in construction of the cabin section were Kevlar/epoxy , fiber- glass/epoxy, and graphite /epoxy. The four con- tinuous longitudinal roof beams which intercon- nect with each of the three bulkheads were con- structed of fibe rglass/ epoxy . The two center roof beams that support the transmission mass were of sandwich construction with fiberglass faces, Nomex core, and graphite/ epoxy caps. Graphite/epoxy blocks were used locally at the transmission attachments and were designed to allow up to 1.5 inch vertical stroking in a controlled manner. The roof beams were supported laterally by fiberglass intercostal members. The bulkheads and floor panel were constructed of fiberglass/ epoxy sandwich structure with alumi- num honeycomb core. Kevlar/epoxy fabric was used in the roof, belly and side skins, and the fran- gible subfloor structure, while Kevlar/epoxy fabric sandwich construction with Nomex core was used in the energy-absorbing subfloor structure and the side skins. Graphite/epoxy tape was used for local reinforcement around the door frames. The drop test conditions for the cabin sec- tions were representative of the 42 ft/s vertical crash impact velocity requirement specified in MIL-STD-1290, assuming the landing gear had slow- ed the aircraft from 42 ft/s to 30 ft/s prior to fuselage contact (see Figure 5). The two cabins were drop tested with roll attitudes of 0° (flat) and 20°. The 20° roll condition represented the most severe roll attitude requirement for the Army's ACAP aircraft and was the most critical design condition for the energy-absorbing sub- floor structure. As shown in Figure 5, when designing for the roll impact condition, all of the crash impact kinetic energy is absorbed on only one side of the fuselage. However, for the flat impact condition, both sides of the energy- absorbing structure are crushed which results in only about one-half of the available crush depth being utilized. DESIGN SUPPORT TESTING OF ENERGY-ABSORBING SUB- FLOOR STRUCTURE Design data for sizing the energy- absorbing, load- limiting structure under the floor of the cabin sections was developed from design support testing of small, economical keel beam sections shown in Figure 6. Characteristic load-deflec- tion response of the energy-absorbing structure shown in Figure 7, was rectangular- shaped without undesirable high peak loads that can be found in conventional structural design. The energy- absorption (area under the load-deflection curve) was considerably higher for the tailored crush- able structure than for a conventional structure and stroke- to- length ratios were found to be good, being up to 80% before bottoming out began. The energy- absorbing Kevlar sandwich struc- ture exhibited other advantages besides good energy absorption and load- limiting ability. The Kevlar material was also found to maintain good structural integrity even after severe crushing deformation which is important in providing the protective shell around the occupants. Good</page><page sequence="3">CRASH IMPACT CHARACTERISTICS 3.119 structural integrity allows the crushable struc- ture to provide load- carrying capability in the fuselage structure as well as energy absorption. In addition, dynamic testing showed that there was no significant loading rate sensitivity for this type of structure. FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY The sequence of fabrication and assembly of a cabin test section beginning with the engineer- ing drawings and culminating with a completed structure is shown in Figures 8 and 9. First, loft layout templates of mylar were generated using CADAM and based on the engineering draw- ings. The mylar templates were used as patterns for making tools, cutting out detail parts, and for assembly. Next, bond tools were made for fabrication of detail parts. Then, the detail parts were fabricated and most of the parts were cured in an autoclave while some parts were cured in a heated press. Finally, the cabins were as- sembled in a wooden two-part fixture. The methods used for fabrication and assem- bly were driven by minimizing costs for building only a small number of cabin structures. Accord- ingly, the tools were relatively simple. Since the cabin test section would not be exposed to a hot, humid environment, the high temperature (350°F) curing resin materials were not required and many of the details could be bonded at 265°F using wood tools. However, some metal bond tools were used. For example, a large curved metal plate was used for forming the large one-piece side skins and door frames and a flat metal plate was used for fabricating large sandwich panels from which the bulkheads and floor were cut out. The detail parts were assembled into the final cabin section using room temperature curing adhesive. Mechanical fasteners consisting of rivets and screws were used to hold the structure in place and apply pressure during curing. CRASH IMPACT TESTING The two cabin sections were drop tested in BHTI 1 s large drop tower facility shown in Figure 10. The first cabin section was drop tested at a 30 ft/s vertical impact velocity and at a flat attitude with no pitch or roll. Floor- and bulkhead-mounted attenuating passenger seats and anthropomorphic dummies were installed to study the effects of the crash on a human occupant. The second cabin section impacted at a 20° roll attitude. In the second test, the anthropomor- phic dummies and stroking seats were replaced with 177-pound rigid lumped masses. Accelera- tions of large masses were measured in both drop tests and displacements of the stroking seats were recorded in the flat drop test. The veloc- ity of the bottom of the cabin just prior to impact was measured using trip switches. In addition, high-speed motion pictures were used to record the cabin structure response for each drop test. 30 FT/S FLAT DROP TEST - The first composite cabin section drop test was considered survivable based on the excellent post-test condition of the cabin protective shell structure and the perform- ance of the energy-absorbing structure compo- nents. As can be seen in Figure 11, structure deformation was restricted to the areas that were designed to be damaged or crushed with no detect- able permanent deformation in the protective shell. Maximum crushing of approximately 3.8 inches occurred in the aft crush zone and ap- proximately 4.5 inches in the forward crush zone. The crushing deformations correspond to approxi- mately half of the usable crush stroke of 8 inches (80% of the 10 inches of subfloor depth) . With only minor repair plus replacement of the crushable subfloor structure, the cabin was considered reusable. The high-speed motion pictures indicated that the aft structure exhibited some rebound (approximately 7.5 inches); however, the forward structure did not. Although not considered a significant problem, the rebound was believed to have occurred as a result of the unvented air cavities in the aft crush zone acting as an air spring and storing, rather than dissipating some of the crash kinetic energy. This was substan- tiated by analysis. Both troop seats stroked properly and at- tenuated decelerative loads on the occupants (dummies). The bulkhead-mounted left seat strok- ed 9 inches while the floor-mounted right seat stroked 6 inches. Both seats had an 11-inch stroke capability and therefore neither bottomed out. Figure 12 is a time-history trace of both the occupant pelvis vertical acceleration and the aft, center floor vertical acceleration. The U.S. Army's Aircraft Crash Survival Design Guide TR79-22 (1) recommends that the pelvis vertical g's should not be above 23g's longer than 6 msec duration in order to minimize the probability of injury to the occupants. Note that the pelvis g's shown in Figure 12 were within the noninjuri- ous levels the design guide recommends while the floor g's have a duration above 23 g's consider- ably greater (by about 5 times) than recommended. Therefore, without the attenuating seat in addi- tion to the crushable fuselage structure, the occupant would have probably experienced injuri- ous decelerative loads during the crash impact. This illustrated the importance of the elements of the energy management system working together to protect the occupants; that is, the fuselage structure served to maintain a protective shell, provide energy absorption, and retain the seats and large masses while the seat restrained the occupant, provided additional energy absorption, and controlled loads on the occupant to tolerable levels . The 1000-pound overhead transmission mass vertical acceleration time history shown in Figure 12 indicated a peak of approximately 75 to 80 g's which was above the 50g design load. The four transmission joints were designed to 12.5 g's vertical load each which corresponds to a 50 g vertical load factor at the transmission eg for a pure vertical loading. The 12.5 g stroking</page><page sequence="4">3'120 J. D. CRONKHITE load for each joint was based on the static strength of the graphite blocks used in the roof beams and it was predicted that there would be little or no stroking of the joints for the flat impact. However, in the test each joint stroked 1.25 inches and then bottomed out, allowing the vertical transmission acceleration to exceed 50 g's, but this did not result in a catastrophic failure of the roof beams. This was considered to be due to the inherent strength in the trans- mission attachment structure as a result of designing for combined loading conditions plus some additional strength provided by the roof skins, attach angles, and secondary structure such as the lateral intercostal beams. Note that dynamic tests of the graphite roof beam joints were subsequently conducted and it was found that the joints failed at 30% lower loads dynamically than statically which explains the excessive stroking of the joints compared to predictions. The thickness of the graphite blocks was then increased by 30% prior to the second drop test at a 20° rolled attitude in order to provide the proper stroking load. 20° ROLL DROP TEST - The 20° roll drop test of the cabin was considered successful since the protective shell structure maintained its integr- ity, provided a livable volume for the occupants and retained the major masses. The test also demonstrated that the crushable energy-absorbing structure was capable of attenuating vertical crash energy at oblique impact angles of at least 20° roll and still perform well. The cabin impacted on the left side crushing the subfloor structure as shown in Figure 13. All of the vertical kinetic energy was attenuated before the cabin section rotated onto its right side resulting in no crushing on the right side. From motion picture analysis, the cabin vertical velocity reached zero while the cabin remained rolled at least 17°. The measured transmission and floor accel- erations are shown in Figure 14. The maximum transmission acceleration was about 25 g's verti- cally and less than 20 g's laterally. The resul- tant transmission acceleration for the roll drop test was considerably lower than the flat impact (32 g's compared to 75 g's) due in part to the cabin crushing only one side over a greater stroke of about 8 inches. Also, the attachment joints did not bottom out as they did in the flat drop test. The stiffened attenuating transmis- sion joints stroked 0.5 inches at the left aft joint and about 0.25 inches at the left forward joint. The only damage to the cabin structure, aside from the deformation of the subfloor crush- able structure, was a failure of a secondary intercostal roof beam that ran laterally between the longitudinal main roof beams. The structure was in such good condition that with minor re- pairs and replacement of the crushable subfloor structure, the composite cabin section could be used again. KRASH ANALYSIS AND COMPARISONS WITH TEST DESIGN ANALYSIS PROCEDURE - The KRASH compu- ter program is a nonlinear transient response analysis for simulating the crash impact behavior for any arbitrary three-dimensional structure. The analysis includes both geometric and material nonlinear structure behavior capability. KRASH is often referred to as a "hybrid" crash analysis method because it generally requires input data derived from other analyses or test since the structure is represented in a rather coarse manner using nonlinear beam and spring structural elements and lumped masses. For design of the composite cabin sections, KRASH and the NASTRAN (6) finite-element struc- tural analysis were used. KRASH was used for the dynamic analysis of the composite cabin drop test conditions and NASTRAN was used for determining internal loads required for strength analysis (see Figure 15). The NASTRAN analysis was con- ducted using applied load factors from KRASH based on a "snapshot" of the dynamic loads at points in time when the loads were critical. For the NASTRAN analysis, the structure was assumed to remain elastic which was considered a good assumption since all of the primary structure above the floor was designed so that it would not yield or be damaged. (Note that in the primary protective shell structure, any yielding was considered unacceptable because of the char- acteristic brittle failure modes of composite materials . ) For structure sizing, a strength analysis was performed using the NASTRAN internal loads to size the critical areas including: the main transmission support roof beams, the aft cabin bulkhead, the roof and side skins, and the floor panel loaded by the fuel mass. The sizing of the crushable subfloor structure was based on energy absorption and load attenuation requirements from the KRASH analysis then using the design support test data to determine the proper amount of crushable structure to include under the floor. COMPARISON OF KRASH AND TEST FOR FLAT DROP -A comparison of the KRASH and test results was conducted using the KRASH model described above and shown in Figure 15. For the flat drop analy- sis, a half model was used due to symmetry. The KRASH model was modified from that used for the design analysis by first including an air spring based on the air volume in the cavities of the aft cabin crush zone area and then reducing the transmission joint stroking load by 30% of the design value. These modifications were incorpo- rated into the KRASH model to reflect the obser- vations made in the flat drop test. In order to facilitate the comparison of analytical and test results, the acceleration data was filtered and plotted using a data analy- sis program called DATAMAP (7). For the compar- ison of the test data and the KRASH analysis results, 60-Hz two-pole Butterworth filtering was used. Figure 16 shows an example comparison of the use of various filtering frequencies for the test and the analysis. The purpose of filtering</page><page sequence="5">CRASH IMPACT CHARACTERISTICS 3.121 the data was to smooth out the unimportant higher frequencies yet preserve the major pulse ampli- tude and duration that causes significant struc- tural deformation and damage. The peak and duration of the major pulse and overall shape of the acceleration time history was shown to be preserved in the 60-Hz filtered data. For the 30 ft/s flat drop condition, struc- ture deformed plots and high-speed photos are compared in Figure 17, and acceleration time histories for the transmission, crew masses, cabin floor, and troop pelvis are compared in Figure 18. Generally, the KRASH results agreed well with the flat drop when comparing deflec- tions of the crushable structure, accelerations of the large masses, and seat/occupant response. Specific comments on the comparison of KRASH and test results are as follows: 1. Acceleration time-history responses including peak g's, shape, and duration agreed well for the transmission eg, crew mass, floor, and passenger pelvis. 2. The stroke of the bulkhead-mounted seat, which was simulated in the KRASH model, was 9.0 inches in test compared to 9.9 inches in KRASH. 3. Maximum deflections of the aft crush zone compared well -- 3.75 inches de- flection from test and 3.5 inches from KRASH. Rebound also agreed well. Note that an air spring stiffening effect was observed in the aft crush zone area and an air spring was added to the KRASH model thus reducing the maximum aft crush zone deflection from 5.0 inches to 3.5 inches and increasing rebound. 4. After the test, it was found that the transmission attachment joints stroked at 30% lower load than designed. When the KRASH model was modified accord- ingly, it showed good agreement having fully stroked to 1.25 inches with the transmission vertical g's comparing well also. COMPARISON OF KRASH AND TEST FOR 20° ROLL DROP - The KRASH analysis comparison with test was conducted using the full KRASH model shown in Figure 15. Comparisons of analytical and test results for the vertical and lateral acceleration time histories for the left-hand troop mass and the transmission eg are presented in Figure 19. The peak responses from the 60-Hz KRASH data were considerably higher than test. The vertical and lateral accelerations on the major mass items from the KRASH analysis indicated a strong 20- to 30-Hz vibration mode in the structure. This vibration mode appeared to be a result of the manner in which the bulkheads were modeled. The vertical beams used in the bulkhead model did not stiffen the bulkhead in shear sufficiently for an oblique impact. The rolled impact unsymmetrical- ly loaded the bulkhead which excited an in-plane vibration mode of the bulkhead. This vibration was not experienced in the flat impact since the vertical beams were loaded vertically in compres- sion and acted as columns. In an attempt to filter out the bulkhead vibrations in the KRASH results, data filtered at 15 Hz was overplotted on Figure 19 to enhance the major responses of the structure without the unwanted artificial vibration mode. In general, the 15-Hz filtered data agreed well with test results. Note also that the comparisons of the roll angle time histories and the maximum crushing of the sub- floor derived from high-speed film analysis were found to be in good agreement, within 5%. CONCLUSIONS Conclusions that can be drawn from this investigation of the crash impact characteristics of helicopter composite structures are as fol- lows: 1. Based on full-scale fuselage cabin crash tests, composite fuselages can be designed and fabricated that provide energy-absorption and load attenuation in controlled areas and provide a primary protective shell structure around the occupants for crash impact. Excellent post-test condition of the cabin protective shell structure and the performance of the energy-absorbing components demonstrated that the Army's MIL-STD-1290 crashworthiness require- ments could be met by a composite structure . 2. The method of using design support testing to define the energy absorbing characteristics of the subfloor struc- ture proved to be economical and accu- rate in representing the actual cabin structure response. 3. The KRASH nonlinear, large-deflection structure crash simulation computer program proved to be a useful and rea- sonably accurate analytical tool for design of crashworthy composite fuse- lage structures. 4. The use of a data analysis program, such as DATAMAP, for automatic filter- ing and plotting of time history data allows a better understanding and in- terpretation of the analytical results and greatly facilitates any comparison with test results.
