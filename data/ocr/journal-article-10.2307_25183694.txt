Princeton, New Jersey, Princeton University Press, 1997. ?12.95. This collection of selected essays appears fifty years after the death of the art historian, Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy. Dr Coomaraswamy, or AKC, as he is referred to in this book, was uniquely placed to look at cultures, East and West, and to present the thinking of the former in the language of the latter. Born in Ceylon to a Tamil Sinhalese jurist father and an English mother, he was educated in England, taking his degrees at University College, London, as a geologist. He returned to Ceylon as a government mineralogist and engrossed himself in the study of Sinhalese arts and crafts. His first book, Mediaeval Sinhalese Art (1908), arose from native pride and his association with William Morris. AKC moved easily in Sinhalese, Indian and English cultured circles, influencing and being influenced by some of the finest minds of the age. In 1917 he emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts where he created and curated the oriental art section of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Throughout his career he continued travelling, thinking, and writing. Whether considering the arts and crafts of his native Sinhalese culture, Indian and Indonesian art, or Eastern societies, religions and metaphysics, AKC approached each subject with meticulous attention to detail as well as with an ever-expanding awareness of the interconnectedness of cultures. His son, Dr Rama Coomaraswamy, has searched his entire work for essays which touch on the subject of myth and meaning. Reading these will hopefully send the reader back for more of AKC, and may encourage him, (or her) to think again about his (or her) own approach to Asian, especially Indian, subjects. Throughout this collection there runs the strong current of AKC's sense of the importance and value of indigenous cultures. He never wavered from this in forty years. He could be quite passionate in defence of his principles. In 1910 AKC, at thirty-three, dared to criticise Sir George Birdwood for declaring there were no fine arts in India and referring to the Buddha image as a "boiled suet pudding". In that year, as well as co-founding, with like-minded Orientalists, the India Society, he presented a paper at the March 8th General Meeting of Royal Asiatic Society, "On the Study of Indian Art". In it he indicated the range of knowledge that he felt was needed on the part of the Westerner in search of an understanding of Indian art. AKC's wealth of learning and metaphysical rhetoric militates against immediate comprehension:</page><page sequence="2">314 Review of Books All the more reason to stick to the task of working through every layer and level of argument and illustration. He supports his thesis from a variety of sources - antique and modern, European and Asian - to make the point that certain ideas, whether they be expressed artistically or linguistically, are universal. Essentially, he wove his ideas about mythology into everything he investigated. As far as he was concerned, it is impossible to study any culture without being thoroughly cognisant with its mythology. Part of the problem with modern scholarship, he felt, was that scholars did not understand the material they were dealing with in terms of its cultural content. And "modern" for him began shortly after the turn of the century. Take, for example, the theme of the book, The Door in the Sky, based on the essay entitled, Svyamatranana: Janua Coeli, which dates from 1939. In how many cultures does this idea occur? AKC begins with Vedic rites and shows where and how in a number of ancient cultures this connection manifests itself. The broad answer he gives demonstrates the extent to which proper scholarship is necessary to gain an understanding of even a very simple concept. The footnotes constitute an essay in themselves. By the time the reader has worked through this essay and absorbed its content and import, not only is he/she very much wiser about this particular point, but also he/she has a very good sense of the workings of AKC's metaphysical mind. The degree and depth of learning expressed shows what he expected from others approaching the same and similar subjects. Take as another example the essay, "The Nature of Buddhist Art", written as the introduction to the Wall-Paintings of India, Central Asia, and Ceylon (Boston, 1938) by B. Rowland, Jr. - this version revised for inclusion in his last publication, Figures of Speech or Figures of Thought: Collected Essays on the Traditional or "Normal" View of An (London, 1946). The topics he addresses are part of current debates: the Buddha's aniconic and anthropomorphic art phases; the practice of art in the Buddhist world; the function of the patron; the function of myth and symbol. The essay bears rereading in light of these debates and in light of one of AKC's fundamental ideas that Indian "art" is, aufond, religious, so that in order to understand especially Buddhist "art" one must be able to appreciate this as well as the fact that one deals with "... reality on different levels of reference ..." (p. 174). To say more would be to spoil the experience of this book. Other essays included in the volume are: "Mind and Myth", "Imitation, Expression, and Participation", "Atmayajna: Self-Sacrifice", "A Figure of Speech or a Figure of Thought?", "An Indian Temple: The Kandarya Mahadeo", "Literary Symbolism", and "The Symbolism of the Dome". Dr Rama Coomaraswamy is to be congratulated on his selection. Mary Stewart</page></plain_text>
