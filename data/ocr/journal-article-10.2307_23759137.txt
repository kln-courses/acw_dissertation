It stems from a private collection in Santa Fe, New Mexico, was acquired in 1991 by a Swiss art dealer in Geneva and entered a private collection in Switzerland in 2003 where it is still preserved. As provenance the art dealer vaguely mentioned "Colima Culture", described the elegant figure as a dancer and musU cian, and dated it to between 100 B.C. and 300 A.D. The red slipped figure is 44 cm high, 28.5 cm wide, and 14 cm thick. The style of this figure, a remarkable example of the funeral art of Western Mexico, is simple and sober. The hollow anthropomorphic statuette is made of a well fired, red-brown burnished clay and is covered in places by black spots, a residue, commonly interpreted as mineral ac cretions from the soils or walls of a tomb. The material of the black splatterings has been identified on original pottery figures by chemical analyses as manganese dioxide (Von Winning 1974: 77-79). No painted details are recognizable, however there are two incised lines that define the worn belt. The beautifully polished and lustrous surface of the sculpture shows no losses, nor traces of weathering. Represented is a standing male figure, holding an unidentified elongated, stick like object in his right hand. The fine oval face is enclosed by a crescent-shaped coiffure, the small eyes are almost closed and shaped like coffee beans, the large nose is sharp and rectilinear, the mouth is small, the lips are closed and pointed. The figure is dressed in a simple loincloth with a broad belt. The knees show horizontally placed thin protectors. As or naments two beaded collar strings and an oblong, vertically placed pectoral are worn. Comparable ceramic figures are commonly described as shamans, warriors, dancers, and mu sicians. On top of the head of the personage projects a small round spout, indicating that the hollow figure functioned definitely as a vessel, originally filled with a liquid. A small group of related and very similar hollow statues are also red-slipped and highly polished, all around 40 cm high, holding diverse objects in both stylized hands, orna mented with the same distinctive double collar and wearing the particular loincloth with a vertical element in front. There are apparently only four examples in this particular style and type known in the literature: the hitherto unpub lished statue on the front cover of this issue of mexicon, sec ondly an object from a private collection in the United States (Von Winning 1968, No. 70), a third statue was on display during an exhibition in Genève (Mexique: Terre des Dieux 1998: 91, No. 78), and a fourth example was exhibited in the Musée Ethnographique d'Anvers (Richard F. Townsend et al. 1998: 69, No. 2). These three-dimensional ceramic sculptures evidently represent shaft tomb figures. Shaft tomb complexes are a unique archaeological feature occurring predominantly in Mesoamerica in Western Mexico, mainly in the present Mexican coastal states of south-central Nayarit, central Jalisco, and Colima (Disselhoff 1932; Eisleb 1971; Von Winning 1974). In such tombs human remains are usually accompanied by mortuary offerings such as pottery vessels and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, ceramic house models, masks, as well as other artefacts, like figurines made of green stone and obsidian, diverse ornaments, shells, mir rors, musical instruments, spindle whorls, and metates. Un fortunately, systematic scientific explorations of shaft cham ber tombs have been conducted only sporadically and almost all examples of the corpus of figurai terracottas known and published were excavated by looters (cf. Fürst 1978: 42-76; Kan, Meighan, and Nicholson 1989: 128-175; Aveleyra and Pina Chan 1997: 148-165). As a result of this lamentable fact the overwhelming majority of the known ceramic figures in the Colima style originate from illegal diggings, have no known source and lack any recorded archaeological con text. Even in an official descriptive guide, published by the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Antropologîa e Historia, of the "Museo de las Culturas de Occidente" in the city of Colima (Messmacher 1965), not a single one of the illustrated pottery artefacts has been given a provenance information. There are many known archaeological sites within the Mexican state of Colima, for example El Chanal, Cuauhtemoc, Comala, Los Ortices, Copales, Morett, Playa del Tesoro, Periquilla, Armeria, Tecoman, and Chanchopa (Kan, Meighan, and Nicholson 1989: 10, map), however, at only a few sites have official scientific explorations and excavations been carried out. The many hundreds of characteristic handmade terracotta hollow and solid figures scattered in numerous private collec tions and museums in the United States and Europe are only partially published, and are predominantly unprovenanced. They are commonly and simply designated as from "Colima" or are in the "Colima style", and rarely assigned, tentatively, to a specific archaeological location. One of the best-known type of brown- and red-slipped, polished terracotta effigies are the famous hollow dogs, the most commonly portrayed mexicon • Vol. XXXI • Dezember 2009</page><page sequence="3">animal in the funerary art of Colima, and definitely a hallmark of the Colima style. Chronologically, the deplorable archaeological situation of these displaced ceramic effigies makes any reliable dating speculative. The few radiocarbon datings of organic items found in shaft-and-chamber tombs in Colima can hardly be applied to establish the antiquity of ceramic specimens. Ther moluminiscence is an appropriate archaeometric technique that provides rather exact dating of Precolumbian fired clay objects. For instance, thermoluminiscence tests applied to ten unprovenanced Colima style pottery figures (Hoffmann 2002: 59, 62, 63, 66-69, 72-74), provided dates between 100 B.C. and 400 A.D.; four specimens were dated to 100 B.C., three to 50 B,C., and only the remaining three items gave dates of 200, 350, and 400 A.D., respectively. Unprovenanced Colima-style ceramic figures are usually dated from the Late Preclassic to the Early Classic periods, namely from 200 B.C. to 300 A.D. (Fürst 1978: 43; Berjonneau and Sonnery 1985: 153-167; Aveleyra and Pinâ Chan 1997). The manufacture date of the figures in any given century within the long time span of half a millennium is chronologically more than inac curate and highly speculative. At present the anthropomor phic clay figures can only be provisionally dated between 200 B.C. and 100 A.D. Whenever a comparable specimen of the shaft-tomb complex is discovered in the course of a scientific excavation in the future, then a better chronological determination can be considered. In conclusion it should be mentioned that the growing interest and subsequent tremendous demand of Colima style figures on the international art market, where thousands of specimens were traded, has led to the creation of numerous imitations and forgeries. Many of these fakes are very sophis ticated and therefore extremely difficult to expose. In order to recognize whether or not an object is authentic, a thermolu miniscence test should be applied at the very least, as a visual inspection and evaluation of these Mesoamerican funerary offerings even by experts must be regarded as insufficient.
