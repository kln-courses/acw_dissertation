<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES THE INFLUENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE USE OF Ε SCH ΑΤΟ LOGICAL TERMS' τ Α \ THE literature on New Testament eschatology is vast and daily vaster, and I make no pretence to have mastered it. All that I venture to offer in this paper is the suggestion that, in some of the learned discussions, an obvious but important fact is overlooked. This is the fact that, in all that they wrote about what we call escha tology, St. Paul and the others were confronted—always, and not at one time any more than another—by a complex situation. That situa tion, from first to last, was invariably held within the tension of the incarnation itself—a tension which, by definition, can never be resolved in this life and is never amenable to progressive adjustments. The situation, therefore, always, from the very first, presented a wide variety of needs and a diversity of questions which were potentially simultaneous. It is, I suggest, when this constant fact is forgotten that theories of successive phases of thought and even of evolutionary stages of development gain more plausibility than they deserve. In an article in the J.T.S. not long ago,2 I tried to show that christological formula tions were dominated first by one emphasis, then by another, not always according to chronological sequence but rather according to their par ticular purposes, whether it was worship and adoration, explanation and defence, or, perhaps, even attack. What I shall try to do now is to apply the same kind of considerations to eschatological formulations, by asking: What particular conviction did this one and that one aim to safeguard ? In thus offering a classification according to the con victions that needed protecting, I want to suggest that the need or the appropriateness of that other kind of classification according to sue cessive phases of development is correspondingly weakened, and even that the search for consistency or uniformity at any given stage is partly obviated. This idea, although I have been arriving at it, I think, independently, is, of course, not original: it is sponsored by others also, at least in part. In a paper read before this very Society on 9 May 1940, and later 1 The Presidential Address delivered to the Oxford Society of Historical Theology on 25 October 1962. 2 'The Influence of Circumstances on the Use of Christological Terms', J.T.S.

MOULE published in the J.T.S.,1 Dr. John Lowe presented a view which, in some respects, though by no means all, is close to mine. Much more recently—in last year's session—Dr. G. B. Caird read a fascinating paper ('The Linguistics of New Testament Eschatology')2 which he has been kind enough to lend me, and with which my own (though drafted before I had read it) concurs in important respects. To these articles I shall return later. Then, to quote only two others from among the more recent examples, L. Cerfaux speaks of three different 'scenarios' for Paul's eschatology, in 1 Thess., 2 Thess., and 1 Cor. xv;3 and L. van Hartingsveld, writing of Johannine eschatology, says: 'Man wird von jedem Versuch der Systematisierung absehen miissen. Ein einheitliches System gibt es nicht'; and adds: 'Auch das ubrige N.T. kennt ver schiedene eschatologische Begriffe, ohne dass diese systematisch eingeordnet werden.'4 Later, in a footnote, he writes: 'An sich 1st das Fehlen der Apokalyptik kein Argument, das Joh. Evang. und die Joh. Apok. verschiedenen Autoren zuzuschreiben. Wieviel Vorsicht man walten lassen muss, kann man aus den Briefen des Paulus ersehen. Diese haben auch nicht immer die gleiche Thematik und sind unterein ander sehr verschieden. Der Romerbrief und der Brief an Philemon sind nicht vergleichbar. Dennoch stammen sie vom selben Autor.'5 All this already anticipates just the kind of observation that I want now to make; but it is, I think, worth while to reiterate this untidy view of things and to reinvestigate it, if only because attempts continue to be made to give a neat and orderly account of the steady evolution of es chatological thought, and New Testament scholarship is still coloured to a surprising extent by the assumption that such an account can be given. A caricaturish and over-tidy presentation of such an orderly account might run something like this: (i) The earliest understanding of all drew no dividing line between the incarnation and its sequel: Christians were participating in a single, indivisible event—the coming of Christ. (ii) Then quickly came the sense that there had been an interruption, and that an interval was taking place, with the conviction, however, that 1 'An Examination of Attempts to Detect Developments in St.Paul's Theology', J.T.S.J.T.S. xlii (1941), pp. 129 ff. 2 Cf. his article 'On Deciphering the Book of Revelation: III.

(especially p. 271).</page><page sequence="3">INFLUENCE ON ESCHATOLOGICAL TERMS 3 it would be a very brief interval: Christ would return at any minute, and the whole of God's purposes would then be consummated. (iii) As time passed without this happening, compensations were invented or discovered. One was Heilsgeschichte—the incorporation of the interval into a recognizable divine pattern of salvation; another was the recognition of the presence of the Holy Spirit in the Messianic Community, a foretaste and pledge of the consummation and an interim consolation. (iv) Finally, this coming of the Holy Spirit came to be identified, without remainder, with the consummation: it was the return of Christ. Such a view carried with it, no doubt, implications of a more evolution ary and progressive, a less cataclysmic, conception of the final denoue ment itself. I called this outline caricaturish. But in fact it is such only, perhaps, in its simplicity and neatness. One could quote chapter and verse from recent writers—let alone those, like E. F. Scott, of a rather earlier generation—for substantially each of these stages. Dr. J. A. T. Robin son1 holds, if I mistake not, that no. i is really not only the most primi tive Church-view, but also the dominical view; that no. iv, accordingly, represents the profoundest and most dominical way of translating this into the language of the Church's life; and that the rest was brought upon the Church by its inability, as time passed, to resist the temptation to divide the indivisible. Dr. Dodd, in a celebrated essay,2 and else where, has argued for successive changes, at least in emphasis, within Paul's own thinking. Starting from an early emphasis on the im mediacy of the consummation and on judgement for the reprobate, Paul's thought moved through to a revaluation of the natural order— indeed, to universalism. Dr. Dodd throws considerable stress, as we know,3 upon a believed crisis in St. Paul's life, which makes this any thing but an even or a steady evolution; but an evolution it remains, however jerky. Not long afterwards, Dr. Wilfred Knox argued4 for a change, as he put it in his chapter-heading, 'from Omega to Alpha', in Paul's teaching. Under the pressure of Hellenistic influence, and especi ally the Colossian situation, Paul found himself, Knox thought, driven from apocalyptic back to cosmogony: from Christ the Omega to Christ the Alpha. Once again, it is a change precipitated, in part abruptly, by circumstances; but still it is a permanent movement out of one position 1 See, for example, Jesus and His Coming (1957). 2 'The Mind of Paul: Change and Development' in B.J.R.L. xviii. 1 (1934), pp. 69 ff.; reprinted in New Testament Studies (1953). 3 'The Mind of Paul, a Psychological Approach' in B.J.R.L. xvii. 1 (1933), pp. 91 ff. 4 St. Paul and the Church of the Gentiles (1939).</page><page sequence="4">C. F. D. MOULE into another. As for the idea that the Johannine coming of the Paraclete replaces the parousia-hope, that is a commonplace of interpretation. 1 In reaction against the evolutionary view of Pauline thought, the late Dr. John Lowe's paper, already mentioned, maintained that virtually no alteration or development whatever could be established in the eschatology (or, for that matter, the christology) of the Pauline epistles: Galatians may be early, but is without apocalyptic; Philippians is late, yet expects the Lord from heaven. I do not myself hold that there is no case for a progressive sequence of changes in emphasis; but my thesis is that the chief explanation of the variations (which are great) in New Testament eschatological formulation is to be sought not primarily in successive compensations for the delay of the parousia, nor yet in incalculable changes of mood or in the mere hyperbole of a vehement Oriental (to which Dr. Lowe gave a good deal of weight in his paper), nor even in the special charac teristics of oriental thought, so satisfyingly illuminated by Dr. Caird's paper, but in the fact that the New Testament writers—and notably Paul—were content to be torn by a dilemma, and were aware of it in a a way which some of their interpreters refuse to recognize. In all fair ness to Dr. Lowe's paper, this, be it said, is his own last and crowning point. I want to try to show that, both in the Pauline letters and else where, formulations are found which may be both mutually incom patible, and, equally, incapable of being plausibly arranged as successive stages in an evolutionary order of development; and that they are best explained as the result, simply, of the unmanageable dimensions of the Christian verities. These being great beyond expression, all that Paul can do is to nail down or 'peg' first one insight and then another, as need arises, without attempting a coherent, architectonic scheme or a logical series. The 'pegs', if I may pursue the metaphor, were driven in—as, indeed, actually happens with tent-pegs—not in a developing sequence all round, but on opposite and complementary sides, pre ferably simultaneously, or at least alternately. In handling the greatest and most paradoxical convictions of the Christian faith, something like this is bound to happen: we have to drive in the pegs for guy-ropes on opposite sides.2 This, be it observed, 1 Dr. Dodd, for instance, speaks of the Fourth Evangelist's 'reinterpretation, or transmutation, of popular eschatology'; 'the true parusia', he says, 'is to be found in the interchange of divine αγάπη, made possible through Christ's death and resurrection' ... 'It appears . . . that the evangelist had the intention to interpret the event which he is about to record in Chs. xviii-xx—the death and resurrection of Christ—as the eschatological Event in the fullest sense.' The Interpretation Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel (1953), pp. 39s f. 2 In another connexion, Μ. E. Dahl writes admirably: 'The Hebrew asserts</page><page sequence="5">INFLUENCE ON ESCHATOLOGICAL TERMS 5 holds good for western thought quite as much as for oriental. Among the characteristics of oriental thought named by Dr. Caird in the paper I have referred to are two: the use of absolutes, and the putting of these absolutes starkly side by side unreconciled. But, while wholly agree ing, I venture to suggest that the nature of the incarnation forces the same situation, at certain levels, on any formulation, even if it is a westerner's. I expect we all find ourselves questioned by inquirers, from time to time, about the central puzzle—freewill versus pre destination—and about what Christianity teaches concerning heaven and hell. In such cases, I often find myself driven to make two anti thetic, yet complementary, affirmations in quick succession—first, that there is no language even remotely big enough to describe the gravity of our responsibility for free choice, except the language of heaven and hell; and, then, that the love of God is such that I cannot conceive of its being ultimately defeated, or failing to bring everyone in fact to choose heaven by his own free choice in the end: that God's love is such that it could neither be itself if it did not respect a person's freedom of choice, nor yet if a single soul were ultimately left to choose hell. This is what, rightly or wrongly, I understand to be the position of Dr. Robinson's book, In the End, God . . . (1950). Now, in the same way, there are, as we know, within the New Testa ment statements about the last things which it is difficult to fit into a single system; and my point is not only that these are incapable of being built into a single system, but also that they have, intrinsically, no logical sequence or successive order of evolution, but may arrive on the scene at any moment, and in almost any order, whether to 'peg' two opposite ends of a paradox or to defend different aspects of the truth as they chance to come under attack. They are produced (to use Papias' celebrated phrase) προς τάς χρείας, to meet each need as it arises. There are aspects of eschatology which have to be stated and then simply balanced by their opposites or complements. So vast are the purposes of God that the human mind can only adumbrate bits of them as thesis and antithesis, never, in this life, reaching synthesis; and, consequently, it is not surprising if a single thinker is found using antithetic formulations at one and the same period of his own develop both the immanence and transcendence of God and is stubbornly consistent in maintaining this "inconsistency". Over human personality he employs a great number of apparently contradictory expressions and ideas, thereby showing inconsistency. But he is consistent in refusing to allow his ideas of human personality ever to fall into a "consistent", systematic way of conceiving it . . . if we are to understand the Bible, we must look for a number of intuitional in sights which together build up a meaningful pattern, but which discourage systematization.'

Howard's striking citation2 of two of Charles Wesley's hymns—the first containing such phrases as: Never in the whirlwind found, Or where earthquakes rock the place, Still and silent is the sound, The whisper of Thy grace; the second: Come, Thou Conqueror of the nations, Now on Thy white horse appear; Earthquakes, dearths, and desolations Signify Thy Kingdom near. . . . It is true that, in this case, seventeen years divide the two; but they both belong to a single mind, and the one follows the other not in the order of an evolution from a primitive apocalypticism to a mature mysticism, but in the reverse order; and they appear to have been controlled by circumstances rather than by any permanent change of outlook. With this in mind, let me attempt some classification of the variety of formulations demanded of a Christian by various situations. (i) Where personal decision is at issue, there, as we have said, the symbols of the Great Assize and of the alternatives, salvation and damnation, are perhaps the only symbols even remotely big enough to carry the gravity of the situation. Von Dobschiitz was not far off the mark when he wrote (in 1908) :3 'Of course, in His addresses to the people (Jesus) speaks as the missionary; there is the need to be watchful, for the great moment will come shortly, suddenly'; but went on to contrast this with Jesus' language to those who had decided to accept him—'the intimate circle of His followers', where 'there is no anxious self-preparation for judgment to come, but a happy enjoyment of all blessings which God's grace has vouchsafed to them in Jesus'. We do not need to endorse this particular classification or description of the sayings of Jesus to recognize the force of such a distinction. Similarly, van Hartingsveld4 (surely rightly) attributes the language of judgement and resurrection in St. John to the setting of conflict with the Jews, as against a different set of symbols in the discourses with the disciples. If one thus distinguishes between language for the uncommitted and language for the committed, another significant distinction will be between the individual and the collective. 1 Op. cit., p. 180, n. 3. 2 Christianity according to St. John (1943), p. 202. 3 The Eschatology of the Gospels (addresses at the Third International Con gress for the History of Religions, Oxford, 1908, published by Hodder and Stoughton in 1910), p. 20. 4 Op. cit., pp. 168 f.</page><page sequence="7">INFLUENCE ON ΕSCHΑΤΟLOGICAL TERMS 7 Thus, (ii) on the level of the individual, or even of the comparatively small and homogeneous group, it is possible to speak in terms of realized eschatology.1 His choice once made—or in so far as his choice is made—an individual may be said already, here and now, to have passed from death to life, or to have been judged and condemned, as the case may be. Either way, he is 'beyond judgement'; and where there still remains futurity for the individual, the day of death can, in a sense, be substituted for a world-cataclysm or a collective Day of Judgement, as a symbol for the climax of the process. But (iii) it is different for humanity viewed collectively. The more the group overlays the individual, the less appropriate do terms of realized eschatology seem to be, and the less adequate is the aggregate of indi vidual deaths as a symbol of the consummation. Of a believing indi vidual you may say that he has already 'seen the light', 'accepted life', 'passed from death to life', or (judaice) 'accepted the yoke of the King dom'; and, at death, he may even be conceived of as being taken forth with into the immediate presence of God.2 But when the departed individual is viewed in relation to a larger group, he has to be conceived of as 'sleeping' or somehow 'waiting'—as though not yet in the immediate Presence, so that he without us should not be made perfect. And of the group as a whole you can scarcely affirm realization. The group, unless it is exceptionally homogeneous and pure, is bound to be, in some measure, a corpus permixtum, awaiting a unification and purification and consum mation still in the future. The only language appropriate to its destiny is that of futurist eschatology. Wheat and tares must grow together until until until the harvest. Parousia is mostly a collective word, describing the arrival of the King to the city or community, who receive him with mingled joy and fear, according to each individual's condition.3 Strictly speaking, the difference between circumstances (ii) and (iii) is the difference between being fully committed one way or the other, and not be ing committed; but it remains true that, in practice, committal becomes less obvious and more diffused, the larger and looser the group becomes. (iv) Then, yet again, one might distinguish questions about human destiny from questions about the destiny of the whole of creation. About man's destiny it may be possible—just because he is man and 1 I do not say 'it is necessary', for of course there is often a strong note of futurity for individuals (e.g. in parables enjoining alertness). 2 Thorleif Boman, whose essay 'Hebraic and Greek Thought-Forms in the New Testament' contributed to Current Issues in New Testament Interpretation (essays in honour of O. Piper, ed. W. Klassen and G. F. Snyder, S.C.M., 1962), seems to me open to question in some respects, makes this point convincingly (pp. 8 {.). 3 So exactly Chrysostom, Horn, in ascens. (P.G. 1. 450-1, cited by Cerfaux).</page><page sequence="8">C. F. D. MOULE is personal—to speak in terms quite free of apocalyptic. Of man's destiny one may use terms of personal relationship and character—the growing up into mature selfhood, the attainment of a right relationship with God; and, as a means to this end, one may recognize evangelism as an eschatological activity of great significance. But about the future of the entire cosmos, if one speaks at all one must speak not in personal but in the mythical and quasi-physical language of apocalyptic. (v) Or, again, apocalyptic has its value simply in emphasizing the transcendent and the 'vertical', as against the 'horizontal' and merely human. Ultimately, I believe that anthropomorphic language goes deeper into divine mysteries than any other terms, because the fully human is nearer than anything else in our experience to the divine. But nevertheless it may be that the mythical is, in certain circumstances, the only means of emphasizing the 'otherness' of God and his transcendence. It is rather like abstract art in contrast to naturalism—it introduces mystery and transcendence into a scene that may be in danger of be coming earth-bound and photographic. Conversely, when myth and a cataclysmic conception of the End threaten to induce a fatalistic resignation, and when one is in danger of forgetting God's creatorhood and the goodness of the created world and God's redemptive purposes towards it, then it is time to abandon myth and apocalyptic again in favour of moral progress and social development. A recent example of a bid to retrieve the latter values in the teaching of Jesus himself is S. Aalen's treatment of the Theme of the Kingdom in his paper ' "Reign" and "House" in the Kingdom of God'.1 There he maintains that Jesus deliberately abandoned the normal Jewish conception of the 'revealing' of the Kingdom of God as a transcendent manifestation of God's power and glory, in favour of the idea that the Kingdom was not manifested, but simply 'came': 'the Kingdom', he writes, 'is sent into the scene of history, or into the world as the scene of mankind. And history is here, in accordance with O.T. thought, conceived as a linear stream running towards a goal.'2 While impressed by this article, I am not myself fully persuaded by the whole of it; but I cite it simply as an example of an interpretation of the Kingdom in terms which are not apocalyptic. (vi) Viewing the this-worldly and the human from a slightly different angle again, one may say that there are times when the emphasis falls on human responsibility in the working out of God's design. Then it is that the missionary task of the Church (already alluded to) comes into the foreground, and eschatological statements take the form: 'but first must the gospel be preached to all the nations'. A stress on the sudden 1 J.N.T.S. viii. 3 (April 1962), pp. 215 ff. 2 Loc. cit., p. 226.</page><page sequence="9">INFLUENCE ON ESCHATOLOGICAL TERMS 9 ness of the coming and the foreshortening of the time, while logically contradicting this, is primarily a way simply of emphasizing the oppo site or complementary truth of the divine control of the design. (vii) Finally, any distinctively Christian account of God's purposes is bound to take cognizance of two facts: first, that, with the incarnation, a new era has begun; but, secondly, that it has not yet been consum mated; and the language may vary considerably according as the stress falls upon the newness or upon the incompleteness. The distinction here will overlap in part with the distinction from which we began—■ namely, that between the realization for the individual and the futurism for the group. Now I do not pretend that this sevenfold classification of aspects of eschatology or types of eschatological statement is either exhaustive or successful; but I hope it is sufficient to show that different formulations have to be enlisted in the service of different affirmations, all of which may prove to be simultaneous aspects of a single great conviction too large to be expressed coherently or singly. If so, I need not weary you by attempting a complete exemplification from the New Testament of each of these aspects. I propose, instead, merely to recall the existence of examples of a certain number, while selecting only a few special cases to look at in rather more detail. We can easily enough think of a large number of judgement-sayings couched in apocalyptic language from one end of the New Testament to the other. About these we need, at present, do no more than observe that, even within this category, there are different aspects to be detected. The parable of the wheat and the tares speaks, so far as its distinctive element goes, to the problem of the impurity of the Church collectively, and warns against hasty judgement before the time: it is like St. Paul's μη μη προ καιρού τι κρίνοτε (1 Cor. iv. 5)· The twin parable of the dragnet, on the other hand, affirms nothing except that there is a judgement and a separation coming. The story of Dives and Lazarus underlines, for the individual, the irrecoverability of lost opportunity and the transitory character of this life's conditions. Then, over and above the judgement sayings, the parables of growth affirm various further aspects of God's way. I do not, myself, believe that they all say only one thing, namely, that the harvest is here. Each has a different aspect to present. The Kingdom of God is secret but potent; it is alive, with a life that man cannot fabricate for himself. On the other hand, like any living, growing thing, it is, in an extraordinary way, at the mercy of man, to help or hinder. The size and quality of the crop depends in part upon the way in which the message is received and responded to: and so forth.</page><page sequence="10">10 C. F. D. MOULE But, instead of dwelling longer on these sides of New Testament eschatology, perhaps it will be worth while to pause a little over certain less frequently noticed aspects of it in the light of our classification. One is simply this (to reiterate what I have already stated): the 'realized' type of formulation tends to apply to individuals. As I have argued elsewhere,1 the well-known difference between the Gospel and the First Epistle of St. John in respect of eschatology lies precisely here. The realized eschatology of the Gospel is for the individual believer: it is by no means exclusive of futurist language for the group; and when, as in the Epistle, a group is being addressed, the futurism becomes more pronounced. Van Hartingsveld is absolutely right in reminding us that there are futurist-sayings in the Gospel, and I think his observa tion (already alluded to) that they occur in dialogue with antagonistic Jews is significant.2 Conversely, it is, of course, true that, even in the Epistle, there are collectively applied 'realized' statements such as 'we have passed from death into life' (1 John iii. 14). But nevertheless the two tendencies are, I think, distinguishable. Exactly so with Paul. He can speak, on a comparatively individual level, of having died with Christ and even (if we so interpret Rom. vi. 8-11 and if we accept Colossians as Pauline)3 of having been raised with him; but if anyone says that 'the Day' is here (2 Thess. ii. 2), or that the resurrection has taken place already (2 Tim. ii. 18), or—which comes to the same thing— that there is no resurrection such as Paul would recognize, but only a private, individual, spiritual resurrection (1 Cor. xv. 12), that is a a dangerous deceit.4 Similarly, speaking on the individual level, death may mean being with the Lord (Phil. i. 23); but, when the whole Church is in view, then, as I have said, the individual who dies has to be con ceived of as waiting or sleeping, and the being with the Lord is some thing only realized at the end (1 Thess. iv. 13 ff., 2 Thess. ii. 1).s Incidentally, it is the recognition of this kind of duality of expression 1 'The Individualism of the Fourth Gospel' in Nov. Test. v. 2-3 (1962), pp. 171 ff. 2 Op. cit., p. 153. 3 See G. R. Beasley-Murray, Baptism in the New Testament (1962), p. 139. 4 H. Koster has recently argued ('The Purpose of the Polemic of a Pauline Fragment (Phil, iii)' in J.N.T.S. viii. 4 (July 1962), pp. 317 ff.) that the op ponents attacked in Phil, iii were Jewish-Christian missionaries who believed that they already had the eschatological promises in full, including resurrection. If so, this helps, on my showing, to explain the vigorously futurist eschatology of Phil. iii. 20. 5 This, it seems to me, is a more realistic interpretation of the facts than to attempt to attach a particular stage in human destiny to the being συν Χριστώ (as, for example, is done by P.-H. Menoud, Cahiers Theologiques (Neuchatel, 1945) p. 9). Cf. M. Bouttier, En Christ (Paris, 1962), pp. 38 ff., for a useful discussion.</page><page sequence="11">INFLUENCE ON ESCHATOLOGICAL TERMS 11 (as well as linguistic considerations) that disposes me to be still so old fashioned as even to entertain the possibility that ivros in Luke xvii. 21 means 'within', and that the point at issue there is simply the invisible, inward and spiritual character of the kingdom.1 It is, after all, very much like Rom. xiv. 17, 'the Kingdom of God is righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'. Be that as it may, it seems to be particularly noteworthy that not only St. John (as just noted) but also St. Paul demonstrably contains within a single writing both non-apocalyptic and apocalyptic eschatologies. I refer, of course, to the Epistle to the Romans. Whatever may be said of the provenance of Rom. xvi. 20 ('the God of peace will grind Satan under your feet speedily'), at least it will scarcely be doubted that the strongly apocalyptic formulations of Rom. ii. ι ff. and xiii. 11 ff. belong to this epistle. Yet equally integral is Rom. viii; and here a majestic eschatology is unfolded which is essentially non-apocalyptic. I know that in fact the actual words άποκαλυφθήναι and άποκάλυφις do occur (vv. 18 f.); I am well aware also that a cosmic, and not only a human, perspective enters in (vv. 19 ff.). But the values throughout the chapter are personal values and are expressed in terms, not of myth and apocalypse, but of personal relationship—especially sonship. Only at the very end do 'supernatural' terms make their appearance (vv. 38 f.); and then it is only a dramatic way of emphasizing the invincibility of the love of God—the most personal of all his manifestations. It seems to me that the presence of chapter viii side by side with chapters ii and xiii makes it perfectly clear that Paul uses apocalyptic and non-apocalyptic language according to his theme, not according to the stages of his theological development. Very striking also is the fact that, although Ephesians is so elaborate in its demonology, its eschatology is essentially that of Rom. viii: it is in terms of the growing up of the entire people of God into mature personhood. Whether this is Pauline or not, it is, in this particular respect, similar to Rom. viii. Furthermore, the gap of time between ι Cor. xv and 2. Cor. iv-v is, on any calculation, short: yet here, again, one finds, side by side, a fully apocalyptic eschatology (1 Cor. xv, directed, probably, against mystical individualism) and an eschatology of individual growth in character. I am not denying that St. Paul may have undergone some decisive experience between the two. Indeed, 1 See, long ago, von Dobschutz, op. cit., p. 13, n. 1; and Aalen, loc. cit., p. 223, n. 1, has a non-committal note; and now J. A. Baird is arguing in great detail for the meaning 'within' (The Justice of God in the Teaching of Jesus, 1963, pp. 169 ff.). Dr. Caird, in conversation, has pointed out to me that objec tions to eWo's = 'within' still remain, in that Luke—who places his material care fully—follows the verse with apocalyptic material, and in that it is difficult to find a parallel for the generalising use of 'you' demanded by the sense 'within'.</page><page sequence="12">12 C. F. D. MOULE I believe that—if one goes no further—it is at least true that, up to and including 1 Cor., he seems to count on his own survival to the parousia, whereas afterwards there is no evidence that he does so. But I am not sure that the change in 2 Cor. is itself due to this. For 2 Cor. iv-v is, I believe, a profound meditation on the necessity for accepting one's creatureliness. The unspiritual man is the possessive man, who tries to win immortality by clinging to life and behaving as though he were not a mortal. The spiritual man is the one who, accepting his mortality, dares to believe that it is precisely by 'letting go', by detach ment, that he will find—not 'nakedness', but a heavenly clothing. I am well aware that this is a questionable interpretation, and that the passage has recently been put right back into the melting-pot of critical discussion.1 It would take us too far from the main point to attempt a detailed justification of my exegesis now. I will only say that, as I see it, the crucial questions for exegesis are: (i) What is the reason for the 'groaning' in 2 Cor. v. 2, 4? (ii) What is in view in the famous phrase ε'ί ye και ενδνσάμενοι ού γυμνοί εΰρεθησόμεθα (v. 3)? (in) What is meant by the clause beginning εφ' ω ου ... (v. 4) ? I side with those commentators who believe that Paul is not dealing here with the prob lem of death before the parousia: and I believe, instead, that he is, throughout this passage, speaking of the difference between a worldly and vain attempt to cling to the transitory, and the Christian way, which means using up the transitory in the construction of what is enduring. The 'groaning', as in Rom. viii, is due to the natural hatred of parting with the transitory—we groan because vie do not like (R.S.V. 'not that we would . . .' is wrong) the hateful process of 'taking off' comfortable old clothes in exchange for the new and the unknown: we all prefer to put on more clothes on top, like a pullover (εττενδνσασθαι v.v. 3). There are times when the terrifying thought overtakes us, 'Is what we are offered in exchange real at all, or is it a cruel hoax, and shall we be found naked?' But no! (5 .ש), God has created us for precisely this exchanging process: the transitory is meant to be used up and parted with in the good cause of entering upon the permanent, the home from heaven. If this is a fair interpretation of this notoriously controverted passage, here, very near to the apocalyptic of 1 Cor. xv, is an eschatology of individual growth towards maturity, parallel to the non-apocalyptic 1 See, for example, A. Feuillet, 'La Demeure Cileste et la Destinee des Chritiens, Exdgese de II Cor., v, i-io et contribution a l'etude des fondements de l'eschatologie paulinienne', in Recherches de Science Religieuse, xliv (1956), pp. 161 ff., 360 ff.; R.

I have no wish to deny that a crisis occurred in Paul's life between 1 and 2 Cor.; but I do not think that this need be invoked as the explanation of this par ticular change. It is simply a difference of theme. Now, the tension in which all these ideas are held, and by which they may be co-ordinated (though not logically reconciled), is that of the central affirmation of the Christian faith, the incarnation. As I said at the outset, I have no wish to deny that there was change and develop ment in the eschatological thinking of the New Testament. What I have been questioning is the extent of its relevance to much of the formulation of such thought; and I hold that the heart of the problem is not the delay of the parousia but the nature of the incarnation, which, from early to late was an invariable factor. On the Christian estimate, the incarnation of the Word of God marks the opening of the new age, the inauguration of the new covenant. But it does not abolish imper fection, and St. Paul is nothing if not realistic on this score. Schweitzer, through wildly false exegesis of Rom. iii. 25, gravely erred in imagining that, in the eyes of Paul, 'Christ's atoning death has reference only to sins committed in the old condition of existence, that is to say, before baptism';1 and H. J. Schoeps has unhappily followed Schweitzer in this misconception.2 But this seems to me to be blindness to words and tenses. St. Paul himself is perfectly well aware that at present there is sin; the present age is an evil age; at present, we see in a mirror, enigmatically; so far, the Spirit's presence is only a firstfruits and a pledge. Just as Yahweh was married to Israel, but found his spouse unfaithful, so Christ, who loved the Church and made her his bride, has not yet finished freeing her from every spot and wrinkle. The Church is the temple of the Holy Spirit, but still needs cleansing; God lives and walks among his people, but the unclean is yet to be removed. The bride in her perfection, the abode of God in its absolute purity, are a vision of what is yet to be. At present Jesus is reigning as Messiah, but his enemies are not yet all reduced: only when his reign is fully implemented will it become the reign of God.3 And any exegesis which turns a blind eye to the presence of this tension is likely to be unsound. I believe Cullmann is perfectly right in his insistence4 that the develop ment of New Testament theology was conditioned far more by what 1 The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle (Eng. trans., 1931), p. 220. 22 Paul (Eng. trans., 1961), pp. 196 f. 3 There is a superbly clear analysis of this in A.

F. D. MOULE had already happened, the incarnation, than by hopes—expectant or flagging—about the future, or by the delay of the parousia. The constant and really influential factor is the tension between the already and the not yet; and the long and the short of New Testament eschato logy, at almost any period, is the 'Become what you are!'—'thy king dom come, for thine is the kingdom!', 'Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us, therefore let us keep the Feast'. Here I gratefully quote from the closing paragraph of Dr. Lowe's paper: "... the most satisfying reason of all for much of Paul's muta bility, the real justification for his apparent inconsistencies, is the inherently paradoxical character of the Gospel which he preaches. When one's religion proclaims "Become what you already are", it is impossible to avoid falling into verbal contradiction.' The two halves of that proclamation may be momentarily taken apart, so that 'what you are' may at one moment be the dominant thought, and 'become!' at another moment. But there is absolutely no reason why the one should follow the other in any logical evolution. The constant datum is the incarnationand, given this, the rest may be affirmed simultaneously or successively and in either order. The problem—so far as the shaping of theological thought is con cerned—is not primarily the delay of the parousia. So far as I can see, 2 Pet. iii is unique within the New Testament in this respect. 2 Pet. iii contains a considered reply to scoffers who say that things have gone on so long without any sign of the coming that there are obviously no grounds for believing in a coming at all. To this 'time-scale' type of objection it is difficult to find any satisfactory reply in kind. All that can be said, as long as one stays on the same level as the objector, is that God's time-scale is not man's time-scale: and that, alas, is the very lame argument adopted. It is a relief that the New Testament nowhere else adopts it. For elsewhere in the New Testament I can think of nothing like this. There are affirmations that the end will be within that generation (notably Mark xiii. 30),2 or that it will be very soon (Luke xviii. 8; Rom. xiii. 11 ff.; xvi. 20; &amp;c.); there are affirmations that it will not be as soon as some expected (Mark xiii. 7; Luke xix. 11; 2 Thess. ii; ι Cor. xv. 25; &amp;c.); and there are sighs and longings for its hastening (Luke xviii. 7; Rev. vi. 10; &amp;c.). But nowhere, I think, is there evidence that the Church's prolonged existence without its arrival has either altered the programme of expectation or very much changed the shape 1 Cf. Von Dobschutz, op. cit., p. 30; A. Robertson, op. cit., p. 47. 2 I am weary of reading comments which stress the confession, in v. 32, of ignorance of the precise date, but ignore this affirmation of certainty that it will be within that generation.</page><page sequence="15">INFLUENCE ON ESCHATOLOGICAL TERMS 15 of theological thinking. There is a sustained yearning for the coming; there are few signs of a change in the expectations or in the various affirmations affirmations of basic conviction. Most of the passages that may be cited for 'anxiety over the delay' are from outside the New Testament: from non-Christian Judaism, there is Isa. xiii. 22 (LXX); Hab. ii. 3 (with I Q Hab. 7. 7 (Elliger, pp. 191 ff.)); and from Christian documents ι Clem, xxiii. 3 f.; Barn. xix. 5; Hermas, Vis. III. iv. 3; 2 Clem. xi. 2 f.; Tert., depatient. 2. 7.1 P. Minear, in a recent essay,2 seems to have made a very good case for the view that this time-scale type of calculation was utterly remote even from the mind of the author of the Apocalypse, whose viewpoint (if Minear is right) was infinitely more spiritual. The real problem, therefore, is the far profounder problem of a per feet Head united to an imperfect body; and all the incomplete fragments of a solution are concerned with him who is Saviour as well as Judge, who is individual as well as inclusive, and who is the Omega because he is the Alpha.
