<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW VOLUME XLII APRIL, 1949 NUMBER 2 LETTER TO PROFESSOR ARTHUR D. NOCK ON SOME FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS IN THE SCIENCE OF RELIGION MARTIN P. NILSSON LUND UNIVERSITY PREFATORY NOTE. This letter has a lengthy history. More than thirty years ago I felt the necessity of a knowledge of and clearing up of the modes and lines of thought of unlettered people and wrote down a draft of a lecture upon which I have drawn here. Later on I applied my views to a special field, the concept, or to speak more justly the concepts of the soul, in a lecture delivered to the Fifth Congress for the History of Religions at Lund in 1929. Then I put the subject aside, although it always lurked at the back of my mind. Certain recent tendencies in the science of religion caused me to reconsider the prob- lems involved and to write down a draft in order to coSrdinate and to systematize my views in regard to certain fundamental questions of this science. I happened to mention this in a letter to Professor Nock, and, as he wanted to take cognizance of the draft I had made for private purposes, I translated it into English and sent it to him. When he wished to publish it I asked him to subject my draft to the judgment of an expert anthropologist and to let me know his opinion. Professor Kluckhohn of Harvard was kind enough to read my manuscript and to supply some useful remarks and references. As he found my considera- tions useful, I consented to their being printed. I thank these two colleagues warmly for the interest they have taken in them. I am under a heavy debt of gratitude to Mrs. W. L. Sperry for her kindness in undertaking the difficult task of revising my English style in this paper as well as in others which I have published in the Harvard Theological Review. Lund, May 15, 1947 MY DEAR NOCK: I wrote down these considerations, not for publication but for myself, in order to clear up matters, to test old ideas and new opinions and to coardinate them. But as you take an interest in</page><page sequence="2">72 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW them I send them to you for your own edification and, I hope, as an occasion for a stimulating correspondence. In my early days I was intensely interested in primitive religion and anthropology and I wrote a book on primitive religion and another on primitive culture (in Swedish), but in the early twenties I began my ex- tensive work in Greek Religion; (my book on Homer and My- cenae belongs also to this series, for the study of religion drove me to try to fill up the gap between the prehistoric and the historical age of Greece). Thus my reading of anthropological literature has necessarily been limited. Of the work of recent authorities, Pater Schmidt, Malinowski, etc., I know but the outlines. My age would prevent me from a long and exhaustive study, but certain new tendencies among the young scholars of the science of religion in my country have made me reconsider my views. These young scholars would imply that, in the light of more recent research, the work of an older generation is fit only for the wastepaper basket, but this is not true. The putting of the ques- tions, the results achieved, the terminology of an older generation are more enduring than a younger generation is willing to admit. The battle against evolutionism is in part a tilting against wind- mills. There is always a development, always an evolution. That it is lacking among primitive peoples is an illusion due to the fact that we know but a brief space of their existence. Evolution may go in either direction to higher or lower forms, the latter is called degeneration. Take for example Gnosticism which began as a kind of philosophy with a strain of myth and ended in gross mythology and magic. Higher or lower is a value-judgment, sub- jective, the outcome of the individual's own personal viewpoint (which is itself not necessarily devoid of logic). On the whole evolution goes from what are, in regard to formalities and con- cepts, more elementary forms to purer and more complicated forms, just as material evolution does.' It would be strange if spiritual and religious evolution did not show any progress; after all, material evolution and techniques do so. The anti-evolu- tionists cannot deny evolution in religions which are known his- torically without falsifying facts. Perhaps only W. F. Otto does 1 Cf. my review of W. F. Otto, Dionysos, in the German periodical Gnomon, xi. 1935, pp. 177 et seqq.</page><page sequence="3">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 73 that - but the religion which he finds, e.g., in Nonnos is not that which was alive in the age of Nonnos. There may be the seeds of growth, e.g., a mythical clothing of concepts among the earlier Gnostics, but these need to be developed, to be actualized, in order to be of importance. Thus, the range of the anti-evolution- ists is that of primitive religions, the religions of the peoples con- cerning whose history information is lacking. Anti-evolutionism would, however, not have taken so strong a hold, if it did not have some justification. Let us look at the common series: power, taboo, magic, daemons, gods, religion. It is very often taken to be an evolutional series: preanimism, dyna- mism, animatism, animism, polydaemonism, polytheism, mono- theism; that is, it is thought to be an historical evolution. I have long been opposed to this taking of one thing for an- other, to this taking a logical for an historical series, but I think I should still be called an evolutionist. For I acknowledge the logical series, going from lower to higher ideas, but as conceptual, not as historical. The mentioned ideas are found in various stages, in germ perhaps in all stages of the historical evolution. The anti-evolutionist paints the devil black indeed in order to be able to chastise him the better. In the first edition of my Primi- tive Religion (1911) the first chapter in which these ideas were treated bears the title, "Fundamental Psychological Ideas," and as time went on, the difference between the conceptual, logical series and actual development has become still clearer to me. I may only refer to what I say in my Gesch. d. gr. Rel. I p. 34 et seq. Es muss schon von vorneherein Verwahrung eingelegt werden gegen Missbriiuche, die nicht selten mit der vergleichenden Religionswissen- schaft getrieben werden und geeignet sind, sie in Verruf zu bringen. Die vergleichende Erforschung der primitiven Religionen baut nicht wie die vergleichende Mythologie auf einer gemeinsamen Abstammung der Mythen, der Religion und der Sprachen auf sondern auf der Annahme einer gemeinsamen psychischen Veranlagung der ganzen Menschheit. Diese Annahme ist zwar nicht unbestritten, hat aber eine so feste Grundlage in den Tatsachen, dass man vergeblich sucht, sich ihr zu entziehen. Tabugebote und Reinigungsriten, Seelenglaube u.s.w. sind allgemein menschlich. Diese Grundvoraussetzung ist jedoch nur beziiglich der einfachen Hauptelemente gesichert; sobald es zu kom-</page><page sequence="4">74 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW plexeren Gebilden kommt, ist sie nicht mehr giiltig. Es ist unberechtigt, Erscheinungen wie den Totemismus, auch wenn sie bei primitiven V5lkern sehr verbreitet sind, als allgemein giiltig hinzustellen. Vor- schnelle Verallgemeinerungen, welche dieser Wissenschaft besonders geschiidigt haben, miissen vermieden werden. Ahnlich verhiilt es sich, wenn Besonderheiten in einer oder mehreren primitiven Religionen dazu verwendet werden, um besondere Erscheinungen in der griechischen Religion zu erkliren; im Spezialfall versagt die Methode, weil sie nicht darlegen kann, wie es einmal in einem bestimmten geschichtlichen Fall gewesen ist, sondern nur das Verstaindnis im allgemeinen f*rdern und kliren kann. Es sollte nie vergessen werden, dass sie mit einem Zusam- manhang arbeitet, der nicht geschichtlich, sondern psychologisch ist. Damit haingt eine andere irrige Auffassung zusammen, die oft be- gegnet, aber mehr die primitive Religionswissenschaft als solche angeht. Diese Disziplin heisst 'Wissenschaft', nicht 'Geschichte' der primitiven Religionen, denn sie stellt die strukturelle Verwandtschaft der Reli- gionen, nicht ihren geschichtlichen Zusammenhang oder ihre tatsichliche Entwicklung dar, wofiir nicht einmal das Material vorhanden ist. Wenn sie eine Reihenfolge gewisser Begriffe aufstellt, z. B. die Macht, die M~chte, Geisterwesen und Gdtter, oder den Glauben an den wieder- kehrenden Toten und an die Seele, so handelt es sich dabei um ein logisches Nacheinander; dieses wird aber oft mit einer geschichtlichen Aufeinanderfolge verwechselt und man stellt die Sache so hin, als sei der Glaube an die Macht ilter als der Glaube an machterfiillte Wesen. Auf diese Weise wird das logische Nacheinander mit dem geschichtlichen, tats~ichlichen verwechselt. In Wirklichkeit wissen wir z. B. nicht, welche von den beiden erwiihnten Vorstellungen zuerst in einem Menschen aufd~immerte, oder ob sie beide uranfainglich sind; solange wir die Religionen kennen, gehen sie neben einander her. I think this is what is needed. My views were greatly determined by my experience during a fairly extensive work with anthro- pological materials when I wrote my book on Primitive Time- Reckoning. In this field conditions are fairly simple, some simple facts are the basis. The simplest ideas are the same everywhere: determining the time of the day by the position of the sun, the time of the year by the change of the seasons, the rising of the stars, the phases of the moon and their connection with the seasons, the naming of years from events. Evolution varies and is different in certain parts of the world, these do not agree with</page><page sequence="5">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 75 the Kulturkreise. Survivals of primitive time-reckoning are found among all civilized peoples. Associations: More than thirty years ago I asked for some- thing which I called eine primitive Erkenntnisslehre. What I had in mind will appear from the following. This desire seemed to be met by a large work of Levy-Bruhl, La mentalite primitive, but it is not satisfactory. L-B was hampered by his desire &amp; tout prix to say something absolutely new. He is criticized and rightly. My opinion is expressed in the introduction to the French transla- tion of my paper on soul-concepts.2 The faculty of thought in primitive man does not differ essen- tially from that of civilized man, but I cannot agree with the opinion of certain anthropologists that they are absolutely identi- cal; a development from lower to higher forms has taken place. The beginning is the same, but there is a difference like that be- tween the jingling of a musical child and the playing of a virtuoso. Like everything the faculty of thought can and must be exercised and trained, let us say developed. This is the difference. I should say with you that primitive (you say prelogical) mentality is a fairly good description of the mental behavior of most people today except in their technical or consciously intellectual activi- ties. The materials with which the faculty of thought works are supplied by associations. I avoid the common expression 'associa- tion of ideas' because the word 'idea' seems to imply something reasonable, but the associations may be as arbitrary and non- logical as possible. Moreover one of the members is often not an idea but a sense perception (see below). Associations are of central importance for the understanding of primitive mentality and I must dwell upon them, not only with regard to the mentality of savage and barbarous peoples, but also with regard to the like mentality among civilized people (see your dictum). I am not competent and I do not wish to say anything about the philosophi- cal discussion concerning the association of ideas, I take them empirically. The importance which I ascribe to them does not commit me either way as to the assertion that consciousness comes 2 Revue de 1'Histoire et de la Philosophie religieuses, x. 1930, pp. 113 et seqq.</page><page sequence="6">76 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW into being through mental chemistry, nor concerning the great problem of the Gestaltpsychologie. Here something of great importance must be pointed out. Civilized people think chiefly in words, primitive people in imagery. Language is the instrument of thought and some knowl- edge of primitive languages, of their vocabulary as well as of their grammar, is helpful to understand the modes and lines of thought of primitive peoples. Primitive languages are very con- crete and poor in abstract expressions. This is not to be confused with any lack of general representations. I come back to this later on. An association is a coupling of two components. One which calls forth the association can be a sense perception or a repre- sentation in mind, the other which is coupled with the former is a representation in mind or a remembrance. A representation may rise to the level of consciousness without calling forth an associa- tion. Many years ago the name Kirsopp Lake came into my mind and I began to cast about in my mind as to whether it meant a man or a lake. Much later I learned that it was the name of a very well known scholar. We shall see that this is of certain im- portance in regard to the associations. More commonly a repre- sentation is called forth through a sense perception or another representation which is coupled with it. It is superfluous to dwell upon this, but it should be noted that the sense perception or representation which calls forth the association may be subcon- scious. One evening I had laid aside the papers on my writing desk and was staring unthinkingly at the blotting paper, beside which there was a calendar of the month. Suddenly I was aston- ished to find that Professor Wrangel came into my mind. After a while I glanced at the calendar and behold the name Evert - the Christian name of Professor Wrangel. Associations may be as fortuitous and arbitrary as possible and this is the reason why I do not like to add 'of ideas.' Another example throws light on a point which, moreover, is very important in my opinion, the tendency of an association to be repeated and fixed. Long ago when bicycling on a bit of road over which I often go in the summer, a Dutch friend came into my mind. This happened the next time I went over this piece of road and soon I could not go</page><page sequence="7">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 77 there without thinking of van Hille. Later on, when I came there once with a son of mine I told him this. He asked: Do you think of van Hille when you go in the opposite direction too? I did not then but ever since that day I do think of him. Modern philosophers criticize Plato's two categories of associa- tions, similarity and contiguity, i.e., nearness in space or time. Association by contrast can, though with a certain difficulty, be subordinated to these two categories. Philosophers speak of asso- ciation through interest. This may be tested. I begin with a time-honored example. In a place in New Guinea where a mis- sionary lived, an unknown disease broke out which proved devastating as so often happens when a new disease appears among a savage people. The natives imputed it first to a sheep, an animal unknown to them, which the missionary had brought with him, and compelled him to kill it. As the disease did not abate, the natives imputed its continuance to a portrait of Queen Victoria in the missionary's study. The reason why the natives coupled these things with the disease was that they were some- thing new, something unknown to them. To us it seems unreason- able, but the natives acted just as a scientist does who tries to find out the cause of a new phenomenon, he casts about for a new circumstance which may be the cause of it. Under ordinary cir- cumstances, they would have cared neither for the sheep nor the portrait, but the interest, the tension caused by the epidemic, made them cast about for a cause and called forth the association. Professor von Sydow has written a paper on the importance of the unusual in belief and custom.3 He wants to present a new category of associations of ideas which he names phantasy or emotional associations because, he says, there is nothing in itself which leads thought from the one when the other appears. This is correct, but I have stated already that an association can be as fortuitous as it is thinkable. If your mind is intensely occupied with something, it is enough that some other thing should appear, i.e., nearness in space or time, to evoke an association. I take an example of von Sydow's, the pillar pine (a very unusual and remarkable form of the pine tree) at the root of which coins were 'In the Swedish periodical 'Folkminnen och Folktankar,' xiii. 1926, pp. 53 et seqq.</page><page sequence="8">78 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW laid by the sick. When anyone was sick the very striking appear- ance of this tree produced an association with the disease, espe- cially when we take into consideration the known r1le of trees and plants in popular medicine. Others of his examples are quite analogous with that adduced from New Guinea. Interest forms no new category of associations. To use a comparison from chem- istry, it serves as a catalyst which calls forth a process which would otherwise not have appeared. You may also compare it with the technique of electricity and say that interest is the tension the increase of which causes the spark to pass from one pole to another. It is absolutely necessary to have a clear conception of the fortuitousness and arbitrariness of associations, because they are foreign to our logical methods of thought. I shall return to this difference. There is another, little observed form of association which has a certain similarity with the last mentioned, a willed, purposeful association. If you want a Latin term, I may call it a voluntative association. You make a knot in your handkerchief in order to remember something. In Peru this was developed in the quipu. Such aids to the memory are common among primitive peoples. The Pima of Arizona make use of a tally. The year-mark is a deep notch across the stick. The records of early years are memorized, and there are a few minor notches to aid in recalling them. The year-notches are all alike, yet when a narrator is asked to recount the years, he never makes a mistake. Taking the stick in his hand, he would rake his thumb-nail across a year-notch and begin: This notch means that, etc. More on this is to be found in my Primitiv kultur, pp. 197 et seqq., where I pointed to the importance also of such arbitrary associations for primitive art which interprets geometrical patterns as animals and objects. It is enough for a primitive man to have a certain animal in his mind when drawing a line or two or cutting a notch to connect these with a certain animal. Through repetition the associations of a geometrical design with a certain animal or object can be fixed. Similarly primitive people find men, animals, and objects in the constellations. I fear that your psychologist may accuse me of a superannuated associationist psychology. To this I reply as follows: I speak</page><page sequence="9">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 79 solely of the origin of ideas. An idea arises by necessity in a single brain and vanishes with this, if it is not accepted by others. The mode of life, the lines of thought, the interests of a group of men may be so much akin that the same idea is likely to arise in the minds of several men. The same circumstances may cause an idea, proffered by an individual, to be readily accepted by his fellows. This conditions the living on of an idea, i.e., the social group is the necessary condition. An idea is formed and fixed by the social group, and this group is the bearer of the tradition by which an idea lives on. It may also modify the ideas and add new ideas. Thus, social psychology is of paramount importance. It has been objected that associationist psychology refers only to single elements of complex ideas. This is not true. If I see an object belonging to a certain man, this may recall the whole man, his shape, his manners, his actions, etc. To take an extreme in- stance, the anecdote that Newton seeing an apple falling from a tree hit upon the law of gravitation: The falling apple is a com- plex idea, the other component is much more complex, the whole universe. Or, take the example of the sheep and the plague. The sheep is a complex idea and the plague and its consequences also. I may be reproached for generalizing too much, and thought to "make the 'primitive' into a kind of fictitious absolute category," as says Professor Kluckhohn. To this objection I reply: my purpose is to analyze a certain mode of 'thought' which is at the bottom of the minds of unlettered people (savages, barbarians, or peasants of a bygone age), and of which traces are found fre- quently even in educated people of today. I adduce examples from my own experience too. I am fully aware of the variability of the culture of primitive peoples, of the fact that the elements discussed here are developed differently in different peoples. Some hints to this fact will be given in the course of this letter. But after all, there is a common background and my aim was to find out this common background of undeveloped human thought. Property: Before I enter upon the subject which has evoked these considerations, religion, I want to call attention to another region where the importance of associations is especially evident, ideas of the rights of property and their origin among primitive peoples. My son Per commented briefly on this in a juristic</page><page sequence="10">80 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW dissertation,4 but it would be worth while to subject this theme to thorough research. The idea of the right of property has its origin in an association of a certain person or certain persons with a certain object, and the more intimate this association is, the stronger is the idea of the right of property. It concerns every- where in the first line personal belongings which a man always wears and which therefore are associated with him most inti- mately: clothes, weapons, jewelry, etc. This explains a fact which surprised some modern scholars, namely, that primitive people know that literary property, that is to say, songs, magical for- mulas and so forth, belong to the man who uses them and others may not use them without his consent. In my Primitiv kultur, pp. 157 et seqq., where there are further examples, following other scholars, I emphasized the importance of labor for the origin of property, but fundamentally this, too, is an association, the product is associated with the maker, the thing cultivated with the cultivator. So, pots are the property of women as long as pot-making is an industry of women. It need not be said that the owner can transfer his property to another, a garment, a weapon, a pot, a magic formula, etc., in exchange or for payment, thereby annulling the association of the object with himself. Association can be weakened or annulled if the owner does not use an object. I cannot here enlarge upon the consequences of this view as concerning the important idea of the ownership of land or of inheritance, but I may point to a curious fact which is explained by this view, namely, that a fruit bearing tree may belong to the person who planted it, even if the ground is not his 4Per Nilsson-Stjernquist, Om handraickningsutslag, Lund 1946, pp. 38 et seqq. I translate some relevant sentences. Among primitive peoples substantives are wanting that correspond to the words dominium and possessio, right of property or possession. However, genitives or corresponding forms are found everywhere. A person and an object are connected, e.g., by one of them being put in the genitive. The Greenland Eskimoes are cited as an example. According to Professor W. Thalbitzer they lack an abstract concept of the right of property. One observes solely that they conceive of the connection of a person with an object much more intimately than we do. One might say that all possessed objects have a very great affection value for the possessor himself as well as for others. For others the object so to say takes color through its connection with a certain person. Because of this, stealing is a bad action. The affection value of a harpoon which once belonged to a skilled hunter is in a certain measure comparable. The value is inherent in the harpoon even though for a long time it has been used by others. Ceremonies in bargaining or exchange of goods do not occur. This record is very illuminating.</page><page sequence="11">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 81 property. I have myself experienced how tenacious this idea is. Near my summer home was a garden in which a shrub of German elder grew. The birds carried seeds to my land where a few shrubs of this kind grew up. On one occasion the old woman who owned the garden explained to me that these shrubs in reality were her property because the seeds had come from her garden. You have added an exactly similar example from Ireland. A neighbor of Mrs. Sperry's sister claimed that the tiny cyclamens that pros- pered so on the rockery came from her garden and that the rasp- berry canes were hers because they seeded themselves from hers. If an object, e.g., a boat, is made by the common labor of several persons, it is associated with all of them, it is common property. This point of view is especially notable in regard to landed prop- erty; in certain cases it applies to cultivated ground, but here there are various modifications in regard to hunting and grazing lands which appear clearly to belong to a certain tribe or group. On the other hand implements such as traps and bow-weels, placed on the common ground, are the property of an individual, for they are associated with him. The importance of association appears in regard to heredity too. Generally the heirs have helped the man from whom they inherit in his work, at least the heirs are asso- ciated with the man from whom they inherit, the association is, so to speak, contagious. In this letter it is possible only to call at- tention to some simple fundamental facts, not to enlarge upon the modifications which took place as conditions became modified and complicated and when fixed customs were added. It is a subject which ought to be followed up. Elaboration of associations: Something more must be said on two points. One is the elaboration of the materials given by asso- ciations, through logic and experience. Logic is not wholly want- ing among primitive peoples, but it is embryonic, undeveloped; experience is of greater importance. Two issues emphasize the necessity for developing the idea of the elaboration of associa- tions. One is causality which Frazer emphasized when speaking of magic and which is vigorously contested by scholars. I shall come back to this later. I do not wish to discuss the philosophical problem as to whether causality is given a priori or whether Hume's dictum is right: "causation is known as an habitual antecedence</page><page sequence="12">82 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW and as a tendency on our part to look for something definite to come. Apart from this practical meaning it has no significance whatever." The tendency to find a cause, to seek for an ex- planation is innate in man; a testimony is the aetiological myth. I dare say that even animals instinctively know something of cause and effect. If a horse on a warm day takes refuge in the shadow of a tree, it is because it is cooler there. As a matter of fact, the idea of causality arises from an observed sequence of happenings in time. As Hume says, A is followed by B; if A hap- pens, one expects that B also will happen. Because of the lack of logic in associations, this post hoc may be taken as a propter hoc, a mistaken conclusion which is still common. An Australian tribe carries big leaves as umbrellas when it rains and they hear the frogs chant. When they wish for rain during a drought, they carry those umbrellas and imitate the chanting of the frogs. Here is an association of two components, A and B, and the Australian expects, that if one happens, the other will happen too. Experi- ence alone teaches that an association conditioned by causality cannot be reversed; it goes from A to B, but not from B to A. Such an association can, however, be fixed. This is important for magic (see below). An action may be repeated and if the wished for consequence happens fortuitously, belief is strengthened; failure is overlooked. This is still common, or quacks would not have so many followers. The second question is the punctum saliens in Levy-Bruhl, that is his contention that to the primitive mind the part is identical with the whole. A feather is a bird. A man who carries a feather of an eagle on his head is an eagle. Here language must be taken into account. The copula is, which must necessarily be added in our languages, implies to us identity or subsumption: in the latter case the subject is part of a larger group of similar objects, e.g., he is a man. In earlier languages the copula is is often lacking and it is probably lacking in primitive languages. But my knowl- edge of them is too restricted to warrant a general judgment. I can only presume that the copula may be wanting. In this case two words are put at the side of each other, they are stood up against one another, there is a relation between them, but the quality of this relationship is not expressed. Lqvy-Bruhl is guilty</page><page sequence="13">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 83 of an error, according to our linguistic use in interpolating the copula is and concluding from this that the relationship is that of an identity. Association on the ground of similarity can be used for a mistaken conclusion: simile, ergo idem. In this case too the associations are purged through experience and logic. The working up and purging of the associations is a long enduring process which is not ended as yet, but modern man, especially scientists, have or ought to have advanced a bit through training. This is the difference between the mentality of primitive and civilized man, the former may belong to a savage people or to a cultured people. General ideas (Categories): The second point which I hinted at above is closely related to associations, which are fundamental for my views. It is the general ideas and the two form the basis of a chapter in my book on primitive culture, pp. 97 et seqq. Here too I am not competent or willing to discuss the philosophical problems, I simply state their existence. I begin with those which I did not touch upon loc. cit. The words for 'man,' 'woman,' 'warrior,' etc., are general ideas and they are probably present in all languages, but primitive languages are relatively poor in regard to such words. It has often been emphasized how much concreteness and wealth of details the representations or ideas of primitive peoples imply. They are very complex. There is a corresponding scarcity of words expressing general ideas. Thus, there may be many words signifying different species of trees or fish but no generic word for 'tree' or 'fish.' Such a general idea may be said to be a bundle of associations, individuals being asso- ciated on the ground of their similarity. Designations of quality come next to these. There is no language but can express such qualities as 'big,' 'old,' 'weak,' 'strong,' 'dark,' but we must free ourselves from the idea, founded on our grammar, that they are necessarily expressed by adjectives. There are other possibilities. One means is the reduplication which is found in many languages, and with children too. Its basis is emotional. Next we proceed to that expression for general ideas which I treated loc. cit. and called categories. The reduplication may, e.g., in Greek, serve as a grammatical category. Such categories are developed abundantly in many languages, and more, e.g., in</page><page sequence="14">84 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW certain Indian and Bantu languages than in Indo-European lan- guages. Everywhere these categories show a like power of laying hold on the whole language regardless of actual connection, e.g. gender in the Indo-European languages; all words are incor- porated in a gender-category, frequently in contrast to their real gender, even if in fact they have nothing at all to do with sex. Our word classes are actual as well as grammatical categories, but categories exist which are not expressed by linguistic forms, and the means of expression differ, see my remarks on the expres- sion of qualities.5 In this case a category may be called a classifi- cation. Loc. cit., p. 135. I advanced the hypothesis that totemism is such a classification which was not carried through. Two ex- amples: It is told of the Wakallura and related tribes in North Queensland that everything, dead or living, is divided between the two exogamous halves in which the tribes are divided. The Zunis divide all things in the world among the seven regions which cor- respond to the places of the clans in their camp. Classifications seem to be instinctive and appear, especially in language, as cate- gories which cover the whole material of the language and extend even to material which is not pertinent. The result is that general ideas exist, but unconsciously, for primitive languages have not the abstract substantives which we use. They recognize no gram- matical rules but they have such and apply them without excep- tion. Classification is a strand of the same fabric, even if it is not expressed in words. General ideas exist but appear consciously only in the particular cases. Here I ought to work in the chapter on primitive mentality from my book on primitive culture, but I dare to hope that the above lines will give a sufficient idea of my thoughts. Soul-representations: I now turn to the subject which has called forth these considerations, namely religion, and I shall begin with the images of the soul, because the dominant importance of the associations is especially evident in such images. If we wish to think of a deceased person who was dear to us, 'Professor Kluckhohn refers to H. G. Alexander, Linguistic Morphology in relation to Thinking, Journal of Philosophy, xxxiii, 1936, pp. 261 et seqq. His statement, p. 267, that morphology comes nearer to a natural and primitive systematization of the world than does vocabulary, agrees substantially with my view on the so-called categories.</page><page sequence="15">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 85 we customarily turn to his grave, and we speak of the grave as his last resting place, his house, although we know well that his personality, his soul, is not there. I knew a mother who had lost a little child and who, in winter, used to cover its grave with fir- tree boughs, so that, she said, 'the little one might be warm.' The last thoughts which are associated with the dead lead us to those places where their bodily remains have been laid. Such is our experience, and we cannot but expect primitive peoples to have given themselves over even less critically to the influence of asso- ciations, without considering whether these were consistent or agreed with one another. From the earlier palaeolithic period the dead man was laid on a bed of small stones holding a hand axe, which was both weapon and tool. Later, but still in that same distant period, food, weap- ons, ornaments, or colors for painting the body, were placed with him. These things are called 'grave gifts' or 'sacrificial gifts' and are supposed to have been meant to serve the dead as nourishment or equipment. This is the customary, rationalistic explanation; as a matter of fact it is just a matter of associations. The need of nourishment and weapons, fondness for ornament, were associated with the living, and these associations perpetuated themselves in relation to the dead and occasioned the giving of nourishment, weapons and ornaments. This extension to the dead of the associations formerly con- nected with the living - or, more correctly, the failure to sever these associations from the dead - goes, however, very much further. That which is peculiar to the living, in contradistinction to the dead, is self-mobility. It is well known that this also was often attributed to the dead, an idea which still survives in the belief in ghosts. Either the dead man himself or his bodily remains, his skeleton, is thought to move about. On the other hand the dead man was even, in palaeolithic times, buried in the earth, i.e., treated in a different fashion than were the living. This means that people were aware that he was dead, i.e., that the associations connected with the living were no longer applicable to him. People knew, therefore, that the dead man was dead, and treated him accordingly. Above all, it was known that he had lost self-mobility. These two lines of association flatly</page><page sequence="16">86 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW contradict each other, yet run side by side down to the present day. This is characteristic of the double nature of the relation- ship - the ambivalence of the feeling mentioned above. If it was known that the dead man was dead, that meant that the associations connected with him as living had to be severed or cut away from him as dead, and this held, above all, for self- mobility, which was the real distinguishing mark of the living. It is not easy - above all, for the primitive it is quite as impossible - to conceive that self-mobility has simply gone to nothing, as, that the world was created out of nothing, or, indeed, that death is something natural. Self-mobility was naturally conceived of, not as an abstract characteristic, but in its manifestations, as something concrete. Therefore in death it separated itself from the dead man and went on existing somewhere else. That was a matter of observation. It flew up into the sky with the last breath, it flowed away with the blood which streamed from the wound, for, when the blood-stream or the breath ceased, death appeared. Through these associations the soul is identified with life. German scholars have coined the word Lebensseele. As life is as- sociated with various parts of the body, the soul may be found in the breath, in the blood, in the entrails, etc., and consequently German scholars speak of Hauchseele, Blutseele, and generally of Kiirperseelen. However, it is not necessary to look for the vanishing self- mobility in some part of the man's body, or, generally, in some- thing belonging to him; it can legitimately be associated with something outside the man, provided only that it be in such close contact with him as to provide a route for the association. An excellent example of this is provided by the so-called Fanany cult, which is very widespread. The first worm which wiggles out of the disintegrating corpse is protected and given special care, being taken, as it were, for a representative of the dead man. It is something living which has come forth out of the dead man. In a similar way the same association may be attached to any living thing which settles on the corpse or comes near it - an insect, a butterfly, a bird, a snake which crawls out of the grave. These are the 'soul-animals' (Seelentiere), called by many names, which have acquired their significance in exactly the same way as, for</page><page sequence="17">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 87 example, the Hauckseele, i.e., through an association which transferred the self-mobility or the life of the dead man to some external object which in one way or another came into contact with him. But the possibilities of association are far from being exhausted with these examples. I may further refer to some well-known in- stances: the soul may be identified with the shadow, the image and even the name. A man's shadow accompanies him every- where where the sun is shining, has the same outline as he, makes the same motions, in short, is most closely connected with him. No wonder, then, that the shadow is treated as the man's alter ego and that the same associations are attached to it as to the man. It is perfectly reasonable then that the shadow is considered as a sort of soul. The same is true for the portrait, though an actual, individual portrait is so rare among primitives that the 'portrait-soul' never attained full development, the associations attached thereto were not firmly established and therefore have an earlier, looser form. Primitives are notoriously opposed to photography. For the camera, in fact, provides a completely similar portrait, to which are attached the same associations as those connected with the man photographed. This portrait, however, is in the possession of some other person, and the man photographed does not know what may be done with it. He is not master of his alter ego. No wonder, then, that he opposes the taking of a picture. The name is seldom identified with the soul - the word Namensseele is rare - but the name can just as well be considered a soul as can the shadow or the picture. A man's name is a point in which all sorts of associations are bound up, but is, however, invisible. If the name be pronounced, the same associations are called up as those attached to the possessor. Herein lies the well-known significance or power of the name, which equals or, indeed, exceeds the significance of any given part of the body, e.g., the hair, etc. That the name is not customarily reckoned among things which are considered souls is because in this instance the associations are not, as otherwise, attached to something visible. If the word soul be taken in this sense I should not hesitate to identify the soul also with the tomb monument. For the monu-</page><page sequence="18">88 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW ment sometimes appears as the representative of the dead man, and this not, as a matter of fact, because his soul is thought to have taken up residence in it, but because the associations which belong to the one who lies beneath it have been transferred to the monument." In the Greek cult of heroes it sometimes happened that the monument was washed, anointed, or even kissed. And so with this went the fact that the simple, elongated gravestone was developed into a portrait of the dead man, whether only in the form of a herm, with head and genitals, or in that of a rep- resentation incised on the vertical surface of the stone. (This is still clearer with the Aramaeans, where the grave stone was in fact called nefesch, soul.) And so ultimately we come to the grave- statue. Because of the associations deriving from the dead man it is only natural that the tomb monument should be invested with his features. Various scholars have correctly emphasized the great and fundamental difference between the notion of the soul of a dead man and that of the soul of a living one. This distinction holds, also for us today. The popular notion of the human soul as a man's spiritual personality, detached from all bodily attributes, holds, as a matter of fact, only for the living man. As soon as we attempt to imagine the soul of a dead person, we begin to conceive of it as a sort of ghost. Evidences of this are the appearances of ghosts in spiritualistic seances and the theories about materialization and the astral body, which are only make-shift devices for bridg- ing the gap between these two irreconcilable concepts of the soul. This distinction is natural, indeed necessary, if the notions of the soul are to be treated from the point of view here laid down. According to our popular notion of it, the soul works through the organs of the body, and these are in consequence simply disre- garded, a fact which constitutes our real advance over the primi- tive notion by which the soul was attached to the body. In both instances the living body is the point of association. Those same associations which are attached to the living can 6 Cf. B. Schweitzer, Studien zur Entstehung des Portrats bei den Griechen, Akademie der Wiss., Leipzig, Berichte, phil.-hist. Klasse, xci, 1939, fasc. 4, pp. 8 et seqq.</page><page sequence="19">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 89 be carried over to the dead. What then arises is no concept of the soul, but a belief in ghosts, a notion of the revenant of the living corpse. If the dead man is to be conceived of as dead, as not liv- ing, then it necessarily follows that the associations attached to the living are torn loose and cut away from their point of associa- tion. Nevertheless they continue to exist, and have become home- less and seek a new dwelling. This simile is not completely false, but it would doubtless be more nearly correct to say that if a new point of association be provided they likewise attach themselves to it. To indicate where such a point is to be found I need mention only the common concept of the soul, which Germans call Freiseele, classical scholars psyche. It is this Bildseele, appearing in dreams and in hallucinations, which is the most important point of con- nection, although I incline to favor that view which attributes great importance to the picture preserved in memory. The so- called Freiseele is a Bildseele, except for the fact that the image is nothing actually present or visible, but is an image pre- served in memory or seen in dreams and therefore capable of assuming all those associations which attached themselves to the living man. This it does down to the last detail, so comprehen- sively, indeed, that this concept of the soul as a spirit approximates the belief in ghosts to such a degree, that the two are almost fused. On the other hand, the Freiseele, since it is not an actually visible image, is somewhat vague, and is influenced by other concepts of the soul, sometimes even to the point of fusion with them, e.g., with the breath-soul, the animal-soul, etc. A real concept of the soul is missing among the primitives - and also at much higher levels of culture. What exists is a "bundle of associations" which attach themselves to a given point and are thereby made definite, although in actuality loose and kaleido- scopic. Moreover, there exists no single "bundle of associations," but a large number of such "bundles," as there is a large number of points of departure. Pluralistic teaching about the soul is founded in the nature of things, and only our habits of thought make it sur- prising that man should have several 'souls.' For the bundles of associations exist side by side, without being tested for relation-</page><page sequence="20">90 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW ship, agreement or disagreement. Such testing is only a very late development. Of course, they influence and color one another. For example, the Freiseele or the animal-soul is also attributed to living men. More important in this connection than such mutual influence is the fact that, as always happens, the bundles of associations, through repetition and tradition, become fixed, and as it were ossify and petrify. After they have attained a certain fixity, they can be called concepts. The ossification consists in the fact that the fixed concept, disengaged from its point of departure, is treated as an independent and complete entity. Thus, for instance, in the story about the man who sold his shadow to the devil, the shadow is taken from the man. The so-called 'external soul' is a good example of this disengagement and petrification. In conclusion I wish to add one point more. The word 'soul- material' (Seelenstoif), introduced by scholars who have been occupied with the study of the Indonesian peoples, has been very much used and applied by transference to the concepts of other peoples, e.g., the North-American Indians. 'Soul-stuff' is a sort of substance with certain capacities normally attributed to the soul, which permeates not only men but the whole surrounding world. It belongs in the same category as mana. The question is, therefore, not of the Freiseele, but of life-energy, although beliefs are found in which the two concepts are confused. This life-energy is associated with all living creatures and therefore constitutes a general concept of a 'soul-stuff' permeating everything which, however, influences and is influenced by the customary notions of the soul. Power (Mana): In regard to "concepts" of the soul, associations are dominant, a general idea comes in only with the 'soul-stuff,' which is a border-line case, the latter dominates in a fundamental and much-argued problem, the problem of the mana, or, to speak more generally, the "representation" of power, the idea of power, which often, though erroneously, is spoken of as a concept. This idea was emphasized about thirty years ago by some scholars, of whom Marett was one, and in opposition to Tylor's animism it was taken to be the basis of religion. Accordingly this doctrine was called preanimism. In Germany it was called</page><page sequence="21">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 91 animatism, an incorrect term, because this word has another significance to which I shall refer later. The best designation is the word 'dynamism' which goes straight to the core. Some German scholars say orendism, borrowing a word from Indians in North America. In the beginning power was conceived of rather mechanically, later it seems, it was qualified, so that religion colored it, using the contrast of magic and religion, to which I shall refer later. This was especially the view of R. Otto; power became mysterium tremendum, fascinosum, numinosum, some- what like the English word 'awe' which implies reverence as well as fear. Thus the idea of reverence was added which religion needs but which is absent in magic, i.e., the holy. On the other hand, one comes pretty near the ancient hypothesis that religion is founded 6n and has arisen from fear. The idea, or to speak more justly, the concept of power is vigorously criticized nowadays. It is said that the faculty of thought of primitive peoples is too undeveloped to conceive such a concept, and that power emanates always from a person or a spirit, but it is seldom mentioned that there are also examples of power coming from things, not from persons or spirits. This criti- cism is due to misunderstanding. Long ago I pointed out the fact that power appears to consciousness only in separate phenomena or cases, one cannot speak of a concept of power. Two things have contributed to lead the discussion astray. The first is that the word by which power is usually designated, mana, is borrowed from a people and a language, in which the idea of power has undergone a special development, further, that mana, like power, in our language is an abstract substantive. It would be better and more correct to designate power by an adjective, for power is a quality such as 'big,' 'strong,' 'weak,' 'old,' etc., which even primitive languages can express. The Dakota word wakanda, translated as 'Great Spirit,' means simply 'mystery' or 'mysterious' and signi- fies a quality rather than a definite entity. Among many tribes the sun is wakanda, among the same tribes the moon is wakanda, and so are thunder, lightning, the stars, the winds, various animals, trees, and inanimate objects or places of a striking character: even a man, especially a medicine man, may be considered as wakanda.7 7 R. Karsten, The Origin of Religion, p. 191i, with references.</page><page sequence="22">92 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW This quality has been said to be supernatural, but it has been justly remarked that to primitive peoples there is no difference between that which depends on natural causes and that which depends on supernatural causes, such as there is to us. They do not realize that that which depends on supernatural causes is not explainable according to natural causes, but they have a sense of order, of what is to be expected to happen, a sense which is ab- solutely necessary for the simplest practical ends, for life. Thus, one may use the word 'supernormal,' for all feel the difference between the usual and the unusual. If one clearly understands that power is an unconscious general idea of the same kind as those ideas which we express through adjectives such as 'big,' etc., the objections already noted appear to be without value, depend- ing on misunderstanding. This criticism evokes the same mistake, as if any one were to assert that primitive languages lack gram- matical rules simply because primitive peoples are not conscious of rules, have no grammar. Unconsciously they apply the rules of their language without mistake. The discussion has gone astray because power is often thought to be mechanical on the analogy of our idea of natural forces. The idea of power is extremely emotional, because it is called forth by some unusual phenomenon which strikes the mind and stirs up emotions. This is the reason for the opinion which makes power a mysterium tremendum et fascinosum, and finally holy. Power appears as a conscious general concept only in an ad- vanced stage of development. Space forbids discussion of this development among Polynesians and Indians, and such a discus- sion is not absolutely necessary for these considerations. We must now consider the way in which power appears, the individual phenomena. Analogies with our ideas of natural power have a large place and play their part in leading the discussion astray. The comparison with electricity, which passes from one object to another, with which it comes in contact is common. So the analogy of infection by contact is common. But these analogies are not good because they introduce ideas unknown to primitive mentality. If one wishes to grasp the question aright, one has to remember that in this case too, associations are at work. If a man is especially lucky in war, in the chase, in fishing, this faculty</page><page sequence="23">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 93 is associated not only with the man but also with the weapon or the implement.8 Power may be associated with an object because this object attracts attention to itself by a special appearance. It is related in Melanesia that a stofie concerning which such an idea has been conceived is laid at the root of a tree that it may grow better and bear fruit. And then there is the great mass of amulets which are still not obsolete, i.e., mascots. Fetishism: Fetishism is explained by such circumstances as these. Whatever an object is it may become a fetish, if attention is directed to it by some fortuitous happening, so that one believes that it is endowed with power. It happens that it is thrown away if its power fails. Negroes in western Africa have medicine bags which contain various things, but these must be connected with important happenings or taken from strong and wild animals or famous men, i.e., power is associated with them. The medicine bags of the Indian are of a like kind. But a ceremony is added, a consecration and a sacrifice, for the religion of the negroes is not the most elementary kind. They have also fetishes in human form, but the power is not invested in the figure but in a kind of red clay with which the figure is smeared, without this it is of no value. Taboo: Marett wrote a paper on the tabu-mana formula as a minimum definition of Religion.' It is a program directed against animism, and in his book The Threshold of Religion he discusses the question of whether taboo is negative magic. He denies Frazer's opinion, to which I formerly adhered that taboo depends on a conscious averting of power. My comparison with electricity is erroneous and lends color to such a view. The basic element is the feeling of something in power which Marett calls 'mysterious'; instead of this word which admits various meanings I should say strong emotional feelings raised by the supernormal, the unusual, the unexpected, but in certain circumstances reverence too is raised. Fear awakens the impulse to be on one's guard, reverence that of keeping distance. When these feelings, associated with the manifestations of power, bring about actions and become fixed, 8 Examples in Marett, The Threshold of Religion, pp. 12o et seqq., and above, p. 8o, n. 4. ' Archiv fiir Religionswissenschaft, xii, 1909, pp. 186 et seqq.</page><page sequence="24">94 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW a taboo rule is there. If something similar to a concept of power has been developed, e.g., among the Polynesians, the taboo rules appear as negative magic, and the idea may arise that power can be restored to the man who has lost it. Because taboo is an inter- diction it achieves a very great social importance and is supported by social injunctions, common opinion, punishments, and what is extremely effective, fear of infringement. Thus, is created that outgrowth of taboos so often and vividly described. The second metaphor through which the transference of power is visualized, that is, infection, corresponds better to a primitive stage. For infection can be thought of concretely as a soiling. If one comes into contact with a person or an object which is en- dowed with power, something of this quality adheres to the one who comes into contact with him or it, just as dirt adheres to the one who comes into contact with something dirty. It is an asso- ciation depending on a fact. It is possible to wash or to scrape off dirt, to suck snake poison from the bite, or if some poison has entered the body a purgative may be used. The same methods are, of course, used to get rid of that which possesses a noxious power, diseases, pollution, etc. Diseases and infection by power are treated by the same means. Purifications take a large place in all religions. Magic: The next hotly debated question is magic, i.e., Frazer's theory and the criticism of it.'o In very broad outlines the doc- trine of Frazer is that magic differs essentially from religion. Magic is primitive natural science founded on mechanical caus- ality, while religion looks to a deity who can say yes or no. Magical acts operate according to associations, and consequently magic is homeopathic or sympathetic. Others have continued this reasoning and said that magic is the first stage and religion is a higher, subsequent stage of evolution. This construction is weak and was soon subjected to a serious criticism by Marett."1 Younger scholars pass it over because they oppose Marett on other points. It is not possible to state a difference between magic and religion SoI refer to the lucid exposition by Dr. Westermarck, Ritual and Belief in Morocco, vol. I, pp. 37 et seqq. Agreeing theoretically with Sir James Frazer he emphasizes the 'mysterious,' the supernatural as the common element of religion and magic. ' From Spell to Prayer, The Threshold of Religion, pp. 33 et seqq.</page><page sequence="25">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 95 in the earliest stage as Frazer does nor between magical and reli- gious acts. The latter too make use of the supernormal power which is the basis of both. Frazer's comparison with natural science and his reference to mechanical causality is especially contestable, in fact extravagant. Even so one should not overlook the fact that it comes near a truth, the difference between the living and the dead - compare what was said concerning interment - observed even by animals. A horse takes fright easily at a moving object, much less at an object at rest. Acts are determined by this dif- ference. I read some years ago a short article by the Swedish journalist Erik Lindorm with the title, "The machine ennobles." It hits the mark. If the horse is not able to pull the cart, the driver swears and whips the horse in order to force him to use the last ounce of his strength. If the auto stops, the chauffeur mumbles an oath perhaps, but he does not whip the machine, he gets out to examine and mend the defect. Primitive people make the same difference, but it is confused by ambivalence, an impor- tant factor, to which I shall come back. There is further confu- sion from the fact that it is possible to treat a living being, a man, as a thing without a will, as dead, i.e., to use coercion against it. Theoretically this is the fundamental difference between magic and religion. Magic tries to attain its purpose by coercion, sub- duing the will, if there is any, in primitive peoples often through a very effective suggestion. Religion tries to attain it by benevo- lence, grace, free will. It happens also in higher religions, e.g., in Greece, that people threaten and try to coerce the gods; primi- tive people do so, if they have gods or similar beings. Marett advanced the opinion that magic is a projection of the will in acts and words. I begin with an example which is similar to that adduced by him, the bull which gores the coat. I have heard that a certain farmer, when he became angry, took his cap from his head, threw it on the ground, stamped on it, and swore. This is an elementary outburst of wrath, not even of will. It is not rudimentary magic. Something must be added to make magic of it, and this must be implied in the word which the criticism of Marett's view adds, a wish, for a wish implies a purpose, and only when a purpose exists is it possible to speak of magic, even if only rudimentary. This wish, this purpose, implies that the</page><page sequence="26">96 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW act is often accompanied by words. Acts and words go together even in an elementary outburst of anger, how much the more, if a definite purpose is present in the mind. Magic is at least directed emotion, the adjective implies the essential difference, and Marett erred because he did not observe this. When magic attains to fixed forms, magic formulas are created and texts are borrowed from myths and cults. Marett's criticism is further directed against Frazer's division of magic into homeopathic and sympathetic magic according to associations, because of similarity and conti- guity in space or time. To begin we must state that a magic exists which imitates an action of daily life producing a certain effect; the difference is that in magic this effect is produced in a supernormal way. An example is the Australian arungaquiltha, a spear which is directed against the man who is to be killed, whatsoever the distance is, further words are added expressing the purpose.12 Such a magic depends on an association only insofar as the magical act imitates a common act, and this is not what an association means in this connection. In most cases, however, and especially in de- veloped magic Frazer is right, and so much so that it is super- fluous to adduce examples. The objection that, e.g., a warrior who wants to destroy an enemy by magical means bores through a bulb which does not resemble a man, or that the dolls which are used in magical arts have no resemblance whatever to the man who is to be destroyed, is a misunderstanding. Here the above- mentioned voluntative association enters; it associates arbitrary things with that which is in one's mind. Cf. the Malay formula: it is not wax I scorch, it is the liver, the heart, and the spleen of N. N. I scorch. That incantations and songs are added is no objection to the importance of associations. Such formulas and songs, derived from myth or religion, belong to a fairly advanced stage of magic, their purpose is to awaken and to strengthen the supernormal power. Their connection with the special occasion upon which they are used is often no more than loose. Mantics: (i.e. Mantic procedures). I come now to mantics which are very important in early religions. There is no reason here to enter upon certain psychopathic states of mind which are very important for the science of religion and for mantics: sor- 12 Cf. lonka-lonka, Marett, loc. cit., p. 75.</page><page sequence="27">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 97 cerers, Pythia, etc. Nor is there any reason to speak of dreams foreboding the future. I note only that primitive people do not know the difference between dream and reality as clearly as we do. I do not know how dreams are interpreted by primitive peoples, I do know from ancient Greece that there they are inter- preted by the aid of analogies, i.e., associations, sometimes of contrast. They may be rather far-fetched. I wish to direct attention to omina, fortuitous signs and other oracles of such a kind. My opinion derives from something which happened when I was a school boy. One morning when I was on my way to the school I walked at the side of a cart. During morning prayer I played the fool which was observed by a teacher and resulted in a warning from the rector. It was a long time before I could again walk beside a cart, so that I went either faster or slower in order to escape the cart. This was not only a disagreeable recollection but also a feeling that something evil could happen, if by any chance I ran alongside of a cart. In this case two things were associated absolutely fortuitously through the unpleasant event which followed the coincidence. I think that a lot of omina have come into being in this manner, through fortuitous association, e.g., bird omina, encounters with certain persons, a word heard in passing, something happening when the mind was filled with thoughts on something imminent, which, consequently, was associated with the former.13 Other omina are of another kind. The heavenly phenomena, eclipses, etc., loom largely as omina. Here emotion is still stronger, one fears that such an unusual sign might be followed by misfortune. The inter- pretation is secondary. Signs from sacrifices are somewhat dif- ferent. That which is offered to the gods must be blameless; it is forbidden to sacrifice crippled animals. If it appears that the interior organs of the sacrificed animal are abnormal in some respect, this arouses scruples and is interpreted as a sign of the anger of the gods and of imminent bad events. Such signs were elaborated into an extensive doctrine, Greek inspection of vic- tims and Babylonian and Etruscan inspection of livers. The de- velopment of mantics was fostered because it was in the hands of specialists. Some oracle methods make use of arbitrary associa- 13 Cf. my Gesch. d. gr. Rel., I, p. 153.</page><page sequence="28">98 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW tions. Pegs are thrown and their situation noted. Dice are thrown and the result interpreted according to some system. A Greek papyrus has, e.g., a list of Homeric verses preceded by figures indicating the casts of three dice. The Lappish noids used a drum on whose cover images are depicted, referring to the life and inter- ests of the people. On the cover a ring is laid which is moved when the noid beats his drum, and the oracles are given by the images which the ring touches when moving. The kind of mantics treated until now depends on an arbitrary linking up of two events which are near to each other in time, a linking up effectu- ated by emotion and the tension of interest. This linking up can be broken. Starting from their idea of inevitable fate modern scholars find this unreasonable, for a future event which is predicted must happen. But if we have a clear understanding of the nature of omina as described above, it appears that the linking up may be broken. I avoided walking at the side of a cart in order to avoid unpleasant events, a student friend of mine turned and went back if a cat crossed the street before him. In antiquity a sign, an omen, a prediction was often valid only if it was accepted: omen accipio, see, e.g., Hdt, I, 62: it could be rejected, Hdt, V, 56. This circumstance has contributed to an opinion equating omina and predictions with magic.'4 An omen works with magical power, it is said, so that the predicted future event happens because of the prediction. It is evidently superfluous to appeal to the supernormal power in this case for the interpretation, the mentioned linking up depending on a for- tuitous association, and the possibility of breaking it are sufficient for our understanding. The same idea is relevant in regard to those predictions which are formed by sorcerers and prophets. A prediction is not only a statement that a certain event will hap- pen, but a powerful word which determines the future; prediction comes near a curse. The sorcerer prophesies by virtue of the mana by which he is filled. He is inspired by a god or a daemon, he is in a state of ecstasy. But here we touch upon psychopatho- logical states of mind which do not belong to the kind of magic which is treated here. Such a prophecy comes near a curse and it is known how strongly a curse can impress the mind of the cursed " Cf. my Gesch. d. gr. Rel., I, pp. 152 et seqq.</page><page sequence="29">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 99 man; it happens that the curse is fulfilled through its psychologi- cal effect. Read what Westermarck tells about the Moroccan custom of laying 'dr upon someone. The supernormal power is working because of emotionality and suggestibility. A prophecy may produce the like emotional and suggestive effect, but this is in reality not a part of mantics. The kind of mantics treated here is fully explained through fortuitous, arbitrary associations which depend on interest. Ambivalence: That ambivalence of representations mentioned above is very important to a right understanding of primitive mentality. I do not mean the tension between opposite feelings and representations of which psychology speaks, but simply the fact that man is compartmentalized; sometimes he attributes something to one compartment of his mind, sometimes to another. The dead body may be considered to be dead stuff and be re- moved, it may also be considered to be living in a certain sense, if the associations with the functions of life are not cut off. An animal may be considered to be an animal to be hunted or a nox- ious animal which must be killed, but also as endowed with super- normal power. A tree may be treated as dead stuff, hewn down, used for fuel or timber, etc., but it may also be thought that it is endowed with power, and respect and cult may be devoted to it. A stone may become a fetish or an amulet, if through some chance a belief arises that it is endowed with power, respect and cult may be devoted to it. Primitive man is subject to the changing feelings of the moment. His ideas oscillate between two poles, one may say, one negative and another positive. One is represented by the common, dead stuff, the other by the living, that which is filled with power, supernormal power. His ideas are attracted to the latter pole by this emotion, which arises from the feeling of life and power. Only logic removes ambivalence and how difficult this is is proved by the common cult of images in higher religions. The idea of the god and his power is associated with his image, and it is very difficult to cut off this association. Animatism, Personification: Personification is a word not very much used in the science of religion nowadays. It has got into bad repute because the personifications of abstract qualities, e.g., Justitia, Virtus, Fama, especially come into one's mind, in fact</page><page sequence="30">100 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the word implies a much wider sense. Aphrodite is not much more than a personification of sex appeal and sex action, Ares of war- madness and the turmoil of fighting. This is the case too concern- ing the Greek gods of nature. Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, thrower of the lightning, sender of the rain, is in this respect a personifi- cation of atmospheric phenomena; Artemis of the free life of nature, Demeter of the crops and the corn, etc. But these are gods of a highly developed religion with which we are not con- cerned here. Here, our interest is the soil basis from which per- sonification springs or, if you like, an embryonic personification, which consists in the fact that man ascribes will and feeling to dead things and seeks for the origin of certain phenomena in will and feeling. This is called animatism, a soul is ascribed to dead things. This is a mistaken application of that which is the basis of man's ability to understand others, namely that he conceives of them according to analogy with himself. The error is that here ambivalence enters the picture, under the influence of an emotion man does not distinguish between that which is living or dead. There is no need to speak of animals. Primitive man did not distinguish clearly and essentially as civilized man does between the 'soul-less' animal and man. I take the time-honored standard example of the child who hurts himself against a chair and who gets angry, and beats the chair. This does not by any means imply any conscious reasoning, the thing is simply that the child in its anger treats the chair as it would treat a playmate who had hurt it, but it is also evident that such an act implies the attitude which is called animatism: the dead thing is treated, though un- consciously and under the influence of an emotion, in the same manner as a living being. But there is no need of any emotion producing such confusion, for confusion it is from our point of view. A child of four years said of a brook bubbling between stones: see, how the brook wrinkles and frowns! The same boy sat at the breakfast table, the sun shone on the cloth, suddenly the sun vanished, covered by a cloud. He said: now the sun went home to have breakfast. Soon the sun came back and the boy said: Now the sun has put on nice clothes, now it comes back. Such examples show that Max Miiller's disease of language is not so far from reality as is some-</page><page sequence="31">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 101 times said, i.e., his thesis that nature myths originate from meta- phors which were mistaken for real. Primitive languages are known to be very concrete. Primitive peoples are compelled, if need arises, to deduce from their concrete expressions means of expression for such notions as cannot be seen or felt. Personifica- tion may sometimes have arisen in the manner indicated by Max Miiller, though he immensely exaggerated its importance. We come back to animatism, the idea man has under certain circumstances, that dead things, like himself, are endowed with feeling and will, and we add, moreover, endowed with supernormal power. The real difficulty is to understand how personification could originate from animatism. It is hardly sufficient to say that man has an innate propensity to represent to himself any- thing that feels or wills as of a living being. In regard to animals it is simple, for they are living, feeling, and have a will, and primitive man makes no essential distinction between man and animal. It was sometimes possible to ascribe supernormal power to animals. If one wished to draw on this, one had to turn to the animal, but one reached the animal only as something to be hunted and the chase is another thing. Hunting tribes perform, however, elaborate ceremonies with the killed animal. Other primitive peoples, e.g., the Australians, make an image of the ani- mal. In this way a cult of animals may arise without any neces- sity to insert totemism as an intermediate link. Greek gods have many traces of theriomorphism, though survivals of totemism are absent in Greece, and the Egyptian gods with their bodies and heads of animals certainly do not originate from totemism. Thus the question of the origin of personification and especially of anthropomorphism arises. Why have the powers, endowed with will and feeling, which dwell in stones, trees, rivers, which send diseases, etc., been conceived of in human shape? There are ani- mal shapes too, and mixed shapes. One is not quite content with the general propensity of man to anthropomorphize will and feeling. It is perhaps permissible to advance a guess, for it is no more. I refer to the beings which appear in the belief in the so- called High Gods, which I discuss later. If an answer is wanted to the question as to how the world was made such as it is, or how customs and ceremonies originated, the most simple answer</page><page sequence="32">102 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW is to say that a man made this in olden times. Just as a man makes an implement or builds a cabin, so has this man made the world and all that is in it, he has invented customs and ceremonies; in this he is similar to the 'religious formulator' of Radin. These figures are anthropomorphic as well as theriomorphic, e.g., the thunder-bird and the muskrat which created the world according to some Indians. My guess is that the anthropomorphic form of these figures may have contributed to creating the belief that the beings, endowed with will and power, which dwell in trees, stones, which send diseases, etc., have an anthropomorphic or theriomor- phic shape. The above mentioned beings, the so-called High Gods, occur chiefly among peoples on a low level of culture; I do not remember having encountered beings similar to nymphs, daemons, etc., among the Australians or even among the Indians. In fact anthropomorphism is not general, it is proper to certain peoples. Animatism is the fundamental stuff of which religion is created, insofar as you understand religion as applying to a higher, say a supernormal, power which is endowed with feeling and free will. The High God: Le dernier cri in the science of religion is the belief in the High God. The idea is fairly old, it was advanced fifty years ago by Andrew Lang, whose scientific importance was not sufficiently appreciated, even by his compatriots, because his interests were exceptionally wide and he was a fascinating writer. His idea at that time met only with criticism, because animism and soon preanimism were dominant. It was, however, not forgot- ten and was taken up by Pettazzoni in an important book. He tried to show that the High God was a god of the heavens. It became much more famous through the extensive work of the learned Father Schmidt. He starts from the hypothesis of Kul- turkreise and he tries to prove that the peoples on the lowest level of civilization, Urkulturvijlker, pygmies and pygmoids, precisely know the belief in the High God. The hypothesis of Kulturkreise is a brittle construction. Further one may ask whether the cul- tural poverty of these peoples is original or perhaps due to im- poverishment. That the African pygmies have not a special lan- guage but speak the languages of the surrounding negro tribes proves in any case their dependency on others. Father Schmidt</page><page sequence="33">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 103 himself says: there is also a simplicity which depends on im- poverishment and decay, but he adds cautiously: consequently this is later than that more perfect one which preceded it.15 The cult which Father Schmidt ascribes to the High God, the so-called first fruit sacrifice, seems doubtful, because it is nowhere said that the sacrifice is brought to the High God: I cannot but think that Father Schmidt would have adduced this, were it anywhere to be found. Although certain of his followers abandon the hypothesis of the Kulturkreise they proceed further including the High Gods of the old culture peoples in the discussion. Thus they construe an all-embracing High God, a god of the heavens, of the weather, lightning, and thunder, a sungod, creator of the world, god of fertility, bisexual, guardian of morals, punisher of wrong-doing, Lord of Fate, omniscient, omnipresent, almighty, eternal. It is asserted that the gods of polytheism originated by the splitting off of certain of the High God's functions. This opinion resembles that which was popular among certain German scholars fifty years ago, namely, the so-called hypostases; lesser gods originated from greater gods by the splitting off of certain of their functions. Research has proved later that the procedure, generally speaking, was the inverse one. Turning to the mentioned complex of the functions and qualities of the High God it is first to be noted that certain words in reference to an earlier time and stage have not the significance which they imply to us. An idea of eternity such as ours is highly developed. In Homer still the gods are neither omniscient nor present everywhere. They know that which is necessary under the given circumstances, but no more, many things are concealed from them. They appear if needed, but they are not almighty in our sense of the word, they are merely mightier than man. Fate, in our sense of something that is de- termined previously and inevitably, is a late achievement of thought.'6 The gods send events, destinies, not the coherent series of Fate. It is not permissible to confuse beliefs of primitive Religionen hos urkulturens folk, p. 98. 1 The fatalism of Homer is something different which I treated in my Gesch. d. gr. Rel., I, pp. 338 et seqq., and so too the Babylonian tables of Fate in the New Years festival are a product of astrological belief.</page><page sequence="34">104 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW peoples with modern ideas. In regard to the punishment of wrongdoing it is often said that the being from whom originated the customs of the tribe keeps watch over and punishes trespassers, just as a man, a father or a chief, who sees that his injunctions are not obeyed, punishes trespassers. This being seldom punishes himself, but punishment is administered through social means and it is sometimes brought about through the strong suggesti- bility, e.g., if a taboo is disobeyed. The god of the heavens gives fertility because he gives rain, but fertility depends on many other circumstances, and in fact this function is not very apparent in the High God. If all these functions and qualities which are borrowed from higher religions are removed, and if we keep to the High God such as we find him among peoples on a low cul- tural level, generally speaking, two functions remain, the creator and the god of the heavens. The creator, 'the maker,' was under- stood rightly by S6derblom. He is, so to speak, a mythological, more correctly, an aetiological, god, and because of this he is a deus otiosus. He does not always appear in human shape but very often in the shape of an animal too. In regard to the former I quote Andrew Lang: "7 "As soon as a man had the idea of 'mak- ing' things, he might conjecture as to a Maker of things which he himself had not made and could not make. He would regard this unknown Master as a 'magnified non-natural man.' . . . This conception of a magnified non-natural man, who is a Maker, being given, his Power would be recognized, and fancy would clothe one who had made such useful things with certain other moral attributes, such as Fatherhood, goodness and regard for the ethics of his children, these ethics having been developed naturally in the evolution of social life. In all this there is nothing 'mystical,' nor anything, as far as I can see, beyond the limited mental powers of any beings that deserve to be called human." In regard to the word 'father' which arouses certain religious ideas in us, we must remember that the word which we translate by 'father' in languages which do not know of relative designa- tions of kinship, applies to every man of the age-class of the father, it signifies a man of a certain advanced age generally. One may have a certain reverence for a man of this age, not 17 In the preface to the second edition of his Making of Religion, p. x.</page><page sequence="35">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 105 more. A similar reasoning applies to the god of the heavens. Concerning the sun and the moon primitive peoples have the same idea as the boy who said that the sun has gone home to have its breakfast. There are many myths of this kind, e.g., among the Australians, Eskimos, etc. Who hurls the thunderbolt? Who lets the rain stream down? It may be a man or an animal such as the thunder-bird of the Indians. This is the most simple reply, but one may also form cosmological myths. The High God as he appears in the Uppsala school is of a piece with Hooke's 'ritual pattern' which plays so great a r61le in its divine kingship ideology. The ritual pattern is found whole no- where, it is pieced together from parts, found at various places, because they enter into a logically coherent connection. The pattern is in fact always found 'disintegrated.' The ritual pattern is consequently a logical construction whose existence is not proved in the world of realities. In the like way the functions and qualities of the High God are pieced together from various sides; even among a people on such a high cultural level as the Greeks some function is absent: Zeus did not create the world. The splitting off of certain functions and qualities of the High God, from which the polytheistic gods are said to originate, is in fact a disintegration. In this case too a pattern is constructed which is not found anywhere and the existence of which is not proved and impossible to prove. That fervid adherent of the High God Belief, Professor Widen- gren, is, in his construction of the High God, guilty of the same logical error which he criticizes severely in his discussion of the mana. He generalizes ideas which need not have any connection and do not have it. I know quite well that my limited knowledge of primary facts is not sufficient for a thoroughgoing criticism. To achieve this one would need a long life such as that of Father Schmidt and not the little which remains to me and which I must use in the problems which concern me more intimately. But I was compelled to clear up my own thoughts on the basis of such knowledge as I have. I know quite well that these con- siderations will be anathematized as a superannuated evolution- ism. Widengren's last book has the title Religionens ursprung (The Origin of Religion) and preaches the belief in the High</page><page sequence="36">106 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW God. Consequently this is the origin of religion. But the question how this belief was created in man's mind cannot be put to one side. The ineradicable desire of man to trace the reason for every- thing cannot be suppressed - e pur se muove. If this question is rejected the only consequent and logical standpoint is the Urofenbarung of Father Schmidt. God revealed himself to man. During my long life I have seen so many theories of the sci- ence of religion accepted as a solution of the problems, dominate and even dominate tyrannically, contested, and brought down to their proper proportions, that I have learned the necessity of criticising le dernier cri too. I am not inclined to fall down and pay respect exclusively to the idols of the day. Only the poor ruins are left of the proud chateau of nature mythology, animism was ousted by preanimism, the claims of totemism to unlock all locks were shown to be an illusion, the mechanical causality of the doctrine of power and of magic was rejected and the impor- tance of emotion emphasized. However, if one is not the prisoner of preconceived opinions, one must acknowledge, justly, that none of these idols of a day has been vain. All of them have taught us to understand better the problem of religion and its origin, after criticism has reduced them to their true importance. This is true too in regard to the belief in the High God. It was put in the shadow by other dominating opinions and was pushed to one side. It does not give the answer to the last question, if one does not trust in the Urofenbarung, but it renders an impor- tant contribution to the understanding of religous development, I purposely use the anathematized word evolution. We have to distinguish the two figures discussed above. In later religions the gods are often not the creators of the world, nor in the re- ligions of primitive peoples is the god of the heavens. This god is a simple personification of the kind which has been discussed above. It is possible, perhaps likely, that he belonged to certain peoples, e.g., the Indo-Europeans, from the beginning, has de- veloped and has become a very important factor in their religion. But I cannot believe and there is nothing to prove that the other gods of a polytheistic religion were created by splitting off from him. At best it may be possible that he has been 'so to speak' a midwife helping other gods to spring off from the animatism</page><page sequence="37">LETTER TO PROFESSOR NOCK 107 which endowed natural objects with a soul, so that they got a shape and were seen by phantasy, personifications in the sense in which the word is taken here. Phenomenology: Finally something must be said of phenomen- ology, a recent method of the science of religion, because it is at the back of the new opinions. It classifies religious phenomena according to their similarity or kinship. The question may be asked whether phenomenology has any further purpose than putting the phenomena into their respective boxes, whether it tries to find a connection between them. It cannot be the his- torical connection, development, and cross-influences. For phe- nomenology puts together phenomena from different peoples, differing as to age and development. In principle it cares neither for time nor for history. Consequently, if any connection is sought for, it must consist in a quality of thought which is com- mon to mankind and acts originating from these thoughts. If it be so phenomenology comes very near to the old comparative science of religion against which it opposes. The difference is that while the latter is occupied with simple phenomena, the former is occupied with complicated ideas and rites. The risk is that the phenomena may be oversimplified and adapted according to the scheme into which they are put. In spite of all the tendency to find development, evolutionism, to use this bad word, is ap- parent. For a development to higher forms cannot be denied. Just as the faculty of thought is developed, so that, e.g., a Greek philosopher thinks more clearly than, say, an Australian native or a farmer of olden times, so religious ideas are developed to higher forms. There is a difference between the Baiame of the Australians, the Zeus of the Greek, and Jahwe in the later Jewish religion. Yours ever, MARTIN P. NILSSON</page></plain_text>
