It is generally agreed that those last years found him at his least inventive and imaginative, fixed into the strait jacket of a political satirist. His earlier position as second cartoonist, which he held from 1871 to 1901, allowed him more freedom to exercise his talents as an artist in touch with the artistic life of London. Sambourne's enthusiasm for the art world probably reflects the fact that he was a comparative latecomer to it. In contrast to the other artists who worked for Punch in the final decades of the 19th century, Sambourne had received relatively little training. John Tenniel, the principal cartoonist, had attended both the Royal Academy Schools and the Sketching Club in Clipstone Street. George du Maurier had been an art student in three European countries, in the atelier of Charles Gleyre in Paris, and at the academies in Antwerp and Düsseldorf. Charles Keene, who had not trained as a painter, had spent five years as an apprentice to JW Whymper, the wood engraver. Sambourne, born in 1844, had received some early instruction from his father's sister, Jane Barr, who was a talented amateur watercolourist. When he was 16 he spent a few months at the South Kensington School of Art, largely occupied in copying from the Antique. In the later 1860s, when he had decided to become an artist, he briefly attended the evening life classes in the Langham Chambers, Portland Place, the new home of the Clipstone Street Academy. Here students drew from the draped model in one week, and the undraped the next. At 10 o'clock the assembled artists would comment on each other's drawings. There was, however, no teacher. Destined by his father for a career as an engineer, Sambourne had been apprenticed at 17 to John Penn and Son, manufacturers of marine steam engines, who operated from Greenwich, Blackheath and Deptford. During his time at Penn's, Sambourne, promoted to the drawing office when his employer discovered his talent, dreamed of devoting his life entirely to art. His chance came in 1867 when a fellow employee, Alfred German Reed (the son of a well known musical entrepreneur), showed one of Sambourne's drawings to his father. Thomas German Reed evidently alerted Mark Lemon, the founding editor of Punch , to this new talent, and Sambourne's first drawing appeared in the magazine on 27 April 1867. This was a decorated letter T, heading a short article. These 'initial letters', often elaborately decorated, were a popular feature of 19th- century illustrated books and magazines. Sambourne's father had died in 1866, and, given this opening, Sambourne thankfully relinquished his career as an engineer. For a time, Sambourne's work for Punch was fairly sporadic, consisting almost entirely of initial letters and vignettes with a handful of somewhat unsatisfactory quarter- or half-page 5 1 Illustration to Canto IV of Byron's Childe Harold, 1878</page><page sequence="2">2 Illustration to Canto IV of Byron's Childe Harold 3 'An anxious moment', Punch , 27 July 1878, p 34 cartoons. He showed real talent in his title pages for Punch prefaces, and in the graceful and grotesque drawings in which he satirised contemporary fashion. He drew young women in supremely elegant dresses, hats and hairstyles, but each of them resembled an animal or a bird. The animals chosen were sometimes uncomfortable ones, a porcupine or a snake, for example, but these were not serious contributions to the 'woman question' debate. Occasionally, however, Sambourne made his drawings even more piquant by dressing the girls in military costume. The series began in 1867 and continued for a number of years. An ingenious and unthreatening anthropomorphism was a hallmark of the early Sambourne. Like a number of other artists of the period, including Henry Stacy Marks and Briton Riviere, he was a lifelong habitue of the London Zoo. The anthropomorphic tradition, which goes back to ancient times and was prominent in the literature and art of the middle ages, has been a continuous thread in western art. In the 19th century it flourished in caricature and animal painting. In his cartoons, John Tenniel frequently presented the nations as animals, the 'Russian Bear' and the 'British Lion', for example. Tenniel, however, followed a formula, and, unlike Sambourne, he neither redrew his animal images during his career, nor ranged widely among different examples. The anthropomorphic artist, Ernest Griset, was also working for Punch during Sambourne's early days on the magazine. Griset drew animals which were more obviously grotesque than Sambourne's and, like Tenniel, he illustrated a volume of Aesop's Fables, a series of ancient parables in which the behaviour of animals provides a satire of human behaviour. However, while Sambourne flourished at Punch , Griset failed, probably as a result of his personality rather than of his work. The staff immediately recognised that Sambourne, unlike Griset, was a 'clubbable' man. All three cartoonists would have been aware of two important influences. One came from the painter, Sir Edwin Landseer. Like Sambourne, Landseer was a serious animal artist, and in some of his tragic later paintings of hunted animals, he touches a string far beyond the scope of satirical anthropomorphism. However, in earlier paintings, such as Dignity and Impudence (1839, Tate Gallery), the noble bloodhound and the tiny fox terrier, looking out of the bloodhound's kennel, provide a humorous statement on the relation between the great and the irrepressible. Sambourne, appropriately enough, used this Landseer painting as the basis for a political satire in 1876. A second influence was that of Charles Darwin, and On the Origin of Species , published in 1859. Darwin's evolutionary thesis on the relation between animals and human beings led to a new strain in anthropomorphism. As Alex Potts has expressed it: 'What could not be stated openly about the violence of social being in bourgeois society was displaced onto figurations of the animal world.'1 Sarah Burns has shown how American satirists used images of bears and bulls as a metaphor for the violence of the battles waged between rival tycoons and stockbrokers in later 19th-century Wall Street.2 Sambourne's work is not of this kind, but he was aware of the work of Darwin as a naturalist, and undoubtedly carried this knowledge into his own work as a cartoonist. That Sambourne had ambitions to become a leading illustrator, an artist rather than a cartoonist, is evident from three of his early projects. All drew upon his experiences as a traveller. The first was JM Molloy's Our Autumn Holidays on French Rivers , published in 1874. During August 1873, Sambourne was one of four oarsmen who rowed the Marie down the Seine and the Loire. As well as acting as 'Bow' it had been agreed beforehand that Sambourne would record the journey for Molloy. Thickly worked, with more dark areas of shading than is usual with him, these drawings are a vital component of the completed volume. The second of Sambourne's travel projects was for Our Holiday in the Scottish Highlands , written by his Punch colleague Arthur A Beckett, and the third was a lavish edition of the Venice passages from Canto IV of Byron's Childe Harold (Pis 1, 2). Many of Sambourne's drawings for these three books are studies of landscape, laid out in a horizontal format, and frequently evoking a profound sense of melancholy and desolation. They are a striking contrast to the sketches of fellow travellers, or of picturesque local people, which are full of humour. These three volumes are unique in Sambourne's oeuvre. They represent a path not taken, a bid to become an artist in a particular field which was then, perhaps regrettably, abandoned. The originals of some of the drawings for these travel books hang on the walls at 18 Stafford Terrace, an indication of the draughtsman's own pride in his early work. Apart from a few interviews given near the end of his life, and a letter to Marion H Spielman who was writing a history of Punch , Sambourne said little about his attitude to his work. He began keeping a diary in the 1880s, but there is no surviving record of his objectives as his career developed in the previous decade. He married in 1874 and the birth of two children, Maud and Roy, added to his responsibilities and his need to make money, and possibly distracted him from continuing with experiments outside his work for Punch. The appointment of Shirley Brooks as editor of the magazine, on the death of Mark Lemon in 1870, resulted in Sambourne's promotion to the regular staff in 1871. The need to produce one or two cartoons a week was a life sentence for him. Because of the pressure to produce cartoons for Punch , he was often very slow in completing projects for publishers other than Bradbury Evans. His illustrations for a Hans Andersen volume were never completed and the few drawings he finished only saw the light of day in Three Stories of Hans Andersen? a quarter of a century after the inception of the scheme, and in the year of Sambourne's death. If Sambourne did indeed harbour an ambition to become an artist in his own right, it was therefore an ambition which was never fully achieved. Of his continuing interest in the fine arts, particularly during the earlier part of his career, there can, however, be no possible doubt. He was clearly a frequenter of the Royal Academy exhibitions from an early age, and from the 1870s he made regular expeditions to Paris, often in the company of the painter Luke Fildes, to view the anntial Salon exhibitions. Some of the photographs which Sambourne 6</page><page sequence="3">brought back from the Salon hang in the dining room at 18 Stafford Terrace, many of them reproducing historical and genre scenes by popular masters of the French and European schools. Fildes was only one of Sambourne's artist friends. The cartoonist and illustrator was part of a circle which included local Kensington painters like Marcus Stone, George Boughton, Colin Hunter and Edwin Austin Abbey. Further afield, he was on good terms with, among others, Lawrence Alma Tadema, William Powell Frith, Frank Holl, William Orchardson, and Joseph Edgar Boehm, as well as his fellow illustrators, Walter Crane and Randolph Caldecott. Frederic Leighton and John Millais both lived in Kensington, but Sambourne had a professional rather than a personal relationship with these giants of the art establishment There is no record that either ever dined at 18 Stafford Terrace. Among Sambourne's closest friends were the members of the St John's Wood Clique, a group of painters known for their historical and genre works. Sambourne's taste in European paintings, as indicated by the photographs which he bought in Paris, provides a context for his appreciation of paintings by Philip Hermógenes Calderon, JE Hodgson, Henry Stacy Marks, Adolphus ('Dolly') Storey and William Yeames. All were more or less contemporaries of Sambourne, and he not only admired their work but often joined their outings and entertainments. They do not, however, pay him more than cursory attention in their autobiographies, which is perhaps an indication that he was not so closely integrated into the group as was his Punch colleague, George du Maurier. All these artists, with the exception of Crane and Caldecott, were either full or associate members of the Royal Academy. Sambourne would frequently solicit photographs of their Academy works for his growing collection. Some hang on his walls, mingled with the French Salon pieces. Among the paintings for which he sought a reproduction was An Anxious Moment (Royal Holloway College) by Briton Riviere, known, like Sambourne himself, as an animal artist. Riviere had been elected an Associate of the Academy in 1878, the same year that he exhibited An Anxious Moment. The painting shows a flock of geese facing the threat of a tall black hat, dropped into their path. In her catalogue of the Holloway Collection, Jeannie Chapel notes that 'most of the reviews saw the painting as genuinely funny'.4 Sambourne's cartoon of 27 July 1878 (PI 3) uses the Riviere painting in order to celebrate the award of the Grande Médaille of the Exposition Universelle in Paris to John Millais and Hubert von Herkomer. The Royal Academicians, their faces recognisable, appear as Riviere's group of geese, all hissing at Herkomer (the black hat), while Millais flies away above them. The painting had attracted a great deal of interest and comment in the Academy exhibition, and, not surprisingly, the cartoon scored a particular success with the artistic community. Sambourne distributed prints to his friends and Riviere was among those who wrote to thank him. At the same time the artist asked for the return of another print, that of his painting Sympathy (Royal Holloway College), where a young girl sits on the stairs with her dog. In order to protect his copyright, Riviere 7</page><page sequence="4">4 'Punch's Essence of Parliament', Punch , 16 June 1977, p 277 5 'Swell struggling with the cig'rette poisoner', Punchy 23 September 1882, p 135 explained, he wanted Sambourne either to send back the print or to destroy it. Sambourne clearly appealed against this, and a letter of 13 August from Riviere tells him that he can keep the photograph. Both prints are on the walls at 18 Stafford Terrace. Sambourne appreciated the satirical possibilities which a flock of geese offered to him. In a cartoon of the previous year, drawn for an 'Essence of Parliament' column on 10 June 1877 (PI 4), the source painting is by a German artist, Ludwig Knaus. In Tausend Ängsten (A Thousand Terrors', untraced) of 1872 shows a young girl holding a piece of bread and menaced by a flock of geese. In another Knaus painting of the same year, Das Vesperbrot ('The Afternoon Meal', Cologne), a similar situation is developed as a young girl feeds vegetables to an importunate group of birds. For his cartoon, Sambourne showed the radical politician, John Bright, in the role of the girl, holding a slice of bread labelled 'Vote'. He uses the group of geese to represent those unmarried women who were hoping to be enfranchised. Waddling along in their bonnets they are clearly meant to be absurd. The one man with them, a bearded figure, is labelled as Jacob Bright, John Blight's brother. Jacob Bright and his wife were prominent supporters of the women's rights movement, whereas John Bright had changed his mind on the issue, and spoke strongly against the proposed changes in the debate of 1876. The premise of the original Knaus painting is therefore reversed. The young girl becomes a middle-aged man, and, unlike the original female figure, he has the upper hand. Sambourne probably enjoyed reversing the gender of his comic geese, female in the 'Knaus' cartoon and male in the 'Riviere' parody. There is an acknowledgement of the source on both drawings: '"Geese" after L. Knaus (Slightly Altered)' on the one, and, on the other, 'With Punch's Apologies to Mr Briton Riviere, A.RA)'. The two paintings from which Sambourne drew his structure and situation were popular works by respected artists. John Tenniel had established a similar practice early on in his career. He regularly introduces well-known works of art into his political cartoons, adapting the figures and the narrative for comic effect. Many of the paintings to which Tenniel refers are still familiar today, 'typical examples are Sir Edwin Landseer's Monarch of the Glen (1851, John Dewar and Sons; Punch , 31 July 1880) and Millais' Princes in the Tower (1878, Royal Holloway College; Punch , 28 August 1880). Sambourne sometimes introduces equally famous works. Turner's Fighting Temeraire (1838, National Gallery, London, Punch , 26 August 1876) provides the basis of a half page letter T for an 'Essence of Parliament' column, with Disraeli as the old boat towed away to be broken up. On 24 September 1892, Sambourne used the Turner painting again, this time to illustrate a protest against the scuttling of the Foudroyant , another survivor of the Battle of Thifalgar. Like Tenniel, Sambourne turned to the The Monarch of the Glen , in his case for a 'Fancy Portrait' of the Duke of Buccleuch (Punch, 25 August 1883). On the whole, however, such iconic images were more the exception than the rule with Sambourne. Were it not for the notes which Sambourne usually adds, cheekily making his apologies to the original artists, the fact that these cartoons are parodies would probably never be noticed today. We have, however, to assume that his contemporaries (or those who knew the art world) would have seen the joke when, on this occasion using an old master painting instead of a contemporary one, he ranged the peers and bishops who were cutting up the Education Bill of 1906 as the surgeon and students in Rembrandt's famous Anatomy Lesson (Mauritshuis, The Hague). Sambourne moved away from fine art into the commercial world when he made his own version of a drawing by Henry Stacy Marks. The drawing, commissioned as an advertisement for Pears Soap, shows two monks, one shaving, the other washing his hands. In 'Lather-Day Saints (From the Well-Known Mediaeval Mural Decorative Advertisement by Thide Marks, R.A.)' Sambourne adapts Marks' drawing to show the prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone, shaving while the radical politician, John Bright, washes his hands in a bowl labelled 'Radical Lather'. In the original advertisement, the names of the surgeon who held the chair of dermatology at the Royal College of Physicians, Sir Erasmus Wilson, and of the famous singer, Adelina Patti, appear in a written recommendation for the soap, pinned onto the wall behind the two monks. Sambourne has changed these two names to those of Bright and of Anne Parnell. The Irish leader, Charles Stewart Parnell, had been imprisoned in 1881 for inciting agrarian violence, but was released in 1882 when growing disorder in Ireland was felt to be a threat to security. John Bright, who served as a cabinet minister in Gladstone's government until 1882, had a large part to play in Irish land reform, and is seen here as the man who helps to 'Lather' the guilt of Parnell. Marks was a personal friend of Sambourne, and it seems possible that this drawing was chosen for two reasons, both to catch the public eye and at the same time to provide an 'in joke' among the artist's circle, a mild jibe at Marks for prostituting his talents in this way. Sambourne made frequent use in particular of one celebrated sculpture, Frederic Leighton's Athlete struggling with a python , the original bronze version of which was shown at the Royal Academy exhibition of 1877. Sambourne wrote to Leighton soon afterwards enquiring whether he was too late to purchase a small bronze replica, and it appears that his fears were justified, since there is no record of such a replica at 18 Stafford Terrace. Many people were surprised and impressed that Leighton had branched out into sculpture, and Sambourne could be sure that the work would be recognised when he incorporated it into a cartoon a few weeks after it first appeared, on 26 May 1877. The caption read: 'Mr Leighton's group admits of so many applications. This is Punch's. (With his compliments to the sculptor.)' The athlete, identified by his fez, is TUrkey, posed naked against a background of fallen classical stones, while the helmeted and multi-fanged snake is Germany. 'Which will win?' was the caption. 8</page><page sequence="5">Sambourne used the same sculpture for two further cartoons, both in 1882. In a small cartoon in the Almanack , 'The Crinoletta Disfigurans: An old parasite in a new form', he shows the Venus de Milo in a bustle, with, beside her, the names of two earlier cartoonists who had condemned the fashionable disfigurement of women's bodies: 'Leech, Punch's Almanack, 1861' and 'Hogarth'. To the right of the Venus , on a plinth labelled 'Aesthete struggling with fashion, after Leighton', a woman in a tight dress wrestles with whalebone coiled around her in the form of Leighton's snake. The third cartoon, of September 23 1882, is entitled 'Swell struggling with the cig'rette poisoner' (PI 5). Sambourne, himself a heavy smoker of cigars, shows a man in evening dress, caught in the toils of a skeleton snake while lighting his cigarette from its mouth. The cigarette box, labelled 'The "Serpent Cigarette'" has the man's credentials written inside it: 'Guards, Cambridge, Marlboro, Derby, Ascot'. This cartoon is not aimed at smoking itself, but specifically at cigarettes, at a time when they were thought vulgar in comparison with cigars. These concern parody to introduce cartoons the are art world one element into Punch. in Sambourne's Another and concern to introduce the art world into Punch. Another and more direct approach came with an annual series of cartoons, beginning in 1872, usually marking the opening of the Royal Academy in May, which featured the Royal Academicians. The Private View and the later Soirée were important milestones in the calendar of High Society. Over the years, Sambourne continued with these Royal Academy cartoons, an indication of the relative fame of the institution and its membership. The drawings assume knowledge of the issues involved, although, as with other Sambourne cartoons, there are often small capitalised words and names to guide the observer. Such was the prestige of the Academy that the faces and works of its members seemed appropriate material for what was intended to be a comic magazine. Sambourne presented the Academicians in many guises, sometimes complete with tiny versions of their exhibits. In 'At the Academy: A Picture Puzzle' of May 1875, for example, the members appear as clothes pegs on a line, their paintings 9</page><page sequence="6">(clearly numbered from the catalogue) hanging below them. In 1877, the opening of the rival exhibition at the Grosvenor Gallery by Sir Coutts Lindsay gave Sambourne a further opportunity. On 12 May he published a full page cartoon showing the Royal Academy as a peacock (peacocks symbolise vanity but were also adopted as icons by the aesthetes) with small likenesses of the members in the 'eyes' of the feathers, and Sir Francis Granty at its head. Lindsay's skeletal peacock has only two artists in its tail, Edward Burne-Jones and James Tissot, whose work was prominent at the Grosvenor in 1877. Grant died in 1878 and Sambourne commented favourably on the appointment of his successor Frederic Leighton. Down the years, he continued drawing the heads of the Academicians under the leadership of their President. In one example, which is dated 1885, but seems not to have been published, Leighton is a giant butterfly, with one of his own paintings on his wing. Around him are his colleagues at the Academy, including Frank Holl, John Millais and Lawrence Alma Tadema, all represented as smaller butterflies flying around a flowering iris. The presence of four dinner knives below Leighton suggests that this had some connection with the annual Academy dinner, an event which Sambourne sometimes attended. In the battle with the Grosvenor Gallery, Sambourne's sympathies were clearly with the Academy, and he was a consistent supporter of the more conventional art establishment. His cartoon on the Ruskin versus Whistler trial makes both contestants look equally silly. They are presented as birds as the judge hands Whistler his farthing's damages for Ruskin's attack on his painting, Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket. The costs incurred by both sides are shown as two snakes. Not long afterwards Sambourne showed Ruskin as Narcissus in one of his 'Fancy Portraits' with an altar to Turner in the background. The words on a much smaller altar, presumably written by Sambourne himself, a former engineer, read 'Engineer Mechanic. Watt - Steam Engine'. Sambourne was wise to steer clear of any further jokes at Whistler's expense, but he did present two other aesthetes, Edward Burne-Jones and Algernon Swinburne, as pot plants, probably hyacinths. Sir John Gilbert, the ageing history painter, on the other hand, was praised in a 'Fancy Portrait' for showing knights who were not 'limp lanky forms of sickly** hue', presumably an attack on Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelites. (Punch, 28 January 1882) In the 1880s Sambourne became friendly with a new group of artists, all fellow members of the Arts Club and including the American illustrator and historical painter Edwin Austin Abbey and the watercolourist Alfred Parsons. The two artists shared a studio at 54 Bedford Gardens, and Sambourne began to use it when he photographed from the nude. Initially, he seems to have taken the photographs for Abbey, but, after a time, he was glad of the opportunity to work on his nude plates away from home. Sambourne also visited the painters and their friends at Broadway in the Cotswolds, and was clearly enjoyed as a cheerful and energetic companion. He met the American artist John Singer Sargent through this group, but there is no indication in Sambourne's diaries about his approach to Sargent's work, then generally considered as radical and impressionist. There are no cartoons taken from Sargent's famous Carnation, Lily ; Lily ; Rose , although Sambourne must have known the painting from his time in Broadway. Sambourne's artistic cartoons tell us a good deal about the high profile of the Victorian Royal Academy, and something (although by no means all) about Sambourne's own taste. It can probably be assumed that he was particularly struck by those paintings of which he includes sketches. On one occasion, he was nearly arrested for sketching Burne-Jones's painting of a mermaid The depths of the sea (Private collection) at the Royal Academy exhibition of 1886. Having set up the tradition of the Academy cartoon, Sambourne involved himself in a great deal of hard work each May, both in catching a large number of likenesses and, in some years, in making small sketches of the art works. He was helped by photographs and cartes de visite but the effort must still have been considerable. Where appropriate, Sambourne turned the Academicians into birds or animals. On 12 July 1879, for example, he showed Leighton as a large gull leading the flock of his members onto a seashore where Mr Punch and Toby are awaiting them. Each Royal Academician and Associate is represented, most with their names on the waves which are carrying them in. A number of their Academy works, including Millais' portrait of Gladstone (National Portrait Gallery, London) and Edwin Long's Esther and Vashti (untraced) are also sketched in onto the waves. Near to the shore is a group of Associates who are labelled as ducklings, with Sambourne's friends and neighbours, Luke Fildes and George Boughton, among them. From 1885 onwards, Sambourne was able to join his friends on the walls of the Royal Academy, as an exhibitor if not as a member of the institution. From that year, the Black and White room was inaugurated, and artists were able to submit drawings for inclusion in the Annual Exhibition. In the first year, Sambourne sent in his masterpiece, the Design for the Diploma, International Fisheries Exhibition of 1883. This immensely detailed drawing shows all aspects of fishing, both at sea and on land. There are fish of all kinds together with the animals and birds which, like human beings, catch and eat them. A bust of Queen Victoria, flanked by nymphs, stands at the top of the design, with the Royal arms below her. Once this opportunity presented itself, Sambourne exhibited at the Royal Academy in most years, usually sending in his title pages or elaborate drawings for the Punch Almanacks. Sometimes he exhibited cartoons or book illustrations of which he was particularly proud, and on one occasion an invitation card for a banquet given by the Lord Mayor of London. Sambourne became increasingly interested in establishing the tradition in which he himself was working, in marking his own place in the history of graphic satire. He began to buy books about his predecessors and to collect letters written by earlier members of the Punch staff. He acknowledged a stylistic debt to Albrecht Dürer, and admired the German draughtsman Alfred Rethel, but he preferred to place himself in a British line of artists. One of his first Royal Academy cartoons, published on 1 June 1878, is entitled 'Ars Britannica MDCCCLXXVffl'. At the centre is a caption reading 'Rich and Rare were the gems she wore', a quotation from George Moore's Irish Melodies. Above it, carefully labelled, is a sketch from a self portrait by William Hogarth. The other artists represented are contemporary, so that Hogarth, placed just below the goddess Athena, takes up his place as the pre-eminent British painter. Two months before, on 5 April 1878, Sambourne had paid 15 shillings for A Complete Edition of the Most Capital and Admired Works of William Hogarth , put together by the Revd Dr Trusler in 1831, a book which includes prints of most of Hogarth's major works. Another volume of Hogarth reproductions which remains in Sambourne's collection was published by Bell and Daldry in 1872 and, significantly for the cartoonist, this second book publishes both prints and paintings. Sambourne evidently recognised that Hogarth was a predecessor in his own field, as well as a towering figure in British art. Writing in The Magazine of Art in 1891, he described Hogarth as 'a great and true English artist . . . alone in his strength and originality, a giant in his work'. He criticises Hogarth's vanity and lack of regard for other artists, but still expresses a strongly positive reaction: 'Had he cared, what cartoons could he not 10</page><page sequence="7">6 'Mr Punch's Parallels, No. T, Punch , 28 April 1888, p 194 have produced! Even his very style of clear, all-meaning line would have added force to his keen satire.' He notes that Hogarth's plates are full of detail, 'here a label on a bottle, there a half-curtained picture or a spider's web, all further interpret the great thinker's and artist's meaning'.5 This description suggests that Sambourne found in Hogarth a parallel, or even perhaps an influence, for his own style. In his most elaborate cartoons he often introduces a mass of small objects, their names and significance indicated by tiny capital letters. On 28 April 1888, Sambourne took an actual example from Hogarth, presenting the President of the Local Government Board, Charles Ritchie, in the pose of Hogarth's David Garrick as Richard III (cl745, Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool). The occasion was the Local Government Bill which set up County Councils, and Ritchie (as Richard III) is shown surrounded by ghosts in the form of parliamentary amendments. It is appropriate that Sambourne, who had decorated his house in the aesthetic style, should turn to the 18th century in order to trace the origins of British art. A Queen Anne revival was a notable feature of aestheticism, with its red-brick houses and its Kate Greenaway-style dresses. Both John Leech and John Tenniel turned to Marriage à-la-Mode for a political cartoon. Sambourne (following in the footsteps of John Leech) chose another 18th-century work, Sir Joshua Reynolds' Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy , for a cartoon of 11 January 1879 where Garrick is replaced by John Bull. There are several versions of this painting, and one copy is in the Garrick Club (Sambourne's club), but Sambourne was presumably using the print in his own collection, which still hangs on the stairs at 18 Stafford Terrace, as his source for the image. George du Maurier was the official 'Social Cartoonist' of Punch , and his satirical drawings, and his Aesthetic' cartoons in particular, are frequently cited as evidence for later Victorian taste. Although he had many artist friends, and occasionally introduces an artist into a cartoon, Du Maurier is by and large the chronicler of the domestic life of the London art world. Sambourne takes on a more official role, indicating which were the popular paintings, and recording the officers and membership of the Royal Academy. It was a tribute that he was glad to pay to the world in which he played a part. His house is filled with the work of his contemporaries, a lasting statement of Sambourne's sense of belonging. 1 Alex Potts, 'Natural order and the call of the wild: The politics of animal picturing', Oxford Art Journal , XIII, no 1 (1999), p 20. 2 Sarah Burns, 'Party Animals: Thomas Nast, William Holbrook Beard and the Bears of Wall Street ' American Art Journal , XXX (1999), pp 9-35. 3 Leonée Ormond, 'Linley Sambourne: The Water-Babies and Three Tales of Hans Andersen' The British Art Journal , II, 3 (Spring/Summer 2001), pp 84ff. 4 Jeannie Chapel, Victorian Taste, 1982, p 128. 5 Linley Sambourne, 'Political Cartoons', Magazine of Art, 1892, p 22. 11</page></plain_text>
