<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rebecca H. Hague Ancient Greek Wedding Songs: The Tradition of Praise Our first references to the wedding songs of the ancient Greeks appear in the earliest extant works of Greek literature, the Iliad and the Odyssey. In the description of one of the cities which decorate Achilles' shield in the Iliad, there is mention of wedding processions, accompanied by bright torches, music, dancing, and song (18.490-96). In the Odyssey, Menelaus's palace is the setting for a wedding feast with a singer and two acrobatic dancers (4.15-19). And near the end of the Odyssey, when Odysseus wishes to cover up his actions in the palace, he bids a singer to take up his lyre and lead a dance, "so that anyone outside who hears might say that we are celebrating a wedding" (23.131-36). Song is an ever-present accompaniment to the wedding in Homer, and the frequent mention of wedding songs by authors of all periods of ancient Greek literature attests to the continuing importance of song to the wedding ceremony in ancient Greece.' Unfortunately, not many of the songs which were actually sung at weddings have been preserved. And of the extant songs which were composed for actual performance at a wedding, many are not preserved entire; in fact, some consist of only one line.2 But we do have songs which, upon comparison among themselves and with the songs for actual weddings, can be seen to have been composed within the narrow tradition of wedding songs. Such songs are found in tragedies and comedies or other works such as Lucian's Symposium, and as they were clearly intended to imitate wedding songs, they can be used to fill in the gaps in the tradition. This tradition seems to have continued unaltered throughout antiquity, or at least our sources do not allow us to see any developments through time; so I will be using as examples texts from various time periods. By collecting some of these songs from diverse sources and bringing them together here, I 131</page><page sequence="2">Rebecca H. Hague will illustrate the narrow range of content which typifies this genre. Once I have established the characteristic themes and language of the genre, I will demonstrate the antiquity of this tradition by comparison with a passage in the Odyssey which reveals Homer's familiarity with the genre. But before we consider the songs, we must consider their setting, the wedding ceremony, for wedding songs, like all occasional poetry, can only be properly understood when they are studied in the context of the ceremony for which they were composed. The wedding in ancient Greece ordinarily spanned three days.3 It began with rites through which the bride bid farewell to her youth, and she and the groom prepared for marriage. The next day her father gave a feast, at which his family, the bride, and the bridegroom were present, and other guests. The feast concluded in the evening, and the bride and groom departed amidst friends on a procession to the bridegroom's house. There they were received by the bridegroom's parents, and, after the bride was initiated into her new home, the couple retired to the bridal chamber. In the morning they were awakened by friends, who came in a formal procession to present the couple with gifts. We have examples of songs for each of these stages of the ceremony, and these songs are remarkably similar, considering that they were used to accompany the various activities of the different stages. But although the subject of almost all the songs is the couple being wed, the manner of addressing the couple and the tone of the songs vary in the different stages. One type of song which belongs specifically to one part of the wedding, in this case to the wedding feast, is that in which an eikon, or comparison, is made, such as Sappho's address to the bridegroom (115):4 To what, dear bridegroom, may I compare you well? To a slender sapling I compare you most of all. Similar songs of comparison were sung at other symposia, as well as wedding feasts, in a game called the eikasia, in which one person ridiculed another by making a ludicrous comparison. This game was so common at symposia that guests felt that cleverness at it was expected of them, for in Xenophon's Symposium, when one guest is asked not to go on with his eik6n, he says (6.10), "But if I am silent, I don't see how I am going to render services worthy of such a fine dinner." The eikon was used for ridicule, and most of our examples come from comedy.5 In the Wasps, Xanthias begins to describe the insults exchanged at a feast by Lysistratus and an old man (1308): "Then Lysistratus told him what he looked like, as he saw him." The words as he saw him tell us that it is the appearance of the man which was mocked, as in the Birds, when 132</page><page sequence="3">ANCIENT GREEK WEDDING SONGS Pisthetaerus and Euelpides first see each other dressed in feathers, and each describes to the other how he looks (804-806): P: "Do you know what you look like with those feathers? Like a dimestore painter's rendition of a goosel" E: "As for you-a blackbird with a crew cut!" It would have been only natural at a wedding feast, when comparisons were made, to apply the same technique to songs directed to the bride and groom, concentrating on their appearance, but in a complimentary rather than derisive vein. Songs such as the one by Sappho which use the language of the eikasia, that is, which contain the verb eikazd6 or one of its relatives, are most at home at the wedding feast.6 But the wedding feast was not the only stage of the ceremony at which songs were sung which use the technique of comparison to describe the appearance of the bride and groom. In fact, almost all of the songs for every part of the ceremony compliment the couple by means of this technique. A brief survey of these comparisons shows their limited range. Very often, the comparison is made to the gods or heroes, sometimes implicitly, by describing a divine or heroic wedding whose action parallels that of the wedding at hand, and sometimes directly, in a simile. Outright comparison is the focus of the song for the wedding feast described by Lucian (Symposium 41), in which the bride is said to surpass not only other maidens, but even Aphrodite and Helen, and the bridegroom is said to surpass not only his peers, but also Nereus and Achilles: Or such as once in the house of Aristaenetus Radiant Cleanthis was raised, a queen, Surpassing all other maidens, Better than Aphrodite and Helen herself. Bridegroom, hail to you, too, best of your peers, Better than Nereus, and the son of Thetis. And again we will sing this bridal song together, To both of you, many times. At the conclusion to the song the guests laugh, so we must understand the song to be a parody of the things said in the wedding songs, and its extravagant praise does sound empty since it does not give any details in explanation of the comparisons made. But its. objects of comparison are the same as those which were used by Sappho; Himerius tells us that Sappho compared the bridegroom to Achilles, both in person and in deeds (Orationes IX.16), and Sappho 23 compares a woman, quite possibly a bride, to Helen and Hermione.7 And in a song to be sung when the couple approached the bridal chamber, Sappho compares the bridegroom to Ares, god of war, famous for his amorous intrigue with Aphrodite (111):8 133</page><page sequence="4">Rebecca H. Hague Raise the roof! Hymenaon! Lift it, carpenters! Hymenaon! A bridegroom is coming in, equal to Ares, Much bigger than a big man. In other songs the bride and groom are compared to a divine or heroic couple indirectly, in songs which contain a scene of a wedding of gods or heroes. In the wedding song at the end of the Birds, the procession of Zeus and Hera to the bridal chamber is described, a scene which parallels the procession of the actors (1731-44): Once the Fates united The great ruler of the gods With Hera, Olympian queen, Goddess of lofty throne, Amidst these wedding strains. Hymen, 0 Hymenaeus, O! Hymen, 0 Hymenaeus, O! Blooming Eros with his golden wings Guided straight The drawn-back reins Groomsman of the wedding, sitting by Zeus And blessed Hera. Hymen, 0 Hymenaeus, O! Hymen, 0 Hymenaeus, O! Similar descriptions of superhuman weddings are found in Sappho 141, a description of a wedding feast of the gods, Sappho 44, the description of the wedding procession of Hector and Andromache, and in Iphigeneia at Aulis (1036-88), where the feast for the wedding of Peleus and Thetis is depicted.9 In all of these songs, the focus is not on the bride and groom so much as on the others who are present at the wedding and whose singing and dancing contribute so much to the splendor of the occasion. The comparison to a divine or heroic wedding glorifies not only the couple being wed, but also the guests and the ceremony in general by a comparison to the mythical scene. ' Another feature shared by many Greek wedding songs is the makarismos (pronouncing makar, or blessed) of the groom. For example, the earliest extant wedding song, the song of Peleus and Thetis in Hesiod, begins (fr. 211 Merkelbach and West): "Thrice-blessed and four times happy Peleus, 134</page><page sequence="5">ANCIENT GREEK WEDDING SONGS son of Aeacus." This is really another compliment by indirect comparison, since the adjective makar implies comparison to the gods, the makares." Other objects of comparison in the songs are not anthropomorphic. The greatest number of these comparisons is found in Theocritus's Epithala- mium to Helen (Idyll 18), in which Helen is compared to a race horse, to spring, to dawn, and to a tall cypress, which brings to mind Sappho's comparison of the bridegroom to a slender sapling. In the announcement of the bridegroom's arrival which precedes the procession in the Birds (1706-19), Pisthetaerus is compared to a star or the sun in his radiance. He is unusually radiant because he carries Zeus's thunderbolt, but the simile would not be inappropriate to any bridegroom whose wedding finery is gleaming in the torchlight. The most frequent object of comparison aside from gods or heroes is plants. I have just mentioned Theocritus's comparison of the bride to a cypress tree, and Sappho's of the groom to a sapling. Sappho also compares the bride to an apple; Himerius tells us this (Orationes IX.16 = 105b LP), and the fragment we have which describes a late-picked apple is likely from a wedding song (105a): Like the sweet-apple which reddens on a high bough, High on the very highest, and the apple-pickers have overlooked it. No, they haven't really overlooked it; they could not reach it. Sappho's comparison of a woman to a hyacinth, if not part of a wedding song, may well be an adaptation of an image taken from a wedding song (105c): Like the hyacinth which shepherds in the mountains Trample with their feet, and the purple blossom is on the ground.'2 The comparison of the bride or groom to a plant removes the couple from their village to the landscape of a garden or meadow, to a simple life, of the type men led before they developed such niceties as tables and beds, the way of life of the city of hogs described by Plato (Republic 372a-d), in which men recline on beds of leaves strewn with yew and myrtle. This was a time when a young girl alone in a field might have expected to be ravished by a god, for a meadow or garden is often the setting for such surprises, as well as for the love-making of the gods. The earliest description of a sacred union, that of Zeus and Hera in Book 14 of the Iliad, takes place on a bed of grass fashioned by Zeus on the peaks of Ida, with clover, crocuses, and hyacinths (346-51). A soft meadow with spring flowers is the scene of Poseidon's union with Medusa, described in Theogony 278-79. In the Homeric Hymn to 135</page><page sequence="6">Rebecca H. Hague Demeter Persephone is gathering flowers in a soft meadow when she is seized by Hades (4-18). And in the Ion of Euripides, Creusa describes her rape by Apollo as she was gathering flowers (887-90). These are only a few of the many examples of flowery meadows in a sexual context, and since the discovery of the Cologne Epode of Archilochus, which portrays a man persuading a woman to yield to him amidst blossoming flowers, many scholars have noted the importance of a flowery field to scenes of love- making.'3 This is borne out also by the imagery of wedding songs, and, indeed, it is possible that the origin for this imagery is hymeneal. Its use for divine and human weddings is well-attested, and its extension to descriptions of love-making outside of marriage is understandable as an attempt to create the atmosphere of a wedding and so give an air of legitimacy to the union.14 The antiquity of the connection of plant imagery with not only divine, but also human, weddings is attested in the Odyssey, Book 6, in the passage spoken by Odysseus when he first meets Nausicaa. The references to marriage in this episode have often been noticed.'5 They begin with Athena's visit to Nausicaa in the night and her advice to go and wash the clothing that would be needed by her family for the wedding, as Nausicaa is now being courted by the best of the Phaeacians, and, as Athena tells her, "Not much longer will you be a maiden." The next day Nausicaa and her attendants go to the river to wash the wedding clothes, not far from the spot where Odysseus has been driven ashore. When he hears them, he decides to seek their help, and approaches them, attired in garb entirely unsuitable for an encounter with a young maiden. All the girls flee except Nausicaa, whose limbs have been rid of fear, as Homer tells us, by Athena. The situation is now charged with sexual overtones; a young girl is alone in grassy meadows, as Odysseus describes the surroundings, and we know what is apt to happen in such cases. But Odysseus puts Nausicaa at ease by addressing her as a suppliant, in words very much those of a wedding song. He begins by comparing Nausicaa's appearance to that of a goddess, Artemis, using the language of the eikasia (149-52): I clasp your knees, O queen. Are you a goddess or mortal? If you are a goddess, one of those who hold the wide sky, I liken you to Artemis, daughter of great Zeus, Most closely, in your appearance and height and person. We have already seen that this, the eikasia, is a standard form of comparison in wedding songs, and comparison of the bride to a goddess is common, although not to Artemis, the goddes who was granted eternal virginity. Her choice in this passage indicates Odysseus's care to act with propriety toward the maiden. 136</page><page sequence="7">ANCIENT GREEK WEDDING SONGS A makarismos follows, first of Nausicaa's parents and brothers, and then of her future husband (153-61): But if you are a mortal, one of these who dwell on earth, Thrice-blessed are your father and the lady who is your mother, And thrice-blessed are your brothers! And I am sure that their hearts Are always warmed with happiness because of you, When they see such a lovely bud taking her place in the chorus. But the man is most blessed, surpassing the rest, Who prevails with his brideprice and leads you to his home, For I have never seen anything like you with my eyes, Neither man nor woman, and wonder holds me as I look at you. The reason for her family's and husband's blessedness is explained, as is usual with the makarismos, as due to Nausicaa's beauty and grace, which is depicted by means of a metaphor comparing her to a bud. The lines which follow continue this imagery (162-69): Once on Delos beside the altar of Apollo I saw such a thing, a new shoot of a palm coming up- For I went there, too, and many men followed me On that trip on which I was to suffer terribly- And when I saw that shoot, my heart was struck For a long time, since never had such a tree come up from the ground; So now, lady, I admire you and wonder at you and I am terribly afraid to touch Your knees. These comparisons reinforce Odysseus's earlier allusion to the setting, and Nausicaa is described as part of a natural landscape, as the bride is so often in wedding songs. But the type of plant to which Nausicaa is compared is significantly different from the comparisons made in wedding songs.'6 There the bride is not a plant which has just sprung up, but a ripe or blossoming plant, one ready to be picked. Again, Odysseus's words clearly recall the language of wedding songs, and place Nausicaa in the landscape of sexual possibilities, but are much more circumspect than comparisons which imply the upcoming plucking of the blossom. This part of Odysseus's speech ends with words which recall its beginning and his position as suppliant, and in the next ten lines he elaborates upon his suffering and entreats Nausicaa to help him. He ends his speech with a prayer for the fulfillment of Nausicaa's wishes (180-85): May the gods give you all that you want in your heart; May they grant you a husband and a house and sweet Harmony. For nothing is more enduring, nor better, 137</page><page sequence="8">Rebecca H. Hague Than when a man and his wife have a household with Harmony of mind: it causes much grief to their enemies And pleasure to well-wishers, and they themselves feel it the most. Similar prayers for the future happiness of bride and groom are often part of wedding songs. One example is found in an epithalamium from a papyrus in the John Rylands Library (no. 17), which concludes: . . Now may the gods Give you harmony, and may you soon have children, And children of those children, and reach a ripe old age.'7 These three features-the makarismos, comparison of Nausicaa to a goddess and to a plant, and the prayer for her happiness-differentiate this speech from all other suppliant speeches and strongly suggest marriage and wedding songs. This suggestion is reciprocated by Nausicaa, who says to her handmaidens when she first sees Odysseus after he has bathed and dressed in the clothes she has given him (243-45): Now he is like to the gods, who hold the wide sky. Would that such a man be called my husband, Dwelling here, and that it please him to stay! The wedding which this passage suggests does not, of course, come to pass. Nevertheless, the language and standards of praise so closely parallel wedding songs that the passage is without question written in the same tradition as the later songs, and is evidence for this tradition's deep antiquity. The similarity of the imagery of Greek wedding songs to love songs of New Kingdom Egypt, and to the Biblical Song of Songs and the was f or description which is a staple of Syrian love and wedding songs was noticed by Franz Dornseiff in an article published in 1936.18 The emphasis of these songs is also on the appearance of the couple, which is praised, as in the Greek songs, through the technique of comparison. A brief example from each will serve to illustrate this. From Chester Beatty Papyrus I, an Egyptian love song of the New Kingdom: 19 She looks like the rising morning star At the start of a happy year. Shining bright, fair of skin, Lovely the look of her eyes, Sweet the speech of her lips, 138</page><page sequence="9">ANCIENT GREEK WEDDING SONGS She has not a word too much. Upright neck, shining breast, Hair true lapis lazuli; Arms surpassing gold, Fingers like lotus buds. Joy has he whom she embraces, He is like the first of men! From the Song of Songs:20 Like a lotus among brambles, So is my darling among girls. Like an apple in the wild wood, So is my love among boys. In his shade I love to sit, And his fruit is sweet to my palate. Hark my love, There he comes, Leaping over mountains, Bounding o'er hills. My love resembles a buck, Or a young stag. The similarity of these songs and the Greek songs, all focusing on the praise of the appearance of the bride and groom by means of comparison, suggests that there was a very old tradition of wedding songs common to many people of the Eastern Mediterranean. Dornseiff's suggestion that the Song of Songs was compsed for a feast in the court of Solomon is particularly interesting in view of the Greek sympotic tradition of the eikasia, from which the comparisons may have been extended from the feast to the songs of the rest of the ceremony. The tradition is very tenacious. There are modern Palestinian parallels to the Song of Songs,21 and modern Greek wedding songs preserve the comparisons of the ancient songs, as in the following song:22 My bride, clear water and shining moon, Your mate is to be envied, a fine young man. At your in-laws' house, in the neighborhood to which you go, Like a cypress may you stand straight; like an oak may you take root; And like an apple tree, a sweet-apple tree, may you blossom; may you bear fruit, May you call your own nine sons and one little sweet-apple. 139</page><page sequence="10">Rebecca H. Hague This contemporary song would have been perfectly at home at a Greek wedding in the time of Sappho, or Homer, or perhaps even earlier. Its praise of the bride and groom, and wishes for the new family by comparison to things of nature, especially plants, preserve the tradition of the ancient Greek songs and attest its continuing life.

Wedding songs formed such an integral part of the ceremony that the Greek word hymenaios, the cry which forms a refrain for some of the songs and is used as the name for wedding songs in general, was sometimes used of the wedding as a whole; see Liddell, Scott, and Jones, A Greek-English Lexicon (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940), s.v. hymenaios (2.).

Huddleston, "The Wedding Songs of Ancient Greece," Ph.D. diss., The Johns Hopkins University, 1980. 2. Sappho is the author of most of the songs we have which were composed for actual weddings. According to Servius, she composed a whole book called Epithalamia (In Vergilii Carmina Commentarii, III, p. 139 Thilo-Hagen), and it seems that more poems for weddings were included in her other books, which were arranged by meter (cf. D. Page, Sappho and Alcaeus [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1955]); pp. 125-26). Alcman is once called hymneter hymenaion, singer of wedding songs (Anthologia Palatina vii. 19), but none of the fragments of his poetry which have come down to us is generally considered to be a wedding song. There is one fragment, however, describing a table laden with poppy bread and a mixture of sesame and linseed which may be part of a description of a wedding feast (19 in D. Page, Poetae Melici Graeci [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962]); poppy and sesame seeds are mentioned elsewhere as wedding food (cf. Aristophanes Birds 159-61, Peace 868-70; Menander fr. 938 Kock). 3.

There is a collection of the most important literary evidence for the ceremony in Huddleston, op. cit. n. 1, Appendix A. 4. In this and all other citations of Sappho's poetry, I use the numbers of Lobel and Page, Poetarum Lesbiorum Fragmenta (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1955). 5. So in Plato's Symposium, when Alcibiades wants his eikon of Socrates to be taken seriously, he first makes clear that this comparison will be made for the sake of truth, not as a jest (215A). 6. I thank Diskin Clay for pointing out to me the specific context of Sappho's song. His paper, "Alcibiades' Praise of Sokrates: Eikon and Eikasia," presented at the 1979 meeting of the American Philological Association, provided me with the references to eikones cited here. One other song by Sappho, 23, may have been sung with the eikones of the wedding feast, but it is too badly fragmented to be certain. It compares someone to the infamous beauty Helen and her daughter Hermione, using the verb eisk6, and ends with reference to an all-night vigil, which was sometimes kept outside of the bridal chamber by friends of the bride and groom (cf. Sappho 30). 7. See note 6. 8. The obscenity of this fragment was noticed first by G. S. Kirk; the roof must be raised because the bridegroom is "fantastically ithyphallic" ("A Fragment of Sappho Reinterpreted," Classical Quarterly 13 [1963]: 51-52). This suggestion has been further supported by H. Lloyd-Jones, "Sappho Fr. 111," Classical Quarterly 17 (1967): 168, and J. Killeen, "Sappho Fr. 111," Classical Quarterly 23 (1973): 198. Dissent is expressed by M. Marcovich, "On Sappho fr. 111 LP," Humanidades 5/6 (1963-64): 223-27, and K. J. McKay, "Door Magic and the Epiphany Hymn," Classical Quarterly 17 (1967): 189. 9. The context of Sappho 44 has been the subject of some debate. Wilamowitz was the first to suggest that this song was composed to celebrate a real wedding ("Neue lesbische Lyrik," Neue ahrbiicher 33 [1914]: 229-47). This view was accepted until it was challenged by A. Lesky, (A History of Greek Literature, trans. J. Willis and C. de Heer [London: Methuen, 1966], p. 142; so also J. Kakridis, "Zur Sappho 44 LP," Wiener Studien 79 [1966]: 21-26), who claims that the comparison of the bride and groom to Hector and Andromache would have been inauspicious. In response to this view, W. Rosler has pointed out that comparison to Hector is no more an ill omen than comparison to Achilles, also a victim of the Trojan War, whom we know was the subject of one of Sappho's wedding songs ("Ein Gedicht und sein Publikum: Oberlegungen zu Sappho Fr. 44 LP," Hermes 103 [1975]: 275-85). 10. On the significance of the emphasis on the guests at the wedding, see R6sler, loc. cit., note 9. 11. Other examples are Sappho fr. 112; Euripides, Phaethon 240, Trojan Women 311; Aristophanes, Birds 1722and 1725, Peace 1333; TheocritusIdyll 18.16. Onlyonce is the bride pronounced makaria, in the Trojan Women (312), a song sung by the bride herself in a state of frenzy and clearly not a typical wedding song. The Greeks seem to have felt the same reserve that we do in our tradition of congratulating only the groom. 141</page><page sequence="12">Rebecca H. Hague 12. Both Sappho 105a and 105c are placed in a singing contest at the end of the wedding feast by J. A. Davison (From Archilochus to Pindar [New York: St. Martin's Press, 1968], pp. 242-46). His reconstruction is based on the Latin singing contest at a wedding feast depicted in Catullus 62, in which the young women oppose the separation of the bride from her family, and the men urge the completion of the ceremony. Thus the men sang the song comparing the bride to an apple, implying that the bride is in danger of withering, in response to the girls' song about the hyacinth, which describes the deflowering of the bride. There is slight evidence for such a contest in Greece; Himerius says that Sappho made songs for the bridal chamber "after the contests" (Orationes IX.4); and in modern Greek weddings, the bride's mother sometimes sings songs of lamentation when her daughter leaves the house (M. Alexiou, The Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1974], pp. 120-22). Davison's theory that the apple song is intended to tease the bride about her age is attractive, for why else would Sappho emphasize the fact that this bride was one of the last picked? But the hyacinth song is closer to Catullus 11, a song about abused love, than it is to the lines of Catullus's wedding song to which Davison compares it. Catullus's wedding song describes a carefully tended garden flower, not a wildflower in the mountains. And Sappho's reference to shepherds is an unlikely metaphor for the groom, since they are plural. On the wedding imagery of Catullus 11, see E. Frankel, "Vesper adest," Journal of Roman Studies 45 (1955): 5-6. For a different view of the apple song (Sappho 105a), that it is simply a compliment to the bride's forbearance, see Himerius Orationes IX.16; A. Gomme, "Interpretations of Some Poems of Alkaios and Sappho," Journal of Hellenic Studies 77 (1957): 260; M. Treu, Sappho (Munich: E. Heimeran, 1954), pp. 152-53,223-24; and H. Frinkel, Early Greek Poetry and Philosophy, trans. M. Hadas and J. Willis (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1973), p. 172. For a fine discussion of Catullus 62 and a study of the symbolism of flowers and fruit, see E. Stigers, "Retreat from the Male: Catullus 62 and Sappho's Erotic Flowers," Ramus 6:2 (1977): 83-102. Her contention that the image of a flower was not considered to be appropriate for a bride is refuted by Michael Italikos's reference to Sappho's comparison of brides to "the delicate beauty of roses" (noticed by P. Wirth, "Neue Spuren eines Sapphobruchstiicks," Hermes 91 [1963]: 115-17; Addenda 117A Lobel- Page). Nevertheless, her proposed metaphorical progression from flowers for young maidens to fruit for sexually initiated women can still stand, as the bride is at a liminal stage and could therefore be compared appropriately to a flower or a ripe piece of fruit. 13. The Archilochus fragment was published by R. Merkelbach and M. L. West, "Ein Archilochos-Papyrus," Zeitschrift fiir Papyrologie und Epigraphik 14 (1974): 97-113. Among the subsequent articles which discuss the significance of the setting, see J. Van Sickle, "The New Erotic Fragment of Archilochus," Quaderni Urbinati di Cultura Classica 20 (1975): 128-29; J.

Bremer, "The Meadow of Love and Two Passages in Euripides' Hippolytus," Mnemosyne 28 (1975): 268-80. There is a list of passages in which a meadow is the setting for the love-making of gods in A.

Motte suggests that the erotic significance of flowery fields derives from their identification with Gaia (Earth), the recipient of the see of Ouranos (Sky), as well as from their function as the "couche nuptiale" of Zeus and Hera. "Sous son aspect dynamique, l'image montre en outre le giron divin qui s'entrouvre et elle manifeste par anticipation la merveilleuse fecondite de cette double union, qui en realite n'en fait qu'une" (Motte, Prairies et jardins, p. 218). 15. The allusions to a coming wedding are so strong that W. J. Woodhouse has suggested that Homer is making use of a folktale in which a prince disguised as a castaway marries the daughter of the king whose land he has reached (The Composition of Homer's Odyssey [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1930], pp. 54-65). But N. Austin argues convincingly that the many references to marriage are "generated not by an anonymous folktale, but by the story of the marriage of Odysseus and Penelope which occurs later in the poem" (Archery at the Dark of the Moon [Berkeley: University of California Press, 1975], p. 275 n. 13). J. Winkler has recently suggested that this passage in the Odysse.y is imitated by Sappho, who takes the role of Odysseus in Fr. 31 ("Gardens of nymphs: Public and private in Sappho's lyrics," in Reflections of Women in Antiquity, ed. H. Foley [New York: Gordon and Breach, 1981], pp. 73-76); I would argue that both Homer and Sappho use the traditional language of wedding songs. The language of Homer's passage clearly seems suitable for a wedding in the eyes of the rhetorician "Dionysius," who cites the end of this passage from Homer in his instructions on composing wedding speeches (X.6 p. 271 UsenerRadermacher). 16. It is worth noting that the two examples in archaic art of nature showing sympathy for man are vase-paintings of palm trees which droop over mourning or dying people (Boulogne 558 and Naples 2422, noted and discussed by J. M. Hurwit, "Palm Trees and the Pathetic Fallacy in Archaic Greek Poetry and Art," Classical Journal 77 [1982]: 193-99). Odysseus has chosen a plant compatible with his position as suppliant. 17. Other examples are Sappho 141 and Theocritus Idyll 18.50-53. 18.
