<plain_text><page sequence="1">Israel Exploration Journal VOLUME 35 NUMBERS 2-3 1985 A Phoenician Inscription from 'Akko* M. DOTHAN University of Haifa During the seventh season of excavations at Tel 'Akko in 1980, a Phoenician inscription written on a rim and body fragment of a pottery bowl was discovered.1 This inscription immediately aroused special attention, for its length (seven lines) is considerably greater than that of other Phoenician inscriptions found to date at 'Akko, which consist only of single words or several letters. The inscription is, moreover, the longest Phoenician cursive inscription yet found in Israel.2 Before proposing a reading and translation of the inscription, it is necessary to describe the exact provenance of the ostracon and the circumstances surrounding its * Published in slightly different form in Hebrew in El 18 (1985), pp. 116-123, PI. 23. I wish to express my sincere thanks to friends and colleagues with whom I discussed this inscription and who advised me on its reading and interpretation: Profs. N. A vigad, J.C. Greenfield, . Mazar and J. Naveh of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem; Prof. M. Heltzer of the University of Haifa; E. Puech of the Ecole biblique et arch?ologique, Jerusalem; and Prof. A. Millard of the University of Liverpool. Special thanks are due to Profs. F.M. Cross of Harvard University and . Peckham of the University of Toronto, with whom I discussed mainly the paleographical problems of the inscription. I am most grateful to the photographic laboratory of the Israel Police Headquarters for the fine infra-red photographs of the ostracon that appear here.

It was found in the northern section of the mound (Area A) in a stratum which lies above the remains of the early terre pis?e rampart (Fig. 1). The remains of the buildings found in this area in the 1980 season date mainly from the Persian and Hellenistic periods. Most of the Hellenistic buildings were found in a poor state of preservation, owing primarily to cultivation of the surface of the mound in the nineteenth century. Several buildings of the Persian period (c. 530-330 B.C.E.) were better preserved, and it is possible at least in part to reconstruct their plans. Reconstruction of these buildings is aided by the plans of adjacent Persian period structures discovered in previous seasons of excavation.3 The foundations of large Persian period buildings oriented north-east-south-west were found; among them, the remains of a probably once imposing structure are of special interest. Sections of thick perpendicular walls and their corner joint were traced. These walls are partly of solid Phoenician construction in header-stretcher style. The finds from this- area, in addition to the common pottery of the period, included small objects such as figurines. 3 M.

To the south of this structure, an alley apparently leading to the large building mentioned above was discovered. In the easternmost room of the structure were four bases of columns which seem to have served a dual purpose: to support the ceiling and to divide the room into a roofed section and an open courtyard. Two superimposed floors were found in this room and large amounts of Persian period pottery were associated with both levels. Both floors were partly damaged and a section of one wall was disturbed in antiquity. The ensuing robber's trench was filled with dirt and debris, including many sherds from the Persian period. It is as yet impossible to determine whether this material accumulated over an extended period, with the debris from the Persian period floor levels gradually filling the robber's trench, or whether the pit was intentionally filled with this debris in the Hellenistic period. Among the sherds in this debris, almost all of which are from the Persian period, two ostraca were found. One of them bore a series of numbers with connecting waws. The second bore the seven-line inscription which is the subject of this paper. The inscription is written on both sides of a discarded late Iron Age II sherd (PL 13:A- )? It was drawn in black ink over the reddish, unevenly applied slip. The first four lines are on the outside of the sherd; the three remaining lines continue on the inside. A margin is left on the right side of the inscription on both the outside and the inside of the sherd. The slip has peeled off in several places, removing parts of some letters. In other cases the ink has splashed or peeled off, leaving the reading of a few letters open to different interpretations.4 The inscription reads: D ux hp tmn nb mn mbi mwx bv nbwb 2 WDDl " "'z ?X^DDl ? 3 ?bVmxzx mix 4 *** ?Dato?* 5 / /;/ m /ixz E 0 6 -fz rnyxmpTi 7 1 By order: to the guild of (metal?) artisans; they shall give a valuable basin 2 to nbw, the overseer of the shrine(s); (likewise they shall give) metal cups (golden?) 3 10, and vessels with inlay (round ringstands?) 25, and large 4 pyxides 70, and pots (on stands) 5 60, and decanters 60, and 6 smiths' blown vessels 57 7 and small deep bowls 30. 4 These letters are indicated below in the paleographical commentary.</page><page sequence="4">84 M. DOTHAN COMMENTARY Line L 2. The reading of bet and taw is certain, though dalet might be challenged (see however below, p. 88). m in the meaning of 'law, command, order' was absorbed into Hebrew, Aramaic and Neo-Babylonian from Persian.5 In Phoenician inscriptions it appears only once, in the tariff inscription from Kition.6 Though the dalet there is not absolutely certain, most scholars now agree on the reading m.7 It would thus seem possible, because of the reading in our inscription, to restore the first, damaged letter of the Kition inscription as bet, resulting in 2. Such a restoration is more likely than the proposed restorations of my or niD.8 In our inscription the meaning of n*D, 'by order, according to the law', seems to be most acceptable. ttnn 3D1?. The preposition ~b seems to be in the meaning 'for, to'. Apparently we should read in the plural E , meaning members of an artisans' guild, most probably metal-workers. If 33 in the singular were intended, a personal name would have preceded the profession. Although the personal name 3 is found, mainly in late texts, this does not seem to be the case here.9 5 m appears in the Bible several times; in Hebrew in the book of Esther and in Aramaic in the books of Ezra and Daniel, m certainly meant law, as in Dan. 6:15 (MT 6:16), DIDI "H?V m, 'the law of the Medes and Persians'. Twice the preposition "2 is prefixed to ; "JHVk ma, 'according to the law of thy God' (Ezra 7:14) and nnVx 2, 'concerning the law of his god' (Dan. 6:5; MT 6:6). Once "2 is the preposition of the plural, 0 3 2, 'by the laws of the Persians and the Medes' (Est. 1:19). It should be noted that the preposition "2 in Hebrew is also used with words close to m in meaning, such as , 'commandment' (2 Chron. 24:21; Neh. 12:24). For the use of "2 in Phoenician as an instrumental or functional preposition, see S. Segert: A Grammar of Phoenician and Punic, Munich, 1976, p. 208. For the occurrence of the Persian loan word d?in?' in an Aramaic inscription from the fourth century B.C.E., see F.M. Cross: An Ostracon from Nebi Yunis, IEJ 14 (1964), p. 186. 6 The Kition inscription, first published in CIS I, No. 86A-B in 1881, has been republished and discussed many times during recent years. Among the latest thorough treatments of the subject are J.B. Peckham: Notes on a Fifth-Century Inscription from Kition, Cyprus (CIS 86), Orientalia 37 (1968), pp. 304-324; J.P. Healey: The Kition Tariffs and the Phoenician Cursive Series, BASOR 216 (1974), pp. 53-60. A very useful review of most of the literature on the subject is to be found in Kition III, pp. 103-126, which includes a discussion of O. Masson and M. Sznycer's article on the subject in Recherches sur les Ph?niciens ? Chypre, Paris, 1972, pp. 21-68. 7 Healey (above, . 6), p. 56. 8 As Peckham suggests (above, . 6). 9 For the use of ~b as 'to, for', see the standard dictionaries and grammars. For un as a craftsman, see Kition inscription 86A (above, n. 6). For unn as an artisan using bellows, see Isa. 54:16. See also Z. Harris: A Grammar of the Phoenician Language, New Haven, 1936, p. 87; DISO, p. 97; M. Sznycer: Une inscription punique trouv?e ? Monte Sirai (Sardaigne), Semitica 15 (1965), pp. 38-43. For artisans' guilds, see I. Mendelsohn: Guilds in Ancient Palestine, BASOR 80 (1940), pp. 17-21. Especially significant is the use of the plural for the members of a guild, e.g. D,N,,23n"'32, 2 Kings 2:3, 5 (ibid., p. 18). For the Persian period, see e.g. Neh. 3:31. It seems that in Phoenician the term 203 was used for metal-casters and for artisans generally and metal-workers specifically; see M. Heltzer: A Recently Discovered Phoenician Inscription, Atti del I congresso internazionale di studi fenici e punici, Rome, 1983, pp. 119-123, where the author argues for 203 as a member of the Phoenician guild of metal-casters which maintained the professional status they had since the days of Ugarit. At Ugarit they were part of the royal economy and received raw materials from the royal stores to which they subsequently delivered their finished product.</page><page sequence="5">phoenician inscription from a 85 an* . Jussive imperfect plural, '(that) they shall give'.10 It seems that here the phrase parallels the Hebrew in meaning as it does in syntactical structure, e.g. As a bowl or container usually made of metal, this word is known in Akkadian11 and Ugaritic;12 in these languages refers to a large vessel. This is not always the case in the Bible, e.g. Song of Songs 7:2 (MT 7:3), Isa. 22:24, where 3 means a small vessel.13 However, in Exod. 24:6 (MT 24:7) the plural seems to mean large basins, as it does in the Arad ostraca.14 In Phoenician HK is found at Kition.15 Line 2. "QD is known from Phoenician inscriptions as a verb meaning 'to honour, respect'. In Punic, as in Hebrew, it appears also as a noun, 'honour, glory'. Here it is probably an adjective, 'valuable'.16 It may conceivably be a pi el plural from the verb (Hebrew 2?), with the translation '(and thus) honoured'. nVtP. An unknown personal name possibly originating from the root bxw with the alef contracted, similar to bwnbw from ^XTiVkw.17 by u?k ('the overseer'). Its equivalent by appears several times in the Bible, mainly in the title by which also occurs on seals and sealings and on a tomb For bn hrs as a member of such a guild, see M. Dietrich: Die Keilalphabetischen Texte aus Ugarit, Kevelaer, 1976,4, 214, col. 2:15, p. 247. For the personal name ttnn p, see CIS I, No. 637. 10 The pronoun IPX or U? is usually equivalent to W or ItPK in the Bible (see below, nn. 19-22) and H in Aramaic. In the later books of the Bible becomes a conjunction similar to (see the standard dictionaries, s.v.). For example of U? in the meaning of 'that, in order' see E.

The singular feminine noun here probably means a shrine or temple.26 At 'Akko, where a shrine probably stood adjacent to the find spot of the ostracon, such a meaning seems certain. In Phoenician mwx as a shrine or temple of the god of Hamon appears in the Ma'sub inscription.27 In the masculine form ItPX it occurs in the bilingual inscription from Pyrgi28 and in Punic as tinpn ,29 and lately possibly in this meaning in Hebrew in the Kuntillet 'Ajrud inscription.30 In all these cases the shrine is linked to the name of a god or goddess. The absence of the name of a deity may indicate that here several shrines are referred to. The continuation of the text testifies to the large amount of objects brought to a place which must have been a well-established shrine. This word begins the enumeration of these objects. This noun, like others 18 Gen. 44: 1; 1 Kings 4:6, 16:9, 18:3; 2 Kings 15:5, 18:18, 19:2; Isa. 22:15, 36:3; S.H. Hooke: A Scarab and Sealing from Tell Duweir, PEFQSt (1935), pp. 195-196; N.

Line 3. ?K^?? is previously unknown in Phoenician. The root is certainly K^?, 'to fill' as in nx*?D, a full, brimming pool. Thepu'al plural participle dx^?? appears in the Bible as inlays or insets; here it may mean round ringstands.35 nu?DD. These objects appear in the highest number (70) in the inscription. The word is unknown in Semitic languages; it seems to be a Phoenician plural form of the Greek , 'box'.36 This type of vessel is well known from archaeological finds, both in pottery and in metal. From the talmudic usage of KODIp, the metathesized form of this word, we know that such vessels were used to store clothes and coins.37 Line 4. , 'large', is an antonym of the adjective , 'small', as in Line 7. is well known in Ugaritic,38 Hebrew,39 Phoenician and Punic.40 ?d^ is unknown in Phoenician, the nearest root being dV, xd^ in Jewish Aramaic. According to the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan (Lev. 6:5), the meaning is chiefly 'to arrange in courses',41 but this would hardly make sense as a noun in our inscription. It 31 Zech. 4:3; Eccles. 12:6; cf.

DOTHAN may, however, be the Phoenician plural of the Greek a (flat dish, plate) or ? (kettle, cauldron), which in talmudic Hebrew and Aramaic became OD^K, DD^N or DD^, 02V.42 The suggested Phoenician version, which lacks the suffix 0", probably had the same meaning as in Greek ? generally a cooking vessel but sometimes a deep bowl made to be set on a stand. For an example of the lack of the Greek ending in Phoenician, compare the Greek a (oil), which in the Phoenician form becomes Line 5. ?D^V. The closest parallel to this word is the plural of pjfr, well known in Aramaic and late Hebrew as a term for a wine flask or water decanter; its origin is the Greek a (flask, flagon).44 It seems that in the plural ?3^&gt; became ??jfr, either through a scribal error or because of assimilation of the nun to the mem of the plural.45 Line 6. nriD^? must be from the root 33 , ^"?, which defines the metal-worker. The noun therefore refers to vessels made by the blowing and hammering technique and not by casting, 203. The singular would be riD^D. In Ugaritic the dual means 'bellows', as does the singular mD? in Hebrew. The yod after the mem may appear as early as the fifth century B.C.E. and represents a diphthong or a long vowel, e.g. ttnp? = unp'D.46 Line 7. mtfX mp*7. If the first letter is bet, i.e. mp2, these are cattle or heifers which were presumably brought for sacrifice. The closest form in the feminine is found in Jewish Aramaic in Palestine ? mp2.47 However, if we read the first letter as dalet, as I prefer, the word is mpl, meaning deep copper bowls, as in Ugaritic48 and Akkadian.49 42 For a as a loan word appearing in many variants in late Hebrew and Aramaic, see S. Krauss: Griechische und lateinische Lehnw?rter im Talmud, Midrasch und Targum, II, Berlin, 1899, p. 318.

Most of the letters appear more than once and many of them show some variations. Their height ranges between 3 and 12 mm. There seems to be no significant difference between the forms of the letters on the two sides of the sherd, though some on the outside, like sade and qof, seem to be executed with special care. However, parts of more letters have peeled off on the outside than on the inside, and m?re letters are faded on the inside than on the outside of the sherd. The letters towards the end of the first line, especially the last two, are more congested and shorter than the others. Apparently the scribe found it difficult to write these letters on the bulging lower part of the rim. Alef appears six times. The letters are similar to one another: a slightly slanting curved shaft with a stroke across the upper part of the shaft and the parallel lower stroke always attached to the shaft. This form is very similar to that ctn Ostracon A at Sidon50 and those from Elephantine.51 Bet appears four times, though the last one, in Line 7, may be a dalet. Its stance is generally bent to the right. The first bet (the first letter of the inscription) is attached to the next letter (dalet) by its upper part; since a fragment of ink has peeled off, the bet looks rather unusual. There are parallels to the 'Akko bets in some of the Sidon variations52 and in the tariff from Kition;53 the closest parallels, however, are with the Elephantine ostraca.54 Gimel appears three times. It twice has the usual form with the right leg thicker and longer than the left; the gimel in the first line is a shorter, equilateral version, probably executed in this way because of lack of space towards the end of the first line. The standard form has parallels at Kition55 and especially in the Elephantine ostraca.56 Dalet appears three or four times and is drawn similarly to bet with a short shaft. The form of the first dalet (in the first word) could be established only after its detachment from the preceding bet. Several variants of this form are found at Kition57 and Sidon,58 but the closest parallels are to be found in the Elephantine ostraca, where a variety of stances of dalet occur.59 50 Vanel, Table 1A. 51 Lidzbarski, No. 44. 52 Vanel, Table IB, especially the first and the last examples. 53 CIS I, No. 86A.

Neither this letter nor the dalet in the second line, which is similarly drawn, could be ayin, as suggested orally by Prof. F.M. Cross.</page><page sequence="10">90 M. DOTHAN Waw, which appears six times, is very distinctive, with an arch-like curved head joining the top of the shaft from the left. In the last two examples this hook becomes almost a saddle-like feature on the top of the shaft (once leaning to the left), reminiscent of an early Karatepe waw. There are affinities to the first variation at Kition and mainly at Elephantine60 and to the second in the Mit Rahine ostracon.61 Het9 which appears twice, is of the bold well-developed type without a trace of horizontal bars. The first variant has three vertical slightly curved strokes with the middle one touching the outer ones; its closest parallel is in the Elephantine ostraca.62 The other example has three completely free strokes; the closest comparisons are again from Kition and Elephantine.63 Yod appears twice; both variants have the late horizontal form which is somewhat similar to the Kition examples,64 though the parallels are even closer to the Elephantine ostraca.65 Kaf appears in two variations, both with a straight shaft leaning to the right. The first, which is shorter, has its head bent up at a sharp angle to the top of the shaft; parallel forms appear at Elephantine.66 The second kaf has a taller shaft with traces of what may possibly be a pronged end to the head, though a sharp bend downwards is more probable. If it does bend, it is somewhat similar to the kaf in the Eshmun'azor inscription67 and a fourth-century example from Kition.68 Lamed appears eight times and consists of a leftward leaning, sometimes slightly bent shaft, a very short horizontal foot and a downward curved tick on its end. A rare parallel in this period comes from Elephantine.69 Lamed with such a tick is generally later and more characteristic of the Punic script. Mem also appears eight times and it shows some variants, the body being differently curved. The central line, varying from almost horizontal to almost vertical, is drawn in one fairly long stroke. The closest parallels are at Kition70 and Elephantine.71 Nun displays two variants in its four occurrences. The first, which retains a shoulder (the remains of a vertical top and a horizontal base line), is related to nuns with a sharply bent shoulder, for example those of the Saqqara papyri.72 The second variant is an 60 Lidzbarski, Nos. 11, 26; the other type is exemplified in No. 34c. 61 N.

Both variants also appear at Elephantine.73 'Ayin appears twice; its distinctive character leaves no doubt as to its identification. The letter has a very prominent V-shaped form comprised of two strokes. The top of the 'ayin is open in some occurrences of the cursive script from c. 500 B.C.E. onwards. However, even the closest parallels, such as the Elephantine ostraca74 or the papyrus published by Aim?-Giron,75 do not have the pronounced form of the examples in our ostracon. Pe appears twice or three times (that in Line 4 is uncertain). Both the certain pes lean to the right; the taller one with a small triangular head has a good parallel in Elephantine,76 as does the shorter example with the head up.77 The probable pe in Line 4 leans unusually to the left; the only parallel is at Sidon.78 The alternate reading for this letter, resh, is less convincing. Sade. In its only appearance, this letter has a well-drawn and regular shape; the top of the shaft and the top of the head are of the same height. It is closely paralleled in inscriptions from Sidon79 and to some extent in the Elephantine ostraca, where the sade is shorter and broader.80 Qof. This solitary letter at 'Akko has a very interesting shape; it is comprised of a small shaft and a partly enclosing right loop, the left one being already lost. This seems to be the result of the tendency seen in the Kition inscription81 and at Elephantine, where qof sometimes retains only its right loop.82 Resh occurs five times. Three of the letters lean slightly to the left and have a rounded head; two have a vertical stance and a horizontal, angular head. The first type is well attested at Elephantine.83 The angular-headed resh is known at Sidon, though there the shaft tends to be curved.84 Shin. There are two types among the six shins in the inscription. Three times the letter appears in the sawtoothed 'archaizing' form well known at Elephantine.85 Two or possibly three examples are letters with the ink partly splashed and partly peeled off; 73 Lidzbarski, Nos. 2, 8, 9, 15c, 44. 74 Lidzbarski, Nos. 4, 8, 11, 13, 14b, 15c, 41. 75 N.

It has a quite uniform stance tilted to the right on an almost straight shaft, with the crossbar drawn from the top of the shaft or near it almost vertically to the right. The closest parallels are at Elephantine.88 CONCLUSIONS The inscription provides evidence for the existence of a Phoenician temple at 'Akko. The appearance of the inscription and its well-drawn script confirm that this was an order, possibly a copy, issued by a high authority, perhaps even from the office of the governor of the city. According to this order, the guild of metal-workers is to give the man in charge of the temple (or temples) a precious basin; it is also ordered to donate other metal vessels, some of which were probably of precious metals. We have here the first written evidence for a Phoenician cult at 'Akko and a fleeting glimpse of the political and socio-economic aspects of the life of the city. The inscription was found in a structure that was probably used for administrative and storage purposes. Nearby, a well-constructed wall uncovered in the early seasons of excavation is apparently all that remains of the Phoenician temple itself. Of particular importance in this connection are the artifacts of cultic character found in the pit with the ostracon and in the neighbouring area in the Persian period stratum; zoomorphic and anthropomorphic male and female figurines, feet of broken statues and the lower part of a seated goddess inscribed with Cypriote syllabary (?) signs. The inscription enriches our knowledge of the Phoenician language, its vocabulary and its syntax. In addition to the new expressions of clear Semitic origin, a number of Phoenician words seemingly of foreign provenance appear here for the first time. Although the origin of some of these is not yet certain, if I am correct in my interpretation the ostracon contains the earliest known evidence of Greek words entering Phoenician.89 As regards the date of the ostracon, it undoubtedly belongs to the period of Persian rule. The pit in which it was found yielded only finds from this period. The pal?ographie analysis points to the fifth century B.C.E., more specifically to the first half of that century and probably to its early part. In pal?ographie terms it is closest to the 86 CIS I, No. 111. 87 Lidzbarski, Nos. 7, 23, 52, 58. 88 Lidzbarski, Nos. 12, 27, 30, 59. 89 For the introduction of Greek words into West Semitic languages, see A. Montgomery: Interpreters' Critical Commentary: Daniel, Edinburgh, 1922, p. 22. It is probable that the entry was made much earlier than the third century B.C.E.; see Braun (above, n. 31), pp. 24-27.

After the campaign of Cambyses against Egypt in 526 B.C.E., 'Akko became an important military, economic and administrative centre either as an independent city or as part of the Tyrian Kingdom and continued to be so during the entire Persian period.90 By then the Phoenician fleet and the Greek mercenaries in the eastern Mediterranean were an indispensable factor in the Persian empire.91 We may ascribe the Greek elements in the inscription to the flourishing trade carried out by Phoenician 'Akko with the Greek world.92 On the other hand, the wine or oil jars inscribed in Phoenician found at Elephantine must have come from a territory where Phoenician was written and which was rich in oil and wine. Such a territory might have been in southern Phoenicia, western Galilee as far as the Carmel ridge; its capital served by then as the main port for the maritime trade between southern Phoenicia and Egypt. It is therefore significant that the script of 'Akko, but for a few letters, shows a tradition similar to that of many of the Elephantine ostraca. It may be that some of the wine or oil jars found at Elephantine came to Egypt from the territory of'Akko.93 Until the current excavations the main evidence about 'Akko of the Persian period came from fragmentary mentions by Greek writers and from scanty archaeological finds. This first substantial inscription in Phoenician from 'Akko is a significant addition 90 Strabo, Geography, XVI, 2, 25-26; Diodorus Siculus, XV, 41, 3. There is no definite evidence for 'Akko's being an independent city within the frame of the satrapy of Ebir nari, though it certainly was a royal fortress. There are two schools of thought in this matter: one represented by Kahrstedt, for whom 'Akko formed part of the kingdom of Tyre, the other represented by Leutze and Galling, which speaks for 'Akko's independence. There is meagre evidence for both sides; the lack of 'Akko's own coinage in the Persian period seems to add weight to the view that even though the city was an important one it may still have been dependent on Tyre; see PR WE, 1959, cols. 1883-1886, s.v. Ptolemais. 91 Herodotus, Hist?ri??, III, 19; VII, 89-99. 92 Large amounts of Aegean pottery, at first East Greek and later Attic, as well as of other provenance, found from Al-Mina on the Syrian coast to Mesad Hashavyahu and Ashdod on the southern Palestinian coast attest to the scope of the Greek trade with Phoenicia and Philistia, if not necessarily to Greek colonization. 93 As noted above, some of the letters of our ostracon demonstrate a link with letters at Saqqara. Is it pure coincidence that an 'Aki (a man from 'Akko) appears in the more or less contemporary ostraca from Saqqara (Aim?-Giron [above, n. 75], pp. 18, 19) and Memphis (P. Magnanini: Le iscrizioni fenici de Oriente, Rome, 1973, p. 69) and in one of the fourth-century B.C.E. inscriptions at Abydos? (CIS I, Nos. 99-100; M. Lidzbarski: Ephemeris f?r semitische Epigraphik, III, Glessen, 1915, p. 27). In Lidzbarski, p. 20, the author suggests that the wine jars were sent from Phoenicia to the Phoenician colony in Memphis and later distributed to places like Elephantine. For the people of 'Akko in the Persian period, see also M. Heltzer: The People of Aecho in Phoenician and Punic Documents, in Festschrift Hecht (above, n. 18), pp. 142-143. It is still too early to fix exactly the absolute chronology of the early Persian stratum at 'Akko (4b) where our ostracon was found. This stratum could not, however, end later than in 390 B.C.E., with the conquest of the coast by the Cypriote Evagoras and the Egyptian Akhoris; a stone altar base bearing the latter's name was found at 'Akko. The next Persian stratum in 'Akko starts most probably, both on the mound and in the lower city, with Pharnabasos who reconquered the coast in c. 380 B.C.E. (Diodorus Siculus, XV, 41). This date may serve as the terminus ad quern, therefore, for the ostracon from 'Akko.</page><page sequence="14">94 M. DOTHAN to Phoenician epigraphy and paleography.
