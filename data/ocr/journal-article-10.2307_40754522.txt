<plain_text><page sequence="1">Priscilla Johnston Tennyson's Demeter and Persephone Theme: Memory and the "Good Solid" Past The story of Persephone's exile and return, one of the best-known Greek myths, was especially familiar to Tennyson, whose father drilled him in the classics with a vigor that left the pupil fluent in ancient languages and the tutor "frozen or rather suffocated with Latin and Greek."1 The myth seems to have haunted Tennyson throughout his long career: he took pains, for example, to preserve a school exercise written before his fourteenth year, which rendered a somewhat fire-and-brimstone translation of Claudian's De Raptu Proserpinœ in heroic couplets.2 Later the story not only resurfaced in numerous allusions and similes, but also provided a capstone for the long series of dramatic monologues on classical themes, "De- meter and Persephone" of 1889. Like so many of the themes and images established in the early poetry, the legend of Persephone became central to Tennyson's conception of himself as a poet-^so central that it provided the structural basis for a large number of poems that do not explicitly adopt mythological motifs: ioxMaud, for both "Locksley Halls," for such English idyls as "Dora" or "Aylmer's Field," and even for parts of In Memoriam. Ultimately, it gave the poet a framework for his most basic concerns, allowing him to explore the nature of both past and present, the laws of change and continuity, the idea of progress, and, finally, the effi- cacy of memory as a tool which might redeem a vanished ideal from "the curse of time." Tennyson's version of the Persephone myth has attracted a good deal of critical attention, much of it focusing upon the flower maid- en as the poet's alter ego. G. Robert Stange, for example, views her as Tennyson's "definition of the attributes of an artist- imperial, disimpassioned, who moves between divided and distinguished worlds" of reality and the imaginative state. Hades is the latter, the voyage underground showing "the poet's penetration of the Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Vol. 20, No. 1, Spring 1978 ©1978 by the University of Texas Press 0040-4691/78/2001-0068$02.15</page><page sequence="2">Tennyson 's Demeter and Persephone Theme • 69 realm of the imagination, the forbidden region of shadows which must be entered before the highest beauty or the highest meaning of experience may be perceived."3 E. D. H. Johnson also sees Per- sephone and Hades as the poet and his subconscious in much the same way as Stange: for him the poem "becomes a symbolic repre- sentation of Tennyson's entire poetic career. Beneath his artistic productivity lay dark depths of consciousness on communion with which, rather than on any external stimulus, depended his will to create."4 From this perspective, Persephone emerges as the crea- tive personality itself, obscured in the complexities and confusions of adult experience; it remains for Demeter, "the sensitive mind searching for creativity,"5 to get in touch with her visionary other half. Stange 's and Johnson's perceptive readings might, however, be qualified by another look at both "Demeter and Persephone" and the numerous poems in which Tennyson seems to use a similar roster of symbols, all of which suggest that Persephone is not so much a symbol for lost artistic creativity as she is the essence of a lost past in general that the mature, chastened artist needs to re- vive. Indeed, Tennyson's many expressions of longing for such an ideal past generally show close affinities between the flower maid- en, her pastoral landscape, and the bucolic scenery that the poet associates specifically with the world of the past. In one of his few surviving letters to Emily Sellwood, for example, Tennyson explains that "to me the far-off world seems nearer than the present, for in the present is always something unreal and indistinct, but the other seems a good solid planet, rolling round its green hills and paradises to the harmony of steadfast laws." He elaborates upon this associa- tion between pastoral landscape and an ideal past in still another letter that describes "dim mystic sympathies with tree and hill reaching far back into childhood. A known landskip is to me an old friend, that continually talks to me of my own youth and half- forgotten things, and indeed does more for me than many an old friend that I know. An old park is my delight, and I could tumble about in it forever."6 Such pastoral landscape, then, encompasses for Tennyson a wide range of experiences having to do with a van- ished past: in particular, it suggests to him lucid vision, in contrast to the "unreal and indistinct" present; and it expresses a kind of joyous harmony between the natural and human worlds, in which man, possessing the instinctive wisdom of the child and primitive, could once communicate with the vital presences in his bucolic surroundings that are now obscured in the clouded vision of the adult poet.7 Furthermore, Tennyson generally associates this symbolic pas-</page><page sequence="3">Priscilla Johnston • 70 toral specifically with the landscape of classical mythology. The contrast between the first "Œnone"'s lush pastoral and the grim mountains of its sequel; the Lotos-Eaters' discrimination between memories cherished in a sense-drenched land and the stoney reali- ties of their homeland; the Hesperian garden, a tiny oasis of ancient wisdom within the mercantile present- any random look through the mythological poems suggests that Tennyson's concept of a per- sonal golden age in the distant past found an entirely congenial symbolism in the bucolic landscape of classical writers, a landscape that was antithetical to the barren waste of the present. To some extent, of course, such symbolism only typifies Victorian thought in general, with its sense of the past as a kind of Eden in contrast to the hellish present; and the Tennysonian landscape also owes a good deal to the conventional settings of pastoral literature as a whole. However, when the poet applies this schema of dual land- scapes-the rural parks of a lucid past and the wasteland of a dulled present- to the Persephone myth, this somewhat commonplace symbolism emerges as a fully realized system for vision, personal faith, and temporal sequence. Persephone must, in fact, have seemed a godsend to Tennyson in more ways than one, for she perfectly suits the poet's symbol- ism for the vanished past with its connotations of harmony, under- standing, joy, and perfection- qualities which were also ascribed to the girl and her setting by classical authors. As the daughter of the earth-goddess Demeter, Persephone is herself a kind of minor-grade earth-maiden, and for this reason she has her own sacred vale at Enna, in which spring reigns eternally and into which the blighting influences of mortal men cannot reach. We may then see her as a fully appropriate presiding spirit for that "good solid planet" with its "green hills and paradises" that recurs in both letters and poems as a figure for the lucid serenity of Tennyson's lost past. Persephone gives anthropomorphic form to both landscape and its private sym- bolism; and to take her away is in itself to remove love, harmony, and peace, the instinctual lucidity of innocent man- to remove, in other words, all those visionary qualities which the poet found in the world of the past. Tennyson's own "Demeter and Persephone" makes explicit this association between the flower maiden and the landscape of the past. In this case, Persephone is the pastoral of the past, so inter- changeable with the natural world that the mere touch of her foot restores verdure that had seemed dead while she was lost in Hades: "See," cries her mother, "thy foot has touched it; all the space / Of blank earth- baldness clothes itself afresh" (11. 48-49). In con- trast, the world without Persephone becomes the "unreal and in-</page><page sequence="4">Tennyson's Demeter and Persephone Theme • 71 distinct" wasteland of the Tennysonian present, which turns bar- ren without its presiding nature spirit, in response to Demeter's grief: My quick tears killed the flower, my ravings hushed The bird, and lost in utter grief I failed To send my life through olive-yard and vine And golden grain, my gift to helpless man. Rain-rotten died the wheat, the barley-spears Were hollow- husked, the leaf fell, and the sun, Pale at my grief, drew down before his time Sickening, and iEtna kept her winter snow. (11. 106-13) The story of Demeter's grief thus gave Tennyson a ready-made ar- chetype for his sense of past and present, embodied from the earli- est verse in dual landscapes, the pastoral of a vanished past and the monotonous wasteland of the present that appears elsewhere in "Ulysses," "Tithonus," and "The Death of Œnone." Given these two antithetical landscapes, we still have to explain how they became so different. The answer may lie in the poet's own sense of vision as apocalypse, a definition that not only as- sumes an antithetical past and present, but also assumes that they have been torn asunder by some huge mental or physical shock. The pattern emerges as early as the 1830 volume, in poems like "The Dying Swan," which locates the moment of vision at death, and "The Kracken," which posits the Day of Judgment for its sea- creature's emergence. Both earlier, in "Armageddon," and later, in "The Vision of Sin," the apocalyptic violence of the separation be- tween past and present is projected in the obliteration of each pro- tagonist after a brief moment of insight. In these respects even the earliest poetry shows that, at its most intense, Tennysonian vision transpires with such apocalyptic strength that it either destroys the speaker completely, as it does the Kracken or the Dying Swan, or momentarily staggers him but allows him to live on in a bleakly transformed universe. Second, Tennyson's visionaries do not effect this change for themselves: instead, they are generally accosted un- suspecting (often unwilling and unworthy) by an outside force and changed only as a result of this contact with divine consciousness. It is this apocalyptic vision that separates the present from the past for those who are left behind. To anyone familiar with the Persephone myth, such a transi- tion suggests the entrance of Aïdoneus, the god of the dead who abducts the maiden from Enna, after which the world turns waste as her mother grieves over her loss. Tennyson is never particularly</page><page sequence="5">Priscilla Johnston • 72 interested in the nature of Aïdoneus himself, however; and this omission seems especially odd if we are to read the underworld as a wellhead of creative vision, for instead of focusing upon Perseph- one and her experiences underground, Tennyson reduces the maid- en to a witless shell at A'idoneus' hands and seems bent to pass over the sojourn in Hades as an intermission of nothingness, a vac- uum. From this standpoint it seems safer to suggest that Aïdoneus and his underworld represent not the creative unconscious, but rather an ill-repressed set of destructive impulses that bring chaos whenever they are allowed to surface. Thus, in keeping with the apocalyptic nature of Tennysonian vision, what really captures the poet's attention is the cosmic disorder brought on by the god's en- trance. In his boyish translation of Claudian, for instance, Tenny- son focused upon the noise and geological upheaval caused by the rape, culminating in a vision of "all nature gone to wrack," with the displacement of seas and the explosion of voléanos. Even in 1889, his Demeter is haunted by reminders of apocalypse in the very midst of her joy, as she catches sight of the "one black blur of earth / Left by that closing chasm, through which the car / Of dark Aïdoneus rising rapt thee hence" (11. 37-39). With one eye on her daughter and the other on this geological scar, she hovers protectively, lest the naked glebe Should yawn once more into the gulf, and thence The shrilly whinnyings of the team of Hell, Ascending, pierce the glad and songful air, And all at once their arched necks, midnight-maned, Jet upward through the mid-day blossom. (11. 42-47) The incursion of Aïdoneus, then, expresses the characteristic Ten- nysonian pattern whereby having restored a semblance of orderli- ness, lucidity, and harmony to the world, the poet is forced to ad- mit that this seemingly "good solid planet" only holds in abeyance much stronger forces of anarchy, fragmentation, and benighted vision: that it is actually a fantasy realm far too fragile to shut out the forces of brutish mortality brought by the god of death. Aï- doneus thus comes as a representative of the real world in which change and death govern the universe, ruin may beset a feckless person at any time, and "helpless man" suffers because of strange disorders in the powers who rule the cosmos; and, as such, he is the deific counterpart to those other Tennysonian unwelcome out- siders: Heracles, slouching toward the Hesperides to steal the apples that will destroy civilization; Modred, leering into the precarious</page><page sequence="6">Tennyson 's Demeter and Persephone Theme • 73 bliss of Guinever's bower; and the outlaws and infidels who im- pinge upon the bright order of King Arthur's realm. No matter how limited Persephone's promise may be, seen against the much stronger forces of chaos, death, and chance, its realization becomes a major victory for the imagination. The rape myth therefore gives Tennyson a prearranged structure that neatly fulfills the elements of his own private system for vi- sion and temporal sequence, providing him with an initial golden age of joy, continuity, harmony, and simple wisdom; a second, 'vi- sionary' stage bearing terrible insights that sunder two time periods apocalyptically ; a third stage in which the world seems barren while the survivor tries to restore the lost past and all it symbolizes; and, finally, a qualified restoration, underlain by anxiety about the dark forces that might recrudesce at any time. So apt was this mythic prototype that it became something of a structural princi- ple for many of Tennyson's narrative works in general, emerging even in poems whose Victorian realism would seem to make them wholly inappropriate for mythological treatment. The prototype structure, for example, forms the pivotal scene in the English idyl "Dora" (1835). Here, as a child sits weaving flower-garlands with its adoptive mother in a pastoral setting that recalls Enna closely, a saturnine figure appears suddenly and "took the boy that cried aloud / And struggled hard. The wreath of flowers fell / At Dora's feet. She bowed upon her hands, / And the boy's cry came to her from the field, / More and more distant" (11. 99-103). After this Aïdoneus figure (Dora's uncle) vanishes with his prize, the scene closes with a characteristic rendition of the post-abduction waste- land, the bereaved woman lapsing into old memories while "the sun fell, and all the land was dark. "8 Even though this simple Words- worthian tale does not constitute anything like a detailed recon- struction of the legend, the mythic elements of flower-child, pas- toral, violent abduction, and wasteland point toward the ancient source which is delineated far more comprehensively in other idyls. In fact, the Persephone theme was especially useful in poems dealing with Tennyson's jilting by the fortune-huntress Rosa Bar- ing, manifested in plots that allow wealthy rivals to carry off be- loved women. For example, "Locksley Hall Sixty Years After" (1886) gives us Edith, whose lover sees her "like a flower among the flowers," until she is suddenly abducted by an Aïdoneus fig- ure in an apocalyptic scene: "Then a peal that shakes the portal- one has come to claim his bride, / Her that shrank, and put me from her, shrieked, and started from my side" (11. 263-64). Simi- larly, the Edith of "Aylmer's Field" (1863) inhabits an Enna-like landscape "on low knolls / That dimpling died into each other,</page><page sequence="7">Priscilla Johnston • 74 huts / At random scattered, each a nest in bloom," until the ad- vent of her sinister cousin from the other side of the world: "like a storm he came, / And shook the house, and like a storm he went" (11. 148-50, 215-16). After this violent appearance, Edith, con- fined to the house as the destined bride of her dark kinsman, pines away like Persephone in Hades, for she, like her mythic sister, has been torn from the original lover with whom she formed a natural pair. All of these poems follow the characteristic Tennysonian mo- tif of apocalyptic change from blissful past to blighted present; and, more important, all make their points by appropriating imag- ery and plots from the prototype Persephone myth, choosing Vic- torian flower-nymphs, diabolical rivals from the commercial neth- erworld, and bourgeois survivors who are characterized mainly by Demeter's favorite activities, wandering and obsessive remembrance. The Lover's Tale (1828) yields a version of the Persephone theme that is especially bizarre, perhaps because this early work disguises its mythic structure so slightly. All the myth-based materials ap- pear here as we have seen them elsewhere, beginning with a natural pair, Camilla and Julian, for whose love the Enna-like pastoral land- scape provides the special scene. "Many, many years," recalls Julian, "In the Maydews of childhood, .../... we lived together, / Apart, alone together on those hills," where "I gathered the wild herbs, and for her brows / And mine made garlands of the selfsame flow- er" (11. 178, 182-84, 334-35). An especially idyllic stroll ensues: "A day for gods to soar," as Julian terms it. Unfortunately, the next episode turns his comment into horrible truth, for Camilla, unaware of Julian's passion for her, confesses that she loves "An- other'" The admission unleashes a mythic apocalypse that effec- tively shatters the original Enna: then it seemed as though a link Of some tight chain within my inmost frame Was riven in twain: that life I heeded not Flowed from me, and the darkness of the grave. . . . Did swallow up my vision. . . . Then had the earth beneath me yawning cloven With such a sound as when an iceberg splits From cope to base- had Heaven from all her doors, With all her golden thresholds clashing, rolled Her heaviest thunder- I had lain as dead Mute, blind and motionless as then I lay; Dead, for henceforth there was no life for me! (I, 583- 86, 588, 591-97)</page><page sequence="8">Tennyson's Demeter and Persephone Theme • 75 Surely here we are getting a close approximation of the Persephone abduction, in the elements of a broken chasm to the underworld, a terrific thunder followed by the speaker's severance from his be- loved, and the devastating effect of the revelation upon his percep- tion of the natural universe: indeed, the passage bears a close re- semblance to both language and circumstances of the Claudian Rape that Tennyson had translated as a boy, in which "had all Na- ture gone to wrack again / And Earth's fell offspring burst their brazen chain, / And from the deep recesses where they lay / Up- risen in wrath to view the beam of day" (11. 63-66). In keeping with the myth's structure, the successful daemonic rival, Lionel, then appears on the scene as the "phantasm" bridegroom, and the couple leave Julian to wander disconsolately over the old Enna-like landscape, which now resembles the earth after Persephone's exit, a "dead spring . . . wholly dead, / No bud, no leaf, no flower, no fruit for me" (I, 712-13). In "Demeter and Persephone," the grieving mother had been ob- sessed with trances in which "the God of dreams . . . / Drew from thyself the likeness of thyself / Without thy knowledge, and thy shadow past / Before me" (11. 90-93). In the same way, Julian's life becomes one of waking trances obsessively focused upon Ca- milla: he hears, for example, voices in the distance calling to me And in my vision bidding me dream on, Like sounds without the twilight realm of dreams, Which wander round the bases of the hills. The vision had fair prelude, in the end Opening on darkness, stately vestibules To caves and shows of Death. (II, 117-20, 123-25) And, like Demeter, Julian receives his information about Camilla's fate in a vision of death. Thinking that he hears "four bells, four merry marriage bells," he follows what seems to be a wedding pro- cession, only to find that it is Camilla's burial cortege. He then en- counters "the very face and form of Lionel," who as master of ceremonies becomes a kind of King of Death; worse still, he re- vives Camilla from her coffin, dressed as a bride, and they go off to be married. With this vision, which culminates the fourth part of the poem, Julian has all the information that Demeter was vouch- safed: that the beloved is alive, but has been married to the King of Death; and that she pays the price for her immortality by being separated from her natural counterpart in the myth.</page><page sequence="9">Priscilla Johnston • 76 The remainder of the poem completes the mythic framework in which the mother negotiates to get her child back, then finds out that she must restore her to Hades once again. Having learned that Camilla has died in fact, Julian goes to her vault, and she comes alive under his touch, whereupon he restores her to the earth, "back to the mother's house where she was born," in fact. However, like Demeter, Julian inherits qualifying circumstances when he revital- izes his lost past: "'You know you must give me back,'" Camilla reminds him. Hence the Golden Supper, at which he restores his beloved to the rival in a scene that nearly repeats the original in- cursion of Aïdoneus: "And there the widower husband and dead wife / Rushed at each other with a cry, that rather seemed / For some new death than for a life renewed" (IV, 369-71). Thus even at poem's end Tennyson preserves the classical motif which per- meates the work from its beginning, and fulfills the basic structure of the Demeter myth. However, none of these renderings show much interest in the nature of the underworld, in the character of the visiting mythic 'god,' or in the psychology of the god-chosen maidens themselves. "Demeter and Persephone" itself brushes aside these same aspects, following its sources' firm humanist sympathies by concentrating upon the survivor and not the perfunctorily drawn maiden: indeed, the monologue nearly excludes the girl altogether by immersing her in the natural landscape, keeping her "dazed and dumb" through- out, and, because of its genre, letting her mother do all the talking. Despite this de-emphasis, however, the Christian allegory at poem's end has led commentators to pass over Demeter in favor of Per- sephone's important role as a préfiguration of Arthur Hallam (and both of them, of Christ). As a result, Demeter herself seems oddly peripheral, initially an unfulfilled mind searching for a creative principle, or later a mouthpiece for Tennyson's own Christian sen- timents.9 Yet the maiden herself remains stunned and feckless; that she returns at all is the result of her mother's immense powers. It was Demeter alone for whom the poem was originally named and whose experiences it details, and Demeter herself who gave Tennyson oc- casion to write the poem in the first place (she was, he said, "one of the most beautiful types of motherhood").10 It is Demeter, then, and not Persephone, who fills the central role in the poem; at Tennyson's hands she becomes the surrogate spirit of the poet himself, who pines amid a barren present and strives constantly to revive a lost vision- the seer whose imagination is so potent, so ag- gressive, and so persistent that it achieves the miraculous feat of</page><page sequence="10">Tennyson's Demeter and Persephone Theme • 77 reversing temporal sequence and forcing a vanished ideal back from the remote past. Within this framework Demeter primarily allows the poet to de- fine the potential of imagination and to stress the importance of memory in visionary experience. Indeed, since the world of the past epitomized in Enna is to Tennyson the one realm that is "stead- fast" and "solid," it is only natural for him to assume that mem- ory, the sole faculty that ties us to that vanished past, will become the key element in successful imagination, as it is the only means by which the mind can oppose that limbo of dead people and de- funct experiences, Hades. The myth itself is a paean to the power of memory, pitted against superhuman forces that discourage its persistence and compel oblivion; and the same preponderance of memory characterizes all of the poet's other Demeter figures. In "Aylmer's Field," for instance, the clergyman survivor turns much of the poem into a diatribe from the pulpit "in memory of" the dead girl, while both "Locksley Halls" focus upon a protagonist whose memory of an abducted lover is so strange as to border up- on the pathological. The equivalence of memory with imagination within the mythic schema is especially pronounced in "Love and Duty" (1840), a frame for Tennyson's broken engagement to Emily Sellwood. Here, the poet himself becomes a Demeter figure charac- terized by potent memory; according to his mythological system, social Duty assumes the role of Aïdoneus, a "marriage-hindering" force who "came / Like Death betwixt thy dear embrace and mine, / And crying, 'Who is this? behold thy bride,' / She pushed me from thee" (11. 47-50). In the aftermath of this sudden severance, Ten- nyson finds himself, like Demeter, "lost in utter grief" in a barren wasteland, entrapped in "sapless days, / The long mechanic pacings to and fro, / The set gray life, and apathetic end" (11. 16-18). And like Demeter waiting for Persephone's return, he stresses the im- portance of memory as the sole visionary tool that can restore the couple by maintaining contact with the lost one's spirit: "Should my Shadow cross thy thoughts / Too sadly for their peace," he recommends that Emily "remand it . . . / For calmer hours to Mem- ory's darkest hold." If her own exercise of memory proves suffi- ciently potent, she will "wake refreshed" amid a modern-day Enna, "when the first low matin-chirp hath grown / Full quire, and morn- ing driven her plow of pearl / . . . Beyond the fair green field and eastern sea" (11. 85-87, 94-96, 98). "Love and Duty'"s rape myth structure thus makes explicit what had only been suggested in the other poems that follow the same structural principle: that imagination, symbolized by Deme- ter, is a process whose powers are re-creative and commemorative,</page><page sequence="11">Priscilla Johnston -78 not fictive and escapist. Indeed, the myth's stress upon memory as the key element in a fleshy resurrection gives imaginative experi- ence as empirical basis, with its uniquely solid bias- real flesh and blood, definite times and schedules, observable changes in climate and vegetation- asserting that vision is viable and palpable, not merely the fictive construct of a connoisseur of the past. For the anxious survivor of Arthur Hallam, and the poet who sees the hopelessly lost past as the receptacle for all good things, the value of such palpable vision is inestimable. Most of Tennyson's successfully realized visions are therefore small in memoriis in a literal sense, demonstrations proving that the lost past can be reclaimed in fact, if the imaginative memory is strong enough and persistent enough in its concentration. But the poet was far from naive about the powers of the imagination; and as a result his mythic story- ^essentially one of repeated loss and a fall into experience- allows him not only to define the successful imagination but also to record its limitations and failures. Imagina- tion may have palpable results, but they are still subject to time and cannot provide more than a brief interlude that is inevitably obscured in the dark realities brought by Aidoneus. From this standpoint, Persephone's abduction is really Demeter 's story: it is she, not her daughter, who loses her innocence by being forced to admit that no matter how strong her memory is, it cannot with- stand the power of time and change that will bring the appointed hour of Persephone's return to Hades. Demeter's progress of a soul thus becomes a vehicle to record Tennyson's own initiation into experience, moving from a naive faith in the world to a crisis of realization, and finally to a troubled acceptance of human mortal- ity. In fact, much of the poem's poignancy results from its tension between two incompatible responses which Demeter brings to the visit from her married daughter, paralleling Tennyson's own diffi- culties in accepting the flaws inherent in mortality. The first- De- meter as maternal busybody-^hows the kind of immature wishful thinking that asserts factitious ideas: perhaps spring really could last forever; perhaps the maiden is still unchanged and only seems to be the "imperial disimpassioned" wife of Death. But the second type of response is a mature realization that no amount of pretend- ing can renew innocence or maintain eternal springtime in a trans- formed cosmos that has assimilated new rules of time and change. By choosing this myth, then, Tennyson is able to express the in- tensity of his longing for the pleasant fiction of an eternal Enna, and the repulsiveness of the realities that curtail its duration; but at the same time, the myth shows him rejecting the kind of escap- ist imagination that could frame a fairy-tale fiction like a permanent</page><page sequence="12">Tennyson 's Demeter and Persephone Theme • 79 Enna, in favor of the newly complex, realistic, and sophisticated awareness of Demeter. She is the mature poet who can recreate a vanished ideal but must accept its new endowment of human limitations and subservience to the facts of change, discontinuity, and death in Aïdoneus' ultimate proprietorship. There is worse still, for Tennyson also uses the Demeter figure to show how the imagination may actually become destructive. On the one hand, the very single-mindedness of Demeter's quest is nec- essary for a successful restoration of her ideal past; on the other hand, this necessary single-mindedness wreaks ruin on the goddess's own world. The earth does not turn barren by itself, just because Persephone has left it, but rather because Demeter's obsession has made her give up any provision for the future, since she ignores her responsibility to make the earth bear human food in her con- centration upon the lost ideal. Tennyson's own version of the myth emphasizes this lapse in duty by showing that mundane changes occur merely in response to the earth- goddess's shameful neglect: if flowers and birds die, it is because of her "tears" and "ravings"; if man's food wilts, it is only because "I failed / To send my life" through his vines and grain. Hence Demeter gives Tennyson a per- fect way to summarize his lifelong conflict between social respon- sibility and private imagination: as Demeter, he can focus his en- ergy upon regaining Persephone and her bright ideal of a past, al- lowing the present to turn waste; or he can relinquish Persephone forever by giving attention to mundane social responsibilities. But the two goals are mutually exclusive and he cannot have them both. Perhaps the structure of the myth, which allowed nine months with Persephone in return for three months without her, gave Ten- nyson, if not a synthesis between the two possibilities, at least some alternation between two perpetually open choices, and favored the happier one. Because all of these anxieties- fears about the powers and limi- tations of the imagination, the role of memory, the problem of sudden, senseless loss- are also central to In Memoriam, the Per- sephone myth provides a structural framework even for this great elegy, one that underlies and often parallels its Christian basis. Just as the myth defines successful imagination as memory and traces memory's power to redeem a vanished ideal from "the curse of time," so Tennyson's elegy appropriates such structural principles from the myth as search, memory, and an evolving human form, in order to effect its own imaginative triumph, the resurrection of Hallam from a Hades-like limbo of expired time. In arguing that In Memoriam is broadly structured around the Persephone myth, I do not want to undermine the importance of its Christian beliefs,</page><page sequence="13">Priscilla Johnston • 80 which are central, albeit unconventional. In fact, most critics find that "Demeter and Persephone" only recapitulates the Christian faith of In Memoriam: as James Rissane comments, "the poem's pagan perspective [comes] as an anticipation of the Christian dis- pensation";11 Persephone is generally seen as a figure for Arthur Hallam, and not the other way around. But the Persephone theme may have shaped In Memoriam as much as the elegy influenced the later monologue in turn; a lifetime of writing shows that the story was an integral part of Tennyson's thought long before its explicit rendition in the late 1880s. In addition, while many mythic elements in the elegy seem to have a Christian basis, most of the same elements- the emphasis upon seasonal rebirth, the fall from pastoral into harsh reality, the polarities of a Shadow of Death and a Sun of Life- conform at least as well to the myth of Persephone as to the myth of Christ. What sways the balance in favor of a clas- sical structure is the fact that certain of In Memoriamo ideas can be explained by the Persephone story but not by the Christian mode. To take one major example, the sundering of the natural pair both in the elegy and in the other myth-based poems does not hint at any sin on either member's part, so that the whole point of a 'paradise lost' Christian story is missing from this classical per- spective in which the gods act more or less at random. Indeed, if Tennyson had found the Christian rationale of justifiable punish- ment for a serious transgression acceptable, the questions that im- pelled him to write his poem in the first place would never have occurred. During most of In Memoriam, however, the poet rejects the language of conventional Christian platitudes as wholly inade- quate, mere "vacant chaff well meant for grain." The language of Christian belief must, then, be avoided, while the substance of such belief must be vindicated. By using the Persephone myth, and ma- nipulating its congruence with a Christian mode, Tennyson may resolve a crisis of faith without putting Christian beliefs specifical- ly on the line; and may affirm the bases of that faith without the baggage of conventional religious formulas, trite to the point of meaninglessness. Even though the elegy antedates "Demeter and Persephone" by some fifty-odd years, we can judge the monologue's relevance to In Memoriam simply by comparing structural aspects of the two that have a clear basis in the original myth. The pattern is a famil- iar one: at poem's outset, Tennyson himself occupies the same position as Demeter when she was left to wander the earth after her daughter's abduction; and the work develops a series of flash- backs that allude to the earth-goddess's woes so closely as to seem intentional. Like Demeter and Persephone before the entrance of</page><page sequence="14">Tennyson 's Demeter and Persephone Theme • 81 Aïdoneus, Tennyson sees himself and Hallam as a natural pair, in concord both with each other and with a pastoral landscape that recalls the poet's Enna of the lucid past, "a good solid planet, roll- ing round its green hills and paradises to the harmony of ... stead- fast laws." In this phase the couple wanders "From flower to flow- er, from snow to snow: / And we with singing cheered the way, / . . . And glad at heart from May to May" (XXII, 4-5, 8). Even though this bucolic setting seems to owe more to the pastoral ele- gy's conventional shepherd pairing than to any specific myth, Per- sephone's flower-gathering just before the intrusion of Aïdoneus may also be implicated, and seems justified in light of the occur- rences immediately thereafter. As we might expect from the an- cient prototype, this pastoral turns barren with the sudden incur- sion of "the Shadow feared of man"- as much of a mythic death figure as Aïdoneus himself- who abducts Hallam: he "spread his mantle dark and cold, / And wrapt thee formless in the fold, / And dulled the murmur on thy lip, / And bore thee where I could not see / Nor follow" (XXII, 14-18). As a result, Tennyson, like De- meter, is stranded "in the waste" of the present, a phase in which "I dreamed there would be spring no more," for the entrance of the Shadow, like that of Aïdoneus, has brought with it the ma- ture realization that time and death set final limits to earthly life. These are terrible insights; it is no wonder that Tennyson's diffi- culty in coming to terms with them should lead to his rendition of the experience as an apocalyptic rupture, as if his own conscious- ness were under physical assault. The characteristic post-abduction landscape, a world of "desert dust" and "iron hills, "takes precedence after the Shadow's assault; and in this connection it is interesting to notice how naturally the Aïdoneus episode feeds into the scientific preoccupations that per- vade In Memoriam's crisis of faith when Nature's grim law con- demns man to ruin and extinction. The mythic pattern may in fact offer one explanation as to why here, as elsewhere, Tennyson seems to anticipate the theories of Lyell and Darwin long before he could have read their works.12 The elegy's description of apocalyptic events and ruined landscapes seems often to come from the pages of Victorian science, and especially from the geographical catas- trophists who claimed that higher species were born from the ruins of lower forms that had been obliterated by flood, earthquake, or other natural disasters. It is true that one of the bases of such early evolutionary theories is the idea that natural cataclysms lay waste a fertile area, followed by a gradual regeneration of life.13 But the same pattern describes Aïdoneus' visit and its bleak aftermath quite precisely, with its earthquakes, its altered weather, its fatal effects</page><page sequence="15">Priscilla Johnston • 82 on vegetable and animal life, and, above all, its unpredictable cata- clysm. What may seem to come from scientifically advanced con- temporaries may therefore owe an equal debt, ironically enough, to an ancient etiological myth; and Tennyson might well have been attracted to the Aïdoneus legend even more because it offered a unique opportunity to fuse those two antipodal viewpoints, scien- tific rationalism and a very personal kind of mythopoeic vision. Tennyson's behavior after the death seems to confirm its basis in myth, for it closely parallels Demeter's own anxieties and ac- tions in the ancient story. The earth-goddess, for example, refused to mingle at the other gods' feasts, "saying she never again would set foot upon fragrant Olympus, / Never would suffer the corn and the fruit of the earth to awaken / Till she beheld with her own eyes the face of her lovely daughter."14 Similarly, Tennyson's obses- sion with redeeming Hallam isolates him from friends and family in "wayward grief" that abuses "the genial hour" of Christmas feasting and turns the world waste in his eyes. Instead, he under- takes his own Demeter-style voyage, a mental one, in an effort to find out what godly power is responsible for the senseless abduc- tion of Hallam. In Tennyson's monologue on the classical myth, Demeter confronts the three Fates with her question, and receives this response: "'We know not, for we spin the lives of men, / . . . and know not why we spin!'" (11. 84-85). In the elegy's version, Tennyson confronts "Nature, red in tooth and claw," a private adaptation of the Moerae who fulfills the same functions and gives a nearly identical response: "'I bring to life, I bring to death: / . . . I know no more'" (LVI, 6, 8). Both versions of the episode adhere closely to the classical original- here, Ovid's Fasti: No spot of earth did Ceres leave unvisited. She wandered also in the sky, and accosted the constellations that lie next to the cold pole and never dip in the ocean wave. "Ye Parrhasian stars, reveal to a wretched mother her daughter Persephone; for ye can know all things, since never do ye plunge under the waters of the sea." So she spoke, and Hélice answered her thus: "Night is blameless. Ask of the Sun concerning the rav- ished maid." (Book IV, 11. 574 ff.) Furthermore, both protagonists follow the ancient prototype when they are haunted by a "phantom- warning" of their loved one in exile. In "Demeter and Persephone," for example, the dead girl appears in a vision sent by Mercury, "the god of dreams," who "Drew from thyself the likeness of thyself / Without thy knowl- edge, and thy shadow past / Before me." The episode may come</page><page sequence="16">Tennyson 's Demeter and Persephone Theme • 83 from Claudian's De Raptu Proserpinœ, which Tennyson knew with the intimacy of a translator: "Dreams troubled [Demeter 's] dread and a vision of Proserpina lost troubled her every sleep. . . . She saw Proserpina shut in the dark confines of a prison-house and bound with cruel chains. . . . When . . . she was at last able to recognize her daughter, albeit with doubtful gaze, she cried: '. . . Who hath power to wreak such cruelty upon me? Art thou my daughter or does a vain shadow deceive me?'"15 In the early sections of In Me- moriam, Tennyson is haunted by similar visions, as the Mercury- like "Sleep, kinsman ... to death and trance / And madness" brings him dreams of Hallam whose reality he cannot trust: "If any vision should reveal / Thy likeness," he complains, "I might count it vain / As but the canker of the brain" (XCII, 1-3). Like Demeter, then, the poet needs to turn his "wind / Of memory murmuring the past" into palpable reality, using the power of his memory-as-imagination to reverse temporal sequence and bring back Arthur Hallam, with his Enna, in a form that very nearly approaches flesh and blood. This re-creation of Persephone's return occurs, of course, in sec- tion XCV of the elegy, in terms fully congruent with Demeter's own vision. Just as the materials of poetic memory come together by degrees in the mind's eye, Persephone appears in the monologue as a gradually evolving form, moving from the status of concept ("the likeness of thyself") to fleshly shell (a "dazed and dumb" girl) to a sentient human being: "'Mother!' and I was folded in thine arms." In the same way, Hallam appears first as a figment of memory, a "visual shade of some one lost" (XCIII, 5), then in terms of "love's dumb cry" (XCV, 27), and finally in a form so fully vital as to wreak literally stunning physical changes as he en- folds both poet and setting: The dead man touched me from the past, And all at once it seemed at last The living soul was flashed on mine, And mine in his was wound, and whirled About empyreal heights of thought, And came on that which is, and caught The deep pulsations of the world. (XCV, 34-40) The imagery of the vision, with its movement from concept to dumb human figure to touching and embracing, strongly suggests that the poet had in mind the same mythic prototype that under- lies earlier sections of the elegy, exploring the success of memory</page><page sequence="17">Priscüla Johnston • 84 in reviving the lost child from Hades, the limbo of the unredeemed past. The pattern is completed when Hallam 's resurrection, like Persephone's, simultaneously revitalizes the original Enna-like gar- den, as under his touch "the doubtful dusk revealed / The knolls once more. .../... And sucked from out the distant gloom / A breeze began to tremble o'er / The large leaves of the sycamore, / And fluctuate all the still perfume, / And gathering freshlier over- head, / Rocked the full-foliaged elms " (XCV, 49-50, 53-58). The Demeter myth therefore facilitates Tennyson's progress of the soul by giving him a series of props and precedents, Christian in idea yet religiously neutral in language, around which he can structure his own thoughts. The myth's major importance, how- ever, lies in its congeniality to the evolutionary theme that pro- vides the elegy's final consolation. In Memoriam culminates in a vision of Hallam as a fully evolved man who provides "a closer link / Betwixt us and the crowning race / Of those that, eye to eye, shall look / On knowledge" (Epilogue, 127-30). Hallam thus fulfills the same spiritual promise borne by Persephone that future genera- tions, "who grew beyond their race, / And made themselves as Gods against the fear / Of Death and Hell," might permanently overcome the conditions imposed by Aïdoneus' incursion. In "De- meter and Persephone" it is this aspect that has attracted most crit- ical attention, making it superfluous to discuss the association be- tween Persephone, Hallam, In Memoriam, and Christian hope fur- ther here. As G. Robert Stange has pointed out, "the myth of Per- sephone has been reinterpreted as an anticipation of the story of Christ"; and Ward Hellstrom makes the parallel even more explicit by defining both Persephone and Hallam as "the quite human real- ity which prefigures and promises the greater reality, a God of Love."16 From this standpoint, the terms of the Persephone myth give Tennyson still another way to justify his obsession with mem- ory, his "passion of the past": the maiden is not just a symbol for that lost ideal past, but a symbol for the future, coming as a fully evolved "human-godlike" combination, the premonition of a Heav- en-on-earth to come. By using her myth, then, Tennyson is able to reconcile all the themes whose disparity had so shaken his equilib- rium at the outset of the elegy: in Persephone, he brings Christian tradition in line with a favorite private vision; he is able to use both scientific evidence and primitive myth; he finds an objective struc- ture for the most personalized experience; and he can knit the war- ring contraries of past and future, life and death. Previous considerations of "Demeter and Persephone"-4nflu- enced, perhaps, by the hopefulness of In Memoriam- have rested upon the serene confidence of its final twenty-five lines, resulting</page><page sequence="18">Tennyson 's Demeter and Persephone Theme • 85 in such highly positivistic conclusions as Jerome Buckley's: "it is the burden of the idyl to demonstrate that love can restore the self and so transcend the force of death and hell."17 Curtis Dahl's per- ceptive essay on the poem reaches a similar conclusion, that it shows "the Christian hope of joyful immortality. ... [It is] a statement of Tennyson's fundamental Christian faith," conceived as a rebuttal of Swinburne's nihilistic "Hymn to Proserpine" (1866). Against Swinburne's "allegory of pessimistic fatalism," in which Prosperine shows the inevitable triumph of time, change, and death, Tennyson poses "an allegory of Christian hope," in which Perseph- one becomes "a symbol of the regenerative, resurrective force of nature that parallels and symbolizes the spiritual resurrection of Christian belief."18 But this hopeful assessment relies wholly upon Demeter's final speculations, whereas Tennyson's other classical poems (e.g., "Ulys- ses," "The Garden of the Hesperides," "The Lotos-Eaters") pose a conflict between what their naively confident speakers think and the far different outcomes known to their readers. I see no reason why "Demeter and Persephone" does not follow the same method, pitting its speaker's faith and hope against all evidence to the con- trary. This may not invalidate Demeter's belief (indeed it increases its pathos and bravery); yet it does inject a cautionary note: love wins here, it is true- but only for a time; and we know that the God of Love will win more- but only after a while. Persephone's evolutionary promise is therefore only part of the story: equally important are the myth's radical ambiguities which express far less reassuring aspects of evolutionary theory that recur during In Memoriam and help to remind us that this is a poem about skepticism as much as it is about faith. The "life of lower phase" that the flower-maiden overcomes always remains on the periphery; in fact, it is only emphasized by the very cyclical nature of the myth in which nine months' time will inevitably bring another cycle of loss. If Persephone shows us the possibility of spiritual evolution, then her pyclic disappearances acknowledge the terrible strength of all those regressive forces that threaten the progress of the soul. From this standpoint, Aïdoneus assumes an additional function, appearing not only as a symbol for social and cosmic chaos, but for individual degradation as well, a figure for a lower phase of man's spiritual development in which he is "half akin to brute"; the marriage bond only emphasizes the power of that "dark- er world within us" into which Persephone inevitably reels back. Perhaps, Tennyson thus implies, her periodical collapses into Hades do not prepare her for more progress, but only indicate a mechani- cal repetition of defeat, of regression, a clockwork cycle that ap-</page><page sequence="19">Priscilla Johnston • 86 pears early in the elegy as seasonal reiteration of the same old birth- to-death pattern against which nothing could prevail: "The seasons bring the flower again, / And bring the firstling to the flock; / And in the dusk of thee, the clock / Beats out the little lives of men" (II, 5-8). Tennyson may therefore not diverge as much from Swin- burnian fatalism as Demeter's last speech urges us to believe. The futility of human stability, permanence, and o^der in the face of inexorable change may be central concepts in the younger poet's "Hymn to Proserpine," but the same concepts pervade In Memori- am, being inherent in the elegy's myth-based framework. Tenny- son, however, subsumes Swinburne's wholesale pessimism into his own peculiar ambivalence, making both aspects of the myth mu- tually dependent and equally possible, so that the myth can cut both ways, using the same elements to promise both infinite prog- ress and perpetual defeat. It is this very bivalence that comprises its value for the poet of In Memoriam, from whom the same event elicits both transcendent and despairing explanations. By 1855, this negative potential was fully defined with the writ- ing of Maud. like nearly all the poems rooted in the Rosa Baring affair-"The Lover's Tale," "Aylmer's Field," "Locksley Hall Six- ty Years After"- Maud adheres to the Demeter myth's structure of bliss, cataclysm, and qualified return through the agency of poetic memory. However, where in other poems Tennyson had used the myth to frame a hopeful solution, here he is more interested in ex- ploring its negative implications to their fullest, giving three com- plete cycles of the story in which Demeter becomes a near lunatic, Persephone looks more like the queen of Death than the maid of Enna, and Aïdoneus cuts a wider swath of ruin each time the mythic structure allows him to resurface. Indeed, by locking his poem into the predoomed pattern of the Persephone myth, Ten- nyson augments the cosmic fatality that pervades this work, turn- ing it into a treatise on the futility of human hope in which Aï- donean evil becomes stronger, not weaker, with every attempt made to defeat it. Anticipating Swinburne's Proserpine poems by eleven years, Tennyson's use of the Persephone theme in Maud depicts all the pessimistic fatality that the younger writer would later discover in the story. Our mythic pattern' takes over from the outset, as the speaker remembers an ideal childhood- serene, secure, and wealthy- the sort of "good solid planet" that we have seen time and time again implicated in the Enna myth, here presented in a series of dream flashbacks from the perspective of a drab present. As its prototype dictates, this ideal past is shattered by an apocalyptic event, the father's fall into a "ghastly pit"- possibly a nineteenth-century</page><page sequence="20">Tennyson 's Demeter and Persephone Theme • 87 version of a gaping chasm to the underworld- a fate that has ap- parently been engineered by the Aïdonean "dark father" of Maud. With the parent's retreat to the underworld, one cycle of the myth is fulfilled, leaving the speaker stranded in a barren present and ob- sessed by memories of the sudden death. In the body of the poem, however, Tennyson sets the pattern in motion a second time, sub- stituting for the mythic parent-child pair a new lover-mistress pair with the entrance of Maud. When we first see her, Maud-Persephone is already in thrall to her Aïdoneus figure, a mercantile brother who has "Gone to a blacker pit, for whom / Grimy nakedness dragging his trucks / And laying his trams in a poisoned gloom / Wrought, till he crept from a gutted mine" (Part I, X, i, 335-38). As long as she remains in his power, Maud shares the characteristics of her mythic sister, the "imperial disimpassioned" Persephone, for she too has a "passion- less, pale, cold face," a "dead perfection"; she too is "luminous, gemlike, ghostlike, deathlike"- a new version of the classical femme fatale. Maud thus enters in the role of the "dazed and dumb" flow- er-maiden newly risen from Hades, whose face still bears "That shadow of a likeness to the king / Of shadows, thy dark mate." But once she is united with the same bucolic past that we saw in Enna, Maud becomes an "Oread"; and she restores that past with her "wild voice pealing up to the sunny sky, / And feet like sunny gems on the English green," just as Persephone would restore "a frolic of song" from a nightingale and heal the blighted landscape "with flowers that brighten as thy footstep falls." There ensues for the speaker a renewed Enna, for him as for Demeter celebrated in terms of an extended pastoral in which Maud always appears as the envitalizing presence, creating a "good solid planet" that cul- minates when the lovers meet in their special realm, Maud's garden of Part I, XXII. At the beginning of Part II, however, Tennyson merely turns the Persephone pattern back on itself, when a "ghastly Wraith," the saturnine brother, springs out of nowhere like Aïdoneus out of the earth, to part the natural couple again. As the mythic cycle dictates, Maud's abduction causes a breach in nature, from which "there rises ever a passionate cry / From underneath in the darken- ing land- / What is it, that has been done?" (Part II, I, i, 5-7). Be- cause of this senseless separation, the earth transforms itself for the speaker into the drab present all over again, being "but a world of the dead." Like Demeter, he wanders about the bleak globe making appeals to the "Powers of the height, Powers of the deep" -a phrase that Tennyson was to adapt in "Demeter and Perseph- one" from the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, as Zeus, "the bright</page><page sequence="21">Priscilla Johnston • 88 one in the highest," and Aïdoneus, "the dark one in the lowest." And like Demeter, he grows impatient with Maud's spectral appar- ition, desiring to learn her true fate. Just as the earth-goddess's prayer to see her daughter brings a figment of memory ("the like- ness of thyself . . . past / Before me" ), so before Maud's lover "a shadow flits," Not thou, but like to thee: Ah Christ, that it were possible For one short hour to see The souls we loved, that they might tell us What and where they be. (Part II, IV, üi, 152-56) Both apparitions, however, make the same negation, that loss is final: in Persephone's terms, she will be "'for ever and for ever- more / The Bride of Darkness'"; and in Maud's, He may take her now; for she never speaks her mind, But is ever the one thing silent here. She is not of us, as I divine; She comes from another stiller world of the dead, Stiller, not fairer than mine. (Part II, V, vü, 305-09) One more cycle thus reaches fulfillment, with the speaker fallen into the dreary present. Each time the pattern has been completed, it has taken away one more alternative for achieving a mental Enna, that "good solid planet, rolling round its green hills and paradises to the harmony of ... steadfast laws." First familial, then sexual, love has been inevitably doomed by the mythic structure: with cruel irony, Maud inverts "Demeter and Persephone" 's thesis in which love is so strong by itself that it makes "all the Shadow die into the Light" of it, for here, the brighter the form of the promise, the more portentious the Shadow it helplessly casts after it. The poem ends with the most ambitious attempt yet to fulfill the mythic pattern of pastoral followed by apocalypse, one that expands its scope to threaten civilization itself. Maud's lover recovers from his madness into still another lucid interlude in still another version of Enna, where the face of night is fair on the dewy downs, And the shining daffodil dies, and the Charioteer</page><page sequence="22">Tennyson's Demeter and Persephone Theme • 89 And starry Gemini hang like glorious crowns Over Orion's grave low down in the west. (Part III, VI, i, 5-8) But the bucolic scene comes merely as prelude to the Crimean War; he finds himself face to face with still another apocalyptic rupture, the poem's third: Though many a light shall darken, and many shall weep For those that are crushed in the clash of jarrying claims, Yet God's just wrath shall be wreaked on a giant liar; And many a darkness into the light shall leap. [By the] deathful-grinning mouths of the fortress, flames The blood-red blossom of war with a heart of fire. (Part III, VI, iv, 43-46, 52-53) Here we have another version of the descent into Hades, the same hellish scenery that broke into "Demeter and Persephone" with "the red race of fiery Phlegethon," deriving ultimately from the Claudian translation, in which livid Styx with lurid torrent bounds And fiery Phlegethon for aye surrounds, Dark, deep and whirling round his flaming caves The braying vortex of his breathless waves. The gleaming Pine shoots forth a dismal light, Around her head the snaky volumes rise And dart their tongues of flame and roll their gory eyes. (11. 31-34, 60-62) At poem's end, the flower-maiden's return becomes merely a feck- less repetition of errors; Demeter turns into a demented, obsessed lover; Aïdoneus' triumph becomes the final act. It is as though Maud proposes a corrective rewrite of the myth's optimistic ren- dering elsewhere, a reminder that as often as Persephone seems to overcome "that darker world within us," just as often her story signifies regression, obsessive longing, and mere clockwork repeti- tion of cycles. To stop looking at the myth after the serene end- ings of In Memoriam and "Demeter and Persephone" is as though one were to stop reading the Idylls after the first few optimistic books. More clearly, perhaps, then any of his other uses of the Perseph-</page><page sequence="23">Priscilla Johnston • 90 one myth, Maud shows the reasons why Tennyson kept returning to the story throughout his career, until it is defined as the basic driving force behind human life in general, both personal and so- cietal. Primarily it expresses two antithetical concepts of change and decay simultaneously- dynamic progress or mechanical cycle -and refuses to decide which alternative is the more genuine. On the one hand, the myth shows that loving memory can indeed per- form the imaginative miracle, bringing back a lost past in fleshly and palpable form; as such, it reinforces Darwinian theories, with the human race "passing through . . . from state to state" and achieving greater spiritual fulfillment at each stage of the cycle. This is one side of the evolutionary pattern; but the other side ex- presses "dull mechanic Circumstance" by which race succeeds race from life to death in blind repetition that only revolves around a central stasis. All this begins to look like a mere reduplication of cycles of promise and loss: the eternal clockwork exchange of Per- sephone from Hades to Enna and back. However, the legend's greatest value lay precisely in its ambiva- lence. Even though it provided benign solutions to certain of Ten- nyson's major preoccupations- suggesting that the lost past could be restored in fact, that the imaginative memory could reify its ob- ject in flesh and blood, that the dead remained corporeally intact and could communicate on human terms with the living, and that man could evolve into a spiritual demigod^still the mature poet was not able to cull out the myth's negative aspects, namely that Persephone must always return to Hades, and that the maternal grief necessary to restore her also laid waste the material present. Finally, far more than the Christian myth which it so often resem- bles, the myth of Demeter and Persephone can handle both sides of Tennyson's beliefs: it extends invaluable promises of resurrec- tion and faith, yet weighs them against sacrifices at least as great; it suggests evolution, but hints at mechanical cycle too; it centers upon a maternal poet-figure simultaneously capable of heroic love and the basest neglect. It is no wonder that Tennyson repeated his prototype throughout his career; but it is also not surprising that as late as 1889 he was still hoping for "younger kindlier Gods" to release him from the mythic pattern's endless cycle.

In an article on "Tennyson: The Passion of the Past and the Curse of Time" (ELH, 32 [1965], 85-109), James Rissane discusses the pastoral of the past and the wasteland of the present in considerable detail; and his con- clusions from "Mariana" might be applied equally well to the Persephone myth: "For Tennyson the passing moment is not ineffably palpable and in- tense . . . but insufferably drab. . . . Containing no quality that can be savored and hence eliciting no emotion, the present cannot be a realm of essential re- ality. . . . Whereas the present seemed to Tennyson empty and unreal, the past, that 'good solid planet,' was a world of plenitude and stability.
