She has read the book of myths. Her journey is to search the reality behind the myth, "the wreck and not the story of the wreck/the thing itself and not the myth."2 She may discover, as critic Alicia Ostriker suggests, that "the thing itself' is mythical, that there is no reality separate from subjectivity.3 However, I am here to explore the book of myths, the one "in which/our names do not appear." I came to explore particular pages. . .ones about women's sexuality. . . and new pages, freshly written where we name and are named: I came to explore the wreck The words are purposes. The words are maps. I came to see the damage that was done and the treasures that prevail.4 I came to suggest that women need to tell stories about our sexuality(ies): stories that will not only describe but shape our sexual</page><page sequence="2">34 Re-Mythologizing Women's Sexuality experiences. I would also venture that telling the stories of our sexuali- ties is in and of itself a spiritual quest, a seeking to name the great powers, a "drive to connect."5 For the book of myths, referred to by Rich, does contain many myths about our sexuality where the meaning of myth as aetiology and myth as falsity converge. Reading such a book, a sharp knife comes in handy, "to cut (our) way in, cut structures apart."6 There is a sense in which feminist literary criticism acts as that sharp knife, cutting through the false allusion/illusion of stories told about us, and carving out new mythological ground for women.7 To reveal its double- edged character, I will review historical dimensions of feminist literary criticism, and comment specifically on pieces which I believe especially significant to the re-mythologizing of female sexuality.8 But first, I reflect on the nature of the book of myths and pause at some seldom told stories. The Connection of the Spiritual to Story Carol Christ has described beautifully the spiritual dimension of story. She explains that women need to tell our own stories. We need to shape our own experiences of self, and, from our perspective, name "the great powers that establish reality." We need to do this because story is crucial to self-revelation and self-understanding; it is crucial to our making sense of our relation to others and the world. Christ claims: "In a very real sense, there is no experience without stories... stories give shape to experience, experience gives rise to stories."9 Stories are the essence of myth. 10 Stories become myth when they are distinctively connected to what a society believes it most needs to know. Myth assumes a sacred aspect when it attempts to name "the great powers." The great powers are primarily identified by the function of orientation they give to life; they are signifiers in the search for purpose and meaning; they are sources of energy, opposition, and containment, the matrix of literature. Divine dimensions are often, but not necessarily attributed to the great powers. The stories of Ulysses were sacred to the Greeks, just as the stories of the God of Abraham were sacred to the Hebrews, and the stories of Nanabush to the Ojibway. The problem identified by Carol Christ is that the recognized story- tellers in Western cultures have been men, and their stories orient them to their own particular perceptions of the great powers. Women, without stories, unable to experience our own experience, try to adjust our lives to fit the story. Christ laments: Women's stories have not been told. And without stories there is no</page><page sequence="3">Halhnan 35 articulation of experience. Without stories a woman is lost when she comes to make the important decisions of her life. She does not learn to value her struggles, to celebrate her strengths, to comprehend her pain. Without stories she cannot understand herself. Without stories she is alienated from those deeper experiences of self and world that have been called spiritual or religious. She is closed in silence. The expres- sion of women's spiritual quest is integrally related to the telling of women's stories. If women's stories are not told, the depth of women's souls will not be known.11 Connection of the Spiritual to the Sexual Carter Heyward, a Christian feminist ethicist, writes explicitly of the connection between the spiritual and the sexual: I found the pearl of great price. And I realized that my relatedness to God, and to all, is at once spiritual and sexual. And there was no way, and there is no way, for me to know sexuality as that fundamental human yearning for meaningful relationship without knowing that, to the extent that I am yearning for meaningful relationship with people who are men, I am yearning sexually for men; and that to the extent that I am yearning for meaningful relationship with people who are women, I am yearning sexually for women; and to the extent that I am open to and yearning for relationship with God, or with people, or with other aspects of creation, I am alive and yearning sexually - period.12 To be "alive and yearning sexually" at all is a considerable feat when we consider all that has distorted, damaged, and destroyed women's sexu- ality. If one accepts with Carter Heyward that the sexual is spiritual, then a consultation of our spiritual sources should reveal much about our sexual lives. For women in the Judeo/Christian tradition, this is a sad enterprise. With God as Father and Christ as Brother, it requires a powerful imagination to believe ourselves created in the image of God. With God so conceptualized, our sexual choices appear to be chastity or incest. The limited scope of sexual alternatives authorized by Christianity became even more clear to me as I watched the performance of The Rez Sisters , a play by Tomson Highway that celebrates the lives of Aboriginal peoples. I was struck by the difference between Christian and Native mythology. Nanabush, representative of the Great Spirit, moved con- stantly on and off the stage, in and out of consciousness, always watch- ing, reflecting, teasing, annoying, and entering into laughter, suffering, and sexual union. Nanabush, whose role is to "teach us about the nature and the meaning of existence on the planet Earth," is as pivotal a figure in Native mythology as Christ is in Christian mythology. Here he was</page><page sequence="4">36 Re-Mythologizing Women* s Sexuality portrayed in sensual, intensely erotic, mutual relationships with women! 13 It was a shock to my "Christian" sensibility to sexual propriety. To imagine Jesus Christ in the role of lover is still a daring project. Almost defiant. Much has been written about the role of Christian theology and praxis in repressing human sexuality and maligning women.14 The fall/ redemption strand of thought which has informed much of orthodox Christian theology closely associates sin and sex and blames woman for bringing both into the world.15 Redemption requires an aspect of sexual purity. Although contemporary biblical criticism is making an effort to separate the misogynist overlay of the patristic fathers from the "actual" sexual attitudes in both the Hebrew culture and the early Christian church, it is generally recognized that throughout its history, biblical exegesis and hermeneutics have been informed by a sexual ascetic impulse. For example, the 1980 United Church of Canada Report on Human Sexuality assumed that the lay "churched" person would have been conditioned by nineteen centuries of Christian thought to view spirituality and sensuality in opposite terms.16 The image of a playful, sensual, love-making God is almost beyond our ken.17 Christian Mythology: Some Seldom Told Stories Despite the long tradition of sexual asceticism, the image of God as Lover is essential, in a profound way, to Christian mythology. The birth of Christ as "God Incarnate" follows a long mythical tradition of divine union with mortals to produce a messianic figure. The notion of a virgin birth and the clumsy circumlocutory concept of a triune God have served to obscure the logistics of Mary's impregnation. Yet, the "God as Lover" image has been a suppressed undercurrent of Christian thought that has occasionally found expression, particularly in mystic texts. The 12th- century abbess Hildegard of Bingen wrote: Mary God delights in you so much, God was so taken with you he sank his love's fire deep within you. So much love he gave you, that with it you nurture his son. So full of ecstasy is your body that it resounds with heaven's symphony. Your womb exalts.</page><page sequence="5">J Mailman 37 It exalts like the grass, grass the dew has nestled on grass the dew has infused with verdant strength That is how it is with you, Mother of all joy.18 John of the Cross, another celebrated mystic, wrote of the soul's journey toward God. The mystical union of the soul with God is based on complex symbolism. As the church is the bride of Christ, so the soul assumes a spiritual feminine in relation to God.19 O night that was my guide. O night more friendly than the dawn! 0 tender night that tied the lover and the loved one, loved one in the lover fused as one! On my flowering breasts which I have saved for him alone, he slept and I caressed and fondled him with love and cedars fanned the air above... 1 lay, forgot my being and on my love I leaned my face. All ceased. I left my being, leaving my cares to fade among the lilies far away.20 I would hazard that this strong, sexually explicit love language is rarely, if ever, spoken from the pulpits of churches. However, one notion that is gaining a gradual acceptance in Chris- tian churches is the image of God as Mother. Some feminist theologians have been concerned to show that the God of Scriptures embodies a "feminine" principle. Attention is called to female images of God in the Bible, such as the Seeker of the Lost Coin (Luke), or the Isaiah passage where Israel is compared to a child taught to walk by a patient mother, or to passages where Goďs labour to bring forth creation is revered. Often the attempts are apologetic, a search "for an original point of unblemished integrity in the Bible which marks all unpalatable Chris- tian doctrines as due to some later accretion of unbiblical views."21 Yet the possibility of re-imaging God as feminine or androgynous has acted as a powerful symbol for many Christian women of their restoration to dignity.</page><page sequence="6">38 Re-Mythologizing Women's Sexuality A traditional symbol of the spiritual feminine is the Virgin Mary. A study of Mary proves that the meaning attached to this symbol has had a varied history but is deeply rooted in the notion of the Church as the bride of Christ. This idea developed in an anti-sexual, anti-maternal framework, where the hope for a triumph over death was seen in escaping the sin caused by woman and transmitted by birth. Theologian Rosemary Ruether has written extensively on Mariology. She states: "The Virgin Mary becomes the theological personification of Psyche and Mother Church as Virginal Bride and Mother of Christians."22 However, Mary as "Sinless Mother" is the more accented tradition. As a "font of grace," she was very graphically portrayed during the Middle Ages. In Holy Feast , Holy Fast , Caroline Bynum includes plates of medieval foun- tains and pictures where the lactating Virgin is literally giving suck to very needy looking saints.23 In doing so, Mary exudes a kind of power, one that is later lost in the idealized passive madonnas and pietas of "Renaissance" art. Restoring Lost Stories: Implications for Women What remains to be asked and answered is whether restoring these lost stories to the book of myths has any value to women "alive and yearning to be in meaningful relationship." They may represent less commonly told stories but they still conform to the constructs of the patriarchal tale. The recovery of the remnants of the God as Lover, or God as Mother traditions, it could be argued, does nothing to challenge an authoritarian theology and the legitimacy it gives to a hierarchical and heterosexual structuring of human relations.24 Hildegard did not intend to rend apart the patriarchal foundation of marriage when she wrote: Creation is allowed in intimate love to speak to the Creator as if to a lover Creation is allowed to ask for a pasture a homeland Out of the Creator's fullness this request is granted to Creation 25</page><page sequence="7">Haüman 39 In all the examples cited above, heterosexuality is enshrined, mother- hood is idealized, and patriarchy remains unscathed! The spiritual models in Judeo-Christian mystical tradition do not illumine all the possibilities of our sexual expression; in fact chastity is the one that finds the most favour. The homosexual or lesbian experience is not told. In my later reflections on the play, The Rez Sisters, I pondered on the sexual messages sent and received. This was a play which both implicitly and explicitly acknowledged lesbianism. The strong bonds between and among the seven women were nurtured and celebrated. Nonetheless, the central mythical figure was male and the only visible sexual contact was heterosexual. Moreover, this union took the form of a death dance, our signal that Marie Adele Starblanket was no more. At the same time, the avowed lesbian became pregnant in a casual encounter with a brutish man after her female lover died in a grotesque suicide. Yet, despite what I later took to be destructive messages about women's sexuality, I really enjoyed the play! It was this realization of paradox that helped me to understand the work of feminist literary criticism. For feminist theory in this field seeks to disclose and describe the multi-faceted dialectic between aesthetic pleasure and political engagement. Some of the several dimensions explored in this inquiry have been: What is the dynamic that allows women to "fuse" with texts when doing so requires identifying against ourselves? Is there a feminist hermeneutical ap- proach that can allow women to transcend the patriarchal message of the text? In instances such as the stories of God as Lover and God as Mother that I have given above, is there a libratory impulse? a glimpse of new mythological ground? a hint of a new naming of the great powers? Can we claim from the mystic tradition a new love for creation that is indeed holistic? Can we, like Ruether, rediscover in Mary, Woman as Social Iconoclast?26 1 want to hold onto these possibilities, but in themselves, they do not satisfy my spiritual quest. Feminist Criticism and the Spiritual Quest I will now turn to an overview of selected stages of feminist literary criticism, keeping these questions in mind. I do not expect to give full answers to them. However, I do want to give a general sense of how some of these questions may have been approached, especially in reference to women's sexuality, where feminist criticism has acted as a sharp knife, cutting away false representation, and carving new mythological ground. In the beginning, women read the "book of myths" and did not like what they found there. They made connections between what they read and</page><page sequence="8">40 Re-Mythologizing Women's Sexuality the social, economic, and political inequality they experienced. They began to talk about this among themselves, and significantly, to write about it.... Early feminist literary critics exposed the negative image of women in classic and popular texts, the falseness of defining woman as either virgin or whore, the gross misrepresentation of women's lives. Moreover, they showed how the portrayal of women in books, plays, and "great" literature gave a kind of numinous authority to the subordination of women in society. They identified this negative portrayal of women with the misuse/abuse of their sexuality, with their status as object of the "male gaze."27 Kate Millett set out to kill the angel/monster image of woman and the male-authored texts that engendered them. Her book Sexual Politics slashed the book of myths.28 She clearly saw the defamation of women's sexuality in fiction as both causality and reflector of women's subordi- nate status in life. Many followed the path that Millett had hewn, as we shall see later. Re-reading the book of myths, women began to wonder. . ."where are our stories'"? They began to search - and somewhat to their surprise, found them in abundance. According to Elaine Showalter, "The second phase of feminist criti- cism was the discovery that women writers had a literature of their own, whose historical and thematic coherence, as well as artistic importance, has been obscured by the patriarchal values that dominate our culture."29 The recovery of women's literary tradition spurred a mapping of the range of the female imagination and the postulating of a distinct or several distinct female aesthetic(s). To do this meant grappling with a number of questions: how does the experience of being a woman in male- dominated culture inform her writing? Similarly, how does being a Afro- American woman or a lesbian woman, or an Aboriginal lesbian woman mark her experience and her writing? Moreover, how is one to read the writings of women? Feminist critics began to speculate that women have always told their stories, but, in Emily Dickinson's telling phrase, told them "slant." Therefore, they began to read women's stories as the stories of an oppressed group, and to theorize on the themes, styles, and structure from this perspective. The hermeneutical starting point be- came 'what do women's stories mean to the women who wrote them and to the women who read them?' The previously almost universally scorned sentimental novel and Harlequin romance were redeemed as valid subjects of study in understanding the differentiated experience and imagination of women.30 Voice was given to the notion of a women's</page><page sequence="9">Hallman 41 culture, distinct from that of men in its naming of the great powers that orient life. Women began to speak of and in a "different voice," finding expression in its own language, literary style, and form.31 The Amazon and the Goddess were invoked as mythical exemplars. Lesbianism came to be celebrated as a well-spring of woman's power and creativity: for some it was postulated as her only source of creativity and power - both a promising and perplexing idea, particularly for those struggling to achieve mutuality in heterosexual relationships. I will look later at the potential of lesbianism to re-mythologize our sexuality with reference to the work of Adrienne Rich. Women were puzzled by the things they read and they asked many questions . . .about the old stories in which their names do not appear. . .and about their new-found treasure... Some questions were answered by mother, some by father... some have yet to be asked or answered. In her narrative of the history of feminist criticism, Showalter acknowledges its mixed parentage, mothered by the women's move- ment, fathered by patriarchal literary criticism. Developments in the general field of literary criticism have had a formative influence on feminist thought. Inasmuch as psychoanalysis, deconstruction, struc- turalism, and post-structuralism have informed literary criticism, they have also impelled further theorization of feminist literary criticism. So, in what Showalter calls the third phase of feminist literary criticism, there has been "a radical rethinking of the conceptual grounds of literary study, a revision of the accepted theoretical assumptions about reading and writing that have been based almost entirely on male literary experiences."32 At this point women reading the book of myths may want to slam it shut, perhaps to follow Mary Daly's existential "leap into freedom";33 perhaps to ruminate among the ruins with Jane Martin.34 Others continue to scrape away the "symbolic construction of gender and sexuality within literary discourse."35 Language is their blade. Feminist critics began to question the relationship of literature to life and the search for a universal meaning or singular truth. They began to look carefully at women's relation to language, and the role of language in producing ideology. In doing so they have presented a fundamental challenge to androcentric epistemology and ontology. I cannot possibly do justice to the exhaustive (both in the sense of comprehensive, and tending to exhaust) nature of this work. I will limit my comments to a brief discussion of how the theoretical insights of Toril Moi and Catherine Belsey both challenge and lend credibility to my quest for new myths about women's sexuality(ies).</page><page sequence="10">42 Re-Mythologizing Women's Sexuality Feminist Criticism: Selected Stories My historical tour of feminist literary criticism begins with a tribute to Kate Millett. She believed the relationship between the sexes to be one of power of men over women and that the dynamic of this power relationship was dramatically revealed in the representation of sexual relations between men and women in male-authored texts. The power of men over women was the central tenet of her political theory of patriar- chy. She saw this basic inequality between the sexes as grounded in and perpetuated by all the institutions and processes of society. To her, patriarchal gender ideology was one that constantly demanded the individual to prove his or her identity as male or female by rigid adherence to culturally assigned sex role stereotypes of "masculine" and "feminine." The construction of masculine and feminine stereotypes was aided and abetted by "writers, who after the usual manner of cultural agents, both reflected and actually shaped attitudes."36 She analyzed the writings of D.H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer. In these works she showed that sexual contact between the sexes was an enact- ment of sexual politics, the acting out of man's power over woman.37 Therefore, central to their works was the glorification and deification of the phallus and the debasement and "demonization" of the vagina. Millett spared no detail of the misogyny inherent in their representation of sexual relations. Moreover, what added insult to injury, according to Millett, was that these authors were heralded by critics as liberating sexuality from Victorian prudery and repression. For a woman alive and yearning to be in a meaningful relationship, nothing could be grimmer that this representation of her sexuality, premised as it was on violence against her. Sexual Politics is a very shocking book. One cannot read this book and remain indifferent or unmoved. Reading it for a second time after a fifteen-year period, I am freshly provoked by the misogyny Millett described. For all its limitations in terms of critical literary analysis, (and I basically agree with Toril Moi in this regard),38 as a polemic to mobilize women's anger, it is brilliant. In the way that Millett was grateful to Mailer for making clear the depth of contempt that men have for women, so women can be grateful to Millett for making clear "the desert we inhabit," for outlining the stranglehold such perverse myths have on our sexuality, and for provoking the wrath we need to cut ourselves free.39 Perhaps the growth of "Images of Women" criticism can be in part attributed to the anger Millett mobilized.40 At the height of its enthusi- asm this approach called for a feminist ideologically-inspired literature that would serve as a forum and provide positive role models for women,</page><page sequence="11">Hallman 43 achieve cultural androgyny, promote sisterhood, and augment con- sciousness-raising.41 Few feminist critics would argue for these goals today, but I believe this approach to literature served a very valid purpose for women beginning to claim their own stories, an approach that logically followed Milletťs rejection of the stereotypes of women's sexuality. It was necessary ground work for exploring the problematic - what do we as women want to say about our sexuality? How shall we tell our story? And significantly, how shall we read our story? The recovery of women's literary tradition has prompted many musings on women's identity, our creativity, and our resistance to patriarchy, and what Adrienne Rich calls "compulsory heterosexuality." Rich looks to literature for documentation of the "double life" led by women who nominally acquiesce to heterosexual relationships and its institutions (marriage, maternity, and maintenance of sexually "correct" behaviour); but who look to relationships with women for survival and sustenance. She cites Meridel Lesueur's novel, The Girl , and Toni Morrison's Zula as revelation of this double-life. In these works, sex with men, although perhaps pivotal to the respective female protagonists, is ultimately a disappointment. It is in their relationship with other women that they find intimacy. Rich writes: "Yet it is the women who make life endurable for each other, give physical affection without causing pain, share, advise, and stick by each other." For Rich, both these novels reveal the "lesbian continuum" by which she means "a range of woman- identified experience," not simply genital sexual experience but "many more forms of primary intensity between and among women, including the sharing of a rich inner life, the bonding against male tyranny, the giving and receiving of practical and political support. . ."42 1 am reminded of the feminist revisionist creation legend of Lillith. In this story, two human creatures were created by God and they both shared in the work of the Garden. In the course of time, Adam grew tired of sharing the tasks and desired someone to serve him. Lillith would have none of this so she set up camp outside the Garden. God agreed to make Adam a helpmate so Eve was brought into being. She was forbidden to go near the Garden wall because a monster lurked outside it. Things went along smoothly for a while and Eve took good care of Adam, but, by and by her curiosity was piqued and she climbed the Garden wall to look on the other side. Behold there was Lillith as happy as can be. Eve was shy at first and simply looked and crept away, but soon she was making frequent trips over the garden wall, laughing, talking, and sharing all manner of things with Lillith. Lillith gave her a different perspective on the work she did for Adam, and before long Eve was demanding equality in the Garden! The comfortable world of Adam was shattered.43</page><page sequence="12">44 Re-Mythologizing Women* s Sexuality My purpose in retelling this tale is to stress, with Rich, how primary bonds with women can transform our vision of the way things should be, and also supply the strength for the resistance of the ways things are. Carol Christ describes Rich's vision as one where "women's relationships with women become symbolic of the power that can transform a culture of power and death into a culture of life and rebirth."44 Rich leaves the old territory of patriarchal symbol and carves out new mythical ground. This movement can be seen in two of her poems, "Diving Into the Wreck" and "Origins of History and Consciousness." In the first poem, Rich subtly reenacts Gilgameďs legendary search for the plant of eternal life. Her treasure, androgyny, is of a doubtful sort, incapable of sustaining her everlasting interest, for she later rejects this hope. In the second poem, she reenacts the creation story, "a new naming of self and world that arises out of the experience of nothingness."45 Having stripped herself of all patriarchal myth and language, facing genuine emptiness, the poet asks herself why poetry is written and discovers it is written from "the drive/to connect. The dream of a common language."46 The "drive to connect" can create a new language and as Carol Christ affirms, a celebration of women's diverse experiences, of women's values - a celebration of extraordinary women, ordinary women, women lovers, women alone. It creates the possibility of telling our own stories on our own terms... but here I am stuck ruminating among the ruins. For who are the extraordinary women?... ordinary women? To speak like this is to imply a judgement against some standard. The plumb line appears to be patriarchal culture - the extraordinary ones break out beyond the limits set by patriarchy; the ordinary bind the wounds within. To celebrate women as lovers or women alone suggests a particular meaning because of our present relationship to patriarchal culture; i.e., that it is unusual for women to be lovers, or to be voluntarily alone. The notion that I believe Rich is getting at is that in the telling of our stories, we can shape our experience, and bring a "better"' reality closer into "being." To remember the stories of all the possibilities helps us to extend those possibilities and to create new ones. I wonder, though, whether the language Rich dreams is common, or whether it plunges us deeper into contradiction and divided loyalties. First, I would argue that we cannot step outside patriarchal culture; we cannot strip our minds totally of patriarchal language and thought. There is no Archimedean point from which to view our dilemma.47 The lesbian continuum about which Rich speaks is also bounded by patriar- chy. It is the patriarchal culture that gives definition/meaning, perhaps also time/space, to woman-identified experience. Even the radical femi-</page><page sequence="13">HaUman 45 nist Mary Daly admits that woman-centred thinking is blossoming only on the edge of male-centred universities.48 It is the context and con- straints of patriarchy that give women's relationships their subversive force. Furthermore, how does the exaltation of woman-identified expe- rience mesh with notions of equality between the sexes? A fundamental tension within feminism is between the idea of female specificity and the idea of male/female equality. I would submit that the notion of equality is as fundamental to feminism as the notion of particularity.49 It is a paradox from which there is no easy appeal. I cannot argue that women are the same as men; neither can I speak with any degree of assurance about the nature of the differences. To speak of women as more intimately connected with life-affirming values and qualities of nurture is in itself to suggest that men are more intimately connected with death-dealing values and qualities of violence. This is a tempting analysis, but to begin with this prima facie assumption is to court the same mind/body dualisms and gender essentialisms we want to avoid. To subvert the meaning of the androcentric myths of Woman as Body, Woman as Nature, Woman as Carnality without fundamentally challenging the categories of sex and sex difference is to reject at some level the notion of equality between the sexes. This I would argue is not to tell the whole story. For as much as women need to name the great powers that orient life from their own perspective, this must surely mean to name our demons as well as our gods. In patriarchy demon has been often read "woman" and clearly this we cannot accept. At the same time, we cannot deny our own demons in a hagiographie hope that "female values... will be our foundation for the transformation of culture."50 Life- affirming values are not the exclusive province of women, nor our only province. Our oppression does not free us from being oppressors - oppressors of men, oppressors of women. We must look at and tell our part in dealing death and destruction. We cannot forget our trade in white feathers.51 Adrienne Rich avoids the question of condemning heterosexual relationships by suggesting it is the wrong question. She argues that heterosexuality is an institution in which women may have qualitatively different experiences but no choice in terms of our participation: "in the absence of choice, women will remain dependent upon the chance or luck of particular relationships and will have no collective power to determine the meaning and place of sexuality in their lives."52 Rich's theory of compulsory heterosexuality provides a deeply insightful way to under- standing how our intimate relationships are determined and how our deep affinity to women is denied. From this vantage point I would agree with Carter Heyward that "heterosexism is a social structure in our</page><page sequence="14">46 Re-Mythologizing Women's Sexuality culture and worthy of only being undone."53 However the dynamics of heterosexuality monolithically understood as the institution of power of men over women is not particularly helpful to women seeking new ways of understanding this aspect of our sexual- ity, and new ways of relating to men. I would argue that our sexual attraction to men, our sexual pleasure with men, our yearning for intimacy with men, cannot be comprehended solely in terms of power or social compulsion. Surely part of our spiritual quest is to open the spectrum of our relationships. We are friends, mothers, comrades, colleagues, sisters, lovers to men as well as to women. All these relation- ships are distorted by the dynamics of power and heterosexism. The stories of all these relationships need to be told in their painful and joyous complexity. If women's stories are mainly stories of struggle, then the struggle is not just to resist male power, but, sometimes with, sometimes against men, to make a better world. Lesbian experience offers powerful possibilities for remythologizing our sexuality. Yet we need to be very mindful of the temptation to female ascendancy. Poet Nicole Brossarďs comment that if there were three sexes, she would be trisexual, poignantly steers us toward a diverse and rich exploration of a much fuller range of possibilities.54 Moreover, the fundamental issues of how all peoples should behave toward one an- other - women to women, men to men, men to women - must not be slipped over by a singular theoretical concentration on the exposure of the injustices for women of a patriarchal and heterosexist ordering of human relations. Finally, I will turn to a brief discussion of Catherine Belsey and Toril Moi as representatives of those feminist critics who retheorized what it means to read and write, who looked closely at the relationship of women to language, who re-thought thinking.55 In one sense, they provide a fundamental challenge to what I have set out to do. By proposing that women need to tell their stories in order to experience their experience, I am accepting, at least to a degree, a relationship of literature to life which allows that an author has an a priori intention or story to tell, that it is possible to faithfully represent it in words, and that its meaning will be readily accessible to the reader. Belsey and Moi effectively undermine these assumptions about writing and reading. They offer a differentiated critique of commonly accepted aspects of literary theory, aspects such as the possibility of a singular universal meaning and the author as the guarantor of that meaning. These assertions, Belsey and Moi point out, do not take into account the polysemous nature of language, the impos- sibility and undesirability of reproducing totally "authentic" experience (who wants to read about toenail clipping?), and the power of the reader</page><page sequence="15">Hallman 47 to produce meaning. Meaning for Belsey and for Moi is never totally fixed. As I have set out their arguments here (rather too simplistically), I agree with them. Yet I believe that it is also a mistake to focus on textuality at the expense of contextuality . I cannot accept that an author does not intend for something to be understood by the reader when she or he writes. Canadian novelist Margaret Laurence, for instance, articu- lated with genuine earnestness her need to speak the heart's truth, to render her time and place exactly.56 She would have agreed that the "something" about which an author writes is shaped and informed by that person's experience. But what a writer chooses to tell (selection, interpretation), how she/he chooses to tell it (language, form, and structure), and what readers understand it to mean from their own experience of self and other texts, involves much more complexity than what is normally understood by mimetic art. From this angle, I do not think the theoretical insights of either Belsey or Moi jeopardize my particular quest, but, in fact, add new dimensions to it. Their belief in the plurality and fluidity of meaning suggest that our naming of the great powers is never a completed act. The myths we write can ultimately be deconstructed, recreated, and reconstructed.57 Conclusion In this paper, I have been primarily concerned to show how women's sexuality and spirituality are intimately connected to each other and to story. The rejection of pejorative stereotypes of women's sexuality in male-authored texts, the recovery and continued creation of a women's literary tradition, and the retheorization of what it means to read, write, and understand story have all helped to disclose different aspects of women's spiritual and sexual identity. In this "drive to connect," women have begun the work of naming the great powers so that the orientation they give is inclusive of all human life, endeavour, and history. Notes 1.
