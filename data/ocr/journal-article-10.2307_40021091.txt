BOOKS IN REVIEW 193 The reviewer finds it very difficult to summarize and evaluate this book. There are two major reasons why this is the case. First, Dupre's great breadth of learning leads him to refer to so many positions on so many points that it becomes rather difficult to detect and follow the lines of argument. Furthermore, even in a book of such great length expositions of so many positions means that, of necessity, each is rather truncated and thus may be misleading. At least this seems to be the case with respect to some of the positions with which this reviewer is familiar such as some of the process and analytical philosophers. Secondly, Dupre's perspective is largely phenomenological and dialectical. While some valuable insights may be gained from such a perspective, this reviewer must confess that he finds much of it obscure, vague, and confusing. The fault, of course, may lie in the reviewer and not in the book. One thoroughly knowledgeable in this mode of analysis might find profound truths in what appear to be obscurities. At the outset Dupre claims that his task as a philosopher is to engage in critical reflection on the given, in this case, religion. Philosophy is concerned with what is, not with what ought to be, nor with predicton of what will be. Thus, his role is that of a critic, not an actor. His purpose is to understand religion, to locate this phenomenon on the total map of human experience. His conclusion is that religious faith is a "complex movement by which the mind discovers a new reality which, although lying beyond the phenomenal and contrasting with it, ultimately integrates all reality into a higher synthesis" (p. 10). Religious experience overcomes the subject - object dichotomy and this unity is expressed through symbol and myth. Revelation, too, escapes this dichotomy and "its symbols unveil the transcendent dimension in which the real reaches its unification" (p. 11). While philosophy may clarify, the origin and development of the concept of God is entirely a matter of the religious act. Involved is dependence upon an absolute reality, the sense of estrangement and integration with the absolute and all other beings. Salvation is discussed in terms of its symbolization in history, moral conversion, and mystical union. Throughout runs the dialectical theme. Religious perception of the transcendent is symbolical and dialectical (p. 14). Negation is always involved in talk of the transcendent for "religious language is always dialectical" (p. 19). Salvation is the dialectical movement "which proposes a transcendent reality, opposes it to ordinary existence, and composes the opposites in a participation of the divine" (p. 19), or in a mystical union with the divine. While Dupre has brought to his discussion of these issues an impressive amount of material from a wide range of sources, it seems to this reviewer that he has not remained consistent with his avowed purpose of being a critic but rather in a subtle way is an advocate for a certain Christian perspec- tive. Perhaps, this is most obvious in the last three chapters dealing with religious alienation, salvation, and mystical union. Yet it is obvious also in</page><page sequence="2">194 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION chapter two where he discusses "positivism" and expresses approval of I. M. Crombie's position. As Dupre understands it, this position exposes the limitations of the Positivists' verifiability criterion of meaning, and insists that religous experience can be verified and understood only in its own terms. Again, it is obvious in what Dupre would add to a purely subjective phenomenological analysis, namely, that "religious experiences are not only real but also are in- tentional, that is, they are states of consciousness which refer beyond the self" (p. 68) . Phenomenology of religion must be "complimented by a philosophy in the older metaphysical sense of the term" (p. lit). But what this means is puzzling, indeed, for there is no explication of such a philosophy, but rather a good deal said about the limitations of metaphysics as exposed by Kant (p. 132). The metaphysician's task, at least in reference to the concept of God, is that of negation (p. 135). Apparently for Dupre the decks are then cleared for faith in its intentionality and dialectical movement leading to mystical union. In the last paragraph of the book Dupre says: The mystical union completes that integration... (which is) the ultimate aim of all religious experience. - All beings are one again, as we al- ways knew they were, and God is with us everywhere. No part of the creation remains strange when all express that God is the Being of all that is. - At that moment man's ultimate dream is being fulfilled (p. 545) . This certainly sounds more like an advocate than a critic. So in spite of the avowed rejection of 'natural theology', the drastic limitations set upon metaphysics, it appears that Dupre has written a defense for a certain type of Christian faith under the guise of an objective analysis and that his work might be characterized as a cryptotheology. Would it not be preferable to openly acknowledge that one is not an impartial critic but rather is an advocate for the Christian faith using what appear to be best tools of analysis for an apology ? In addition to the general criticism above, this reviewer finds a rather large number of claims, descriptions, and arguments in this book concerning which he has serious questions. Only a few can be discussed here. 1. If a philosopher is going to engage in critical reflection on religion, is he not obligated to provide us with at least a working definition of relgion so that the realm with which his discourse is concerned is relatively clear to us ? Is it suf- ficient to claim that religion is undefinable ? According to Dupre: Religion has no definable 'essence', for religion never is - it always becomes. Undoubtedly each type of religion displays a number of ob- jective characteristics which may be described and classified, but they can never be deduced from an a priori form, nor can they be reduced to a common denominator. A universal determination which confines religion to certain particular forms says too much. One which defines religion by its one universal objective trait, namely, a relation to some sort of transcendent reality, says too little for such a relation is not exclusively religious, (pp. 19-20) What is meant by "definable essence" ? Do definitions have anything at all to do with "a priori forms" or "reduction to common denominators" ? Are</page><page sequence="3">BOOKS IN REVIEW 195 they not combinations of defining characteristics each one of which is a sine qua non for the designation in question ? Are not defining characteristics determined through common use in particular language groups and thus may be distinguished from "essence", "a priori forms" and real definitions ? It is not necessary that each defining characteristic in itself be unique - many things may share one or more defining characteristics - but only that all the defining characteristics together serve to distinguish the designation in question from others. To be sure the scope of the definition should be such that its range of denotation is neither too broad nor too narrow but there is no reason in principle why the scope can not fit the range either by adding or by eliminating defining characteristics. Thus there is no necessity for a definition of religion to say either too much or too little, nor for the critic to avoid giving a definition so that it will be relatively clear what domain he has staked out to analyze. 2. It is to be questioned whether or not Dupre has adequately dealt with the verifiability/falsifiability criterion of meaning in general and John Hick's eschatological verifiability for the cognitivity of God-talk in particular. Concern- ing the latter Dupre says that Hick "sees the possibility of falsification in prin- ciple realized in the existence or non-existence of an afterlife. But how could eschatological statements constitute a falsifiability criterion for this life" (p. 67) . The first sentence in this quote is misleadng on two counts. First, in an article footnoted by Dupre ("Theology and Verification", Theology Today, 17, 1960, I), Hick argues that in a few cases there is an asymetrical relation between verification and falsification. An example, not used by Hick, would be the statement, "someone alive today will be alive tomorrow". Surely, this state- ment is verifiable but not falsifiable. Similarly the statement concerning an afterlife is verifiable but not falsifiable. Thus, "falsification in principle" is an inaccurate descripton of Hick's argument. Secondly, it is not that verification in principle is realized in the mere existence of an afterlife. Such could be simply a natural phenomenon. To be sure the existence of an afterlife must be a logical possibility but this possibility only provides a necessary not a sufficient condition for the description of certain possible relevant experiences which would verify the statement, "There is a God". In the second sentence of the quote above Dupre seems to express a mis- understanding of the verificationist's principle of meaning. If a statement has cognitive meaning because it is logically possible to verify or falsify it in terms of describing at least some relevant truth conditions, then empirical factors of time and space are irrelevant. Only if there is a contradiction in the description of possible truth conditions does the sentence lack assertive meaning. Thus, if the afterlife is a logical possibility and relevant truth conditions can be des- cribed at least in principle, then eschatological verifiability may justify the cognitivity of God-talk in this life. It appears that Dupre not only has misrepresented Hick's position but also has failed to deal with the two most serious problems in Hick's position. These are: (1) The adequacy or inadequacy of Hick's eschatological truth conditions for "There is a God". (2) Assuming that the relevant truth conditions could be described, the fact remains that "There is a God" would be contingent statement, the referent of which would exist contingently rather than as a necessary being.</page><page sequence="4">196 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION 3. While there are many valuable points of emphasis in Dupre's discussion of symbol and myth, as for example, the close connection between rites and myths, and the inadequacies of the fundamentalists' literalistic and magical interpretations of myths and symbols, it is also the case that much of the discussion of these topics raises questions as to meaning and consistency. This criticism may be illustrated by the following quotations: "It (analogy) is the basis of religious speech. It merely reminds us that all expressions about God remain expressions about man", (p. 214). "Only symbols - can provide reli- gious language with the two essential conditions - : The subjective involve- ment of the religious speaker and the transcendent nature of his referent." (p. 225) "The dialectical nature of the religious affirmation does not allow any true statement about God in a single proposition." (p. 227) "No statement about God is entirely nonsymbolic, not even the primary ones, but - all discourse about God contains a primary, nonsymbolic dialectical affirmation", (p. 228) "The mythic way of thinking has never been 'surpassed5 by scientific logic for the simple reason that it is a different and permanent method of structuring experience." (p. 248) "At the time Christianity inherited and created its symbols, the mythical mentality no longer existed." (p. 265) Is it the case that the statement, "There is a God", is not a true proposition because it is a single proposition ? Other than the fact that it contains signs (words) what would be its symbolic content ? Is the name 'God' an expression about man ? Is that its nonsymbolic content ? How, then, can this religious symbol also have a transcendent referent ? Must it not be possible to make at least a few primary nonsymbolic statements about God in order for the symbolic expressions to function appropriately ? How can one consistently claim that the mythic way of thinking is permanent and that at the period of early Christianity the mythical mentality no longer existed ? 4. Also to be questioned is Dupre's understanding of the objective in the school of Biblical criticism known as Form Criticism (Formgeschichte) . At one point he quite rightly claims that Form Criticism" has made it unam- bigiously clear that the Scriptures were intended as interpretations for the instruction of Communities" (p. 312), but earlier he states, "the attempt of Form Criticism to separate the facts from the myth has in the end proven to be futile" (p. 270) . Is this latter statement accurate ? Was this not the purpose of earlier Biblical critics and specifically rejected by many of the Form Critics, especially Bultmann ? Was not the purpose of Form Criticism to isolate and classify each individual unit of tradition (pericope) according to its form, and thus to attempt to recover the purpose of the people who produced and applied the first stories about Jesus to their own situation ? 5. Other questions raised by Dupre's discussion can be mentioned only briefly Does the critic objectively analyzing religious experience necessarily have to designate God as the Absolute ? Doesn't this tend to land one in vicious paradoxes of the following type: "God is not a fact. - God is eminently real." (p. 327) ? Aren't there other options, and, in fact, other views ? Is it not one thing to say with Hartshorne (briefly discussed by Dupre) that God necessarily exists and quite another to designate God as the Absolute ? On the basis of such a view, and of the traditional notions of God's omnipotence and omniscience, is it not impossible to arrive at a viable theodicy ? Is the</page><page sequence="5">BOOKS IN REVIEW 197 mystic vision the sole goal of all religious experence ? If the novel element in Christianity is "the fact that God himself is identified with love" (p. 477) , is not the goal of salvation a universal fellowship in which there is perfect freedom and perfect faithfulness ? Does 'fellowship' have the same meaning as 'mystical union' ? Is it not sufficient to describe salvation (discussed by Dupre in the next to last chapter) as a fellowship of love without considering it to culminate in a mystical union ? It would be unfair to Dupre to end this review without briefly mentioning some of his very valuable contributions with which I fully agree. First, I have always thought that the substitutionary theory of atonement was objectionable because of its dubious moral implications. But Dupre quite rightly points out the anthropomorphic assumption implied in this doctrine (p. 457) . Secondly, I think that Dupre is right in his claim that faith is the all integrating factor of life, that it involves the total person in his heritage, his loves, and his hopes, but that it does not function as a solution to the pro- blems of our times (p. 25) . Rather its function in a secular world is to relativize values by placing them in a transcendant perspective (a similar view held by Reinhold Niebuhr) . Thirdly, I think that Dupre is right in his claim that reason, intelligence, and philosophical reflection can serve faith by bringing it to heightened awareness of itself. Surely, as Augustine, Anselm, and Aquines were well aware, an intelligible faith sustains the human spirit much better than one which is irrational and unintelligible. It may be that Dupre is not entirely successful in his search for intelligibility but the goal is a laudable one. Fourthly, I agree with Dupre that "demythologizing' is a necessary and constant process but that the elimination of myth would be destructive of the very nature of religious symbols" (p. 277) . Fifthly, I totally agree with Dupre's claim that "religious love (agape) subsumes all other loves" (p. 479). As Daniel Day Williams (The Spirit and the Forms of Love) has pointed out, agape does not deny nor negate other types of love (sexual, intellectual, etc.) but affirms, deepens, enriches and fulfills them. Thus, God in his love seeks for that ideal form of human community which is the precondition for and the expression of the fulfillment of human life. While I find much that is helpful and valuable in Dupre's book, the obscurities, in my judgment, tend to overshadow the strong points. Again, I must confess that this judgment may reflect my own inadequacy with respect to Dupre's method of analysis so that the obscurities, indeed, may be my own and not attributable to the author.
