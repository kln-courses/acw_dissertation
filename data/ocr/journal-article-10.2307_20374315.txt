Professor of Anaesthetics, University of Durham AND P. DENHAM CHRISTIE, B.Sc. The anthropomorphic immersible dummy which has been constructed for the investigation of design problems of lifebelts (Pask, 1961) has now been used at sea on several occasions. The behaviour of the dummy in actual sea conditions clearly differentiates between the performance of various types of life-jacket in main taining a safe floating position for an inert human form, and observers have no difficulty in recognizing these differences. It has, however, proved to be more difficult than was anticipated to secure adequate cinematographic records which would serve as permanent objective evidence. The tender vessel must be small, so that the dummy can be manhandled overside and so that the presence of the tender does not modify the sea conditions. In fact, in all tests the tender has been the Tynemouth lifeboat Tynesider, which has been fitted with sheer-legs for hoisting the dummy overside. The dummy usually is allowed to drift free on the weather-bow of the tender. In anything other than a flat calm it is difficult for the tender to keep consistent station nearer than 50 yards (46 metres) from the dummy. Thus to secure an adequate size of image on film a long-focus lens must be used. Both the dummy and the tender are in lively motion in normal sea conditions and it is very difficult to secure steady films which permit careful study of the dummy's behaviour. Accordingly another system of recording results has now been devised. Method of Recording Results A light plastic framework (Fig. 1) is strapped over the dummy's mouth. The framework carries a copper wire, insulated except at its tip, and the insulation is treated with sili cone to render it water - repellent. When water splashes over or covers the dummy's face, contact is estab lished ? between the exposed tip of the copper wire through the water ? with metallic portions of the dummy's skeleton. The completion of this circuit actu ates a miniature transistor oscil Fig. 1.?Light plastic framework jator an(j tne strapped over dummy s mouth. A , . tone generated is recorded on a miniature wire recorder ("minifon"). The oscillator and the recorder are completely sealed in a plastic bag and are carried in a canvas pouch strapped to the dummy's right thigh (Fig, 2). The plastic bag is flexible enough to allow the push-button Fig. 2.?Plastic bag carrying oscillator and recorder. switches of the recorder and the battery switch of the oscillator to be operated through the bag. The recorder and oscillator have a volume of about 1,000 ml., and, enclosed in their bag, exert a buoyancy of about 150 grammes. This added buoyancy must slightly alter the floating properties of the dummy. However, a castaway might often carry equipment of such or greater buoyancy, and a life-jacket which failed critically because of such a small disturbing influence could not be regarded as satisfactory. A waterproof inlet, through a jack connexion, allows a microphone to be connected in place of the oscillator so that details of the equipment under test can be dictated on to the wire. When played back the wire record produces a tone whenever the dummy's mouth and nose were covered with water, and this allows an assessment of the percentage of time that free breathing would have been possible for a weak or inert man. By the use of a simple rectifier circuit and a fast-responding galvanometer pen, the record can be written out on paper. It is an all-or none record. Deviation of the pen from the baseline indicates splashing or immersion of the dummy's face. Results Three typical records are presented. Sea conditions when these records were made were as follows: wind light to moderate S.E., with a moderate swell from the east upon an unsheltered east coast. The tests were made about 2 miles (3.2 km.) offshore. The first record (Fig. 3) refers to a merchant-ship life jacket (Fig. 4 A) which conforms to the requirement of the International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea as ?t present in force, which requires that the life-jacket shall be reversible?that is, that it shall not matter whether the belt is put on inside-out or back to front. Inevitably such a life-jacket must furnish buoyancy symmetrically distributed on chest and back, and can therefore have little or no tendency to turn an inert subject face up. Using an anaesthetized man as test subject, Macintosh and Pask (1957) found that it was largely a matter of chance whether or not the subject's</page><page sequence="2">334 AUG. 4, 1962_DESIGN OF LIFE-JACKETS_yJSHS,^ face would be immersed because it depended upon the posture in which he first fell into the water and upon wave action. The dummy is, so far as is possible, dropped vertically into the sea. The record shows that for the first five minutes the dummy's face was continually immersed, then wave action threw the face clear, and during the remainder of the test period there were only occasional brief periods of immersion. The second record concerns a prototype life-jacket (Fig. 4B) designed to take advantage of the new provisions of the 1960 Convention on Safety of Life at Sea, which has not yet been ratified by sufficient member countries and therefore is not yet legally operative. Since reversibility, other than the capacity to be worn inside out, is no longer mandatory, a life-jacket with asym metrical buoyancy and therefore with some "self righting " properties can be designed. Life-jackets for merchant ships are required in vast numbers. They must be robust and simple, easy to maintain, and resistant to deterioration from storage and misuse. Some com promise with an ideal buoyancy distribution may have to be accepted. In this instance the jacket provides some lateral support for the head, but this is not as full as is possible. In practice the life-jacket supported the dummy much more favourably than in the first test. It quickly turned the dummy face up, and thereafter only occasional waves washed over the face. The record shows that the dummy's face was immersed briefly at the moment of launching, as is almost inevitable, but thereafter the mouth and nose were free of water except for brief sporadic immersions. The third record concerns a much more sophisticated life-jacket of a type used by a foreign lifeboat service (Fig. 4 C). The life-jacket offers excellent lateral support to the head, useful immersed buoyancy behind the shoulders, and sufficient high anterior buoyancy to provide a vigorous self-righting moment. In addition, two mobile flaps, indi cated by the hand in Fig. 4 C, heLp to deflect waves from the face. When an inert man, or the dummy, floats freely the legs sink since they have a specific gravity greater than sea-water. The legs then tend to act as a drogue, and the upper part of the body sup ported by the life-jacket is subject to the action of the wind. The man, or dummy, thus comes to lie facing the oncoming waves and wind in most sea conditions. If wrongly designed, the life-jacket may actually cause such waves to break over the face. If correctly designed, it may deflect the water away and assist in keeping the face free of water and spray. The mobile flaps referred to above float upwards and appear to have a useful action in deflect ing the oncoming waves. The third record shows that, apart from a brief immersion on launching, the dummy's face remained free of water throughout the test period. Much work remains to be done in our attempt to find objective evidence of the differences in per formance of variously constructed life-jackets. The results described suggest that real differences exist even in the moderate sea conditions which prevailed during these tests. Visual observations strongly suggest that the differences ki performance are even greater in rough conditions.

A system of recording the duration and frequency of the periods when the face of the dummy is immersed has been devised. When an appropriately placed electrical contact is immersed, it causes a transistorized audio frequency oscillator to record a tone on a minature wire recorder attached to the dummy's leg. The wire-recorder can be " played back " on to a fast-responding recording galvanometer so that a written record is obtained of the periods of immersion of the dummy's face. Examples of such records are presented. We wish to record our thanks to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and, in particular, to the honorary secretary and crew of the Tynemouth lifeboat for their great assistance. The cost of construction of the dummy was borne by a generous grant from the Sir Halley Stewart Trust. References Macintosh, R. R., and Pask, E. A. (1957). Brit. J. industr. Med.. 14, 168. Pask. E.
