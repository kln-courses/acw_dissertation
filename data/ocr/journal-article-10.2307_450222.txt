ENTZMINGER Prior to his humiliation the biblical Samson is a bully who plays crude practical jokes and takes an unmerited pride in his verbal dexterity. As with the riddle his wedding guests solve, however, his reliance upon his wit and tongue to forestall Dalila's curiosity leads to disaster. Milton's Samson suffers the consequences of his scriptural heritage. Appropriate to a figure whose pride has issued as often in words as in deeds, he falls the victim of his own "Shameful garrulity" (491),' and his punishment for disclosing a holy secret, he thinks, is the revocation of the divine promise to employ him in an heroic enterprise. With the veracity and constancy of God's eternal decree thus called into question, human lan- guage becomes an even more uncertain medium. Subject now to the "daily fraud, contempt, abuse and wrong" (76) of his accustomed visi- tors, Samson becomes distrustful of words, fearful of their power, and reluctant to credit their apparent meanings. Though he had once ex- ploited the capacity of language for ambiguity and figurative meaning, he now views its polysemous quality with suspicion, requiring the Chorus to speak with a precision that admits no misconstructions. When they announce Harapha's approach by the self-consciously clever metaphor of an imminent storm, Samson responds, "Be less abstruse, my riddling days are past" (1064). Through most of the poem, Samson identifies words with the mutable and alien external world from which he must protect himself. Accepting this distrust as Milton's own position, Anne Ferry finds that "The poem itself . .. paradoxically denies the power of eloquence, of literature."2 Robert L. Entzminger, assistant professor of English at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, has published articles on Chaucer, Spenser, and Milton.

Where before he had employed riddles as a means of flaunting his superiority over his enemies, however, by the end of his ordeal he adopts a metaphoric, ironic language that expresses both self-deprecation and faith in God. Resuming thus on new terms his role as riddle-master, Samson certifies his access to a spiritual understand- ing previously unavailable to him and at the same time provides himself the means to act upon his insight. While Samson until his exchange with Harapha continues to distrust language, by the end of the poem he affirms its power as an instrument whose strength, like his own, derives from its apparent weakness. If Samson manifests his heroism at the end of the poem through his regained control of figurative language, his self-torture at the outset lies in a literalism expressed in his masochistic obsession with paradox. Met- aphor unites terms potentially disparate by viewing them from a per- spective which discloses significant points of similarity; paradox, on the other hand, insists upon the discreteness of the terms by maintaining the ordinary, reasonable human viewpoint from which their irreconcilabil- ity is most noticeable. Limited through most of the poem to a concept of heroism derived from his earlier experience, Samson feels keenly the painful discrepancy between his previous role as God's champion and his present humiliation, between the promise he had been reared to fulfill and the frustrating conviction that his goal will be achieved without his participation. The reversal of his expectations forces him to recognize weaknesses his former glory had left undetected. "0 impotence of mind, in body strong" (52), he laments in acknowledgment that his confidence of success was founded upon a virtue less self-sufficient than it seemed. The paradoxical vulnerability of his strength is matched by the irony of his seeking the sun in his blindness. "[D]ark in light" (75), he can find neither comfort in the "various objects of delight" (71) available in the visible world nor the means to resist his detractors, so that he feels him- Pittsburgh Press, 1970), pp. 175-94; and the brief rejoinder to both by Anthony Low, The Blaze of Noon: A Reading of "Samson Agonistes" (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1974), pp. 107-108. Low points out that Ferry and Landy overstate their case, basing their argument for the whole poem on an attitude expressed by Samson prior to his final illumination. He does not, however, explore the significance of Samson's recov- ery of deceptive language, finding the irony of his last speeches to be the result simply of "tactical necessity" (p. 107).</page><page sequence="3">ROBERT L. ENTZMINGER 139 self "Inferior to the vilest now become / Of man or worm; the vilest here excel me, / They creep, yet see" (73-75). The refusal of contradictory facts to disclose a coherence, to yield to rational inquiry the means of their reconciliation, both tortures Samson and compels his attention, and so despite his aversion the language of paradox inhabits his speech and betrays his divided mind. Though in closing his lament he reaches for a metaphor, equating his present condition with burial, he rejects the figure because the differences between death and his imprisonment override the similarities and make a real grave preferable: As in the land of darkness yet in light, To live a life half dead, a living death, And buried; but 0 yet more miserablel Myself my Sepulcher, a moving Grave, Buried, yet not exempt By privilege of death and burial From worst of other evils, pains and wrongs, But made hereby obnoxious more To all the miseries of life, Life in captivity Among inhuman foes. (99-109) The oppositions which define his life seem to collide with cruelly de- structive force because Samson thinks of them as existing in the same plane: the physical, external, visible arena where his previous victories were won. Finding it impossible, from the perspective of his own self-pity, to reconcile his chosenness with his present condition, Samson concen- trates his obsession with paradox on instruments apparently inadequate to perform the tasks assigned them. His initial way of dealing with the inappropriateness of his hair and his eyes to their functions is to deny the significance of the ends they fail to serve, discovering thus in their mu- tual meanness a literal congruence between instrument and purpose. If his strength is impotent "without a double share / Of wisdom" (53-54), Samson sees its triviality underscored in the means of its preservation: "God, when he gave me strength, to show withal / How slight the gift was, hung it in my Hair" (58-59). While he provisionally resolves the puzzle of his hair by denigrating what it was to protect, he finds in the loss of his eyesight a paradox less easily dismissed, but he later reconciles himself to the problem in a similar way. In his opening monologue he questions without apparent satisfaction the disparity between the im- portance of sight and the vulnerability of the instrument to which it is entrusted:</page><page sequence="4">140 SA MS ON A G ONIS TES Since light so necessary is to life, And almost life itself, if it be true That light is in the Soul, She all in every part; why was the sight To such a tender ball as th' eye confin'd? So obvious and so easy to be quench't? (90-95) But in his exchange with the Chorus he begins to value his physical sight less, discovering in his affliction a blessing which saves him from appre- hending the full impact of his failure (195-99). The bitter lesson Samson draws from the inadequacy of his hair as a guardian of his strength, the painful irony he feels in the vulnerability of his eyes despite their crucial function, are not the only inferences capa- ble of being drawn from the objects whose meanness apparently dis- qualifies them for their assigned tasks. SamuelJohnson pronounced the frequent "allusions to low and trivial objects . . . unsuitable" for tragedy,3 but the very discrepancy that both Johnson and Samson find troubling is intrinsic to the biblical story and an aid to defining the terms on which the resolution of Milton's poem occurs, the nature of the mid- dle Johnson failed to locate. Both the Chorus and Samson refer to the jawbone with which he vanquished the "choicest youth" (264) of their captors as a "trivial weapon" (142; 263), and if neither is yet aware of the significance resident in the instrument's meanness, the commentators are plain. In his sermon on Psalm 102.16-17, Stephen Marshall alludes to the episode to illustrate God's power: "Sow a bad piece of ground, God doth not use to give a strong crop there; but it's quite otherwise in the building of the church, whatsoever the tooles or instruments are, it skills not one whit: Great instruments doe not further it, weak instru- ments cannot retard it: If he will fight, it's indifferent whether his weapon be a sword, or the jaw-bone of an Asse."4 For Richard Rogers the motif is a recurrent one in the Book of Judges. About Gideon's dream, whose results the Chorus describes in remarking on the fickleness of the Israelites (277-81), Rogers observes, "God doth his people good by things which are of no reckoning nor account. " 5 Even in the choice of the Danite Samson to be a deliverer, Rogers finds God demonstrating a power so supreme he can afford to be arbitrary: "[T]his tribe being one of the meanest: It teacheth that God will serve himselfe by the meaner ,Rambler, no. 140, Saturday, July 20, 1751; in The Yale Edition of the Works of SamuelJohnson, ed.

Like Oedipus, Samson is the riddle-master who has become himself his own riddle, and while his stature as a tragic hero depends upon his solving the enigma, his illumination is inseparable from the verbal process through which it is gained and from his command of the ambig- uous, metaphoric language in which it is expressed. For Samson seeing and saying are mental operations inextricably related; words are not simply a function of thought but the means of thinking. In a recent book Mary Ann Radzinowicz has shown how a variety of Milton's ideas be- come refined through a process of dialectic, and she finds the same verbal process leading Samson from a divided self to an integrated per- sonality.7 But though she recognizes that his verbal exchanges are cru- cial to his development, she does not consider the extent to which his growing understanding of himself is related to his discovering the limits and possibilities of the kinds of language he and his visitors employ. Samson's spiritual recovery depends in part upon his renewed ability to interpret metaphorically circumstances he has previously regarded as paradoxical, and he regains this verbal capacity in two steps. First he must achieve an ironic detachment from his present condition that will allow him not simply to denigrate his eyes and his strength but to appre- ciate the inner vision and virility for which his physical sight and power are merely crude analogues, shadowy types. Once he discerns the spiri- tual meaning latent in his physical circumstances, however, he must then reaffirm his identity, acknowledging the value of vehicle as well as tenor to his recovered heroism. I To the process of detachment Samson's visitors perform a crucial if unintended function. Suspicious of words at the beginning of the poem, Samson only delays his restoration, for despair is overcome by discov- ering a vocabulary whereby its causes and nature can be expressed. Once objectified, whether through language or some other set of sym- bols, the despair seems less integral to the self and therefore capable of being transcended. In theological terms, recovery from sin starts with recognition of sin. Samson's visitors, then, both provide him the oppor- tunity to articulate his pain and are themselves, as many critics have demonstrated, symbols of the flaws Samson must excise before his re- 6Rogers, p. 614. 7Mary Ann Radzinowicz, Toward Samson Agonistes: The Growth of Milton's Mind (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1978), especially pp. 3-66.</page><page sequence="6">142 SAMSON AGONISTES generation can be complete. Rejecting their offers, he purges himself of the tendencies they represent.8 Milton's prefatory analogy to ho- meopathic medicine justifies the concepts of purgation, lustration, or catharsis in terms of which we ordinarily discuss the role of the visitors, and despite some disagreement over Milton's likely understanding of the terminology, its usefulness is borne out by the changes Samson under- goes.9 But the effect of his visitors on Samson is more complex and variable than the analogy suggests, and by restricting ourselves to its terms we have been led to define their function too narrowly. Their importance, it seems to me, lies not just in how Samson sees them, but in how they lead Samson to see himself. In his encounters with his visitors, Samson comes to regard himself through the surrogate eyes they pro- vide, and the revision of his circumstances that their perspective offers is reflected in a language increasingly more adequate to express the spiri- tual insight he is moving toward. As the countrymen whose hopes for deliverance have fled with Samson's defeat, the Chorus anticipates issues raised on a more intimate level with Manoa, but they also represent a simplistic version of Samson's view of himself at the beginning of the poem. To an even greater extent than Samson, the Chorus concentrates on the external, physical aspects of his fall. While he is tortured by the paradoxes of his reversal, however, they simply espouse contradictory positions without attempting to rec- tify them. Despite their insistence that his previous "high estate" was not due to "long descent of birth / Or the sphere of fortune" (170-72), they 8For a full treatment of purgation, see Raymond B. Waddington, "Melancholy Against Melancholy: Samson Agonistes as Renaissance Tragedy," in Calm of Mind, ed. J. A. Wittreich, Jr. (Cleveland: The Press of Case Western Reserve Univ., 1971), pp. 259-87. Although my discussion, like Waddington's, follows what seems to be a consen- sus, there is far from general agreement on the specific sin each visitor represents. Sherman H. Hawkins, for instance, sees Samson purging the tragic passions grief, pity, and fear ("Samson's Catharsis," Milton Studies 2, ed. James D. Simmonds (Pittsburgh: Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1970), p. 223); while Georgia Christopher finds his visitors purging Samson of rage against God, search for extenuation, and fastidiousness ("Ho- meopathic Physic and Natural Renovation in Samson Agonistes," ELH 37 (September 1970):361-73); and Radzinowicz sees him facing self-doubt in the Chorus, self-tenderness in Manoa, appetency in Dalila, and aggression in Harapha (p. 52). Other critics prefer to demarcate Samson's development in terms of the steps toward regeneration outlined in the Christian Doctrine. See George M. Muldrow, Milton and the Drama of the Soul: A Study of the Theme of the Restoration of Men in Milton's Later Poetry (The Hague: Mouton, 1970), pp. 170-225. 9For the terms of the disagreement, see Paul R.

ENTZMINGER 143 locate the cause of his present degradation in the inexplicable turning of Fortune's wheel: "By how much from the top of wondrous glory, / Strongest of mortal men, / To lowest pitch of abject fortune thou art fall'n" (167-69). This failure to perceive the contradiction lends support to the judgment of Louis Martz, who speaks for the majority of critics in finding the Chorus's language "dry and commonplace, often surpris- ingly flat."'0 It is possible that this quality of their speech is only the poetic flaw Martz sees, but it seems to me that their pedestrian expres- sion is integral to the poem, characterizing not only their own limitations but also drawing our attention to an aspect of Samson's personality that they unwittingly help him overcome. For if the Chorus embraces contradictions without acknowledging them or lectures Samson with theological commonplaces (210-14) in an attempt to fit his fall to the categories of received wisdom, Samson like- wise betrays a certain hollowness in his refusal to "call in doubt / Divine Prediction" (43-44) despite his sense that he is disqualified from fulfill- ing his apointed task. Though they provide him the occasion to unbur- den himself, to articulate his torment to a commiserating ear, the Chorus shows so little insight into the spiritual causes of his grief that consciously they can only reinforce his reliance upon platitudes. More important than their attempt at consolation, however, is the provoca- tion to self-defense they offer. Faced with their insinuation that he has betrayed his people, Samson is forced to counter in precise terms the common opinion the Chorus echoes. As a result, the absence of convic- tion he shows in his opening confession of faith changes to vehement certitude. Turning the accusation on them, he reminds them that Israel failed him before he failed Israel; to his victory at Rameth-lechi "Had Judah that day join'd, or one whole Tribe, / They had by this possess'd the Towers of Gath, / And lorded over them whom now they serve" (265- 67). The arrival of Manoa extends and intensifies the sympathy the Chorus expresses, but his presence also implies an accusation less easily dis- missed than theirs. More fully than the Chorus, Manoa shares Samson's awareness of the cruel ironies of his humiliation: O wherefore did God grant me my request, And as a blessing with such pomp adorn'd? Why are his gifts desirable, to tempt Our earnest Prayers, then, giv'n with solemn hand As Graces, draw a Scorpion's tail behind? (356-60) l?Louis L.

Thus in answering Manoa's complaints Samson addresses his own resentment as well, and the fervor of his language reveals a reconciliation to God's justice more complete than his previous submission to "Divine Prediction." Like the vigorous self-defense he conducts against the Chorus's insinuations, Samson's response to Manoa's impiety displays, as Thomas Kranidas has noted, a "clarity and particularity" about his sin that indicates he is "pulling himself to- gether. "11 But if Samson finds in his father a greater appreciation of his grief than in the Chorus, he also sees both in the topic of their exchange and in Manoa's persistent love a reminder of the heavenly Father whose cause he has abandoned. Rather than comforting Samson, then, Manoa's continued devotion reinforces his son's guilt at having repaid with infidelity the divine solicitude he describes as paternal love: I was his nursling once and choice delight, His destin'd from the womb, Promis'd by Heavenly message twice descending. Under his special eye Abstemious I grew up and thriv'd amain; He led me on to mightiest deeds. (633-38) Though Samson can decisively refute the Chorus's accusation that he has failed the Israelites, he can only acquiesce to the charge of betraying God for which Manoa's presence is a tacit reminder. In fact, the defense of God's justice that Manoa elicits forces Samson to feel even more keenly the burden of his guilt, for it leaves him with no extenuating circumstances to plead. Thus if through Manoa Samson is able to purge his resentment, he is nonetheless left at his father's exit with an intensi- fied sense of guilt, and despite its temporary recovery his language again reveals an absence of control that leads him to find his only cure in "death's benumbing Opium" (630). The retrogression seems to be pro- voked by Manoa's efforts to ransom him. Because the Chorus is more limited in their sympathy, Samson never entirely accepts their definition of his circumstances, and in talking with them he comes to find in his loss of sight a blessing which saves him from realizing the extent of his humil- iation. His exchange with Manoa, however, leads him to see himself through his father's eyes, and he recognizes in the offer to ransom him the implication that he has become simply a useless invalid.

ENTZMINGER 145 him so exclusively as an object of pity, Manoa would deprive him even of the bitter dignity of those who suffer justly because they have earned God's anger, and the suggestion leads Samson to consider as the cause of his torment a possibility more horrible than he had previously imagined. As with the Puritans whose condition Samson in some measure repre- sents, the affliction which assures one of God's continued notice is far preferable to the "sense of Heav'n's desertion" (632) Samson feels at Manoa's departure. 12 If the vision of his son that Manoa offers causes Samson to plunge even more deeply into despair, the image of himself that he imputes to Dalila, while more humiliating, evokes a renewal of energy and intellectual control manifested in the precise reasoning with which he rejects her invitation. Her motives for returning have provoked considerable specu- lation, 13 but the theories remain unverifiable because Milton has chosen not to clarify her intentions. For the purposes of the poem, all that matters is Samson's interpretation of her motives, and the accuracy or adequacy of his verdict is less significant than how it leads him to see himself. As the flaw she has exhibited in her previous betrayal is "weak- ness to resist / Phzlistian gold" (830-31), so in her return she shows not love but "furious rage / To satisfy thy lust" (836-37). In refusing Manoa's similar offer Samson has rebelled at being treated as an object of pity; he now rejects along with Dalila the image of himself he imputes to her: an object for physical gratification. She would have him use divine strength, he believes, for the pleasure of a Philistine harlot. To Milton's readers Manoa's continued solicitude may obliquely suggest the constancy, despite appearances, of the heavenly Father's care, and simi- larly Dalila may provide, in the love she expresses, a parodic analogue to the divine beneficence on which Samson must come to trust. Further, in seeking forgiveness without acknowledging guilt she may imply by omis- sion an important stage in Samson's recovery.'4 Samson, however, can- '2lnterpreting afflictions as a sign of God's solicitude is not limited to Puritanism, but it is a view Puritans after the Restoration found especially congenial. '3Most critics, agreeing with Thomas Kranidas that "Dalila's speeches show her too as clever, too easily various to be simply lecherous" ("Dalila's Role in Samson Agonistes," SEL 6 (Winter 1966): 136), followJoseph H. Summers in finding in her "the prototype of the woman who wishes to reduce her lover to an object totally within her power" ("The Movements of the Drama," in The Lyric and Dramatic Milton, ed. Summers (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1965), p. 167). Similarly, A. B. Chambers sees her im- pelled by malitia, "a perverse love of causing harm" ("Wisdom and Fortitude in Samson Agonistes," PMLA 78 (September 1963):318). On the other hand, William Empson accepts her reasons ("A Defense of Delilah," Sewanee Rezvew 68 (Spring 1960):240-55); and Don Cameron Allen agrees, but only because she is too shallow to recognize in herself the motives Samson detects (The Harmonious Vision: Studies in Milton's Poetry (1954; rev. edn. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1970), pp. 88-89). 14For this reading of Manoa, see Nancy Y. Hoffman, "Samson's Other Father: The</page><page sequence="10">146 SAMSON AGONISTES not know or appreciate patterns of Christian theology which Milton's readers may discover. For him the positive lessons she parodies are less important than the debasing view of himself he imputes to her and banishes along with her. In rejecting her offer he purges himself of the lust to which Rogers attributes Samson's blindness: "[T]he occasion of his sinne was his ungoverned eye, the evill heart being soone inflamed and provoked thereby."'5 But if he overcomes the lust she represents to him, nonetheless he retains the value of seeing himself through her eyes, and the detachment thus acquired is reflected in his renewed control of language. In their exchange he sees himself as having formerly been her toy, and thus it is significant that language, the instrument with which she had earlier defeated him, now becomes the "trivial weapon" he uses to with- stand her renewed verbal barrages. As he has with his first wife, Samson has dared to contend with Dalila using words as weapons, and in both instances his hubris has led to his defeat. The answer to his riddle divulged to his wedding guests, he retaliates with arson and forfeits his Timnan bride to the Philistine stake. Similarly he matches wits with Dalila: Thrice I deluded her, and turn'd to sport Her importunity, each time perceiving How openly, and with what impudence She purpos'd to betray me. (396-99) But on the fourth attempt Samson surrenders his "fort of silence" (236), overpowered "With blandisht parlays, feminine assaults, / Tongue bat- teries" (403-404). Dalila's speech is the instrument whereby she has originally conquered Samson, and her continuing eloquence suggests she is relying upon proven strategy to reassert control over a domain to which she believes she has a right. If her wardrobe is now a comically ineffectual tool for seducing a blind man, nonetheless in speech she remains a "sorceress" (819) whose persuasive power recalls the "fair en- Character of Manoa in Sarmon Agonzstes," Milton Studies 2, ed.

Previously Samson has shown himself incapable of learning from the past. Marrying Dalila on the basis of a false analogy with his disastrous first marriage, he then ignores the lessons the perfidy of his Timnan wife and Dalila's earlier betrayals should have taught him. Now, however, he has learned the value of skepticism. While in his bluntness he cannot match the eloquence with which she attempts to regain control of him, nonetheless he is her match in reason, refusing to condone in her a fault he will not forgive in himself and arguing marital obligations against her plea of patriotism. Where with Manoa clarity has fallen victim to de- spair, Samson's prosecution of Dalila evinces a recovery of verbal power accompanied by a renewal of confidence in his physical strength. Seek- ing in desperation to circumvent his arguments through an appeal to his former weakness, Dalila attempts to shift their debate to grounds she feels will be more advantageous to her. But the threat of violence with which Samson denies her request suggests he is capable of translating to the physical level the same demolishing force with which he counters her verbal charms. Samson's resort to the precise language of legal distinctions in answer- ing Dalila's arguments, however, precludes an unqualified victory. For while the rigor of his logic may satisfy those readers who share his belief in the superiority of Israelite law, we must recognize that to Dalila his claims must seem less than compelling.'7 Though she admits that his arguments possess an internal logic that hers lack, she denies him ulti- mate success by refusing to accept the validity of his assumptions. Against Samson's appeal to the sanctity of marriage as the basis for his prosecution, she pleads national security as the overriding motive, and she can flounce off confident that Samson has demonstrated not the falsity of her cause but only the inadequacy of her defense. As with the paradoxes that beset Samson, the contest of values cannot be decided as '6For an elaboration of this point see John M. Steadman, "Dalila, the Ulysses Myth, and Renaissance Allegorical Tradition," MLR 57 (October 1962):560-65. 17At least two critics have argued that the debate remains unresolved: Virginia R. Mollenkott, "Relativism in Samson Agonistes," SP 67 (January 1970):89- 102; and Stan- ley Fish, "Question and Answer in Samson Agonistes," CritQ 11 (Autumn 1967):237-64. For an attack on this position which finds Samson's arguments wholly persuasive, see Joan S. Bennett, "'A Person Rais'd': Public and Private Cause in Samson Agonistes," SEL 18 (Winter 1978):155-68. While the legal distinctions Bennett draws may be valid, they can only be effective refutations if Dalila accepts their legality, which she does not. Robert H. West also questions relativistic interpretations, in "Samson's God: 'Beastly Hebraism' and 'Asinine Bigotry,"' Milton Studies 13, ed. James D.

Yet if Dalila retires with her dignity unimpaired in her own eyes, Harapha departs "somewhat crestfall'n" (1244). Dalila can retreat into the isolation of her culture assured of her vindication because Samson meets her appeal to a national standard of value with his own reliance upon Israelite law, but he defeats the giant by answering the contingent in terms of the absolute. When Harapha charges him with being "A Murderer, a Revolter, and a Robber" (1180), Samson first mocks the limitations of the law, exploiting its reliance upon observed behavior as the only index to motive. Whatever his intentions, he argues, his actions were blameless until the Philistines provoked him. But the real ground for his defense is not the legal one of provocation but the extralegal one of divine mission: "I was no private but a person rais'd / With strength sufficient and command from Heav'n / To free my country" (1211-13). Answering this time the categories of human law with the imperatives of divine sanction, Samson shows he has achieved a detachment that allows him to play with legalistic distinctions in a way that confutes and con- fuses Harapha. In his confidence in the external and the physical, Harapha personi- fies the past that haunts Samson. Not only does he represent the enemy Samson has failed to vanquish, he is in his role as successful champion for his people the son Manoa would have preferred, and in his swag- gering virility he is the lover Samson believes Dalila wants. But though he conceives of himself as Dagon's champion, Harapha defines his god in terms exclusively legalistic and cultural, and so he is, as Samson calls him, "bulk without spirit vast" (1238). Where Manoa's love is a faltering approximation to its divine counterpart, Dalila's plea for mercy a pa- rodic version of the forgiveness on which Samson must rely, Harapha's relationship to spiritual values is totally negative; he is a summation of all that true heroism is not. In vanquishing the giant Samson does not fully succeed in purging his pride, which is still apparent in his eagerness to appoint the time and place for God to vindicate himself. He does, however, overcome his literalism, preparing himself at last to recognize the spiritual truths to which his experiences have been pointing but which have remained until now hovering just beyond Samson's reach. To Harapha the difference between Philistines and Israelites is a mat- ter of custom. The Hebrews are to him simply "the unforeskinn'd race" (1100), a phrase recalling the Chorus's synecdochic reference to Samson's felling "A thousand foreskins" (144) at Rameth-lechi and Samson's equally contemptuous dismissal of his captors as "the uncircumcis'd" (260). Harapha's legalism and literalism are further ex- pounded in his fastidious appeal to the code of chivalry to save him from accepting the challenge of a condemned blind man who "hast need</page><page sequence="13">ROBERT L. ENTZMINGER 149 much washing to be toucht" (1107), and in his inability to think symboli- cally. Accompanying the literalism of primitive cultures is an animism which merges the natural and the supernatural in the magical. Thus for Harapha Samson's strength cannot reside in his hair, "Where strength can least abide, though all thy hairs / Were bristles rang'd like those that ridge the back / Of chaft wild Boars, or ruffl'd Porcupines" (1136-38). Instead he attributes Samson's victories to "spells / And black enchant- ments, some Magician's Art" (1132-33). Although Samson had earlier spoken of his hair as the repository of his might, he now appreciates that its significance lies in its symbolic properties. His "locks unshorn" are to him "The pledge of my unviolated vow" (1143-44), an interpretation which agrees with William Perkins's reading: "Sampson's strength lay not in his haire (as men commonly think) but because he went out of his calling, by breaking the vow of a Nazarite, when he gave occasion of Dalilah to cut off his haire, therfore he lost his strength."18 The capacity to think symbolically requires that we hold the concrete and the abstract levels in suspension, allowing neither the abstract to subsume the concrete (as in allegory) nor the concrete to absorb the transcendent (as in animism). In imputing a symbolic meaning to his hair, Samson demonstrates his growth beyond the self that Harapha represents, a self similarly wedded to legalism and literalism, but it is a growth that Harapha has helped to stimulate. Where Manoa has seen Samson as an object of pity, Dalila (at least as far as Samson is con- cerned) as an object of lust, Harapha sees him as an object of scorn. Coming to view himself through the eyes of his visitors, Samson becomes progressively more detached from the limitations his physical circum- stances impose. But detachment is only a necessary step toward his re- newed heroism, not its substance. Once he transcends the conditions which have seemed a barrier to the fulfillment of God's promise, he can begin to reconcile himself to his present existence in a new way. Thus while previously he has recoiled from the image he finds mirrored in his visitors, here he ironically embraces the prospect of himself as an object of contempt. Taunting Harapha with an aggressively self-deprecating pose, Samson is beginning to regard himself in a new light, preparing himself to discern in his apparent meanness a symbolic potential similar to the one he discovers between his hair and his strength. Challenging Harapha to single combat, Samson continues the strat- egy he has used in disputing legal points: he employs a vocabulary famil- iar to his opponent but applies it in circumstances which make its rele- vance problematic. In flaunting his meanness Samson allows the giant '8A Treatise of the Vocations, in The Works of ... W. Perkins, 3 vols. (Cambridge, 1608-1609), 1:729.</page><page sequence="14">150 SAMSON AGONISTES to refuse combat by appealing to the same code of chivalry in terms of which Samson proposes their duel. Thus by turning on his tormentor paradoxes similar to those that have besieged him earlier in the poem, Samson baffles and humiliates his enemy. But while the disparity be- tween the language of chivalry and the event to which it is applied defeats Harapha, Samson discovers new possibilities in the contrast. The oaken staff with which he proposes to meet the fully armed and armored giant is another of the trivial weapons in Samson's arsenal, looking forward to the sling David will use to dispatch Harapha's son but also recalling and re-evaluating the apparently inappropriate instruments Samson has formerly brooded over. As he proposes an unequal battle to decide "whose God is strongest, thine or mine" (1 154), Samson seems to realize for the first time the significance of disparity, for by consciously relying upon instruments in themselves trivial he illustrates the suprem- acy of God's power. It remains for Samson to explore more fully the implications of the victory his pose has won him, and to refine his ironic language into an instrument capable not only of derision but of affirma- tion. Perceiving the metaphoric potential latent in his physical attri- butes, Samson must learn to express his vision in a figurative language that asserts his readiness to act in God's service while acknowledging his absolute reliance upon divine strength. II The development of Samson's character results, with his conquest of Harapha, in a renewed sense of his integrity. Impulsively offering to fight the fully armed giant with only an oaken staff, Samson illustrates the lesson he most needs to learn. Because the power and the victory will belong to God, the triviality of the weapon is immaterial. While Samson seems not at this point to realize the full significance of his gesture, his "rousing motions" (1382) will soon allow him to see himself as a weapon whose triviality does not preclude its effectiveness. But he must first come to regard himself, his afflictions, and even his death with indif- ference, for only in relinquishing his claim to service does he become once more fully serviceable. As William Bridge had reminded his con- gregation, "It's an hard thing for one that hath been used, to be con- tented to be used no more: oh! that Magistrates, Ministers, Men of serv- ice could but be willing to be used no more, and to be laid aside if God will have it so. A man is never more fit for service, then when he is willing to be used no more in service."' 9 Thus, still not understanding how both possibilities may eventuate, Samson accompanies the Philistine Officer, confident that the "day will be remarkable," but whether "By some '9William Bridge, England Saved with a Notwithstanding (London, 1648), p. 22.</page><page sequence="15">ROBERT L. ENTZMINGER 151 great act, or of my days the last" (1388-89) he leaves totally to God's disposing. 20 The blind slave whose degradation had once seemed to invalidate the promise of heroism now acknowledges the possibility of further use. But as his carelessness with words has played a crucial role in his downfall, so now he must not simply perceive but also articulate the terms of his renewal. Regaining his mastery of language, Samson joins in full equal- ity the company to which he feels his countrymen's fickleness has already entitled him. Among the betrayed Israelite heroes with whom he com- pares himself is 'jephtha, who by argument, / Not worse than by his shield and spear / Defended Israel from the Ammonite, / . . . In that sore battle when so many died / . . . For want of well pronouncing Shibboleth" (283-89). Uniting words and deeds in a way Samson has yet to accomplish, Jephtha defeats his enemies and then, with his pronun- ciation test, separates the faithful from the hypocrites. Similarly Samson must join victorious deeds to the vanquishing power of the mockery he has directed against Harapha. But more important, he must begin to use language as a means of expressing his sense of the relationship be- tween the divine and the human. The result is at once to confess his submission to God's will and to conceal his meaning from the unfit audience whose literal-mindedness is suitably punished. Using puns as Jephtha uses pronunciation, Samson divides his au- dience between those whose understanding is carnal, idolatrously lit- eral, and those who like Milton's readers are capable of discerning the spiritual references in his speech. The epithet agonistes suggests a com- plex variety of Samson's attributes. His physical athleticism is the most obvious reference, but that in turn points to the spiritual struggle from which he emerges as God's champion, and his physical and spiritual torment resonates as well with the modern sense of the word "agony." But the epithet also indicates his mastery of language. Alan Rudrum has noted that "agonistic" is a rhetorical term denoting "the attempt to overcome an adversary in argument, "21 a meaning whose relevance is confirmed in Samson's exchanges with Dalila and Harapha. The theat- rical applications of the term, however, suggest more fully the nature of Samson's renewed control of words. For Milton the word indicated at once a willing entertainer, an object of ridicule, and a mocking de- ceiver,22 and Samson finally subsumes all three possibilities. Not only IOThis future reconciliation of apparent opposites Low calls the "irony of alterna- tives." He finds it pervasive in Samson Agonistes and, with one exception, unique to Milton's poem (pp. 77-89).

(1404-406). The impulsive flaunt- ing of his meanness which overcomes Harapha has been transformed into a consciously deceptive pose, mocking the Philistines and parody- ing, as Joseph Summers has observed, those who like the Chorus are "incapable of heroism.""3 The mockery and deception become even more explicit when with devastating irony Samson announces his final demonstration of strength by proclaiming, "Now of my own accord such other trial / I mean to show you of my strength, yet greater; / As with amaze shall strike all who behold" (1643-45). But the language which deceives the Philistines as it invites their ridicule or offers to entertain them has for Samson and Milton's readers another dimension. Ap- parently submitting to the threats of his Philistine captors, Samson is in fact acknowledging his obedience to a divine command; and in intro- ducing a new demonstration of his strength ostensibly invented for the diversion of his audience, Samson is actually describing its literally strik- ing effect and at the same time pointing to the "greater" strength upon which his own depends. Thus in deceiving the Philistines through language, Samson resumes his earlier role as a riddle-master. But the metaphoric language he speaks both propounds mysteries to the Philistines and expresses his resolution of the riddle of his own life, a resolution based upon his in- sight into realities comprehended by neither the arrogant bully nor the despairing slave. Like many riddles, the one Samson poses to his wed- ding guests asks the respondents to reconcile an effect with a cause ap- parently its opposite: meat from the eater, sweet from the strong. Samson's life has the same "causal contradictive" structure.24 Somehow he must believe that his degradation does not preclude his heroism just as he has already learned that being God's chosen can result in humilia- tion. Riddles are not normally amenable to logical inquiry, which only produces the kind of obsessive fascination that draws his visitors to Sam- son, and Samson to the contradictions between his past and present existences. Instead they require an exercise of intellectual acrobatics: the respondent must maintain a dual perspective, regarding the terms of the puzzle as at once literal and metaphoric until a satisfactory combina- tion of meanings presents itself as a sudden insight.25 "Summers, p. 172.

ENTZMINGER 153 Just as the solution to Samson's riddle involves juggling the literal and figurative meanings of the terms, so in order to resolve the paradoxes of his life he must discover a significance in God's promise and his present condition not immediately apparent, and in so doing he acquires once more a metaphoric language resembling that of the earlier Samson. Yet the tenor of the metaphors at the end of the poem opens out onto a spiritual dimension not available in his earlier speeches. Like the lan- guage with which he seems to acquiesce to his captors' demands, the riddle of the lion and the honey is intended to mock and deceive, but both the vehicle and the tenor of the metaphors in the riddle are drawn from the world of sensory experience. The same constricted imagination is evident in the language with which the biblical Samson accuses his wedding guests: "If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle" (udges 14:18, RSV). Similarly Milton's Sam- son calls Dalila "Monster" (230), "Hyaena" (748), and "viper" (1001), and he likewise turns on himself the scorn these comparisons imply, lamenting that Dalila "shore me / Like a tame Wether" (537-38). Even when Samson refers to God early on, it is in anthropomorphic terms that seem either to reduce God to a jouster (463-71) or to domesticate him into literal fatherhood (633-37). At the end of the poem, however, the metaphors he employs to express his renewed faith in God's guidance, though the vehicles are drawn from-human attributes, seem to exalt rather than diminish their divine tenors because they stress not how God is like man but how far his mastery and strength surpass their human analogues. Samson's visitors lead him first to transcendence and then, at least incipiently in his challenge to Harapha, to a discovery of his continuing usefulness, and his growing control over words reflects his spiritual con- valescence. But the ironic language with which he taunts Harapha has primarily a negative, derisory intent. Achieving a full submission to God's will, he acquires at the same time a metaphoric language capable as well of affirming his faith. This final stage in Samson's development, however, is one for which his visitors provide at best the intellectual form; the substance that underlies his metaphors and seems to confirm his regeneration is supplied inexplicably, attributed to "Some rousing motions" (1382). Nothing in his previous experience causes him to un- derstand the relationship between the physical and spiritual dimensions implicit in his figurative speech. Appreciating the tenor of his meta- phors requires the possession of special information, available only through revelation. Thus if his life assumes the structure of the riddle he Abrahams and Alan Dundes, "Riddles," in Folklore and Folklife: An Introduction, ed. Richard M. Dorson (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1972), p. 130.</page><page sequence="18">154 SAMSON A GONIS TES poses to his wedding guests, the solution is forthcoming in the same way. For his question is not a true riddle but a "neck" riddle, one on which the riddler may safely risk his neck because its solution depends upon infor- mation only he knows.26 But the knowledge Samson acquires intuitively, through a direct revelation, is accessible to Milton's readers discursively, and his experience assumes greater significance as the result of our fa- miliarity with the Christian theology in terms of whose patterns we de- fine Samson's recovery and his heroism. As Samson's sudden illumination gives him an advantage over the Philistines and his countrymen, so our possession of scriptural revelation gives us an advantage over him. Not only do we know the outcome of his trials, we are also aware of the pattern of heroism toward which he is reaching, for we know as Samson does not the antitype whose subse- quent actions provide the model for interpreting Samson's regeneration and sacrifice. Aided by the allusion to the Phoenix (1699-1707), we can recognize in Samson's humiliation and martyrdom an anticipation of Christ, a typological resonance made even more pronounced by the imagery of binding and loosing which looks forward to Samson's Christ- like transcendence of Hebrew law. Similarly, as both Michael Krouse and Barbara Lewalski point out, the parallels between the captivity of the Israelites and the embattled position of the Good Old Cause after the Restoration make Samson an especially appropriate type of the Chris- tian Elect.27 In a sense, then, the means Samson employs to redefine the heroic potential of his life poses a riddle to Milton's readers, and ours like his depends for its solution on the knowledge only revelation can pro- vide. But where his revelation is special and therefore limited to the circumstances he faces, the revelation to which we have access is general and thus capable of confirming in terms of an accepted pattern not only Samson's regeneration but also its continuing significance to the Church Invisible. Yet the extent to which our possession of Christian revelation can confirm the divine source of Samson's illumination is limited. Because grace is a free gift registered only in the human soul, we can neither account for its dispensation nor objectively verify its reception with final certainty. Consequently the careful tracing of Samson's regeneration may be no more than a critical myth, an inference of causes from effects 26For Samson's question as a neck riddle, see Archer Taylor, "The Varieties of Rid- dles," in Philologica: The Malone Anniversary Studies, ed.

ENTZMINGER 155 such as the one Millicent Bell has performed with Paradise Lost. 28 But the absence of conclusive evidence, it seems to me, is not an artistic flaw but a reiteration of one of the poem's basic points. Meaning becomes clear only in retrospect, and while our access to Scriptural revelation seems to confirm the legitimacy of Samson's inspiration, nonetheless our interpretation occurs even as God's historical plot continues to unfold, and so we must recognize that our solution is subject to constant revalua- tion, a process that cannot cease "Till time stand fixt" (PL, XII.555). Thus like Samson we must learn to act without knowing fully either the grounds or the consequences of our actions. As Stanley Fish has said, "And so we learn finally, that the choice is not between informed action and precipitate action, but between action taken on the basis of inade- quate information-faith professing action-and paralysis. And if we are able to follow Samson, we learn to live with what we have learned."29 The confidence of Samson unshorn resides in presumption, the "carnall securitie" that, according to John Downame, persists without doubt of salvation, but only so long as "they enjoy the outward benefits of this life." True assurance, on the other hand, accepts the limits of human certitude as it is marked, in its final stage of sanctification, by not setting "our mindes upon worldly things."30 Like Samson and Milton's readers, Manoa and the Chorus reinterpret Samson's life from the perspective his martyrdom provides, but lacking revelation their definition of his victory remains confined to the histori- cal and cultural dimensions Samson has come to transcend. Manoa takes grim satisfaction in his son's fulfilling the angel's promise, assuring himself that Samson hath quit himself Like Samson, and heroicly hath finish'd A life Heroic, on his Enemies Fully reveng'd hath left them years of mourning, And lamentation to the Sons of Caphtor Through all Philistian bounds.

We must not assume that in our superior knowledge we have measured all the resonances Samson's experience may provide, for the pattern in terms of which we define his experience is still in the process of being fulfilled. By the end of the poem we are led to realize that language is capable of expressing meanings confined neither to the speaker's intentions nor to the understanding of his auditors. Yet while at the outset Samson takes this polysemous quality of language as a cause for distrust, his develop- ment finally reaffirms the metaphoric potential of language as the only means of expressing truths otherwise too complex and apparently con- tradictory to be apprehended. In the figurative language his "rousing motions" allow him to master, Samson is able to resolve the paradoxes whose disparity had tormented him. The vertical, spiritual dimension he perceives can be joined to the promise of heroism in the horizontal, physical world, and the unity can be expressed, the heroism achieved, through a language capable of referring to both dimensions at once. This convergence of perspectives, then, transforms disjunction to conti- nuity, paradox to metaphor, but as it correspondingly resolves low and high, trivial and ultimate, it generates a figurative language especially appropriate to Christianity, whose central mystery of the Incarnation is itself a sacred pun, a riddle like Samson's concluding speeches. The expression of Samson's heroism, then, reaffirms the language of the poem, which throughout exploits for their metaphoric or typological significance items and events that are otherwise insignificant, suggesting thereby the continuing presence, despite appearances, of God's "guid- ing hand" (1).</page></plain_text>
