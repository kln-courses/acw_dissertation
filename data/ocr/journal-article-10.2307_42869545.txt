ABSTRACT: A Face from the Past: an Early Paleoeskimo Ivory Maskette from Devon Island, N.W.T. In 1986 a small ivory carving of a human face was discovered at the Icebreaker Beach Site on northeastern Devon Island, N.W.T. in association with artefacts of an Early Pre-Dorset affiliation (circa 3900-3600 B.P.). The face portrayed is that of an elaborately tattooed elderly Asiatic woman. The maskette dif fers from Dorset depictions of the human face both stylistically and in the lack of overt symbolic content. Conceptual similarities, however, indicate that the Icebreaker Beach maskette is an early manifesta- tion of an evolving Paleoeskimo artistic tradition that ultimately originated in the Bering Strait region or beyond. Introduction Dorset art has long been acknowledged as one of the great artistic tradi- tions of the New World (Taylor and Swinton 1967, Taylor 1971/72).

The carvings they produced are usually small, beautifully proportioned and executed in exquisite detail. The dominant theme portrayed is the pantheon of animal species of economic, and, perhaps spiritual significance to their arctic-adapted creators (Taylor and Swinton 1967; Taylor 1971/72; McGhee 1981; Taçon 1983a; Maxwell 1985). Favoured subjects include the polar bear - the most frequently depicted animal motif in Late Paleoeskimo art - the walrus, the seal, the caribou, the hare, birds and even fish. Human figures were also carved. Late Paleoeskimo human representations are frequently naturalistic - though seldom entirely lifelike. Sometimes they are merely rough schematic outlines. Occasionally, the anthropomorphic figures produced by Dorset carvers are highly abstract, verging, in extreme cases, upon the grotesque (Taylor and Swinton 1967). The stylized ornamentation of utilitarian objects - more fre- quently harpoon heads - as well as the abstract, often non-functional, representa- tion of the utilitarian objects themselves are other distinguishing features of the Late Paleoeskimo artistic tradition (Lyons 1982; Taçon 1983a, 1983b; Maxwell 1985). The ideational "meaning" of Dorset art has been the subject of numerous academic papers (cf. Meldgaard 1960; Taylor and Swinton 1967; Harp 1969/70; Larsen 1969/70; Mary-Rousselière 1970, 1971; Taylor 1971/72; Collins 1974/ 75; Taylor 1975; Blodgett 1978; McGhee 1980, 1981; Lyons 1982; Taçon 1983a, 1983b). It is generally conceded that Dorset art pieces are deeply imbued with shamanistic themes. Moreover, the symbolism employed by Late Paleoeskimo artisans - the emphasis on bear spirits, the concept of "soul flight" and the transformation of the shaman into animal form - is accepted as at least a partial expression of a belief system common to many ethnographically-documented circumpolar peoples1. Despite the wealth of information on the subject of Dorset art, the ultimate origin and developmental history of this unique form of artistic expression remains largely unknown. Most northern scholars agree that Dorset art reached its pinnacle during the Late Dorset Period of the Arctic Small Tool tradition oí circa 1,500 to 900/500 B.P. (Meldgaard 1960 : 24; McGhee 1981 : 26; Taçon 1983a : 160)2. During the Late Dorset Period, a remarkable uniformity of style is recognized across the Arctic (Lyons 1982, Taçon 1983a, 1983b). There are far fewer art pieces known from the Middle Dorset Period of circa 2000 to 1500 B.P. In contrast to the Late Dorset Period, several regional 1 It should be noted that these analogies are based on perceived similarities of form and not on demonstrable historical relationships. 2 Throughout much of the Eastern Arctic, the Late Dorset Period terminates at circa 900 B.P. In parts of southeastern Hudson Bay and northern Ungava, however, Late Paleoeskimo complexes persist to circa 500 B.P. Unfortunately, few, if any, examples of Dorset art are reported from these terminal Dorset occupations. 180/JAMES W. HELMER</page><page sequence="3">stylistic variants have been identified for this interval (Jordan 1979/80; Thomson 1981, 1982; Lyons 1982; Taçon 1983a, 1983b). Of these, the Labrador/New- foundland variant is perhaps the most distinctive (Harp 1969/70; Jordan 1979/80; Thomson 1981, 1982). Art is rarer still in the Early Dorset Period of circa 2500 to 2000 B.P. Examples from this time period are too few to determine if regional stylistic variability occurs. Despite this limitation, the sophistication of these pieces and their similarities to later specimens has led Swinton (1972 : 114) to conclude that they are "such... highly accomplished piece(s) that... (they)... could stand at the end or even at the height of a period rather than at its beginning." Most archaeologists believe that the ultimate roots of the Dorset artistic tradition lay in the Pre-Dorset Substage of the Arctic Small Tool tradition which dates from between circa 4200 and 2800 B.P. (Taylor and Swinton 1967; Taylor 1969, 1971, 1972, 1975; Maxwell 1985)3. Unfortunately, only a small number of fragmentary pieces of Early Paleoeskimo art, some of questionable chronological affiliation, have so far been recovered. Noteworthy examples include a badly eroded antler maskette from Kugarjuk IV at Pelly Bay (Mary- Rousselière 1964 : 183) two small carvings from West Greenland, one of which is engraved with an x-ray skeletal motif (Martijn 1964 : 550), a small ivory bird effigy from the Ridge Site on eastern Ellesmere Island (Schiedermann 1978 : 461) and a crudely carved seal effigy and two fragmentary ivory maskettes from the Igloolik area (Maxwell 1985 : 95). The majority of these discoveries - all of which clearly show affinities with later developments - have been associated with the Late Pre-Dorset Period of the Arctic Small Tool tradition dating to the interval circa 3200 to 3000 B.P. Many of these pieces may actually date to the slightly later Terminal Pre-Dorset or Transitional Dorset Periods of circa 3000 to 2500 B.P. (Taçon 1983a : 76). The earliest evidence of Early Paleoeskimo art in the eastern Arctic comes from the Middle Pre-Dorset component at the Umingmak Site on Banks Island. Here, a number of decorated bone and antler utilitarian artefacts were recovered from a context C-14 dated to circa 3400 B.P. (Müller-Beck 1977 : 5). The designs on these objects are mostly simple geometric incisions such as parellel lines, "y" shapes and "v" shapes. Several tools, however, bear schematic, but nonetheless clearly identifiable, incised depictions of birds and caribou (Müller-Beck 1977 : 58-71). These incised animal figures, however, are the only known examples of representational art on record from this early time frame. Three-dimensional renderings of humans or animals do not appear to occur in Early Paleoeskimo contexts dated earlier than circa 3000 B.P. (Maxwell 1984 : 362). 3 Several scholars (i.e. Taylor and Swinton 1967 and Collins 1974/75) have commented on the similarities between Late Dorset art and the somewhat earlier art forms associated with the Okvik and Ipiutak traditions of Northwest Alaska and the Bering Strait areas. As noted by Taçon (1983a : 79), these similarities may be a reflection oí a common cultural antecedent for all three complexes or may simply be indicative of a shared shamanistic belief system. PRE-DORSET IVORY MASKETTE/181</page><page sequence="4">A significant stylistic gap clearly exists between the earliest manifestations of Early Paleoeskimo art and Dorset art. With the exception of the few pieces dating to the Late and/or Terminal Pre-Dorset Period described above, Early Paleoeskimo art lacks those features which make later Dorset art so distinctive. These features include the emphasis on naturalistic and/or abstract human and animal imagery, carving in the round and the body of symbolism associated with "soul flight" and "transformation". Until very recently, therefore, it has been impossible to establish conclusively that the origins of the Dorset artistic tradi- tion lie in the Early Paleoeskimo Stage. In the summer of 1986 a small ivory carving of a human face was recovered from the Icebreaker Beach Site, Devon Island, N.W.T. This exquisitely detailed piece was found in direct association with an Early Paleoeskimo artefact assemblage which can be dated, on typological and contextual grounds, to the interval circa 3900 to 3600 B.P. This makes the Icebreaker Beach maskette the oldest known example of Paleoeskimo representational art. The age of the Icebreaker Beach maskette and the sophistication of its execution have extremely important implications for theories regarding the origins and developmental history of the Dorset artistic tradition. The principal objectives of the remaining portions of this paper are to fully describe the Ice- breaker Beach maskette, to firmly establish its cultural and chronological affilia- tions, and to evaluate its similarities and dissimilarities to analogous Late Paleoeskimo art forms. The Icebreaker Beach Site The Icebreaker Beach Site (QkHn-13) is located on the northeastern coast of Devon Island in the central Canadian High Arctic Archipelago (Figure 1). It was discovered in 1982 during a preliminary assessment of the archaeological resources of the North Devon Lowlands (Helmer 1982). QkHn-13 occupies a series of well-defined fossil beach terraces which rise from the western shore of a small sheltered inlet on the central Truelove Lowland coastline (Figure 2). The site consists of 10 oval tent rings, three caches, a single isolated external fire box, a poorly defined midden and a dense scatter of surface artefacts (Figure 3). These features are unevenly distributed over several raised beaches and range in elevation from circa six to nine metres above sea level.4 4 The earliest archaeological sites in the North Devon Lowlands, which are carbon- 14 dated to circa 4100 B.P., occur on raised beaches ranging in elevation from between 12 and 15 metres above sea level. Early Paleoeskimo complexes dating to circa 3400 to 3600 B.P. have been dis- covered on beaches ranging in elevation from four to six metres above sea level. These elevations are extremely low compared to those of other Early Paleoeskimo occupations of similar ages. While the upper marine limit in the study area is comparable in elevation to other Far Northern locations, the post-glacial emergence curve for the North Devon Lowlands region - especially over the past approximately 5,000 years - is much flatter. The apparent anomaly of the beach ridge chronology in the North Devon Lowlands is currently being examined by geographers from the University of Western Ontario (Roger King/?m. comm., 1986). 182/JAMES W.

PRE-DORSET IVORY MASKETTE/185</page><page sequence="8">Context of the carving The ivory carving was discovered in the interior of Feature I, one of three features excavated at the Icebreaker Beach Site during the 1986 field season. Feature I is located on the eight to nine metre beach terrace - the highest terrace at QkHn-13. It is a small oval tent ring measuring approximately 3.5 X 4 metres in diameter (Figure 4). The extant pattern of boulder distribu- tions hints at the presence of a much disturbed axial mid-passage alignment, oriented down-slope on a northeast/southwest axis. The maskette was found beneath one of the large flat slabs that once formed a part of the probable mid-passage arrangement (Figure 4). It lay face down (which probably contributed to its remarkable state of preservation) on the surface of a buried pea gravel matrix. Such gravels are frequently encountered beneath the thin, artefact-bearing, humus layer and organic mat that covers the Icebreaker Beach Site. There is no evidence to suggest that the maskette was intrusive into either the matrix or the structure. Description of the carving The Icebreaker Beach maskette is a small, oval piece of walrus ivory measuring 54.2mm in length, 29.3mm in width and 8.2mm in thickness (Figure 5). Its reserve side has been heavily eroded. Any detail that may have existed on this surface has been lost. The effects of weathering on the obverse surface are fortunately restricted to some discolouration and a small amount of exfoliation at the distal end. A three dimensional rendering of a human face is preserved on the obverse side of the piece. It is a magnificently executed visage... austere, yet deeply imbued with character. The individual so accurately portrayed is clearly Asiatic, with relatively Hat features, high cheek bones, narrow eyes (depicting epicanthic folds?) and a broad nose. Indeed, there is a striking similarity between the face depicted on the Icebreaker Beach maskette and the facial characteristics of living Arctic Mongoloid peoples (cf. Coon 1965 : Plate 7). The subject portrayed may have been elderly. The series of deeply incised lines radiating out from both eyes, the set of eight vertical lines extending from the nose to the upper lip and the v-shaped lines bisected by a strait line on either side of the tight-lipped mouth resemble wrinkles. Conversely, these marks may represent tattoos. Certainly, the eight slightly curving incisions on the fore- head, the single deep line from the top of the head to the tip of the nose, the two parallel marks on either side of the nose, the two sinusoidal incisions running from the temples to the lips on either side of the face and the twelve radiating lines extending from the bottom lip to the base of the chin are examples of tattooing, scarification, or some other form of facial decoration. Facial tattooing was once a very common practice amongst the indigenous populations of the Far North (Damas 1984a). It was especially prevalent amongst 186/JAMES W. HELMER</page><page sequence="9">those groups living on either side of the Bering Strait (Nelson 1899 : 50). Graphic evidence of this practice can still be found on the faces of elderly North American and Greenlandic Inuit. Figure 4: QkHn-13 Feature 1. PRE-DORSET IVORY M ASKETTE/ 1 87</page><page sequence="10">Figure 5: The Icebreaker Beach maskette. 188/JAMES W. HELMER</page><page sequence="11">Some of the stylistic elements found in the tattoo marks on the Icebreaker Beach maskette, particularly the set of radiating lines on the chin and the parallel marks on the nose, bear strong resemblance to ethnographically documented circumpolar tattooing conventions (Figure 5; cf. Hughes 1984 : 254; Ray 1984 : 295; Burch 1984 : 313; Spencer 1984 : 335; Damas 1984b : 404; Taylor 1984 : 511; Petersen 1984 : 637). Similar facial markings have also been found on the well preserved "mummies" discovered at the 500 year old Qilakitsoq burial site in West Greenland (Hansen, Meldgaard and Nordqvist 1985 : 207)5. In most circumpolar societies, tattoos similar to those depicted on the ivory maskette from QkHn-13 were borne exclusively by post-adolescent women (Nelson 1899 : 50). This convention was apparently also followed by the pre- historic peoples who buried their dead at Qilakitsoq (Hansen, Meldgaard and Nordqvist 1985 : 202). Male tattooing, where practiced, utilized different stylistic elements (cf. Nelson 1899 : 50). There is a strong possibility, then, that the "face from the past" depicted in such careful detail on the Icebreaker Beach maskette was that of an elderly woman of Arctic Mongoloid descent. Cultural affiliation and chronology of the carving A small assemblage (N = 134) of stone tools was recovered from Feature I at the Icebreaker Beach Site (Figure 6). This collection includes several mis- cellaneous biface fragments (Figure 6 : a-c), a small ovate sideblade (fig- ure 6 : d), an "eared" or "flared" endscraper (Figure 6 : e), three concave side- scrapers (Figure 6 : g-i), numerous small, heavily spalled burins (Figure 6 : j-q), one complete and two fragmentary stone adzes (Figure 6 : r-s) and a large number of microblades and burin spalls (Figure 6 : t-w). In addition, a small serrated-edge, tapered-stem endblade (Figure 6 : x) and a stemmed biface (Figure 6 : y) were found outside the tent ring but at the same beach elevation. Thirty artefacts manufactured from bone, antler or ivory were also obtained (Figure 7). These include a complete self-bladed, open-socketed, harpoon head with a flat cross-section (Figure 7 : a), two distal fragments of either self- bladed harpoon heads or darts (Figure 7 : b-c), a tapered-stem dart with a single line hole (Figure 7 : d), five antler barbs (Figure 7 : e-f), five complete needles (plus seven needle fragments) with round cross-sections and circular eyelets (Figure 7 : g-h) and a number of worked bone, antler or ivory fragments (Fig- ure 7 : i-j). Included amongst the worked bone and antler fragments from this feature is a small piece of decorated bone (Figure 7 : i). A series of narrow parallel lines running perpendicular to the long axis of the piece has been incised into this object at regular intervals. Each line is bisected by a sequence of very short, 5 Very early evidence for fac ial tattooing is also reported by VanStone and Lucier (1974) f rom Northwest Alaska.

This artefact is similar in concept, if not execution, to other pieces of Early Paleoeskimo decorative art. The artefact assemblage recovered from QkHn-13 Feature 1 is typical of virtually all Early Paleoeskimo components dating from between circa 3800 and 3400 B.P. (cf. Maxwell 1973, 1985; McGhee 1976, 1979) Typologically, there is no reason to believe that Feature 1 post-dates the Middle Pre-Dorset Period. Further refinement of the cultural and chronological affiliations of this collection is hampered by the paucity of more temporally sensitive artefact forms. Several artefacts in the collection from Feature 1, however, are potentially time diagnostic. These include the eared endscraper (Figure 6 : e) and the open- socketed harpoon head (Figure 7 : a) recovered from the interior of the tent ring, and the serrated, tapered-stem endblade (Figure 6 : x) and the tapered-stem biface (Figure 6 : y) found in the immediate vicinity of Feature 1. Eared or flared endscrapers, serrated endblades with tapered stems and tapered-stem bifaces are diagnostic of some of the earliest manifestations of the Arctic Small Tool tradition in the Eastern Arctic - the Independence I complex of Northeast Greenland and the Canadian High Arctic (Knuth 1967; McGhee 1976, 1979) and the Early Pre-Dorset phase of northern Labrador (Tuck 1975; Cox 1978), for example. Such complexes date to the interval of circa 4000 to 3750 B.P. The artefacts from the Icebreaker Beach Site are very similar to specific artefacts reported from the Independence I-related Port Refuge Site (McGhee 1979 : Plate 3 : j-1 and Plate 6 : s) and from a series of northern Labrador Early Pre-Dorset sites reported in Cox (1978 : Figure 2 : f-h). These similarities, though inconclusive in themselves, may be indicative of shared cultural chronological affiliations. Harpoon heads are relatively rare in Early Paleoeskimo contexts. The earliest well known forms appear to have been tang-based, barbed, non-toggling weapons. Such artefacts have been reported from Independence I and Sarqaq components in Greenland and High Arctic Canada (Knuth 1967; McGhee 1976, 1979; Meldgaard 1983). This type appears to have "evolved" into a barbed, open-socketed variant by circa 3900 B.P. (Maxwell 1985 : 86; McGhee 1976, 1979). Meldgaard (n.d.) describes a self-bladed, open-socketed harpoon head with a flat cross-section from the Igloolik area which he believes to have been coeval with these latter barbed and socketed specimens. He identifies these self-bladed forms as Type-state B harpoons. The temporal parameters for these artefacts appear to fall between circa 4000 and 3500 B.P. The complete harpoon head from QkHn-13 Feature 1 is stylistically very similar to the Type-state B harpoon head illustrated by Meldgaard (n.d.). Furthermore, it can be easily distinguished from later manifestations of the same harpoon type-state which are more markedly conical in cross-section (Maxwell 1985 : 83). These recent forms are said to date to the interval circa 3600 to 192/JAMES W. HELMER</page><page sequence="15">3400 B.P. This suggests that the age range of circa 3600 to 3900 B.P. is a reason- able approximation for the Devon Island specimen. Independent corroboration of these age estimates comes from the three other features excavated at QkHn-13 between 1983 and 1986 (Helmer 1984, 1985). Feature 4, a large oval tent ring examined in 1983, yielded a modest sample (N = 210) of lithic and organic artefacts (Figure 8). These include bipointed endblades (Figure 8 : a), small straight-based triangular endblades (figure 8 : b), straight-stemmed endblades (Figure 8 : c-d), tapered-stem bifaces (Figure 8 : f), large ripple-flaked oval and triangular sideblades (Figure 8 : g-h), flake knives (Figure 8 : i), a wide variety of burin forms (Figure 8 : j-p), and numerous microblades and burin spalls (Figure 8 : q-v). Organic tools recovered include a single unilaterally-barbed tang-based harpoon head (Figure 8 : w), several bone needles (Figure 8 : x-y), a unilaterally-barbed bird dart (Figure 8 : z), several antler perforators and barbs (Figure 8 : aa), a bone knife blade (not illustrated) and a bilobate bowl or lamp of whale bone (figure 8 : bb). Features 14 and 15 were excavated at the Icebreaker Beach site in 1986 in conjunction with the examination of Feature 1. Feature 14 is a small oval tent ring measuring approximately 3.5 X 4 metres. Feature 15 is the designation given to a 5 X 6 metres section of midden on the circa eight metre beach terrace sampled by block excavation. A large sample of lithic and organic artefacts was recovered from both features - N = 408 from Feature 14 and N = 322 from Feature 15 (Figure 9). Distinguishing characteristics of the combined lithic assemblage include straigth- based and concave-based triangular endblades (Figure 9 : a-b), straight-stem and tapered-stem bifaces (Figure 9 : c-d), a large side-notched biface (Figure 9 : i), several small ovate sideblades (Figure 9 : e), thumb-nail endscrapers and con- cave sidescrapers (Figure 9: f-h), a variety of burin forms (Figure 9:j-m), microblades and burin spalls (not illustrated). Organic artefacts of interest include a tang-based, unilaterally-barbed harpoon head (Figure 9 : n), two self- bladed, open-socketed harpoon heads (Figure 9 : o), several darts with single unilateral barbs (Figure 9 : p), an ivory arrow foreshaft (?) (Figure 9 : q), a frag- ment of what appears to have been a throwing board (Figure 9 : r), numerous needles with round cross-sections and circular eyelets (Figure 9 : s), a carved ivory piece resembling a bear claw (Figure 9 : t), a unilaterally-barbed fish spear (Figure 9 : u), an ivory lancehead (Figure 9 : v) and an antler handle (not illustrated). I have argued elsewhere (Helmer 1984, 1985) that the artefacts from QkHn-13 Feature 4 represent a stage that is technologically transitional between the Independence I and Pre-Dorset complexes of the Canadian High Arctic. This interpretation is based on the occurrence of Independence I diagnostics (small contracting-stem bipointed endblades, tapered-stem bifaces and tanged and barbed harpoon heads, among others) in association with Pre-Dorset diagnostics (straight stem endblades, lack of edge serration, oval tent rings etc.). A radiocarbon date for Feature 4 of 3850 +/- 95 B.P. (NMC-1313) - which PRE-DORSET IVORY MASKETTE/193</page><page sequence="16">Figure 8: Selected artefacts from QkHn-13 Feature 4. 194/JAMES W.

PRE-DORSET IVORY MASKETTE/195</page><page sequence="18">falls midway between the accepted temporal parameters for Independence I and Pre-Dorset in the Arctic Archipelago - reinforces this interpretation. The artefacts obtained from Features 1, 14 and 15 are very similar to those recovered from Feature 4. In my opinion, these four features pertain to either a single occupational episode or a sequence of cyclical occupations separated by only very brief intervals of time. Comparative criteria, supported by the single C-14 date from Feature 4, indicate that the four features examined at QkHn-13 likely represent Early Pre-Dorset Period occupations dating to the interval of circa 3900 to 3600 B.P. By extension, the Icebreaker Beach maskette found in Feature 1 is also an Early Pre-Dorset artefact with comparable temporal parameters6. The Icebreaker Beach maskette and the Dorset art tradition Representations of the human face in Dorset art occur in highly variable forms. Masks, maskettes, multiple face carvings, statuettes, bas-relief images, incised schematic drawings and even petroglyphs are all common vehicles of expression for this motif. Despite this veneer of eclecticism, there are certain conventions for rendering the human face that were shared amongst most Dorset craftsmen. These conventions appear to contrast sharply with those exhibited on the Icebreaker Beach maskette. The faces portrayed on most Late Paleoeskimo pieces clearly exhibit dis- tinctive Asiatic characteristics - almond-shaped eyes, high cheekbones etc. Few of the Dorset carvings, however, match the general facial morphology of the Icebreaker Beach maskette. Perhaps the most common "facial type" displayed on Dorset carvings is a roughly triangular shape with a rectangular upper face and a strongly pointed chin (cf. Maxwell 1985: 161, 163; Taylor 1971/72:37). Other faces, par- ticularly those found on multiple face carvings, are round in outline with accentuated cheekbones and underemphasized chins (cf. Rowley 1971/72 : 122). The face depicted on the artefact from QkHn-13, on the other hand, is clearly oval shaped. Only a very few isolated pieces of Late Paleoeskimo art portray the human face in this manner. Dorset artists usually carved the eyes and mouths of their subjects in deep relief. The shape of the eyes, the sockets and the brow ridges are always well defined, even in the most schematic renderings (cf. Maxwell 1985 : 161). Mouths on Late Paleoeskimo carvings are frequently open, sometimes forming an oval outline (cf. Taylor and Swinton 1967 : 16), occasionally shaped in a circular, "pouting", gesture (cf. Rowley 1971/72 : 120). In many instances teeth - either realistic or the more stylized "shaman teeth" - are visibly displayed. In contrast, 6 An adjusted radiocarbon date on wood carbon of 4,500 +/- 80 B.P. (Beta-20782) has recently been received for QkHn-13 Feature 14. This date is, in my opinion, unrealistically early. It is likely that the wood sample submitted contained pieces of charred driftwood which may have already been several centuries old before being collected and used for fuel. 196/JAMES W. HELMER</page><page sequence="19">the creator of the Icebreaker Beach maskette represented the eyes and mouth of his or her subject as narrow deep set lines. No teeth are discernible. Many Late Paleoeskimo facial representations bear incised lines that resem- ble tattoo marks (Maxwell 1985 : 160). Some exhibit the same pattern of radiating lines extending from the lower lip to the end of the chin found on the ivory carving from QkHn-13 (cf. Taylor and Swinton 1967 : 16; Rowley 1971/72 : 120; Maxwell 1985 : 163). Most, however, display a more complex iconography. A recurring motif in Dorset art is the skeletal "x-ray" design (Meldgaard 1960 : 15, Taylor and Swinton 1967 : 13; Taçon 1983b : 50-51). This motif employs schematic lines, chevrons and "X's" to symbolize the bones, joints and skeleton of the entity represented in the larger work. It is a common symbolic theme in the circumpolar world and is generally linked to beliefs in soul flight and physical transformation (Rasmussen 1929). On many Late Paleoeskimo carvings of human faces the x-ray motif is represented by an incised "X" mark running across the face (cf. Maxwell 1985 : 163). Occasionally, the wedge-shaped piece between the crossed lines was broken away giving the face a horned appearance (Maxwell 1985 : 160). On the magnificent Late Dorset face mask recovered from the Button Point Site on Bylot Island, the "X" mark açross the face is complemented by a schematized vertebral column incised onto the chin (cf. Artscanada 1971/72 : cover pho- tograph). No evidence of an x-ray design can be discerned on the carving from QkHn-13. Whether such a pattern existed on the now obscured reverse surface is a moot point. As a whole, the design elements depicted on the Icebreaker Beach maskette are less clearly symbolic (though not necessarily less symbolic) than those found on Late Paleoeskimo art pieces. Indeed, there is little in the pattern of incisions on this piece to equate with the shamanistic concepts implied by the Dorset skeletal motif. The apparent differences in symbolic content exhibited between the Early Paleoeskimo Icebreaker Beach maskette and much later examples of Dorset art underscore the last major contrast I perceive between these two periods of artistic expression. I have argued above that the image depicted on the carving from QkHn-13 is an extremely lifelike portrait of an elderly Asiatic; perhaps an elderly Asiatic woman. There is, in my opinion, little overt symbolism reflected in its execution. In contrast, few anthropomorphic Dorset pieces reflect the same degree of realism. In fact, many Late Paleoeskimo renditions of the human face are highly abstract with some pieces depicting only the barest essentials of the human form, and others portraying exaggerated features suggestive of physical deformity (Maxwell 1985 : 165). Shamanistic representa- tion clearly takes precedence over naturalism in much of the Dorset artistic tradition. The Icebreaker Beach maskette can be distinguished easily from analogous pieces of Late Paleoeskimo art. The basis for this distinction is, as argued above, both stylistic and symbolic. But, it would be unwise to over-emphasize the PRE-DORSET IVORY MASKETTE/ 197</page><page sequence="20">significance of these differences. The Early Pre-Dorset carving from QkHn-13 embodies many conceptual similarities to later Dorset pieces. Ivory maskettes of comparable size, for example, are found in all phases of the Late Paleoeskimo Stage. Virtually all of these exhibit Arctic Mongoloid physical characteristics and many bear evidence of facial tattooing. In addition, the absence of overt symbolism on the Icebreaker Beach maskette can easily be offset as a legitimate point of distinction. Students of Dorset art have demonstrated that the emphasis on shamanistic representation in Late Paleoeskimo art increased dramatically through time from the Early Dorset to Late Dorset Periods (Taylor and Swinton 1967; Lyons 1982; Taçon 1983a, 1983b). Indeed, it has been suggested that the florescence of Dorset art in general and the incorporation of shamanistic themes in par- ticular, was a response to steadily increasing social and/or environmental stresses during the Late and Terminal Dorset periods (Taçon 1983b : 59-60). The Ice- breaker Beach maskette can thus be regarded as but one extreme in an evo- lutionary cline of symbolic representation. Conclusions In this paper I have argued that the small ivory carving of a human face from the Icebreaker Beach Site is associated with one of the earliest known occupations of the Eastern Arctic dating between circa 3900 and 3600 B.P. I have also argued that differences in style and symbolic content clearly separate the Early Pre-Dorset carving from QkHn-13 from much later examples of Dorset art. Despite these differences, conceptual similarities do exist between the two periods of artistic expression. These similarities are sufficient, in my opinion, to indicate that the Icebreaker Beach maskette represents an early manifestation of an evolving Paleoeskimo artistic tradition that culminated in a period of florescence during the Late Dorset Period. The Early Pre-Dorset affiliation of the Icebreaker Beach maskette makes it the oldest known example of Paleoeskimo representational art and demonstrates that the roots of Dorset art lie in the earliest phases of the Early Paleoskimo Stage. At the same time, the inferred affiliation of the Icebreaker Beach maskette introduces a new set of cultural-historical problems relating to the origins of Paleoeskimo art. The obvious sophistication of the Icebreaker Beach maskette belies its inferred status as a "point of origin" for Dorset art. Logic suggests that ante- cedents for this art form must exist. Given the extrapolated age and affiliation of the Icebreaker Beach Site, these antecedents must lie outside of the Eastern Arctic - either in the Early Paleoeskimo Proto-Denbigh complex of northwestern Alaska, or perhaps beyond, in "Neolithic" (cf. Chard 1974 : 63) complexes from the Siberian shores of the Bering Strait or the interior valleys of North- east Asia. In the final analysis, I suspect that the key to resolving the problem of the origins of the Paleoeskimo artistic tradition, and to many other pressing 198/JAMES W. HELMER</page><page sequence="21">cultural-historical questions, lies in resolving the problem of the ultimate origins of the Arctic Small Tool tradition itself.
