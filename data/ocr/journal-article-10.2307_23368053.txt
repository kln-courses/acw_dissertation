MARTIN Jr. Northeast Missouri State University, Kirksville, Missouri ABSTRACT "Truisms have the disadvantage that by dulling the senses they obscure the truth. Almost nobody will become alarmed when told that in times of continuity the future equals the past. Only a few will become aware that from this follows that in times of socio-cultural change the future will not be like the past... At any moment we are free to act toward the future we desire. In other words, the future will be as we wish and perceive it to be. This may come as a shock only to those who let their thinking be governed by the principle that demands that only the rules observed in the past shall apply to the future. For those the concept of 'change' is inconceivable, for change is the process that obliterates the rules of the past" (Von Foerster, 1972). Objects Which Imply and Transmit Desires, Assumptions, Systems Every man-made thing implies, by its existence, desires. A desire implies the existence, real or potential, of a system in which it finds perfect fulfillment. Thus every man-made object, as it is a consequence of desire, points to the system in which that object has a perfect place, points to the desires that generated both the object and the system, and points to the assumptions which help to generate or to maintain both the object and the system. Assumptions, values, attitudes, and behaviors are acquired through interaction with man-made things, whether they be ideas or chairs; those that are transmitted through unexamined interaction with an object are those which support the system in which that object has a perfect place. Understanding man-made objects requires uncovering and examining the desires, assumptions, and systems which they imply and transmit. The desires, assumptions, and systems that an object implies are not restricted to the ones that originally generated the object. History proves the point. A plain wooden chair is constructed with affection by a colonial farmer who desires to sit in his log cabin. A century and a half later this chair becomes the possession of a man who is proud that he 299</page><page sequence="2">lives in a society in which his success is measured by his ability to buy a chair in order not to sit on it. The chair upon the death of the owner, who wished to immortalize himself, finds its way into a museum where its presence serves as documentation that we no longer live in a society in which a man, desiring to sit down, makes a chair. The chair implies the desire for a place to sit. The chair also implies desired modes of interaction. The form of the chair, the material out of which it is made, its placement, all serve to transmit an expected body tone and mental set (respectful, playful, serious, informal, etc.). The materials, form and construction of the chair also imply the status of its owner and/or the status of the individual expected to sit on it. The chair's history exemplifies all these things, especially the way in which function changes to support different situations and systems. As the chair moves from log cabin to mansion to museum, its function changes. Each time its function changes, it becomes a different object. To visit the museum, to see the chair, and to think: 'Aha! A man, evidently not a chair-maker, once made a chair in order to sit down,' is to miss the mark. This scene takes place in every museum (the chair being any object one chooses), concert hall, movie theatre, and room with a television. A chair is merely taken to be a chair. Transmission of Man-made Order Every part of the environment which man makes serves to transmit attitudes, values, and behaviors that enable that man-made environment to maintain itself. Already by the age of one the child has begun to learn the limits placed by others on his exploration of his own body and the objects around him. By two he has learned to imitate both the language and the gestures that betray basic assumptions about the world. By three he has acquired personal preferences revealing the stereotypes of his culture. By five the child has acquired mannerisms, values, assumptions, and language of the society, social class, peer group, and family of which he is a member. If not by five, by six he has begun to learn the strategies and behaviors which enable him to survive well or badly in and out of school. Regardless of facts learned and skills acquired, an underlying man made order is being transmitted by the man-made environment. This order is the secret content of every interaction in which an individual learns. The cat and mouse cartoon shown for entertainment, the history lesson on colonial America, the exercise in standing quietly in line: each teaches a part of the unexamined attitudes, values, and behaviors which maintain an underlying order. 300</page><page sequence="3">An underlying order may not always be desirable, but neither dissatis faction nor rebellion is a sufficient condition for eluding or changing that order. An additional, necessary (though not sufficient) protection against becoming part of an undesired order is to become aware of the extent to which that order has been incorporated into the structure of one's thoughts, language, actions, and rebellion. Those who rebel against a given order as children, students, slaves, servants, often become (if given the chance) the type of parents, teachers, slave-owners, and masters against whom they wished to rebel, even with the best of intentions. Thus rebellion, as it often incorporates the standard of order against which it rebels, seldom brings about change. The task of psychology, and in particular a psychology of education, is to uncover the order or organization which describes the conditions of learning and predicts the consequences of those conditions. It is not the task of psychology or of education to make judgments about the desira bility of a particular order. Where, however, psychology and education neglect to uncover existing order, they are neither scientific nor educa tional but rather serve to maintain that order. As the secret content of education is the unconscious transmission of attitudes, values and behaviors which maintain an underlying order, the chosen task of education should be conscious examination of this content. To do otherwise substitutes indoctrination, intentional and unintentional, for education. The more innocent (i.e., the more unintentional) the more criminal the indoctrination is. As attitudes, values, and behaviors are man-made (i.e., are artificial), they are objective consequences of the subjects who make, hold, and perform them. The very fact that attitudes are made, values held, and actions performed by subjects, leads to the conclusion that, as each individual, group, institution, or society has its own perspective, so each will have its own attitudes, values, and behaviors. When the content of education remains unexamined, it acquires the appearance of naturalness which is confused with Tightness. The appearance of naturalness severs the man made order from its artificial, subjective origin. This severance serves to maintain a particular set of attitudes, values and behaviors, and, by its service, creates conditions that can only result in violence. An established order strengthens its authority by nourishing the belief in a 'natural' order of things. Rules, procedures, conventions, and values of a society are consequences of man-made desires and decisions. Education demonstrates the non-inevitable, man-made character of rules, conventions, distinctions. 301</page><page sequence="4">Beyond Instruction Education is frequently identified with the transmission of technical skills, such as reading, teaching, bridge-building, or computer program ming. The process of transmitting these skills is usually referred to as instruction. By instruction men are able to pass on the systems they have created. But instruction is not education. To receive instruction is to be given orders or directions. When one wants to operate a machine, one refers to a set of instructions. When one wants to program a machine (such as a computer), one provides instruc tions. The anthropomorphic quality of the ubiquitous FORTRAN lan guage exposes an instruction for what it is in a hierarchical system: command. The basic FORTRAN instructions are verbs with the imper ative form: GO! and DO! A machine is an allo-referred system, i.e., it exists to serve. The relationship between man and machine is taken to be hierarchical: the machine is a means. It exists to go where it is told and to do what it is asked. When a man exists to serve, he becomes a means. Instruction, though it forms a part of education, cannot be educa tion. Instruction is made synonymous with education only in the society that attempts to make man the means by which it maintains its organi zation unchanged. In such a society, the purpose of the individual is the maintenance of the system. To the extent that a man exists to maintain a particular system, that system is, by definition, fascist. Such systems have their precedent in nature. The bee and the ant are living systems which exist to maintain a higher order system — the beehive and the ant colony. In the case of the bee and the ant, no other social organization is possible. In the case of man, a different order is possible. Individual actions within a society may serve to maintain that society without the individual's being subservient to it. Education does transmit social systems. John Dewey (1966), among others, recognized early in this century that '. . . . education . . . (is) the process by which social groups maintain their continuous existence.' But this does not imply (as Dewey recognized) that the goal of education is the perpetuation of social systems. Education is not mere transmission. Beyond Transmission Living systems are circular systems: "Living systems as they exist on earth today are characterized by exergonic metabolism, growth and inter nal molecular replication, all organized in a closed causal circular process 302</page><page sequence="5">that allows for evolutionary change in the way the circularity is main tained, but not for loss of the circularity itself' (Maturana, 1970). Because living systems are circular, they are inferential, i.e., they operate on the principle that what has happened before will happen again. Every case is, in this sense, a general case: ". . . . the circular organization implies the predication that an interaction that took place once will take place again . . . This makes living systems inferential systems. . ." (Maturana, 1970). Thus living systems are innately conservative. In the case of organisms with nervous systems, this conservatism is the basis of learning. The organism reduces the complexity of its environment and increases (sometimes) its chances for survival by generalizing from the past to the future. Ability to learn that food in a particular location is not wholesome prevents rats from being easily poisoned. Learning the location of a water hole has survival value for animals in a dry climate. Von Foerster (1972) observes that the scientific method rests on the false (though useful) assumption that "Rules observed in the past shall apply in the future." Thus the conservatism of the living system increases (sometimes) the probability of prolonged survival. This conservatism is the famous voice of experience which cautions against spitting into the wind, swimming against the current, biting the hand that feeds, and fighting city hall. Inference may prove mistaken. The future may not conform to past expectations. When a farmer pre-baits rats for three nights with whole some food, the rats learn to generalize that food from a particular location is wholesome. When poison is added on the fourth night, the mortality rate is extreme (Ashby, 1964). The predator (two or four-legged) waits at the waterhole for the inevitable appearance of its victims. Individuals and societies that insist that rules applied in the past shall apply in the future become incapable of dealing with a changing environment (Von Foerster, 1972). Man's heritage allows him to represent environmental features within his own cellular architecture and then to communicate these features through the use of symbols. This heritage is of two kinds: the communica tion of molecular structure which prescribes man's organization by means of genetic material, and, the communication of knowledge by means of language and art. Both reflect man's adaptation to constraints in the environment by incorporation of processes (in the one case, structural, in the other case, symbolic) which compute these constraints. All species transmit through genetic, and in some cases through social processes, constraints that allow each species to survive within a particular environ ment (Von Foerster, 1966). The heritage which each generation of each species transmits to the next generation is necessarily an affirmation of the structural features of the environment. This affirmation results, ulti 303</page><page sequence="6">mately, in the negation of the circularity of the species as a living process. Each species, in the process of specialization, creates for itself the niche that, when the environment changes, is destined to disappear. The niche is defined by the interactions into which a species can enter. The inter actions into which a species can enter are defined by its structural organization. Though the niche develops through the interaction of the species with an environment, the niche itself is not a description of the present (environment) but of the past as it has been incorporated in the structural organization of the species. A change in environment may result in change that has survival value for the individual but not the species. Faced with the disappearance of the grasslands, a now extinct species of horses developed more highly specialized teeth, the better to devour the vanishing grass. Those species fortunate enough not to have been so specialized could adapt to changing conditions. But in time they too develop the specialization which so incorporates the structural constraints of the past that they cannot change. Continued specialization hastens their own extinction. Indeed they know nothing of their impending destruction since the interactions into which they can enter constitute a representation of their past, not their present. In order to respond to the present, the past must be negated, without destroying the circularity of the living system. Man is subject to the same constraints as other species, but nature has left a loophole. Human cognition evolved not because it allows man to incorporate the past within his structural organization, but because it allows him to negate that past. Negation is not to be confused with destruction. Adaptation through specialization of parts is a mechanism which operates in species other than man. Long ago man stopped evolving the individual specialized parts which characterize all other species. Man's brain has eliminated the necessity of continued morphological specializa tion, i.e., incorporation of past history within the physiological structure of the part itself (Eisely, 1961). While man's organization is necessarily a representation of the constraints of the past (environments), the inter actions into which he can enter, as defined by his structural organization, are capable of enlargement. While every species defines its own niche, man is capable of doing so consciously because of the structure of human cognition. To Maintain Circularity Language, like man's biological heritage, incorporates within itself the structure of the interactions into which men have entered. In order to 304</page><page sequence="7">say something new, the existing language must, as it carries and transmits the past, be negated. The existing language orients men toward past interactions, not toward new interactions. Negation of the past constitutes an affirmation of the circularity of language itself. A dead language cannot be negated, it can only affirm its past. It becomes irrelevant to the developing ideas of men because it can carry only ideas which have already been implicitly incorporated into the language. The negation of the status quo is the necessary condition for dealing with the present, since the status quo is not a response to the world as it now is, but incorporates the order and structure of past success. The negation of the status quo constitutes an affirmation of the circularity of the living systems — biological, social, and linguistic — necessary for the survival of man as a species. The affirmation of the status quo constitutes a retreat into the past as a solution for dealing with the present. Man, because he is capable of recursively generating descriptions of his own behavior, is capable of self-observation and self-description (Maturana, 1970). He is capable of discovering that the future, contrary to expectation, will not be like the past, and of realizing that the conse quence of that mistaken assumption may be the extinction of individuals, groups, nations, societies, and even mankind. If men, individually and collectively, are to survive, a tool is needed to recognize and deal with the threats created by man's own systems. To maintain the circularity of men as living systems and the circularity of mankind as a collective, evolving entity, a tool is needed which provides whatever is necessary to create structures which allow individuals and the societies in which they live to become processes of permanent revolution against a past which can never be repeated. Nothing less, in the long run, will make survival possible. The goal of every living system is to maintain circularity when faced with a threatening, existing order. If, like other species which have come and gone before him, man meets threat by imposing the solutions of the past on the problems of present and future, he will meet their fate. Evolution provides for the circularity of life itself under the threat of changing conditions. It does not provide for the circularity of any individual species. Man cannot rely on nature to save him. He needs a tool which makes possible the permanent revolution against the past which can enable him to survive. Education is that tool by which man effects the goal he shares with every living system: to maintain circularity in the process of transcending an existing order which threatens him. 305</page><page sequence="8">References Ashby, W.
