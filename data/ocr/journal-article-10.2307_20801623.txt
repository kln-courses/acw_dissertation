K?l?prasanna Simha1 THE DREAM 11 the stories begin with a dream. Maharaja Krisnacandra, freed by a benefactor from the crip _T\pling nazar?na payment on which he had earlier defaulted, is released from the Nawab's prison.2 The annual fall navar?tra festival has already begun, and the raja is desperate to reach his West Ben gal kingdom of Nad?y? before it ends. He commandeers a swift country boat and orders the crew to set sail immediately, not stopping even for provisions. Although the king has avoided tortuous eigh teenth-century roads by choosing the river, there is little chance that he will reach his palace in time for the concluding rituals of navar?tra, the nine nights of the goddess. Weakened by hunger and thirst, Krisnacandra stands on deck, gazing south through the heavy monsoon clouds. Then he hears an unmistakable throbbing from a village on the bank. The sudden din of the drums means that navam?, the ninth day, has begun. Raja Krisnacandra is said to have fainted at that moment. As he lay unconscious on the deck he had a strange dream or vision. A young woman, her face red like the rising sun, appeared before him seated on a lion - a bow, arrow, discus, and conch shell held in her four hands. The lady smiled, reas suring the king that all was not lost. After instructing him to perform her worship in exactly one month's time, on the ninth day of the waxing moon of k?rtik (which usually falls in November), she disappeared. When the mystified king reached home he immediately consulted the pandits attached to his court. After much scholarly research they informed him that the personage of his dream was Jagaddh?tr?, "she who supports (or nurtures) the world. " He then summoned a potter who fashioned a clay goddess according to the royal vision, and on the prescribed day her worship was inaugurated at Krisnanagar, the capital of Nad?y?.3 K?l?prasanna Simha, Hutom Py?mc?r Naks?, Sam?j K?citra, Palllgr?mastha B?b?der Durgotsav, in Bengali, ed.

As the authors point out, r is not the same as d; ibid., 12,15. 3 Mention of an ivory Jagaddh?tr? formerly kept at the palace often comes up in this context, oral traditions having it that the raja directed an artisan to reproduce his dream image in the precious material. While the present royal fam 259</page><page sequence="2">A divine command received in a dream (Bengali svapnddes) is at once the commonest explanation given for religious innovations and the ultimate authority validating them.4 The dreamer chosen to convey a deity's urgent message is ever afterwards associated with the new ritual, his visionary encounter inevitably recounted in connection with it. And yet something in the transitory and unsta ble nature of dreaming itself permits each retelling to differ slightly. I have heard and recorded many variations on Maharaja Krisnacandra's dream, each conveying a subtly different version of the circum stances of his imprisonment and release, of his flight to Nad?y?, of the particular festival that he missed, of the events leading to his vision, and of the appearance of the dream goddess herself. What might account for these modifications to the basic "apparition on a boat" template for Jagaddh?tr?'s estab lishment, and what is meant by the template itself? I have chosen Jagaddh?tr? as the focus of this investigation, even though she is not a major god dess in Bengal (except, of course, to those who worship her), because she presents the interesting phe nomenon of the "new deity." Why, I wondered, did her p?j? become popular in certain regions and among particular groups of people (including social and political dissidents)? Beyond this historical puzzle, however, I wish to address some other intriguing aspects of image worship in Bengal: Why do the major Hindu rituals of Bengal (and by this I mean royal rites or those performed in imitation of them) feature temporary earthen icons worshipped outside of the temple context and discarded in a body of water after only a few days ? What precisely is the role played by time and ephemerality in these rites ? Why is it that these short-lived annual observances have so captivated Bengalis for the past several centuries, leading to p?j? excesses on the part of the wealthy and the intense longing of the poorer and middle classes to participate in the fleeting festivities ? One comes away from a Ben gali p?j? with the impression that something terribly important has just taken place, but what exactly has occurred ? And why is there an unmistakable collective sigh of relief once the images are immersed and life returns to normal? ily could not pinpoint the whereabouts of the small-scale carving, a comparable ivory Durg? in their possession (claimed to be a facsimile of their special Durg? named R?jar?jesvari) is merely the usual late eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century Qasimb?z?r or M?rsid?b?d piece, found in numerous collections. In any case, the story is unlikely since ivory and bone are impure materials, and objects made from them must be kept separate from the area where Hindu ceremonies are carried out. See G. C. Dutt, A Monograph on Ivory Carving in Bengal (Calcutta: Bengal Secre tariat Press, 1901), 2. Some versions of Krisnacandra's dream have the goddess holding five arrows rather than one. 4 See June McDaniel, Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls: Popular Goddess Worship in West Bengal (Oxford: Oxford Univer sity Press, 2004), 28-29. The dream directive is not unique to Bengal; in my experience, recovered ancient sculptures in central and western India are invariably said to have first appeared to the finder in a dream. The images receive pious donations for their re-establishment on the basis of the dream command to worship them. An example is the Gupta period pa?camukha Unga discovered in the Sivan? River at Mandasaur in 1940, now an important cult object (Pasu patin?tha) with its own temple and yearly fair. Another mechanism common in Bengal is the clay icon left on some body's doorstep, often with a note in its hand requesting a yearly p?j?. Here, the person secretly leaving the pratim? is merely the efficient cause for advancing a deity's wish. 5 I have based these remarks about Raja Krisnacandra's life primarily on R?j?blocan Mukhop?dhy?y, Mah?r?j Krisnacan dra R?yasya Caritram, in Bengali (1805; reprint, Calcutta: Ranjan Publishing House, 1948/49); and on David L. Cur ley's study of Krisnacandra's role as a Hindu king and patron of the arts in "Mah?r?j? Krsnacandra, Hinduism, and Kingship in the Contact Zone of Bengal," in Curley, Poetry and History: Bengali Mangal-k?bya and Social Change in Precolonial Bengal (New Delhi: Chronicle Books, 2008), 198-238.

Mohit Ray (Calcutta: Saibya Prak?san, 1986) and Anonymous, "The Territo 26</page><page sequence="3">MAHARAJA KRISNACANDRA OF NAD?Y?5 The name Krisnacandra evokes for many Bengalis an era of munificent patronage and royal ostenta tion. The turbulent eighteenth century saw his riverine kingdom grow and prosper under the first of the semi-independent Nawabs, Mursid Quii Khan (r. 1700-1727). Mursid Qul? and his successors were tasked with collecting enhanced revenue for the beleaguered Mughal empire, while they assid uously consolidated their own power base.6 Stricter enforcement of revenue collections meant that weak zam?nd?rs (landowners) defaulted, while their more fortunate counterparts were encouraged to take over the compromised properties. Hence, by the time Raja Krisnacandra ascended the throne, Nad?y? had swallowed up a number of these delinquent holdings and was well on its way to becom ing one of Bengal's premier kingdoms. The raja's prestige was augmented by his kultn Brahmin status, the number and quality of San skrit learning centres in his realm (Navadv?p most prominent among them), his legendary generos ity to Brahmins, his role as arbiter of caste disputes, and the splendour of his court, which boasted cel ebrated poets and scholars.7 Krisnacandra's long reign (1728-1782) encompassed the end of Nawabi rule and the mid-century triumph of the East India Company. His fate was to preside over the decline and eventual ruin of Nad?y?, brought about by the unsettled political climate of the 1740s, the griev ous famine of 1769-1770, and, most disastrously, the Company "farming system" that auctioned off zam?nd?r? lands to entrepreneurial tax collectors. A British administrator's journal entry from five years before the impoverished raja's death depicts him living like a beggar in a corner of his magnifi cent palace.8 The Nad?y? monarch was twice imprisoned for tax delinquency. An account of his first detention under Nawab 'Alivardi Kh?n (r. 1740-1756) is preserved in the Annad?mangal, Bh?ratcandra R?y's classic narrative poem in Bengali. Written a few years after this first incarceration, the poem recounts the royal prisoner's dream of the goddess Annap?rn?, or she who provides rice (the Bengali staff of life). Sitting near the slumbering raja's head, the divine lady comforts him, instructing him to per rial Aristocracy of Bengal, No. 2: The Nadiya Raj," The Calcutta Review 55 (1872): 85-118. 6 Mursid Quii Khan convinced the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to appoint him both divan (revenue collector) and nav?b n?zim (governor) in 1704. Before that date the offices were separate appointments; see Sushil Chaudhury, From Pros perity to Decline: Eighteenth Century Bengal (New Delhi: Manohar, 1995), 11. Helpful for understanding this complex period in Bengali history are John R. McLane, Land and Local Kingship in Eighteenth-Century Bengal (Cambridge: Cam bridge University Press, 1993); Shirin Akhtar, The Role of the Zamindars in Bengal ( iyoj-ijj2) (Dhaka: Asiatic Soci ety of Bangladesh, 1982); and Philip B. Calkins, "The Formation of a Regionally Oriented Ruling Group in Bengal, 1700-1740," The Journal of Asian Studies 29, 4 (August 1970): 799-806. 7 Kulin Brahmins were supposed to have been imported to Bengal from Kanauj by the possibly mythical ?dis?ra, Raja of Gaur; dates suggested for this event vary. Raja Krisnacandra was orthodox in his decisions about caste; see Shib Chunder Bose, The Hindoos As They Are: A Description of the Manners, Customs, and Inner Life of Hindoo Society (Cal cutta: Thacker, Spink and Company, 1883), 167,171. 8 Ranajit Guha outlines the farming system, implemented in the 1760s, and its devastating effects in A Rule of Property for Bengal: An Essay on the Idea of Permanent Settlement, Le Monde d'outre-mer pass? et present, series 1, vol. 19 (Paris: Mouton, 1963), 16-17; he also cites Philip Francis, who saw Krisnacandra just a year before his death; see ibid., 121, . 142. 6</page><page sequence="4">form her annual worship in the spring month of caitra. Soon after this benediction, Krisnacandra was released from his obligation to pay the special exaction {nazar?na) that the Nawab had imposed upon him.9 A careful reading of the verses surrounding the dream affords insight into the court poet's under standing of his troubled patron's mind. First of all, the date that Annap?rn? proposes for her ritual coincides with the traditional spring navar?tra. This vernal "nine nights" is the counterpart of the grander autumnal "nine nights" (and, according to tradition, is the older of the two great goddess festivals that approximate the spring and fall equinoxes).10 Moreover, the deity specifies the ritually crucial eighth of the fortnight, the same crit ical time period that the drums announced had passed in the first of our dream tales, making the unfor tunate Krisnacandra faint with despair. We note that the monarch is repeatedly referred to as the son of the goddess {devlputra) in Bh?ratcandra's poem. This epithet is reserved for kings who celebrate the autumn navar?tra in suitably glorious royal fashion. As I read it, the meaning of the Annad?mangal dream is clear: for some reason, whether because he has been in prison or because his priests have made an error, the autumn ritual has been mismanaged. As a result, the once divinely favoured king has fallen upon appalling misfortune. However, the goddess indulgently appears to her son in a different form {murati, implying a specific iconic image), and offers him a second chance at performing her puja properly, in the upcoming spring navar?tra. We may be fairly certain that the poet's tale of Annap?rn?'s jail cell appearance is the germ of the later oral narratives about a vision on a boat, since there is no historical evidence linking Krisnacan dra with the goddess Jagaddh?tri. While the Nad?y? raja instituted a number of deity p?j?s and revived certain Sanskritic rituals (notably the Vedic v?japeya rite, designed to boost a luckless zamtnd?rs rank to that of emperor), he surely had nothing to do with the novel Tantric divinity Jagaddh?tri.11 Rather, the evidence we shall consider points to Krisnacandra's great-grandson Gir?scandra as the person who popularised the new goddess. We have been tripped up by a familiar obstacle in our attempt to fit events into the chronological record: a prominent personality, like a kind of historical black hole, tends to engulf incidents occurring in the decades surrounding his lifespan. All Hindu milestones from this tumultuous period in Bengal get associated with Raja Krisnacandra's name. 9 Bh?ratcandra Ray, Bh?ratcandrer Annad?mangal, in Bengali, ed. Nirmalendu Mukhop?dhy?y, 3rd ed. (1978 ; reprint, Calcutta: Modern Book Agency, 1993), dream recounted on 15-16. Curley, "Mah?r?j? Krsnacandra," 214, places the composition of the poem in 1752. It is perhaps not irrelevant that the puniy? (revenue settlement ceremony) was held every year at the end of the month of caitra, when Bengal reaped its main harvest. The feast of Annap?rn?, bestower of food grains, would have fallen just before the zam?nd?rs had to travel to M?rsid?b?d to present themselves at the Nawab's court, paying their taxes and receiving the robe of honour. See McLane, Land and Local Kingship, 13 ; and Ishani Ghose, "Bengal as a Successor State in Eighteenth Century India: A Study of Its Polity, Economy, and Society in c. A.D. 1704-1740" (Ph.D. diss., University of Kaly?ni, West Bengal, 2005), 230. 10 Narendra Nath Bhattacharyya suggests that the worship of Annap?rn? in caitra is a modern form of vasantt durgot sava (the spring goddess festival); see History of the ??kta Religion (New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1974), 135. h For Krisnacandra's v?japeya ritual, see Mukhop?dhy?y, Caritram, 19-21 ; and Curley, " Mah?r?j? Krsnacandra, " 214-17. The rite, which is derived from the ?atapatha Br?hmana, is described in Padurang Vaman Kane, History ofDharma s?stra, vol. 2, pt. 2 (Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1941), 1206-14. 262</page><page sequence="5">THE ROYAL JAGADDH?TR? A new god or goddess may be an amalgam of existing cult divinities, or simply a concept looking for visual form. Sometimes it is even an icon in search of an idea to explain itself. In the etiology of Jagad dh?tr? we find all of these possibilities at play. Her iconographie particularities varied in the different communities that took up her worship, and her traits remain fluid to this day. Among the assortment of divinities who have taken on the title of "world-nurturer," let us look first at the royal Jagaddh?tr? as she appeared in 1959 in the great hall used for the yearly cycle of religious ceremonies at the palace in Krisnanagar (fig. 1). In this rare photograph of an icon that, like most Bengali festival images, existed for but a few days before it was ritually immolated, we see a young female with the heart-shaped face that Bengalis claim is modelled on the leaf of the pan vine (Piper betel). Four-armed, dressed in what appear to be breeches and a blouse, she sits in lalit?sana (with one leg dangling) upon a peculiar crea ture that displays a mixture of equine, leonine, and human features. The goddess holds a discus and conch shell in her upper right and left hands, while the lower right hand grasps an arrow (hidden by her mount's head), and the lower left a bow. Details not visible in the old photograph can more easily be perceived in a picture of the image made in 2005 for the same royal festival (fig. 2). Here P?rnim?, daughter of the palace sculptor S?dhan P?i (b. 1932), completes the goddess's headdress. Once the clay sculpture with its rice straw core has been dried in the sun and painted, a large lump of wet clay is placed on its head and covered with tin foil (r?ngta). Into this mass are thrust a number of coloured sticks with what look like pennants on their ends.12 The profusion of jute hair is a recent innovation, adopted from the stylish, cinema-inspired Calcutta pujas. Formerly, nearly all Bengali female deities had tight plaits formed of clay. We may also note in passing the evolution of the facial type from the sharp triangle with enormous, upward-slant ing eyes of figure 1 - a style referred to by the potters who make images as ?di or kh?s b?ngl? (original or quintessential Bengali) - to the softer, more modelled visage that they designate do-bh?st b?ngl? ("two-language Bengali"), which melds the original type with the modern, plump, and more natural istic face seen in Calcutta and Candannagar. Despite these innovations, the countenance retains archaic aspects that recall late mediaeval paintings from eastern India, especially notable in profile (fig. 3).13 12 The pennant-like decorations, as well as other shiny decorative bits now made of tinfoil, used to be fashioned from mica sheets (abhra). One still sees mica decorations at some traditional p?j?s. 13 B.K. Paul (b. 1939), grandson of a celebrated clay artist from Krisnanagar who settled in Calcutta, interpreted do-bh?s? using the English expression "some old, some new"; conversation in Calcutta, November 2006. Alternatively, the phrase may signify "two styles flowing into each other" (bh?s? meaning to float or overflow). Terms used for the tightly plaited tresses that Bengali devis used to sport are bin?ni (a braid or pigtail) and gh?~rben?(a. shoulder-length braid); see, among other examples, Victoria and Albert Museum ivories of Durg? (02466) and Jagaddh?tri (02468:1). K?l? was an exception, with her loose, tangled locks. Some expressive phrases potters and others use to describe beautiful eyes are: tana cokh (stretched or long tyt),patal cera cokh (eye like a parwal, or wax gourd, cut in half lengthwise), and bans p?t? cokh (eye like the bamboo leaf)- The artisans add that the goddess's nose should be long and straight like a bamboo flute. The flattened forehead, long eyes, prominent nose, and pointed chin seen in figure 3 echo female faces depicted in three-quarter view in eleventh- and twelfth-century Pala manuscript painting ; compare, for example, cat alogue numbers 58b and 59 in Susan L. Huntington and John C. Huntington, Leaves from the Bodhi Tree: The Art of Pala India (8th-12th Centuries) and Its International Legacy (Seattle and London: The Dayton Art Institute in associa tion with the University of Washington Press, 1990). 263</page><page sequence="6">Several unusual traits distinguish this deity icon. Most striking is the confrontational stance, which has both Jagaddh?tri and her mount facing the viewer; in all other Krisnanagar images (with a single exception, which we shall note presently) the v?hana flanks the viewer, so that the goddess sits sidesad dle upon it. The other peculiarity of the figure is its clothing and decoration, including the headdress mentioned above. Asim?nanda R?y, senior member of a collateral branch of the royal family, refers to her costume o&amp;joddh? bes (warlike attire).14 Others, including S?dhan Pai, who models the image, dis agree, claiming that she wears the garb of a gypsy woman, or bedenl. Specifically, she is said to share with the females of the bediy? tribe the coloured sticks and feathers that they thrust into their coiffures. Now, identifying the royal Jagaddh?tri with a gypsy woman places her squarely in the camp of wise old ances tresses (a sub-group of Jagaddh?tri cult divinities), since the beden?axe known as folk healers, travelling about fluvial Bengal on boats and dispensing herbal remedies. We shall take up the question of the ances tress figure presently, but for the moment let us stay with the perceptions of the pujas royal patrons. For the three branches of the Brahmin family that used to rule Nad?y?, of which two still perform Jagaddh?tr?'s rite, the goddess is in no way a tribal or gypsy woman. Instead, she appears as a young princess (perhaps sixteen years old) who rides to the defense of her patrons. While Raja Krisnacan dra's boating dream may have been fictitious, the link between a missed or spoiledp?j? and its super natural replacement in the form of another martial deity was genuine. Throughout the precarious eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the landholding families of Bengal had unequivocal faith in the proper performance of ritual worship. The unfortunate scholarly assumption that Bengali navar?tra was purely a matter of prestige (a " theater of power, " in Bernard Cohn's words) rather than of genuine religious sentiment may be traced to British editorialising in Calcutta periodicals. The English-lan guage press began to disparage thep?j?s after about 1820, with the festivities described as disgusting, indecent, and abominable.15 Apparently, British observers found it increasingly difficult to recognise the goddess's festival, or durgotsava, as a religious observance. Perhaps they had heard rumours about esoteric Tantric practices, or it may be that erotic elements of the dance and music performances seemed impossible to reconcile with a religious event. Most foreign observers of the period concluded that the Bengalis were insincere, and that the entire spectacle was being staged to impress their peers and the Company elite. This judgement, which fed indigenous movements like the Br?hmo Sam?j, was internalised by many Bengali intellectuals and persists to this day.16 Nor can we rule out the pos sibility that the gentry who performed p?j? on a grand scale were content that the British misunder stood their intentions for doing so. 14 He belongs to the kart? b?ri, descended from Jogesvar? Devi, elder sister of Raja Krisnacandra. Our conversations took place on a number of occasions from 2005 to 2007. 15 See, for example, the Rev. William Ward's early, scandalised report on bawdy poetry contests at the Sobh? B?z?r Durg? p?j? in Calcutta in 1806, quoted in Bose, The Hindoos As They Are, 117-19; and the "Asiatic Intelligence" columns in AsiaticJournal 16 ( 1823 ) : 90-91 ; and AsiaticJournal n.s., 13 ( 1834) : 252. Cohn's evaluation of pre-modern ritual is found in Colonialism and Its Forms of Knowledge: The British in India (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1996), 3. Burkhard Schnepel has commented on a peculiar blindness to religious intentions that runs through the writing of scholars like Bernard Cohn, Hermann Kulke, and Burton Stein, "None of [whom] really regards ritual acts and beliefs as genuine forces and ultimate goals that directly motivate and guide the life of rulers and subjects alike"; Schnepel, "Durga and the King: Ethnohistorical Aspects of Politico-Ritual Life in a South Orissan Jungle Kingdom," The Jour nal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 1,1 (March 1995): 159. 264</page><page sequence="7">THE RATIONALE FOR NAVAR?TRA Despite the plethora of nineteenth-century p?j? apologists who, fearing that dependence upon ritu als made Hindus appear benighted, tried to disguise them as mere spectacle, it seems that few priests or their patrons questioned the main purpose of the durgotsava. The annual ceremony was dubbed " the asvamedha of the kali yuga" a label that suggested both its importance for kings (without excluding other wealthy patrons) and the superior efficacy of rites designed to fit the present degenerate age. The ancient horse sacrifice had ensured a Vedic king's military power and his mandate to rule. The tenor of the autumnal nine nights of the goddess was somewhat different, steeped as it was in Tantric ideas about raising and mastering spiritual energies. Designed by ritual specialists, perhaps as early as the twelfth century, the festival was intended to imbue the mediaeval king with the power (sakti) to defeat his enemies.17 The political uncertainty and social unrest that gripped eastern India in early modern times appears to have led landowners to desperate measures. I suspect that the revival and revitalisation of Tantrism in the 1700s was a direct result of the impotence of the Hindu monarchs. One need not pin responsi bility on a particular set of dynastic overlords for the condition to which the zam?nd?rs were reduced. The history of the Nad?y? royal lineage reads like a litany of imprisonments, first at Dhaka, then M?rsid?b?d. The British, with their extractive policies, only completed the evisceration of the king dom. We may recall the cary? song about the stag whose succulent flesh made him his own worst enemy; similarly, Bengal's wealth and geographical accessibility meant that it was perennially the object of unwelcome outside attention.18 If the eighth and ninth of the waxing fortnight of nearly every month of the Hindu calendar are associated with goddesses, then either the tenth or thep?rnim?(full moon) are the times when demons usually meet their destruction. While the proximity of the two sets of dates may originally have been coincidental, in s?kta Bengal they are thematically and causally linked. The connection between Durg?'s victory over the buffalo demon on the ninth tit hi (lunar day) of ?svin and Rama's defeat of the demon R?vana on the tenth is not made everywhere in India, since the events may be celebrated sep arately by S?ktas and Vaisnavas. However, most eastern Indian texts couple the two incidents, mak ing Rama a goddess devotee who is unable to defeat R?vana without her assistance.19 16 Devendran?th h?kur followed the Br?hmo line in refusing to attend the durgotsava. He disapproved, he said, of" idol atry in all its pomp and circumstance. " Glyn Richards, A Source-book of Modern Hinduism (Richmond, U.K. : Curzon, 1996), 31-33. Modern scholars frequently parrot the assumption that p?j? was essentially a chance for landowners to "show off their wealth and assert their prestige, " as Rachell Fell McDermott opines in "Unanswered Questions on the Relationship between Politics, Economics, and Religion: The Case of Durga Puja in Late Eighteenth-Century Ben gal," paper presented at the Bengal Studies Conference, University of Chicago, 29-30 April 1995. 17 Trying to tease out a terminus a quo for the formulation of rituals resembling the grand durgotsava of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is tricky. While we find the complete rite described in pur?nas dated to the tenth century, we must bear in mind the vexing issue of later interpolations. 18 The cary agiti, vernacular Tantric Buddhist poetry in either Old Bengali or Old Maithili, may date to the eleventh cen tury. Per Kvaerne, An Anthology of Buddhist Tantric Songs: A Study of the Cary?gtti (Oslo: Uni versi tetsforlaget, 1977); the song about the deer appears on 96-98. 265</page><page sequence="8">Several of the upapur?nas (so-called "minorpur?nas") detail the autumnal durgotsava as practised in eastern India. Indeed, each of the three p?j? handbooks used by priests throughout the region is based upon one of these texts.20 Careful study of the upapur?nic chapters treating the Lanka war leads the reader to a surprising conclusion: rather than telling a story that then gets acted out in ritual, the ritual itself appears to have generated the version of the epic being narrated.21 As we shall discover, the complex and exacting structure of the devis rite is the key to understanding the sudden appearances of gods and demons upon the mythological scene - and the equally abrupt divine departures once an enemy has been dispatched. Furthermore, these variants of the R?m?yanas Book of War are driven by liturgical time and its junctures. Only the most punctilious king, assisted by an erudite and painstak ing royal priest, succeeds on the p?j? battlefield. He emerges victorious over those who make even a single ritual error. THE UNTIMELY AWAKENING When the discussion turns to the durgotsava in contemporary Bengal, one invariably hears mention of the ak?l bodhan, or untimely awakening. Everybody seems to know that R?ma had to rouse the god dess from her rest during the c?turm?sya, or four-month period during which the gods sleep every year (a year being equal to a single day for Hindu deities). Brahma, as Rama's priest, awakened Durg? dur ing this night of the gods because the epic hero desperately needed her help to defeat the demons of Lank?. In the popular understanding, the untimely awakening takes place under a bilva (wood-apple) tree on the sixth of the bright half o??svin month, in imitation of the precise calendrical moment when R?ma long ago roused the goddess. Indeed, modern priests serving communities or families generally perform the awakening ritual on the sixth waxing day. I first realised that the common perception about waking the goddess was flawed when discussing the topic with As?m Bhatt?c?rya, the priest who performs the rituals for the ruling branch of the Krisnanagar royal family (the r?j b?ri). I had asked him why Durg?'s festival is referred to as the "nine nights" when kingly and aristocratic pujas invariably used to run for fifteen or eighteen days, begin 19 See, for example, chapters 36-48 of the Mah?bh?gavata Pur?na (originating in the part of eastern Bengal that borders K?mar?pa and dated to the tenth or eleventh century): ?r?mah?bh?gavatam, in Sanskrit with Bengali translation, ed. Panc?nan Tarkaratna (Calcutta: Nababh?rat, 1995), 151-98; chapter 60 of the tenth- to early eleventh-century K?lik? Pur?na (from K?mar?pa, or the portion of Bengal closest to it), ed. and trans. B.N.

Besides the numer ous eastern Indian upapur?nas that make the victory of R?ma dependent upon Durg?'s benediction (and the list above is not exhaustive), the linkage is a feature of several R?m?yanas from eastern India, as W. L. Smith points out in R?m?yana Traditions in Eastern India: Assam, Bengal, Orissa (Stockholm: University of Stockholm, 1988), 130-36. 20 The three ritual handbooks (p?j?paddhati) used in eastern India for durgotsava are derived from three upapur?nas : the K?lik? Pur?na, the Devi Pur?na, and the Brihannandikesvara Pur?na', see Shastri, K?lik? Pur?na, vol. 1, 37, n. 1. The first two texts are extant but the third is known only from references in the nibandha and paddhati literature. Hazra, Studies, 582. A few old p?j?s use variant texts; the S?barna R?y Caudhar?s of Calcutta claim that their ritual is based upon the Durg? hakt i Tara?gint, and the Mukherji bari of S?ntipur employs a secret Tant rie manuscript. 21 In a similar vein, Alf Hiltebeitel argues for a "ritual exegesis" of epic in The Ritual of Battle: Krishna in the Mah? bh?rata (Ithaca, N.Y. : Cornell University Press, 1976), 358-60. 266</page><page sequence="9">ning on either the ninth or the sixth day of the preceding dark fortnight. Mr. Bhatt?c?rya (b. circa 1936), whose father took over the duties ofpurohit from relatives, made an offhand remark that kings began their rites in the waning fortnight because it was ak?l, or untimely.22 In other words, the expres sion ak?l refers not just to the "wrong " time of the year, but more pertinently to the inauspicious dark fortnight. Of Bengali deities, only the dangerous K?l? is worshipped in the dark half of the month. It is, however, the proper interval for abbicava (inimical action, or black magic).23 The Mah?bh?gavata and Brihaddharma Pur?nas stress that initiating the ritual on the dark fort night was critical for Rama's success. In the earlier text, Siva tells R?ma that he must begin his wor ship in the waning fortnight in order to foil R?vana (who, in the s?kta scriptures, is usually a goddess devotee), since it will not occur to the demon to initiate his own Durg? p?j? until the waxing fortnight begins. The somewhat later Brihaddharma Pur?na has the ^/instruct R?ma to begin worshipping on the ninth of the dark half of the month so that she may destroy the demon Kumbhakarna on that very day; she then enumerates precisely which of R?ma's enemies will fall on each of the fifteen days of the p?j?.1* Clearly, these and other s?kta texts furnished rulers with a blueprint for crushing their adver saries in the mode of the avenging R?macandra, prototype for all just yet beleaguered monarchs. In prescribing the main goddess rite of eastern India, the s?kta scriptures are true to the root mean ings of the Sanskrit nounparvana, also the common name for a religious holiday in Bengali. The word can signify a joint (as of the body), the days of the four primary phases of the moon (new, the first and third quarters, and full), the moment when the sun enters a new zodiac sign, and the equinox or solstice. In other words, parvana (and a related termparvak?la) refers to the hinges of time, construed as full of dangerous potentiality.25 S?kta documents of the mediaeval period set up R?ma as the paradigmatic 22 Since in the amanta calendrical system followed in Bengal the lunar months commence with the waxing fortnight (on the day after the am?vasy?, or new moon), the royal pujas used to begin not in ?svin but in the preceding month of bhadrapad. The fifteen-day span for durgotsava is termed navamyddi kalpa because it begins on the ninth of the dark fortnight; the eighteen-day period, starting on the sixth, is called sasth?di kalpa. As?m Bhatt?c?rya's father,pandit Manoranjan Smriti T?rtha, took over from his elder sister's in-laws when no competent person in their family was found to fill the hereditary post of Nad?y? royal priest. According to Mr. Bhatt?c?rya, it was an ancestor of his in-laws' family, Laksm?k?nt Bhatt?c?rya, who served as Raja Krisnacandra's purohit. I spoke with As?m Bhatt?c?rya, who comes to Krisnanagar from Navadv?p every year for this ritual work, in September 2006. On Durg?'s rite beginning in the waning fortnight, see also Padurang Vaman Kane, History ofDharmas?stra, vol. 5, pt. 1 (Poona: Bhandarkar Ori ental Research Institute, 1974), 158-59. 23 It must be noted, however, that the imported deity Krisna's birthday falls in the dark fortnight of bhadrapad. On abhic?ra, see Teun Goudriaan, Maya Divine and Human (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1978). 24 ?r?mah?bh?gavatam, 42:14-25. The Brihaddharma Pur?na states that, after Kumbhakarna's fall on the dark ninth, R?ma will proceed to battle on the dark fourteenth, Laksmana will kill Meghan?da on the am?vasy?, Makara will die on the first day of the bright fortnight, the goddess herself will enter into R?ma's bow on the seventh, R?vana's heads will fall on the sandhi (juncture between the eighth and ninth days), R?vana will fall on the ninth, and R?ma will emerge victorious on the tenth. It will be noted that the s?kta texts frequently fudge the time of R?vana's death, mak ing it occur on the bright ninth (a goddess day) rather than the usual tenth; ?r?brihaddharmapur?na, 22:20-25,41-51. The K?lik? Pur?na further indicates dates in the dark fortnight when certain terrifying forms of the goddess may be summoned (60:12-18). 25 The other word for festival, utsava, has none of these implications. See Monier Monier-Williams, Sanskrit-English Dic tionary (New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1976). John Abbott, an early twentieth-century Indian Civil Servant, 267</page><page sequence="10">Hindu sovereign and provide a game plan for defeating his enemies that is based upon the power of time and its joinings. As William Sax points out in the context of a different yearly festival, "time has been disrupted by R?vana and his demon hosts : the order of the world has been upset, resulting in such dis junctures as an exiled ruler and a kingless land.. .."26 Only through a radical reordering of time in the annual ritual can things be set right again, both for R?ma and for his simulacrum, the Bengali king. THE CLAY IMAGE The prototype of the Bengali clay image is the icon that the protagonists of the fifth- or sixth-century Devi M?h?tmya fashioned upon a sandy beach. They worshipped this earthen (mah?maya) goddess for three years, after which the king prevailed over his enemies while the merchant chose to renounce the world rather than exact revenge upon his wicked kinsmen. That the likeness of the devi was established on the bank of the river is telling, for it was intended to be washed away after it had served its pur pose; ephemeral objects of this type are termed ksanika or t?tk?lika (suitable for a short span of time). A comparable representation of Durg? was made of sand and honoured as part of a vow by the cowherdesses of Braj, and even in modern times short-lived ?ingas are modelled of Ganges clay every day by devotees of Siva.27 Small-scale objects of worship made by the practitioner himself to fulfill a vow are at the root of eastern India's clay-icon extravaganzas. Fashioned for a particular objective, the logic of their existence means that they must be destroyed after use. The mediaeval texts are replete with allusions to terra cruda deity likenesses.281 believe that a strong impetus for using such icons of unbaked clay is to inflict harm upon one's foes through the occult practice of abhic?ra. In the context of images designed to injure others, let us compare the royal or r?j bari Jagaddh?tr?s of figures through 3 with the deity figure made for a collateral branch of the Nad?y? family known as r?y b?ri (fig. 4). The artisan seen in figure 4 is Somn?th Pal, whose grandfather Am?lya Bh?san P?l noted the importance of time and its joinings in The Keys of Power: A Study of Indian Ritual and Belief (1932; reprint, Secaucus, N.J.: University Books, 1974), 251-54. 26 William Sax, "The Ramnagar Ramlila: Text, Performance, Pilgrimage," History of Religions 30, 2 (November 1990): 142. 27 ?r?durg?saptasat?, in Sanskrit (Gorakhpur: Gita Press, 1990), 13:io. The distinction that K. M. Varma makes between ksanika and t?tk?lika icons seems contrived; see The Indian Technique of Clay M?&lt;^///?g(Santiniketan: Proddu, 1970), 217, n. 8. Thesis' sand goddess is described in the Brahmavaivarta Pur?na, 4:27:1-12 and 4:27:122-32; see Brahma vaivartam, ed. Acharya Ramesh Chaturvedi, trans. Shanti Lai Nagar (Delhi : Parimal Publication, 2001), vol. 2,232-33, 241. Sanskrit texts usually identify earthen images as p?rthiva or mrinmay?. 28 Some of the eastern Indian upapur?nas (such as the Mah?bh?gavata Pur?na, 43:88 and 44:35-36) specify the use of an earthen image for navar?tra, while the wording of others strongly suggests it. For example, when the Brihaddharma Pur?na states that a supplicant should perform the devis worship for thirteen days on the root of the wood-apple tree before bringing the deity to his residence on the seventh of the waxing fortnight of ?svin, the implication is that the divine presence is being transferred from tree to image. ?r?brihaddharmapur?nam, 11:16-17. The K?lik? Pur?na also indicates that the goddess takes a form (murti) on the seventh day of the month's bright half; Shastri, K?lik? Pur?na, 60:79. On the other hand, frequent textual references to visar jan (dismissal and/or immersion) might allude to a clay pot embodying the deity rather than to an icon. J.D. Robinson surveys texts specifying clay icons in "The Worship of Clay Images in Bengal" (Ph. D. diss., Oxford University, 1983), 31-53. Gaurinath Sastri lists references specific to Bengal, but does not include sufficient bibliographic information to replicate his findings; see "The Worship of the Clay Image of Durg?," in J. N. Banerjea Volume (Calcutta: University of Calcutta, i960), 266-70. 268</page><page sequence="11">may have fashioned the 1959 icon and whose father and aunt also probably worked at the palace on royal images.29 Somn?th, in his late thirties, has been around the making of these clay sculptures since childhood. While he is certainly recognised as a gifted and meticulous artist, part of the difference in workmanship between the two goddess likenesses (figs. 2 and 4) is a direct result of the reimburse ment each potter receives. S?dhan and his family, long discontent with their payment for the king's Jagaddh?tri, dash the figure off somewhat carelessly. Nevertheless, several of the palace deity's intrigu ing iconographie traits have been retained, including the head-on pose of the goddess and the odd, crouching stance of the creature upon which she rides. This peculiar, snub-nosed beast with a truly terrifying snarl seems poised to pounce not on some offending demon but upon the viewer. In con trast, the r?y b?ri icon of figure 4 approximates the usual simhav?hin?, or lion-riding goddess, who perches sidesaddle upon her tamer mount. (I have chosen photographs of incomplete sculptures since the finished works tend to be loaded down with decorations that obscure their form.) The royal image was surely designed with powerful purpose. Only one other Krisnanagar Jagad dh?tri confronts the viewer. The recent conception of a Tantric adept, this copycat icon is the subject of whispered conjecture by townsfolk wondering whether the present representative of the Nad?y? rul ing family (who lives in Calcutta and rarely visits Krisnanagar) knows about her existence.30 The implication is that the patron of the fierce and predatory palace goddess would brook no rival. Nad?y? residents understand that her forceful presence, annually renewed since the early nineteenth century, is intended to deflect foes and that her worship is a regal prerogative. THE LION The lion of eastern Indian art is, generally speaking, a slim and horsey beast (fig. 5). It little resembles the actual Asian lion, which is not native to these parts. However, the devis fantastic mount as it appears in the ephemeral festival arrays belongs to a different category of being than the usual v?hana. While many households that began their festival observances under British hegemony adopted the English lion as seen in the royal coat of arms, p?j?s originating in the eighteenth century or before highlight an archaic composite creature for which various explanations are proffered: it's ?ghor?-simha 29 S?dhan Pai (the elderly potter who fashions the palace icon seen in figures 2, 3, 6, and 20) and Somn?th Pal disagree vehemently over the identity of the former chief royal image maker. S?dhan claims that he alone modelled the 1959 Jagaddh?tr? (fig. 1). Besides Somn?th's relatives, the names of other potters are also in the mix; they include S?dhan's fellow apprentice Kar?li Bisv?s of Baharampur and their teacher Baidyan?th P?l. The oldest informant with whom I spoke, Kamal? B?l? M?l?kar, volunteered the names of the last two artisans as those she remembered from childhood visits to the palace in the early twentieth century. Mohit R?y records valuable information on hereditary p?j? service providers at the Nad?y? court, including artisans, in his R?pe R?pe Durg?, in Bengali (Calcutta: Am?r Bh?rat?, 1985), 1-7. 30 Tur?yat?t?nand N?th Sarasvat? Avadh?t claims to have commissioned this copy of the king's Jagaddh?tr? from the royal image-maker S?dhan P?l after she appeared to him in a dream. The image, which looks just like the royal icon except for its more traditional reddish complexion, is perhaps 15 centimetres taller. I find it difficult to read this appro priation as other than a spiritual power grab, especially since the Tantric avadh?t cites his ksatriya (warrior) lineage in justifying use of the icon, admits that he earlier performed its worship in secret, and dances before it with gestures that challenge the deity and her v?hana. 269</page><page sequence="12">(horse-lion), some say, gentler than a lion and hence preferred by Vaisnavas; others suggest that the animal is a d?b?-simha, a suppressing or overpowering lion, or simply call it deb-sirnha, the lion-god. Despite the prevailing confusion among p?j? patrons and observers, a number of informants are well aware of the creature's identity. The perceptions of these knowledgeable few are backed up by texts such as the K?lik? Pur?na, which explicitly identifies the goddess's mount as Visnu's avat?r Nrisimha (the ruthless man-lion). The scripture further asserts that the buffalo demon seen in navar? tra arrays (where the goddess is shown slaying him) is none other than Siva. Indeed, in one verse where myth surely follows iconic depiction, the K?lik? Pur?na has Siva inform the goddess that he has taken a buffalo body to support her since her lion Visnu can no longer hold her upon his back without assis tance.31 The Nad?y? palace potter S?dhan Pal affirms that all goddesses he produces ride upon Nrisimha. After explaining that the heteromorphic creature originated in K?m?khy? K?mar?p (the region in Assam where the K?lik? Pur?na was composed), S?dhan spelled out the differences between the man lion and his ordinary jungle cousin. His eyes are stretched (t?n?) like a deity's rather than round in the manner of felines; he has a man's moustache, eyebrows, and curly black hair; he possesses a muz zle like that of a horse; and, finally, each of his four limbs terminates in a human hand (fig. 6).32 Before considering what all this may mean, let us glance at another Jagaddh?tri who is intimately connected with Nad?y?'s royal family. Figure 7 captures the moment ofsandhi (juncture) between the eighth and ninth days of the goddess's festival - except that, when we come to Jagaddh?tri, three crucial days of the ceremony are accomplished between a single sunrise and sunset. This difficult feat of ritual tim ing is being carried out at a household p?j? in the small town of R?n?gh?t, about six and a half miles from Krisnanagar. It seems likely that our wrathful palace goddess first took iconic form with the ances tors of this family.33 RAJA GIR?SCANDRA AND HIS GURU We have seen that, despite the ruler's charisma and the narrative appeal of his supposed dream, Krisnacandra was quite unlikely to have instituted Jagaddh?tri's worship. Nad?y? historian Mohit R?y reluctantly concedes that Krisnanagar's premier festival must have begun under the great-grandson of the celebrated eighteenth-century king, at a time when the realm was at its nadir. Without a clear understanding of a Hindu monarch's conflicting responsibilities or of the expectations his subjects held of him, the British complained that Giriscandra, who acceded to the throne when he was only sixteen, ruined his illustrious ancestor's kingdom through reckless extravagance. In point of fact, he had inherited little but the devatra lands (property set aside to defray the cost of worshipping a deity). 31 K?lik? Pur?na, 67:66-6%, 60:137-61, 60:151-52. The buffalo-slaying icon is called K?ty?yan?, not Durg?, in Krisn? nanda ?gamav?g?sa's sixteenth-century Tantras?ra, a document of Nad?y?; see Pratapaditya Pal, Hindu Religion and Iconology According to the Tantras?ra (Los Angeles: Vichitra Press, 1981), 45-46. 32 Conversations in Krisnanagar, November 2005 and November 2007. 33 Not all Jagaddh?tr? p?j?s include sandhi, since the ritual is difficult to manage within the greatly compressed time frame. Indeed, some years the lunar days (tithi) fall in such a way that Jagaddh?tr?'s worship cannot be performed properly. The advice of thep?njik? (almanac) is, roughly, "Do the best you can. " 270</page><page sequence="13">Whatever other personal holdings came down to him were auctioned off before the end of his pro tracted reign (1802-1841). We know of Gir?scandra that he patronised Sanskrit learning and estab lished a Kali temple in Krisnanagar. Mohit Ray supplies us with further information about the ruler's religious leanings: a renowned Tantric scholar named Candrac?ra Tarkac?ramani became Gir?scand ra's r?jguru, or royal preceptor, and through his pupil popularised image worship of the goddess Jagad dh?tr?. The descendants of the royal guru still follow the worship method he devised; we see a branch of the family doing so in figure 7.34 In a 1986 article, Sanjukta Gupta and Richard Gombrich address Tantric concepts of power and statecraft prevalent in Indian kingship since the twelfth century. They point out that the authority claimed by the Vedic dyad of monarch and purohit (royal priest) gave way in the mediaeval period, when the Tantric r?jguru gained precedence. Vaunting the favour of an energetic female deity and mas tery over the six magical acts ( sat karma ), the r?jguru made seductive promises to militarily weak rulers. Belief in rites ofabhic?ra (action against one's enemy) and santi (pacification of negative forces) peaked at many subcontinental locations in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.35 Hence, Can drac?ra's advent upon the Nad?y? stage should not surprise us. According to senior members of the Ghatak family (ghatak is a title indicating their former occupation as matchmakers and keepers of fam ily records), the relationship between the raja and his preceptor began before the clan moved to R?n?gh?t from a nearby village. As the family's oral history has it, Candrac?ra minced no words. "You have lost sakti" the Tantric pandit told the sovereign. "To regain it, you must worship sakti. "3&lt;s 34 Candrac?ra is said to have written a worship manual, perhaps still extant, for Jagaddh?tri's p?j?. Mohit Ray hedges his bets on the question of which king started Jagaddh?tri p?j?; while he admits that there is no historical evidence for Krisnacandra having done so, he seems unwilling to discount the oral tradition entirely. See Ray's notes on the question in Ksitisavams?valicarita, 175, and his more detailed consideration of the topic, along with a discussion of Giriscandra's spiritual preceptor, in "Jagaddh?tri: P?j? o utsab," in Bengali, S?tr?garh Caraktal? B?roy?rlSvarnik? (2002), no pagination. The British view of Gir?scandra is succinctly put in Territorial Aristocracy, 114, while McLane capsulises the conflicting sets of demands on a Bengali raja, whose subjects expected him to uphold social and reli gious order while his overlords (whether Nawab or British administrator) insisted on their taxes; see Land and Local Kingship, xiv. 35 The authors illustrate their point with the example of the powerful eighteenth-century r?jguru of M?rv?r in Rajasthan, and Gupta describes an abhic?ra ritual she witnessed in Bihar as a young child in 1941; the king's enemy died soon after the ritual was completed. Sanjukta Gupta and Richard Gombrich,"Kings, Power, and the Goddess," South Asia Research 6, 2 (November 1986): 131-32,134,136. 36 Candrac?ra resided with many other learned Brahmins in Brahmas?san village, in the area known as B?g?ficar? (S?ntipur); see A. K. Bhattacharyya, A Corpus of Dedicatory Inscriptions from Temples of West Bengal, c. 1500 A.D. to c. 1800 A.D.

The village has since been half washed away by the shifting Bh?g?rath? River. The family designation is Bandyop?dhy?y; they claim to have received the title of Ghatak after moving to R?n?gh?t in 1863, when the town was designated subdivisional headquarters.

There are several temporal hinges during the navar?tra when the priest is able to tap into divine power on behalf of his patron. The best known is sandhi, the period of forty-eight minutes that links the eighth and ninth lunar days (twenty-four minutes at the end of the eighth and again at the start of the ninth). R?ma is said to have felled the demonic R?vana during this interval; he was able to do so because the goddess is transformed during sandhi from the ten-armed Durg?, slayer of the buffalo demon, into the terrible sixteen-armed Bhadrak?lL37 Various rituals are undertaken in preparation for this fateful span of time, including the lighting of a number of lamps (usually 108; they are visible on the lower right in figure 7). The sacrifice of animals, especially buffaloes or goats, occurs at this juncture. It is also at this time, or else at a specific moment during the ninth day (or even, in some cases, on the tenth) that the oblation of the enemy (satrubali, satrubadh, or satrunidhan) may take place. This particular form of malevolent action, undertaken using an effigy of the foe, is prescribed in a number of mediaeval texts and is still practised in some traditionalp?j?s, both royal and bourgeois.38 A Krisnanagar instance is found in the Chatterji family, who offer to their unusual blue Durg? a rice-paste human effigy that is chopped into pieces on the ninth day.39 The earthen adversary of military aspect destroyed each year on dasamt by the Nad?y? raja, upon his return from the immersion of his Durg? icon, appears in figure 9. The partially mould-made image of wet clay seems to wear eighteenth-century costume (although the turban and jama are not specific enough for precise dating). Muslims were as likely as Hindus to be clean-shaven in this era. Senior Krisnanagar informants suggest that, in earlier days, the clay foe was considered a poor substitute for the preferred condemned criminal; the monarch killed this prisoner (when available) with a bow and arrow. In 20061 saw Saum?scandra R?y, the present representative of the royal family, smash the effigy with a hand-held arrow. He may have chosen this unorthodox manner of dispatching his adversary because he did not wish to chance an inauspicious miss. Indeed, as Jogendra Nath Bhattacharya pointed 37 Or, some say, into the eighteen-armed Ugracand?. The Raja of Bisnupur used to appear in full battle regalia for the sandhiksan, underscoring its importance for military victory; see Akos Ostor, The Play of the Gods: Locality, Ideology, Structure, and Time in the Festivals of a Bengali Town (Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1980), 156. Ardhar?tri (midnight)p?j? is another important temporal hinge at the Krisnanagar royal and sub-royal rituals. ?nanda Mohan Bandyop?dhy?y of r?y b?ri told me that Durg? is transformed into the mighty C?mund? during this forty-eight-minute period on saptam? night ; conversation in Krisnanagar, November 2005. The period of twenty-four or forty-eight minutes is called a ghataka in Sanskrit. 38 For example, ?r?mah?bh?gavatam, 45:4 (satrubali at sandhiksan) and K?lik? Pur?na, 67:179-87 (decapitating an image of the enemy made of barley flour or clay on the ninth night). According to N?r?yan Cattop?dhy?y, the hereditary priest for a branch of the Krisnanagar royal family, all royal and sub-royal p?j?s in the town involved Tantric elements like rolling in the bloody mud after sacrificing animals and consumption of liquor. He characterised these practices aspais?cik (ghoulish or nefarious); conversation in Navadv?p, November 2007. 39 The Chatterji family, originally from Baris?l district (now Bangladesh), split some years ago over a property dispute. The elder branch shifted to a new house and engaged a different priest to perform their p?j?s. Their purohit, Sanat Kum?r P?thak, told me that after considerable research he found the proper mantras for satrunidhan in a manuscript of the Pr?natosin? antra; conversation in Krisnanagar, September 2006. The text was compiled in 1821 by the great grandson of Krisn?nanda ?gamav?gisa, author of the Tantras?ra. See S. C.

If, for exam ple, the head of an animal is not severed in a single, clean stroke the family is certain that catastrophe will strike them that year. The author stresses that this fear, not any compassionate impulse, is the rea son many families renounce animal sacrifice in favour of offerings like pumpkin, banana, and sugar cane.40 The guiding tenet is that the goddess rejects the balid?n (sacrificial offering) when she grows displeased with those who proffer it. If the durgotsava is a profoundly precarious time, with equal potential for success and failure, then Jagaddh?trfs rite a month later is a last-ditch effort fraught with perils of its own. We should under stand these seasonal festival moments not as discrete sacred incidents intersecting every now and then with ordinary life, but as a kind of continuous divine trajectory that must not be deflected by human error. Thus the first tuft of straw should be tied for the Durg? icon either on the day Jagann?th's char iot leaves his temple or on the day of its return {rath-y?tr? or ult?-rath, usually in July), or else on Krisna's birthday (janmastami, usually in August) ; navar?tra cannot be performed unless offerings have been made to the ancestors during the dark fortnight known as pitripaksa; work on the Jagaddh?tri image is begun either on the final (tenth) day of durgotsava or on bh?tphont? (two days after K?li p?j?); and so on throughout the year. A disruption at any point in the sequence may derail the rest of the annual observances.41 Not only is the linkage of the yearlong cycle vulnerable to interruption, but each ritual event is subject to peculiar hazards. The mediaeval upapur?nas and vernacular R?m?yanas are replete with tales of thwarted rites in which the protagonists manage to spoil demonic p?j?s through craft or magic.42 Nor is this fear of sabotage only a matter of mythology; a theme of the eighteenth-century Bengali Mah?r?sta Pur?na is the manner in which the invading Mar?th? general is forced to flee his navar?tra rite on the eighth day, after which camp followers loot the offerings. He thus incurs the goddess's dis pleasure and seals his own fate. P?j? desecration is also a common method for demoralising Hindus in present-day Bangladesh.43 Even the arrival of fierce Bhadrak?l? at the pivot of the eighth and ninth days, mentioned above as the moment when R?vana was crushed, has another and more esoteric significance. According to the DeviBh?gavata Pur?na, the terrifying Bhadrak?l? appeared with httyoginh (violent female divinities) to wreck Daksa's sacrifice when Siva and his wife Sat? were barred from attending it.44 The Vedic gods' 4-0 Jogendra Nath Battacharya, Hindu Castes and Sects (1896; reprint, Calcutta: Editions Indian, 1968), 323-24. 41 For instance, a 1994 attack on Dhaka's janm?stami procession meant that for the rest of the year the city's pujas were performed using only a clay pot (ghat). Declining to make images can also denote Hindu mourning or protest, which the government of Bangladesh tries to forestall. 42 Han?m?n often serves as the spoiler, turning himself into a bee, a mote of dust, or a fly to gain entrance to and then wreck the enemy's rites; see Smith, R?m?yana Traditions, 145-53. Massive desecration is not necessary, however. In the (heavily interpolated) Krittib?s R?m?yana, the devious monkey god merely frightens R?vana into omitting some verses from his recital of the Dev? M?h?tmya; cited in Robinson, "The Worship of Clay Images," 233. 43 The Mah?r?sta Pur?na: An Eighteenth-Century Bengali Historical Text, trans. Edward C. Dimock Jr. and Pratul Chan dra Gupta (Honolulu: East-West Center Press, 1965), 50. P?j?s in Bangladesh are defiled by the venerable practice of throwing cow bones into the sacred area or by smashing the icons; I documented several such incidents in 2002. 44 The ?rt Mad Devi Bh?gavatam, trans. Swami Vijnananda (Allahabad: Sudhindra Nath Vasu, n.d.), pt. 1, 3:27:9-10. Hazra, Studies, 441, places this upapur?na in the eleventh or twelfth century. The K?lik? Pur?na names Ugracand? as destroyer of Oaksa s yaj?a; 61:2-20. Ranj?t Cakrabart? (b. 1945), descended from the zamtnd?ri family that has long 277</page><page sequence="20">concern with getting a share of the sacrifice has been transformed (myth, again, following mediaeval practice) into dueling sacrifices, in which adversaries try to destroy each other through ritual while spoiling their rival's parallel attempt. Thus the S?barna Ray Caudhar?s, former zam?nd?rs of the area where Calcutta is now located, prepare a special dish for demons (and one's enemies inevitably belong to this tribe) on the ninth day of the durgotsava to distract them from their schemes on the ceremony.45 The successful hero of the p?j? must, with the help of his priest or preceptor, negotiate perils arrayed before him like the proverbial teeth of Yama (the god of death). And if he fails to do so? THE GODDESS OF LAST RESORT Let us look more closely at the Tantric scholar Candrac?ra's goddess in her 2006 instantiation (bear ing in mind that after two hundred years an image annually remade will surely reflect changing artis tic styles). While we must imagine away later embellishments like draperies of sola (white pith from a water plant), profuse jute hair, the silken sari, and even the slightly smiling do-bh?st facial type, the iconography is close to that prescribed in the ritual handbooks, which, in turn, has been taken verba tim from Krisn?nanda's late sixteenth-century Tantras?ra.*6 The Tantras?ra does not, however, give the name Jagaddh?tri to this form of the devi. The description has a goddess whose complexion is the colour of the rising sun (hence, reddish), seated upon a lion's back (although the dhyana states, con fusingly, that she also sits on a lotus and on a lion throne, or simbdsana), and stipulates that she holds in her four hands a discus, a conch shell, five arrows, and a bow.47 The Ghataks' image adheres to most of these requirements; although there is no lotus seat, I saw that when the potters were assembling the armature they attached a long piece of wood to raise the sculpture high above her mount's back. This odd gap between the lion and the goddess is, most probably, a relic of the lost lotus that appears in old models of Jagaddh?tri (figs. 10,14). Before the vogue for concealing much of the figure in dec orations, the deity's clothing would have been modelled of clay and the lotus visible; there is, how ever, little sense in making a flower that nobody can see. Dh?ren P?l (b. circa 1924) yearly produced the clay Jagaddh?tri image for the Ghatak family from about 1944 until 2000 or so, when his son An?p took over. The old artisan, although bedridden (which, in his case, means he occupies a cot in the family pottery studio where he can observe the goings-on), administered Dhaka's Siddhesvar? K?l? temple, told me that at the durgotsava sandhi they worship the sixty-fouryogints (that is, the female deities who destroyed Daksa's sacrifice); conversation in Dhaka in January 2003. 45 The rice and sesame preparation that the Ray Caudhar?s offer to asuras is termed m?sabhaktabali, probably because it once included a pulse called m?sakal?t. Both this pulse and sesame seed are used in Tantric rituals and to ward off the evil eye; conversation with Bim?n Ray Caudhar? in Calcutta, March 2001. Shib Chunder Bose, writing in the 1880s, noted that a flower or bilva leaf was placed on offerings to Durg? to guard against desecration by R?vana; see The Hin doos As They Are, 100. 46 Or, perhaps, from its eighteenth-century Bengali translation; on various versions of this translation, see Malcolm McLean, Devoted to the Goddess: The Life and Work of Ramprasad (Albany, N.Y. : State University of New York Press, 1998), 92. 47 Pal, Hindu Religion andIconology, 41-42. Krisn?nanda's description was taken, in turn, from the Visvas?ra Tantra. My thanks to Dr. Gautam Vajracharya for clarifying the dhy?na for me. We should note in passing that the Ghataks' devi sits in the usual sidesaddle pose, rather than confronting the viewer as the royal goddess does. 48 ?r?durg?saptasat?, 2:29. 278</page><page sequence="21">waxed enthusiastic when questioned about Jagaddh?tr?'s lion (see detail, fig. 8). "He's called a b?ngl? simha" he told me, adding, "He comes from the jungle of a cold, snowy country"; in this statement he echoes the DevtM?h?tmya, in which the personified Himalaya mountains (Himavant) gave the god dess her mount.48 The moustache and odd, X-like marks on the animal's face are signs (cinh?) by which one recognises the b?ngl?-simha, Dh?ren explained, and at the same time they are masculine markers (in this context, it should be remarked that the lion is usually ithyphallic). "If two lions like this should ever come into the world at the same time, any other lion that existed would be torn limb from limb," Dh?ren informed me. Then, slyly, he suggested that the lion was actually Nrisimha-^^r.49 Indeed, if we compare the mount (fig. 8) with a seventeenth-century painting of Nrisimha on a dasa vat?r bookcover from B?rbh?m in West Bengal (fig. n), we cannot help but be struck by similarities in the oddly discrete curls of black hair, long eyes, snout-like nose, toothy snarl, and moustache. As the Tantric r?jguru Candrac?ra well knew, this ferocious form of Visnu was a powerful focus for abbicava rituals. It has even been suggested that Tantric influence led Vaisnavas to develop the concept of the furious man-lion.5? An ordinary jungle-variety lion would not serve the purpose of destroying dan gerous adversaries. THE ELEPHANT To complete our reading of the r?jguru s icon, we may note that a painting of ?iva, placed at the feet of the devi, is concealed beneath her modern embellishments. The palace icon also used to present the god beneath Jagaddh?tr?'s feet, in the form of the serpent seen emerging from a hole in its base (see fig. i, on the inner side of the lion's right foreleg). Thus the devi is raised above Visnu (as the lion) and Siva (as the cobra), and even above Brahm? if we take the lotus upon which she sits to represent him (as does the K?lik? Pur?na).^1 And, finally, just visible in the lower left corner of figure 7, is an elephant's head. The elephant does not appear with all Jagaddh?tri images, but here it surely stands for the demonic adversary whom thep?j? targets. The Navadv?p priest who performs rituals for r?y b?ri (the collateral branch of Nad?y?'s royal family) maintains that the elephant belonged to Kamsa's family.52 49 Conversation in R?n?gh?t, October 2006. 50 G. C. Tripathi makes this claim, and mentions the use of a Nrisimha image to destroy the family of an adversary, in "On the Concept of Purusottama in the Agamas" in The Cult of Jagannath and the Regional Tradition ofOrissa, ed. A. Eschmann, H. Kulke, and G. C. Tripathi (New Delhi: Manohar, 1978), 43-44. See also Goudriaan, M?y? Divine and Human, 397, for an incantation from the Prapancas?ra antra used to strike down the enemy "as if he were the demon king Hiranyakasipu. " The B?rbhum Nrisimha in the Gurusaday Museum, Calcutta (GM1930) may be compared to an earlier painting of Visnu's fierce form from Bankur? district in West Bengal. The older portrayal, found on a dasa vat?r bookcover in the Victoria and Albert Museum (IS 101-1955), is dated 1499 CE. Its interpretation of the avatar is more leonine (hence, less anthropomorphic) than our figure 11; the mane is tawny and matted, the eye round, and the nose less emphatically pointed. It is also classically four-armed, whereas the B?rbhum version is shown, idiosyn cratically, with only two hands. 51 K?lik? Pur?na, 58:66. 52 Conversation with N?r?yan Cattop?dhy?y in Navadv?p, November 2007. Mr. Cattop?dhy?y, like other priests and pandits I spoke with, rejected the suggestion that the elephant might be a form taken by Mahis?sura. The jubilation over the buffalo demon's death on vijay? dasam? just one month earlier would make such an interpretation unlikely. For an opposing view, however, see Hamsan?r?yan Bhatt?cary?, Hinduder debadeb?: Udbhab 0 kramabik?s, in Bengali, vol. 3 (Calcutta: Firma K.L.M., 1986), 310-11. 279</page><page sequence="22">A cursory search of the Hindu calendar reveals that the god Krisna left Braj for Mathur? on the ninth of the waxing fortnight of k?rtik month (the tithi on which Jagaddh?tri's worship is held), and slew his adversary, the wicked King Kamsa, on the following day. The well-known myth has Kamsa sending his fiendish pachyderm v?hana to destroy Krisna and his brother Balar?m; however, the plot backfires when the brothers kill the elephant and tear out its tusk to stab Kamsa himself. Evidently, Raja Giriscandra's preceptor, in searching for a way out of his royal disciple's disastrous economic and political situation, chose the next demon-destroying date following the R?vana-^W? of twenty-eight days earlier. We have already remarked that, in the Bengali tradition, the worship of a goddess on the eighth and ninth of the bright fortnight results in the death of an asura on the tenth. I suggest that the royal disciple must have either missed or somehow improperly observed the great palace durgot sava, and that Jagaddh?tri was chosen as Durg?'s back-up.53 The elephant she battles represents the usurping Mathur? ruler; in the context of threatened kingship, he is an ideal substitute for the over weening Lord of Lank?. However, as we shall see, the elephant has other possible meanings when paired with a more folkish version of Jagaddh?tri. A GODDESS FLUID IN FORM AND MEANING Let us take a moment to survey forms taken by the goddess Jagaddh?tri. She presides over her own temple in a village in H?gl? district (West Bengal), in the form of a metal icon said to have been estab lished in the eighteenth century; the image has no vdhana. She appears in a woodblock print from an 1836/37 p?njik? (Hindu almanac). Four-armed but with the order of her implements jumbled and a lotus instead of the discus in one hand, the schematic illustration has the deity seated in lalitdsana upon a lotus over a pair of lions meant to represent her throne. Between the lions appears the severed head of an elephant. The brace of lions shows up again as her throne in an undated clay plaque in the Gurusaday Museum in Calcutta (fig. 12). Here, the nude devi, whose four hands are tightly clenched in fists (musti mudrd), sits in yogic posture upon a lotus wedged between the lions' backs. The plaque is conceptually closest to Krisnanagar's royal p?j? icon; its lions confront the viewer, the nudity and 53 Recall that missing an earlier ritual on the Hindu calendar may render performance of ap?j? impossible. In particu lar, Durg?'s festival cannot be undertaken unless the patron has properly carried out worship of his ancestors during pitripaksa. For early connections between Krisna and the Great Goddess, perhaps identified with his sister Ek? nams?/Vindhyav?sin?, see . C. Raychaudhuri, "Links between Vaisnavism and S?ktism," in The??kti Cult and Tara, ed. D. C. Sircar (Calcutta: University of Calcutta, 1967), 40-44. In the context of substitute demons, I must also draw attention to the variant Jagaddh?tri of S?ntipur's Mukherji b?ri. Her epithet is Tripuresvari because she brings about the destruction of the demon Tripura, whose death date is the full moon of k?rtik, just a few days after Kamsa's demise ; conversation with Sy?mal Banerjee and his family priest Raghun?th Bhatt?c?rya in S?ntipur, November 2007. 54 Mohit R?y asserts that this temple at Somr? is Bengal's only permanent structure dedicated to the deity; see "Jagad dh?tri: P?j? o utsab. " The location of the temple, near Guptip?r? and just across the Bh?g?rath? River from ??ntipur, places it in the heartland of early Jagaddh?tri worship. Although Ray reports seeing tiles depicting the goddess on seventeenth-century terracotta temples at Jalesvar and Dignagar, I was unable to find any when I visited the sites in September 2006. Such tiles are, however, found on nineteenth-century clay temples; McCutchion describes a plaque that must surely represent Jagaddh?tri, although he does not identify her by name, in George Micheli, ed., Brick Tem ples of Bengal from the Archives of David McCutchion (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1983), 150. 28</page><page sequence="23">hand gestures of the deity denote Tantric intent, and the fact that it is unfired means it was to have been destroyed after its purpose had been served. A related eighteenth-century nude image of the god dess in black stone from Jessore district (Bangladesh), now in Calcutta's Asutosh Museum, portrays her with her lower hands in fists while the upper two hands perform a cryptic gesture, perhaps tarjam mudr?, denoting admonition or threat (fig. 13). Beneath her lotus seat, a furious lion with some fea tures of Nrisimha attacks and breaks a trident.55 Among early nineteenth-century examples, we may note a small clay model of Jagaddh?tri, pur chased in Calcutta in about 1815 by an American seaman and now in the Peabody Essex Museum, Mas sachusetts (fig. 14). As is often the case with models, the implements held by the goddess have been lost. The figurine introduces a variant Jagaddh?tri type in which her mount straddles an elephant that he has subdued but not killed. This iconography dominates in Candannagar, a former French colony of H?gl? district where the Jagaddh?tri festival rivals that of Krisnanagar. We notice that the divin ity sits in lalit?sana upon an elongated blue lotus (actually a water lily, the Nymphaea caerulea) posi tioned upon a lion of hybrid appearance. An intriguing addition to the stack of figures is a turbaned warrior on the elephant's back, peering up at the goddess while ineffectually brandishing a weapon. If, as I have argued, the Jagaddh?tri icon was devised to target Kamsa (echoing the epic battle waged by R?ma and his protectress Durg? against R?vana), then this warrior is surely the wicked king of Mathur? upon his mount Kuvalay?p?ra. A lithograph made after a model and published in 1832 has a similar iconographical schema, but with an English lion and no rider; the objects held by the goddess again depart from the Tantras?ra prescription.56 Later portrayals of Jagaddh?tri include a fanciful, European-influenced drawing from a K?ligh?t artist's sketchbook, in which a willowy ^/"balances precariously upon a lotus sprouting from the backs of a pair of large, prancing English-style lions ; four nude winged angels or fairies flank the assemblage. Although there is no elephant in this sketchbook drawing, the animal crops up in most K?ligh?t paintings (fig. 15). In tune with the playful, even witty mood of this popular art form, the beast appears 55 The almanac illustration appears in the N?tan P?njik? of Bengali year 1243. P?njik? prints of Jagaddh?tri from the second half of the nineteenth century have been published in Ashit Paul, ed., Woodcut Prints of Nineteenth Century Cal cutta (Calcutta: Seagull Books, 1983), pis. 71,116; a coloured woodcut of the goddess is reproduced as plate 3. The Guru saday Museum terra cruda plaque (GM1163) measures 25.5 X 18 centimetres and may date to the early twentieth cen tury. The provenance of the Asutosh Museum sculpture (AM137), which is a bit over 60 centimetres in height, is Nald?ng?, Jessore (Jasohar). There are holes in the ears and in the lower hands for the insertion of fixtures now lost. The Asutosh goddess makes with her two upper hands a threatening gesture that is illustrated as a variant of the stan dard tarjam mudr? in Robert Beer, The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs (Boston : Shambala, 1999), pi. 74 (sixth row, second from the right). Robert Linrothe recalls seeing the mudr? used in Tibetan Tantric rituals, where it con veyed directed power, compulsion, or admonition; he further specifies that the extended little finger carries an added sense of imprecation or spell-casting; communications in April and May 2009. 56 Interestingly, the lion and elephant in the 1832 print face in opposite directions. This modification reproduces the iconographie peculiarity of Candannagar's most venerable p?j?. The image at C?ulpati (fig. 18) is associated with Indran?r?yan Caudhur?, the French trading settlement's eighteenth-century factor, who allegedly began Jagaddh?tri's worship at Candannagar following another wonderful dream. The lithograph, said to have been made from a model by an artisan named Chit Roy, is reproduced in Charles Coleman, The Mythology of the Hindus with Notices of Various Mountain and Island Tribes Inhabiting the Two Peninsulas of India and the Neighbouring Islands (London: Parbury, Allen, and Co., 1832), pi. 21:1 and 98-99. 28l</page><page sequence="24">less demonic than droll; in one painting the lion grasps its foe's flexible proboscis with both paws and sucks on it as though it were a straw, while in a related woodblock print a pair of pachyderms performs a kind of battlefield pas de deux with their trunks entwined.57 Models from the final quarter of the nine teenth century show goddesses seated on English lions and tricked out in real fabric clothing with gilt wire or tinsel ornaments. An example of this type of figurine, one of a set of Hindu deities presented to the British Museum in 1894, has the lion vanquishing his animal foe in much the same way as seen in figure 14. Another late Jagaddh?tri in Oxford's Ashmolean Museum is reproduced in figure 10; here, the lion treads on what appears to be a loaf of bread but is actually intended as a globe.58 This enigmatic divinity manifests in myriad ways. Sometimes she is enthroned, at other junctures she rides a lion (variously conceived) or perches upon a stack of embattled creatures. We have noted that she may be either nude or splendidly attired, and can hold an array of implements or none. Her complexion has varied, from yellow to orange to deep red (all designated by enchanting names derived from flowers, fruits, molten metals, and heavenly bodies).59 Nor do these modifications exhaust Jagad dh?tri's aspects. And yet, even more disconcerting than her iconographie variability for the scholar trying to pin her down, the pur?nas do not have much to say about this devi. With the exception of a K?lik? Pur?na tale that bears little relevance to Jagaddh?tri as she is worshipped in Bengal, the name seems merely to be used as an epithet for the Great Goddess in her guise as the Earth, "she who sup ports/nurtures creation. "6o I have traced Jagaddh?tri's adoption as a goddess of last resort by the kings of Nad?y? because I believe that her myth belongs rather to the early modern world than to any pur?na. Her story is that of Bengal's Hindu zam?nd?rs, overtaken and ultimately crushed by global historical events. However, as I have suggested, the royal Jagaddh?tri is not the only facet of this protean divin ity. She possesses a decidedly folkish side as well. In order to explore that aspect of our goddess we must journey to rural Bengal, where its womenfolk venerate a wise old ancestor figure. 57 Two pages from the K?ligh?t artist's late nineteenth- or early twentieth-century sketchbook (although not the Jagad dh?tri drawing) have been published in Jyotindra Jain, Kalighat Painting: Images from a Changing World ( Ahmedabad : Mapin, 1999), figs. 52, 54. The sketchbook is in the Gurusaday Museum, Calcutta (GM481). The lion uses the ele phant's trunk as a straw in a Victoria and Albert Museum painting (IS 216-1950) ; the print with two elephants, signed by M?dhav Candra D?s, is in the British Library (Add Or. 4562). 58 The British Museum model (1894-216.9) is iconographically similar to the figure in the Peabody Essex Museum (fig. 14), but for the warrior. Cobras appear over the right shoulders of both images. In its late style, however, the British Museum piece resembles the Ashmolean Jagaddh?tri (X.2984; our fig. 10). 59 For example, Jagaddh?tr?'s dhy?na has her the colour of the child sun (v?l?rka), while informants sometimes stipu late that her complexion should be the reddish-orange of the sivalt flower's stamen, bright reddish-yellow like molten gold (tapta kancan), or an intense yellow like the flesh of the k?l? jam fruit. 60 The story about the dalliance of Jagaddh?tri (as the Earth personified) and Var?ha, as well as the subsequent adven tures of their demonic son Naraka, is told in the K?lik? Pur?na, 36-40. The secondary literature is replete with sup posed early references to Jagaddh?tr?'s rite; most figure among the mirages of archival research. For example, Chin taharan Chakravarti claims to have discovered a Sanskrit verse prescribing the goddess's worship in a fifteenth-cen tury manuscript that eluded me at the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal; see "The Mah?bh?gavata Pur?na, a Work of Bengal," The Indian Historical Quarterly 28,1 (March 1952): 257. The source of many of these references in the second ary materials may be the voluminous Bengali Visvakos, compiled between 1886 and 1911; s.v. "Jagaddh?tri." 282</page><page sequence="25">THE OLD LADY OF BENGAL In his study of the Devi Bh?gavata Pur?na, C. Mackenzie Brown has remarked that the same phrase is used to describe the mutable nature of time and of the devi. Both are n?n?-r?pa-dhar?, "bearing many forms"; I would add that all their aspects, whether benign or pernicious, are of potential use to humans.61 The crone (vriddhik?), an anthropophagie tree goddess known from early literature, is the focus of popular worship in parts of rural Bengal where she is called t?n (the old lady). Her cult is an outdoors, non-Brahmanical affair, patronised largely by women for whom the divinity is a powerful ancestress. Either as the spirit of a particular tree or as a kind of dryad possessing that tree, the burl has no need of an icon. Even when worshipped by uprooted city-dwellers, she generally appears for her rit uals in the form of a leafy branch thrust into the soil of the courtyard, rather than as an image. How ever, the burl sometimes agrees to take anthropomorphic shape, either when her devotees wish to asso ciate her with the Great Goddess of what has been termed "normative" Hinduism, or when her cult is adopted by a ruler. Although she may consent to embodiment, she fiercely resists being shut in a temple. As a vanadurg? (forest Durg?) who prefers the open air, she has been known to break or burn down walls that enclose her.62 Burls are classified according to the botanical species they inhabit; among these is the amia or aml?kt, a small tree bearing a fruit (the Indian gooseberry, or Emblica offainalis) much appreciated for its medicinal properties. Also known as the dh?trt, perhaps because its fruits sustain or nurture health, the tree is worshipped as a goddess on the same day as Jagaddh?tri (the ninth of the bright fortnight of k?rtik). It is difficult to judge whether the association between Jagaddh?tri's p?j? and this tree-deity cult of northern and eastern India is based on a mere coincidence of timing and similarity in name, or is perhaps more substantive. Undeniably, the two traditions have borrowed from and influenced each other over the past two centuries. Thus the goddess devised by Raja Giriscandra's Tantric preceptor has come to be called Ginn?m? (the senior lady) by the Ghatak family, and many Krisnanagar resi dents claim that the king's Jagaddh?tri is a gypsy woman (beden?) skilled in folk medicine. Meanwhile, the old lady of the aml? tree has, in certain locales, become a respectable vaimava goddess with the youthful, voluptuous mien that one expects of a Hindu female icon.63 61 C.

She is clearly a lady of many parts ; or, perhaps, we would be better off thinking of her as a deity cluster. Although Jagaddh?tri is often equated with the Durg? of Bengal's great autumnal festival, a cursory comparison of any of her images with Krisnanagar's vigorously striding royal Durg? (fig. 16) should convince us that their iconographie intention differs. While Durg?, flanked by subsidiary divinities, is occupied with the bloody task of killing an offending demon, the calmly seated Jagad dh?tri does no such thing. Her destructive impulse is carried out by her lion, whether he engages in subduing the elephant asura, pawing its severed head, or menacing the onlooker/enemy with a fero cious snarl. This devi knows how to delegate unpleasant tasks to those who serve her. I have suggested that a religious construct must sometimes search for its visual form. We followed Raja Giriscandra and his Tantric guru in that quest. The corollary, I proposed, is the visual trope in pursuit of an interpretation. This mechanism is common in the history of South Asian art, where com pelling images remain in place long after those who devised them have disappeared from the scene. In thinking about the genesis of the Jagaddh?tri icon, we may recall that lions battle elephants on the walls of many mediaeval temples, in eastern India as elsewhere. The familiar motif would certainly have caught the eyes of artists and scholarly iconographers.64 Even more evocative, in my opinion, is the central oneiric image of two sixteenth-century versions of the popular Bengali narrative poem the Candtmangal. This vernacular tale tells how the goddess Cand? (a name now interchangeable with Durg?) won the devotion of tribal hunters and seafaring mer chants. It was regularly recited at courts and in the homes of the wealthy during the yearly durgotsava. In a strange, unexplained vision sequence, the story has its merchant protagonist looking over the prow of his ship to see, in the very midst of the Indian Ocean, a stunning young woman seated upon a lotus, repeatedly devouring and regurgitating an elephant. This peculiar revelation of the goddess and her 63 On aml?Idh?trip?j?, see Rajendra Kumar Bhattacharyya and Sarat Chandra Mitra, "A Note on the 'Dhatree Puja' as Performed by the Hindusthanis Resident in Calcutta," Anthropological Society of Bombay 13 (1924): 320-29; and Tracy Pintchman, Guests at God's Wedding: Celebrating Kartik among the Women of Benares (Albany, N.Y.: State University of New York Press, 2005), 73-76. Two late ritual manuals in the National Archives of Nepal outline worship of the amia tree (see microfilm reels E1569/37 and B370/7). A famous Krisnanagar Jagaddh?tri was recast as a Jagad dh?tri I burl, perhaps because the neighbourhood of C?s?p?r?, where she was yearly refashioned for worship, featured a large banyan tree. The banyan {bat) is associated with powerful deities or ghosts. Hindu refugees from the new East Pakistan, flooding across the border in 1947, sought a replacement for their ancestral tree divinities. Over the ensu ing years they transformed C?s?p?r?'s goddess into the city's greatest draw of the festival season. Pilgrims come from across Bengal to tie stones to the tree as mannats (vows to reward the deity if their requests are answered), and to view the fifteen-foot clay icon that takes shape over the course of a couple of weeks and is then immersed. Bur?m?, as she is now called, is not only the largest image in Krisnanagar, but perhaps the wealthiest. Her lion is said to have genuine diamond eyes. 64 My comments on the fluctuating significance of images echo A. K. Ramanujan's remarks about the widely differing meanings attributed to proverbs, depending upon region and period, in "Who Needs Folklore?" in The Collected Essays of A.K. Ramanujan (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1999), 536-37. The lithic battles of lions and elephants referred to kingly dominance; usually the lion dominated but sometimes, as in Orissa when rulers assumed the title gajapati, the elephant was on top. 284</page><page sequence="27">power has been variously interpreted by modern scholars as an unpropitious mirror image of Gaja Laksm? (two elephants lustrating the female divinity of good fortune), as an epiphany of the simulta neous creation and destruction of the cosmos, or as a kind of commentary on the nature of pr?dation. Without hazarding an opinion on the exact meaning of so extraordinary a poetic figuration, I would like merely to draw attention to one of Bengal's senior tree goddesses, H?thi-Dhar?-B?ri, the old lady who seizes elephants with her bare hands and is said in this way to have rid the jungle of marauding beasts. In the world of the religious imagination an elephant-catching deity could well inspire a poet; his vision, lively in the popular mind, might later surface as the powerful lady-and-animal focus of Bengal's first communal p?j?. If opposite paths led to this icon's synthesis (downward from Sanskrit pur?na and upward from folk divinity through vernacular verse) it would explain why, while priests claim that the elephant is Kamsa's mount Kuvalay?p?ra, the general populace knows him only as Karindr?sura (the demonic elephant-king).65 THE WORSHIP OF THE TWELVE FRIENDS Calcutta's goddesses (and a few of its gods) are the glitterati of the Hindu world. Nowadays the focus of the city's spectacular public p?j?s is Durg?, yet we know from the sketches of urban life written by a mid-nineteenth-century observer that early popular subscription festivals were likely to feature Jagaddh?tri.66 Durg?, as the older and ritually more important deity, remained the monopoly of the capital's elite families. Wealthy and aristocratic patrons retained control of the autumn durgotsava even longer in the provinces than in Calcutta. A Nad?y? native, recalling the first festivals of independent India, remarked that in those days there were no public Durg? p?j?s in the district; it was for Jagad dh?tri's celebration that the populace formed committees and raised money.67 To understand why divergent patronage systems developed to honour the two goddesses, we must visit the site of a quar rel that erupted some two hundred years ago. 65 The vision of an elephant-eating goddess (kamale k?mint) appears in the Candtmangah of both Mukunda Cakrabart? and Dv?ja M?dhab; her appearance is characterised as bipart? (inverse, or contrary to the norm). It is described some what differently by Sukumar Sen and David L. Curley, who have perhaps consulted variant recensions of the texts. See Sen, History of Bengali Literature (i960; reprint, New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi, 1971), 56-57; and Curley, "Tribute Exchange' and the Liminality of Foreign Merchants in Mukunda's Candtma?gal" in Poetry and History: Bengali Man gal-k?bya, 130-31. Is it only a coincidence that the H?th?-Dhar?-Bur? dwells in Medin?pur, where Mukunda lived and wrote his narrative poem? See Chaudhuri, "The Cult of the Old Lady," 418. 66 K?l?prasanna Simha describes a typical mid-century Jagaddh?tri p?j? of north Calcutta in Hutom Py?mc?r Naks?, 14-45. His witty account captures the excitement of the festivities, with their rowdy musical contests, provocative dancing girls, and clay model tableaux that satirised the very excesses of contemporary society seen in community p?j?s. His treatment of Durg? p?j?, on the other hand, places it firmly in the home of a b?b? (the term then used for a wealthy townsman). 67 Jogn?th M?khop?dhy?y reminisces about the festivals of newly independent India in the "Sunday Supplement" of Bartam?n, 1 October 1998,11. A few newspaper reports from the 1820s mention public subscription (b?roiy?rl) god dess festivals; most seem to have been either the spring durgotsava or Jagaddh?tri p?j?. Perhaps the organisers did not wish to compete with the autumnal rites held by local elites; see Brajendran?th Bandyop?dhy?y, ed., Samb?dpatre Sek?ler Kath?, in Bengali, vol. 1 (Calcutta: Bang?ya S?hitya Parisad, 1941), 231-32. 285</page><page sequence="28">Guptip?r?, a village on the eastern bank of the Bh?g?rath? long renowned for its Sanskrit scholars and vernacular poets, as well as for a fine group of terracotta temples and an ensemble of Tantric prac titioners ranging from the celebrated to the notorious, is generally accepted as the birthplace of the subscription p?j?. An anachronous tale of social injustice with a Marxist twist is often told to explain the genesis of the new kind of festival. According to the popular story, some poor people of Guptip?r?, usually identified as Brahmins and sometimes as women, arrived at the doorstep of the local landlords during the festive season. This ruling family, belonging to the vaidya caste, celebrated both Durg? and K?li p?j?s in grand patrician fashion. When a body of humble townsfolk came asking to feast their eyes upon the Durg? icon (and, perhaps, to receive some sanctified foodstuffs), they were turned away by the haughty zamtnd?rs. Humiliated, the party returned home resolving to raise the funds to con duct their own festival proceedings. Either the original group trying to gain entry to the landlords' palace consisted of a dozen men, or the male relatives of the aggrieved women came to twelve; in any case, the new function got the moniker of b?roiy?rip?j? (the festival of the twelve friends) and, later, came to be seen as an early populist gesture of protest against the tyranny of the landowning class. Since the p?j? to which they were refused admission was surely the durgotsava, it is not surprising that the villagers were said to have chosen Jagaddh?tri for their subscription festival. We have already noted that this goddess, who comes just a month after Durg? on the calendar, had assumed the posi tion of fall-back option for those who missed or improperly performed the earlier rite.68 While the narrative outlined above says a great deal about how Bengalis view today's lavish com munity p?j?s, with their presumed history as engines of social reform and of anti-British political insurrection, it crumbles rather like the story of Raja Krisnacandra's dream when more closely exam ined. The earliest mention of the Guptip?r? subscription festival was penned in 1820 by James Long, a Baptist missionary who reported on "a new species of Pooja which has been introduced into Bengal within the last thirty years. " In the minister's account, the twelve Brahmin friends appear as commit tee members whose primary function is collecting seven thousand rupees to procure Bengal's finest vocalists and to feast all Brahmin comers; he also points out that the revels were extended for an entire week, in contradiction to the rules laid down by Hindu scriptures. There is no mention of a landlord/ tenant dispute, and Long implies that the sole aim of the enterprise was general amusement and cre ating a festive splash. In weighing this assessment we should keep in mind the usually dismissive British response to Bengali religious display.69 68 On the scholars, poets, Tantrics, and temples of Guptip?r?, see Amiya Kumar Banerji, Gazetteer of India: West Ben gal: Hooghly (Calcutta: Government of West Bengal, 1972), 518-19, 679-82. The story of the twelve friends rebuffed by an arrogant landlord appears frequently in the popular press. 69 The Reverend Long's dispatch in the Friend of India, the Sr?r?mpur (Serampore) missionary newspaper, has been pub lished in Bandyop?dhy?y, Samb?dpatre Sek?ler Kath?, 423-24. The minister appears to have decided on a date of 1790 for Guptip?r?'s first public festival when he again wrote about it, some forty years after his first dispatch, in his col lection of essays Calcutta and Its Neighbourhood: History of People and Localities from to i8$y, ed. Sankar Sen Gupta (i860; reprint, Calcutta: Indian Publications, 1974), 20. The date is too early for public adoption of ap?j? that was not established until well over a decade later by the Nad?y? Raja Giriscandra. Jyotirmoyee Sarma cites Long's report in her early and important article on Bengal's subscription p?j?s, "P?j? Associations in West Bengal," The Journal of Asian Studies 28, 3 (May 1969): 580; however, she follows one improbable local tradition in placing the first b?roiy?rt festival even earlier than Long's estimate (in 1760). 286</page><page sequence="29">A more serious objection to the minister's account is that he has overlooked critical information about Guptip?r?'s social fabric. The town's intellectually dominant Brahmins had long been in conflict with its ruling vaidya gentry. According to family lore, Sr?r?m Sen, patriarch of the ruling family, arrived in about 1580 from Senh?t? (Kh?ln?, now in Bangladesh); his appearance with a flotilla of sev enteen ships sounds in retrospect like an invasion. Vague but recurring indications of deep social fissures crop up in Guptip?r?'s oral history. Certain residents hint darkly that the Sens were left-handed Tantrics who secretly supported river piracy and the thagt cult, and practised human sacrifice. Later, the zam?nd?rs religious rituals were boycotted by some in the Brahmin community. Perhaps this embargo lies at the root of the story about twelve slighted friends. In any case, the descendants of Gup tip?r?'s rulers do not admit to having snubbed anybody who wished to attend their festivities. They maintain that they handed over their own Jagaddh?trip?j? to local Brahmins after a botched sacrifice, in which the buffalo ran out into the street with the scimitar wedged in its neck. A more inauspicious turn of events cannot be imagined, and the Sens of today claim that ritual specialists advised the royal family to relinquish their rite to a group of Brahmins in order to counteract the omen.70 THE POWER OF TWELVE In 1939, as a gesture of reconciliation between the Sen family and the Guptip?r? festival committee, Sat?scandra Sen financed the building of a permanent structure to house the community's clay icon. The new cement building stands empty for most of the year, until potter Kuran P?l arrives some time in October to refashion the icon, as did his father and grandfather. A glance at the 2007 image (fig. 17) confirms that this Jagaddh?tri is iconographically unlike others we have seen. While her complexion is the prescribed "rising sun" hue and she holds the customary attributes in her four hands, the god dess is, most unusually, flanked by clay statues of Siva and Visnu. Her foreign-style lion does not maul an elephant but, rather, treads upon a globe that the potter, unsure of its significance, calls a g?/-ball (a round ball). Neither Kuran P?l nor any of the p?j? committee members can say why the deity array includes anthropomorphic figures of the two gods, and they are confused about her secondary title of Vindhyav?sin? ("she who dwells in the Vindhya mountains"). This last point is not so difficult to explain: the epithet is used for the vaisnava goddess, Krisna's sister, to whom S?ktas say he owed his victory over the demonic Kamsa. But what of the flanking divinities, whom we have heretofore seen in theriomorphic form underneath the devil Far from serving as mounts or footstools, these two stal wart gods seem about to stride forth in defence of the goddess. I believe that we must once again probe Jagaddh?trfs folkish side to understand the meaning of her unusual presentation in Guptip?r?.71 jo In piecing together Guptip?r?'s social jigsaw, I spoke with Pranab Kumar Sen in Guptip?r? in October 2006, and consulted ?aktibrata Sen frequently by telephone and e-mail. I also interviewed several residents of the town in 2006 and 2007, including Subrata Mandai and p?j? committee members Krisnacandra Pr?m?nik and Prad?p Pr?m?nik. Some townspeople were reluctant to discuss communal issues. The literature on thag? (Thuggee) is extensive ; recently, scholars have begun to question its supposed pervasiveness. See Martine van Woerkens, The Strangled Traveler: Colo nial Imaginings and the Thugs of India, trans. Catherine Tihanyi (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2002). 71 Kuran Pal, who may be in his mid-sixties, began assisting his father, Phani, at Guptip?r?'s main community p?j? (for there are now others in the village) when he was about thirteen. Although the size of the sculptures is held in check by the wooden structure (k?th?mo) that displays them, in use at least since the time of Kuran's grandfather Dv?rik 287</page><page sequence="30">Jyotirmoyee Sarma has suggested that the founders of the first b?roiy?rtp?j? took their cue from the cooperative customs of less privileged social groups, forced by poverty to organise their rituals col lectively.72 Indeed, the term b?roiy?rJ has long been attached to cooperative public works projects in villages; for example, a b?roiy?rtr ind?r? is a well that has been paid for by general contribution and is intended to benefit all residents of the locality. The number twelve here means "all, everybody. " The Bengali language is replete with examples of twelve signifying entirety, from the mediaeval twelve bhuiy?s, or traditional rulers of Bengal, to the twelve ghosts {bh?t) ready to gobble up the property of a profligate man; the number is even part of a common locution used in referring to a prostitute, b?ron?rt, a woman who is the property of all.73 Particularly relevant to the innovative means of financing an ephemeral clay-icon p?j?, first tried in Guptip?r? and within a decade or so become the rage across Bengal, is a mythological group of twelve associated with Jagaddh?tri's wild side, that is, with her identity as the old lady of the forest. In some parts of Bengal, this fierce tree goddess is protected by her dozen sons, the b?robh?iy?, whose roaming ways and uncanny appearance are described in vernacular song although they rarely take form as icons. They stand at the rustic end of a continuum that extends to the twelve Sanskritic Siva shrines sur rounding many mediaeval and early modern goddess temples. The example of twelve brothers serv ing a powerful mother, focus of a once popular rural cult, may well have catalysed the new ideology of the worship of the twelve friends. Perhaps we see a reminder of these ready defenders of the goddess in the unusual depiction of armed deities on either side of Guptip?r?'s p?j? array.74 THE USES OF POWER Simmering inter-caste tensions led to Guptip?r?'s experiment in subscription p?j?J^ Given what we know of Jagaddh?tri as a powerful divinity who promises to reward her devotees while crushing their enemies, and the town's tradition as a centre of Brahmanic scholarship and intensive Tantric practice, we may hazard a guess that her cult was instituted there with malevolent purpose. Yet, as the b?roiy?rt Pal, the potter claims that the Jagaddh?tri of today is about a foot taller than she used to be. The rough finish and stubby proportions of the clay statues are typical of village production. The goZ-ball, like the bread loaf of figure 10, conflates a foreign symbol of global dominance with an indigenous motif, the victor toying with the severed head of his enemy. 72 Sarma, "P?j? Associations," 580. 73 R?dh?raman Ray argues the case for b?roiy?rt signifying collectivity, although he thinks that the original expression was b?roy?ris (twelve oy?ris, the Urdu word meaning an heir) rather than twelve friends (iy?r); see "B?ngl?r Pratham B?roy?ri Guptip?r?r Jagaddh?tri p?j?," mSmaranik?(p?j?souvenir issue), in Bengali (Guptip?r?: Sri Sri Vindhyav?s in? P?j? Kamit?, [2000]), no pagination. B?robhuiy? probably meant "all the rulers of the earth," i.e. of Bengal, since there were surely more than twelve independent chiefs in the post-Afghan/pre-Mughal interregnum. I suspect that all these idioms arose from the twelve months of the year as the number of entities required to complete a whole. 74 The twelve brothers appear in two early articles, Chintaharan Chakravarti's "The Cult of B?ro Bh?iy? of Eastern Ben gal, "Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal 26 (1930): article 22: 379-88; and Chaudhuri, "The Cult of Vana Durg?," 78. The twelve Siva shrines in the compounds ofs?kta temples, mentioned by Bhattacharyya in History of the ??kta Religion, 153, must surely also be related to India's twelve jyotirlingas. 75 Rachel McDermott's suggestion that the Guptip?r? community p?j? came about because the local zam?nd?rs had been ruined by the Permanent Settlement of 1793 and were thus unable to mount their yearly goddess festival is untenable; 288</page><page sequence="31">system spread from town to town, the focus and operation of these pugnacious rituals changed. Read ing backwards, we might say that their use of aggression became more modern. An axiom of Hindu ritual is that the patron receives benefits in proportion to his outlay. A rite paid for by a large number of people spreads out and diffuses its investment return. In short, there can be no abhk?ra in a com munity p?j?\ the ritual's power has been blunted. Nevertheless, as we shall see, the innate belliger ence of the goddess and her worship was taken up by her supporters, village by village and city quar ter by city quarter, in a spirit of civic rivalry that gradually transformed the meaning of p?j? in Ben gal. An old popular saying has it that community festivals are the time when poets, singers, and San skrit logicians all challenge their rivals. Extemporaneous competitions pitted the celebrities of their field against each other in contests of wit and erudition. The scholars of Guptip?r? used to debate those of S?ntipur, an equally famous old town on the opposite bank of the Bh?g?rath?. Dueling b?roiy?rt cel ebrations were a natural outgrowth of the intellectual contests between the two locales. K?l?prasanna Simha recounts the story of one S?ntipur committee that, giving itself airs, decided to make a clay devi of unprecedented height. When the time came to immerse it, it was far too heavy to lift and had to be cut up and carried in pieces to the river. The impudent citizens of Guptip?r? waited until the next community p?j? before revealing their clever retort : a clay image of the goddess's elephant-headed son Ganesa, wearing a white mourning cloth (k?c?), lamenting his mother's untimely demise. Although it had taken place at least a century and a half earlier, Guptip?r?ns told me the tale of the grieving Ganesa with undiminished delight.76 As goddess icons began taking shape in every urban ward or small-town fairground (fig. 18), pride in locality and caste sometimes took people beyond poetic competitions or debates over Sanskrit texts to overt violence. While transgressive behaviour had certainly been a part of the autumn Durg? cele bration, with its boisterous s?barotsava accompanying images being carried through the town and rib ald transvestite dancing on boats that took the goddess to the river's midpoint for immersion, the spe cialty of Jagaddh?tri's festival was actual street fighting.77 Clubs, razor-sharp slivers of green bamboo, and even swords and scimitars (colloquially k?t?l) were stored in the hollowed-out body of the lion or thrust into the base of the image array, and taken out when disputes arose about which procession had precedence as they carried the icons to the water's edge. Sometimes one group of rowdy men forced another to put their image down on the ground, then taunted them for doing so. After these neigh see Mother of My Heart, Daughter of My Dreams: K?l? and Urna in the Devotional Poetry of Bengal (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 175. 76 P?j? was said to be the time for kabir lar??, g?ner lar??, and tarker lar??(poetry, song, and logic fights). Saktibrata Sen points out that the common denominator for the three contests was improvisation on a topic disclosed at the last moment; e-mail message, March 2009. The story of Ganesa in mourning attire appears in Simha, Hutom Py?mc?r Naks?, 20. 77 The s?barotsava, or festival of the sabaras (probably a general term used for aboriginal groups), is prescribed as a cru cial part of Durg?'s ^/^/celebration in the K?lik?

Kane also discusses the sabara rite in History of Dharmas?stra, vol. 5, pt. 1, ij6-jj. William Ward disapprovingly describes the dancing of naked men, and of men dressed as women, in A View of the History, Literature, and Mythology of the Hindoos, vol. 3 (1822; reprint, Port Washington, N.Y.: Kennikat Press, 1970), 289</page><page sequence="32">bourhood skirmishes, in which a year's worth of quarrels might be settled, the losers were compelled to buy sweetmeats and distribute them to the populace. Krisnanagar was particularly renowned for its Jagaddh?tri brawls; the renunciant we encountered earlier, who worships an icon modelled on the royal goddess, reminisced with amusement about the time his father broke the nose of a man belong ing to a rival quarter of the city.78 When Jagaddh?tri joined the modern age, her reputation as a warrioress and mother of martial sons found expression in the literature of resistance. In his 1883 historical fantasy Knandamath, Ba?kim candra Cattop?dhy?y seems to hark back to the old elephant-seizing forest goddess when describing Jagaddh?tri, the "Mother as she was," who had rid the land of elephants and other wild beasts. An even more compelling link with the deity than her appearance as an icon in the novel's mysterious woodland temple is the central guerilla conceit of Bankim's work. The author posits a band of mili tant renunciants, children {sant?n) of the goddess, who have taken a vow to overthrow their Muslim overlords. To my mind, his revisionist reworking of the late eighteenth-century sanny?s? raids owes a great deal to the mythology of the first b?roiy?rt p?j? and to the truculent reputation of early collec tive festivals. We might trace these ideas through Anandamath to its translator Aurobindo Ghose's 1905 pamphlet Bhav?nt Mandir, with a glance at the revolutionary author's later stay in French-ruled and Jagaddh?tri-obsessed Candannagar; however, heedful of the proverbial criticism of digressive yarn-spinners that the cow in the story has gone up in the tree (galper goru g?che of he), I intend to leave that part of the narrative for others.79 Instead, I would like to end my enquiry by returning to a cou ple of my original questions: Why clay images and why ephemeral icons in Bengal? TERRA EPHEMERA, FLUVIUS AETERNUS In her thoughtful consideration of the uses and misapplications of oral history in producing written history, Gwyn Prins draws our attention to an overlooked point: the past is not only about what hap pened, but also about what stayed the same. Indeed, as she underlines in reference to the persistence over the centuries of English playground riddles, "continuity, sustained by the energy of such cease less renewal, requires more explanation than change." While schoolchildren leave the playground to be replaced by new youngsters every few years (hence the "ceaseless renewal"), the life of a p?j? icon is usually a matter of mere days. Whatever happens to a devi occurs in the flurry of decision-making before the potter roughs out her form and in the rush forced by impending temporal strictures which, as we have seen, are essential to the success of the ritual.80 88. The tenth-day portion of the durgotsava retains ancient apotropaic and propitious performances for sending armies off to war. 78 Conversations with As?m?nanda Ray, Gautam Bisv?s, and Tur?yat?t?nand N?th Sarasvat?

The French government in Candannagar was said to have protected Aurobindo from British arrest. 80 Gwyn Prins might almost be referring to Bengali p?j? displays rather than Zambi?n proverbs when she says that " crys tals of wording remain unchanged within a changing kaleidoscope of structures adapted to particular purposes. " Her comments on riddles and proverbs appear in "Oral History," in New Perspectives in Historical Writing, ed. Peter Burke (Cambridge, Mass. : Polity Press, 1991), 123,130. 290</page><page sequence="33">Kuran P?l informed me that once, during his grandfather's tenure as image-maker, the determi nation was made to give Guptip?r?'s Jagaddh?tri six hands instead of four. However, an unfortunate incident occurred during the rite that year, and a pandit advised return to the status quo ante. Changes in the icons are made on the strength of dream directives, scholarly opinion, and even last-minute mis takes; they are tried in the crucible of ritual and then, like genetic mutations, either dropped or car ried on. Just as different narrators' tellings of an oral tradition transmitted across generations retain certain archaic characteristics and lose others, so the icons we have surveyed are a mix of original and introduced features. Sometimes the new overlays the old, as we see in figure 19 where the potter is engaged in attaching Sarasvat?'s bin?nis, the tightly plaited and ornamented pigtails that distinguished Bengali goddesses in olden days. The braids in the picture will soon be covered over with masses of artificial hair and nobody but the potter (and the photographer) will know that they are there. One icon may retain the devis pigtails but revise her facial type; another may keep the lion's moustache and other masculine markers but drop his human hands. Only by surveying as many images as possi ble can we begin to work out their genealogies.81 The argument is sometimes made that eastern India's position outside the heartland of Brahmanic culture and long spell under Buddhist heterodoxy are to blame for its unstable Hindu iconography. Might we not, instead, view the potential for change as a persistent feature of the Brahmanical land scape? Kumkum Chat ter jee draws our attention to the at once malleable and durable nature of the mangalk?byas, the narrative poems in Bengali that centred around new deity cults. She attributes to its performative context the inclination of this oral and written genre to incorporate fresh material; in this respect it is not unlike the pur?nas, for they too went on being recast and remade over the cen turies. We have seen that Bengali goddesses are prone to magnitude shifts, and may be induced to alter their form at critical junctures. These leaps and retreats in intensity are frequently signalled by the number of hands the ^/manifests. A series of three terracotta tiles on Guptip?r?'s early nine teenth-century Vrind?van Candra temple demonstrates how alterability was seen as inherent in the deity's nature (fig. 5). As we saw with Guptip?r?'s Jagaddh?tri icon, the yearly festival provides a chance to try out these variations for efficacy.82 To watch an artisan modelling a clay icon is to see mud stroked into life. The process is wet and gradual, quite unlike the flurry of chips and marble dust produced by the attacking chisel of a stone sculptor. Haripada P?l, premier potter of Dhaka's Sakh?ri Baz?r, describes his intimate relationship 81 The goddesses of the Durg? array at the venerable Datta family p?j? at H?tkhol? in north Calcutta also retain their pigtails under jute hair. According to Kuran Pal, a pandit suggested giving Guptip?r?'s Jagaddh?tri six arms because her other title, Vindhyav?sin?, refers to a six-handed goddess; the devi did not approve of the innovation. A more favourable divine reception awaited the potter who first mixed up the colours in the dark when trying to finish the Chatterjis' Durg? late one night. The head of the household, at first dismayed, later dreamed that the goddess was pleased with her unusual blue complexion and, ever afterwards, she has been a nil (blue) Durg? (she is mentioned ear lier in this essay, in connection with the rice-paste effigy sacrificed to her every year in Krisnanagar); conversation with Amit?bh R?y, September 2006. 82 Chatterjee's provocative remarks on the mangalk?byas as historical documents are made in "The Persianization of Iti h?sa: Performance Narratives and Mughal Political Culture in Eighteenth-Century Bengal," TheJournal of Asian Stud ies 6y, 2 (May 2008): 513-43. David McCutchion dates to 1810 the Vrind?van Candra temple at Guptip?r?; see Late Mediaeval Temples of Bengal: Origin and Classification (Calcutta: The Asiatic Society, 1972), 33. 291</page><page sequence="34">with the images he makes using a series of somatic metaphors, which I paraphrase here: "My skeleton is of bone, hers is bamboo; my veins and nerves are flesh, hers are formed of straw; the fluid in my body makes life possible just as the dampness of her earthen form makes it feasible as a temporary dwelling for the deity. " Yet the very porousness that allows the divine to enter a terra cruda body is understood, in the Hindu ontological system, as full of peril. We have seen that demons and ghosts crowd about the yearly rituals, hoping for a share of the offerings, eager to thwart the aims of thep?jas patron and turn things in their own favour. In order to frighten them off, loud music and drums are played at crit ical junctures of the rite. While all manufactured bodies are attractive to roaming spirits, those of clay are particularly vulnerable. Besides the risk of demonic possession, the icon itself has garnered poten tially dangerous power during the period of the festival. Although clay sculptures in which the deity has been established may be kept for a year or even for many years, as long as a competent Brahmin performs their daily worship, more cautious patrons prefer to dismiss the divine presence and immerse the image immediately. Once the deity's mud body has been submerged in a deep, year-round water source, its purity is secure (fig. 20).83 In a recent paper, Glen Hayes considers metaphors used by the Sahajiy?s of mediaeval Bengal.84 Tantric mystics whose practice centred upon the love relationship between Krisna and his consort, these vernacular poets flourished from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century. In configuring their subjective experiences, the Sahajiy?s employed the imagery of the natural world around them. When within the body's microcosm they sought to reverse the unfolding of creation by travelling "upwards against the current," this psychic process was felt and expressed as a river journey. The erotic and eso teric language of the Sahajiy?s, as of their cousins the B?uls (a wandering syncretic sect of folk poets), takes in eastern India's riparian landscape, with its brimming lotus ponds and villages approached by stepped landings along the bank. In this watery world, where vast expanses of river lose themselves in mist and hard edges are difficult to find, the idea of a clump of earth coalescing into a divine body then dissolving into mud again seems appropriate. The disorienting confluence of atmosphere and topog raphy makes shipboard visions like Krisnacandra's dream and the elephant-devouring deity seen by the hero of the Candlmangal somehow plausible. The ubiquity of water and its permeable borders are reflected in the Dhaka potter's understanding of the clay deity-bodies and enemy-bodies he and his fellows make. Even the labile, sometimes confusing identity of the eighteenth-century goddess Jagad dh?tri, devised for singular, time-sensitive purposes and subsequently destroyed, is of a piece with other cultural products of the region. 83 I spoke often with Haripada P?l (b. 1943) when I was in Dhaka in 2002-2003 ; see also his conversations with Henry Glassie in Art and Life in Bangladesh (Bloomington, Ind. : Indiana University Press, 1997), 313-66. On the use of par ticular sounds to ward off demons, see M. M. Underhill, The Hindu Religious Year (Calcutta: Association Press, 1921), 45; and Ronald Inden, "Ritual, Authority, and Cyclic Time in Hindu Kingship," in Kingship and Authority in South Asia, ed. J. F. Richards (Madison, Wise. : University of Wisconsin, 1978), 50. Clay icons kept beyond the festive sea son are termed b?rom?sepratim? (twelve-month images); some, like Mrinmay? Durg? of Bisnnupur, may be fairly old. 84 Glen Hayes, "Contemporary Metaphor Theory and Alternative Views of Krishna and Radha in Vaishnava Sahajiya Tantric Traditions," paper presented at the Asiatic Society, Calcutta, in December 2007. June McDaniel addresses some of the same ideas in The Madness of the Saints: Ecstatic Religion in Bengal (Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1989), 75-76, 257. Although both authors confine their comments to vaimava material, I believe that many of the concepts apply equally to ?aktism in Bengal. 292</page><page sequence="35">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I first encountered Jagaddh?tr? in 2000, while on a Fulbright Regional Fellowship for India and Bangladesh. My investi gations into the Bengali p?j?s were further supported by the American Institute of Bangladesh Studies, the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the Asian Cultural Council, and a Zayed University research grant. Helpful and thoughtful people on the ground and in the academy aided me in shaping my conclusions, although any errors are, of course, my own. While there is not space to mention all those who so kindly assisted me, I am particularly indebted to Micaela Soar, James Robinson, and Andrew Topsfield in England; to David Curley, Glen Hayes, Gautam Vajracharya, Sthaneswar Timalsina, David Sanford, and Janine Henri in the U.S. ; to Nim?? Sanny?s? in Dhaka; to Debik? Gosv?m?, Reeta Bhattac?rya, Amit Dey, Subir Sarkar, and Bh?rat? Ray in Calcutta; to Saktibrata Sen of Guptip?r?; and, finally, to As?m?nanda Ray, Saum? scandra Ray, Kausik Ray, Satyendran?th Mandai, Gautam Bisv?s, and R?m in Krisnanagar. Robert Linrothe and Padma Kaimal offered valuable comments on my draft essay. The final version was already in press when I learned that Rachel McDermott had just published a piece on Jagaddh?tr? and her p?j? ("A Festival for Jagaddh?tr? and the Power of Local ized Religion in West Bengal," in Breaking Boundaries with the Goddess: New Directions in the Study of ??ktism, ed. CA. Humes and R. F. McDermott (New Delhi: Manohar, 2009), 201-22.1 look forward to reading Dr. McDermott's conclu sions. 293</page></plain_text>
