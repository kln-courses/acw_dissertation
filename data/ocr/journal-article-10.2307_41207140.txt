Reviewed by Marc Rosenberg Behind the dramatic techniques and so- cial ramifications of every scientific revolu- tion, one always finds a new conceptual framework. The physical revolution, which has put its stamp on our century, had as its basis new ways of thinking about time and space, energy and matter, objectivity and subjectivity. Similarly, the biological revo- lution, which is now in full swing, has many of its roots in the new concepts de- rived from the information sciences, from cybernetics and from systems theory. There is, however, still no single, all- embracing conceptual framework capable of organizing all the data with which biologists characteristically concern them- selves. It is to this lack that Susanne Langer claims to have addressed herself in the sec- ond volume of Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling. In this volume (which constitutes part O MARC ROSENBERG, a peripatetic student, is currently on the faculty of Indiana-Purdue University at Indianapolis, where he teaches courses in communication theory, popular cul- ture, and interdisciplinary studies. 522</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR four of a proposed six-part study), Dr. Lan- ger develops an expanded theory of in- stinct and attempts to demonstrate that all nonhuman behavior can be explained in purely instinctual terms, without recourse to the ethological anthropomorphizations to which she so strongly objects: "I hold that all animal behavior is instinctive, arising from organic sources as impulse seeking expression in motor action, and guided to direct or indirect consummation by acts of perception." And: "The litera- ture of ethology, though not yet old, is already large, and has established a lan- guage of its own embodying highly anthro- pomorphic concepts which go unchallenged because they are brought in as part of the jargon rather than as explicit assumptions with recognized and accepted implications." Much of this study is, therefore, devoted to a reinterpretation of the ethological data in an attempt to free it from anthropo- morphism and bring it into conformity with Dr. Langer's instinct theory. Thus, for example, "The emotional feeling expressed in the cowering posture" is not an example of social communication (according to Dr. Langer, animals do not engage in commu- nication, and the concept of an animal society is a "na√Øve anthropomorphism") but "may be viewed, hypothetically, as des- peration, being overwhelmed by circum- stances"; and "The intensity of emotion which pervades such a spontaneous gesture of giving up the struggle runs through every quiver, every erecting feather or hair on the loser's skin, and in a mammal through every sweat gland exuding the smell of terror. In this extremity the pre- sumptive destroyer suddenly suffers an em- pathie pseudo-identification with his vic- tim and, for the instant, cannot strike." One can see in this example the na- ture of the conceptual gulf separating Dr. Langer from the ethologists. While they are mainly concerned with the gesture it- self as part of an intraspecific communica- tion system, Dr. Langer is concerned with the "emotional feeling" expressed in the gesture. While they are concerned with the effects of one animal's behavior on another, Dr. Langer seeks the cause of those effects in "empathie pseudo-identification." For a philosophy of mind in which the concept of feeling ("anything that can be felt") plays a prominent part, it may be appropriate to substitute an intrapsychic anthropomorphism for a social one. But such a substitution merely shifts the an- thropomorphism from an observable (so- cial) level of organization to one that must remain unobservable and therefore hypothetical. It is doubtful that such a shift will be of any benefit to those who must concern themselves with the observa- tion and systematization of animal be- havior. Any book that attempts a radical revi- sion of a currently accepted conceptual framework owes it to itself and to its sub- ject matter to deal with the best thinking that has occurred within that framework. To do otherwise results in a vitiation of the critique of the old framework and renders any new conceptualization unconvincing. And often, it seems that Dr. Langer has been so anxious to beat her favorite straw men that she has blinded herself to rele- vant and powerful ideas. Thus, she can say that "in the jargon of today's psychology 'information' means any influence of any- thing on anything" and totally ignore the very useful distinctions that have been made between energy and information. In speaking of schizophrenia, she refers to the " 'word salad,' which sounds like conver- sation but really contains no comprehensi- ble statements." Such an assertion, in view of the very important research in schizo- phrenic communication conducted by Greg- ory Bateson, Don Jackson, R. D. Laing and others, must be regarded as nonsense. To the misconceptions must be added the omissions. Admittedly, no amount of research and synthesis can hope to deal with all the relevant data in our very rich informational environment. Yet there are contemporary scholars and events of such importance that one must wonder at their absence from this very lengthy and exhaus- tively documented study. Gregory Bateson and Arthur Koestler have concerned them- selves for years with issues directly relevant to Dr. Langer's thesis. Yet she completely 524</page><page sequence="3">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR ignores them. Surely one would expect that any discussion of biological thinking would have to deal with Ludwig von Bertalanffy and the general system theorists. But they are treated only en passant. The same is true of Chomsky and Piaget, certainly cen- tral figures in any speculation on the nature of mind. Despite the very exciting current research being carried on in biofeedback control, Dr. Langer can speak placidly of "autonomie activity." And one must won- der if any theory of mental processes can be complete without at least some refer- ence to the effects of the psychedelic drugs. The questions raised by Dr. Langer are often interesting and important. But she has neither answered them nor formulated them so that they might be answered. The biological revolution is perhaps the most important event to occur in our time. But the task of organizing its data within a coherent conceptual framework has still to be done.</page></plain_text>
