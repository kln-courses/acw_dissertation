<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Metaphysical Cut: Darwin and Stevenson on Vivisection CHRIS DANTA t [Wjhoever refuses to recognize himself in the ape, becomes one: to paraphrase Pascal, qui fait l'homme, fait le singe. [He who acts the man, acts the ape.] - Giorgio Agamben, The Open: Man and Animal I. VIVISECTION AND ANIMAL LIFE "For anyone undertaking a genealogical study of the concept of 'life' in our culture," writes Giorgio Agamben, "one of the first and most instructive obser- vations to be made is that the concept never gets defined as such" (13). I can think of no better way of illustrating the ambiguity of the concept of "life" in our culture than by pointing to the term "vivisection," which derives from the Latin words vivus ("living") andsectio ("cutting"). The Oxford English Dictionary defines vivisection as "the action of cutting or dissecting some part of a living organism; spec, the action or practice of performing dissection, or other painful experiment, upon living animals as a method of physiological or pathologi- cal study" ("Vivisection," def. ia).To vivisect is, in the broadest sense, to cut into life by dissecting some part of a living organism. Vivisection requires one to make not just a physical cut but also a metaphysical cut. At stake is the concept of life itself. Apparent in the debates about vivisection that raged in Victorian England in the 1870s and 1880s is the reluctance, especially on the part of the pro- vivisectionists, to contemplate the metaphysics of the topic. Those scientists who supported the practice tended to treat vivisection as a means to break life down into its component parts rather than to conceptualize it. The British physician and medical biographer Samuel Wilks illustrates this materialist ten- dency in an 1 88 1 symposium on vivisection that appeared in the Nineteenth Century. Immediately after the Seventh International Congress of Medicine in London, Wilks wrote, Whether it be a question of the nature of the rocks beneath us, or the composition of the ocean, or of vegetable life or of animal life, the method of inquiry is the same. The rocks are broken and put in the crucible, the water is submitted to analysis, the plant is dissected, and, in order to ascertain the laws which govern its 51</page><page sequence="2">Victorian review ^ Volume 36 Number 2 growth and propagation, experiments are made by grafting and by cross fertilisation. In animal life the same method must be adopted to unlock the secrets of nature. The question of the animal being sensitive cannot alter the mode of investigation. (947) The approach to nature advocated here is summed up by the old Roman adage "divide and conquer." The ambiguity of the concept of life is overcome through an act of brute scientific force. Not satisfied to figure science as the forceful capture of nature, Wilks clinches his point in a threatening tone: "It is, therefore, sheer folly and ignorance," he writes, "to stand in the path [of vivisectionists] and forbid any one walking in the one right direction; it can- not be done" (947). Wilks s article is also instructive in the way it tries to reduce the animate to the status of the inanimate. For Wilks, what goes for rocks and water also goes for plants and animals. The fact that animals suffer at the hand of the vivisectionist does not call into question the rectitude of the scientific method. No justification is given for this claim. Nor, for that matter, does Wilks attempt to explain what he means by "animal life." Instead, he grants science the right to treat "animal life" as if it were inanimate nature. What enables him to rel- egate the animal to the status of the insensible is the decision to separate the human from the animal. From this point of view, the pro-vivisectionist fails to take existential responsibility for the animal life within him- or herself. As Agamben notes, It is possible to oppose man to other living things, and at the same time to organize the complex - and not always edifying - economy of relations between men and animals, only because something like an animal life has been separated within man, only because his distance and proximity to the animal have been measured and recognized first of all in the closest and most intimate place. (iS- 16) In this essay, I want to examine how the metaphysical relation between vivi- section and animal life plays out in the work of two popular Victorian writers, Charles Darwin and Robert Louis Stevenson. Darwin was perhaps the most prominent supporter of vivisection in Victorian England, as well as a sometime metaphysician of animal life. Stevenson, while never numbering himself among the opponents of the practice, occasionally indicted vivisection from a literary or existentialist perspective. My aim in pairing these two authors is to show how Stevenson uses literature to critique Darwin by drawing out the meta- physical implications of the latter s position on vivisection. Darwin once wrote memorably in his private notebooks, "He who understands baboon &lt;will&gt; would do more towards metaphysics than Locke" (Charles Darwins Notebooks 53 9). The question, of course, is how best to understand the baboon? In his post- humously published fable "The Scientific Ape" (2005), which I discuss at the 52</page><page sequence="3">CHRIS DANTA: The Metaphysical Cut end of my essay, Stevenson turns Darwin s evolutionary appeal to the similarity of animal and human life into a post-Darwinian nightmare by imagining an ape with metaphysical pretensions seeking to advance the cultural status of his species by vivisecting human beings. What Stevenson s literary intervention into the vivisection debate helps us to see, I will suggest, is that vivisection is a metaphysical cut by which the scientific experimenter tries to disavow his or her relation to the rest of animal life. II. DARWIN AND THE DREAM OF THE ANAESTHETIC BODY Although an ardent supporter of vivisection, Darwin was known not only to care deeply about animals but also, on occasion, to intervene vigorously on behalf of those he saw being mistreated. His son, Francis Darwin, recounts two such episodes in The Life and Letters: "[My father] returned one day from his walk pale and faint from having seen a horse ill-used, and from the agitation of violently remonstrating with the man. On another occasion he saw a horse- breaker teaching his son to ride, the little boy was frightened and the man was rough; my father stopped, and jumping out of the carriage reproved the man in no measured terms" (200). Darwin also expressed horror at his own experiments on pigeons: "I love them to the extent that I cannot bear to skin &amp; skeletonise them. I have done the black deed and murdered an angelic little Fan-tail Pointer at 10 days old" (qtd. in Preece 411). In 1871, he corresponded with the Oxford zoologist E. Ray Lankester: "You ask my opinion on vivisec- tion. I quite agree that it is justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject that makes me sick with horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not sleep tonight" (Life and Letters 200) . Despite these heartfelt reservations about inflicting suffering on other animals, in 1875, Darwin reluctantly joined Thomas Huxley's scientific lobby against the legislative efforts of antivivisectionists, feeling that the potential benefits of the fledgling science of physiology outweighed his personal repugnance toward it (Ritvo 630). Rod Preece neatly summarizes Darwin s attitude to vivisection: "Animals mattered, knowledge mattered far more" (41 1 ) . Both these attitudes of Darwin s emerge clearly in a letter he wrote to his daughter Henrietta Litchfield on 4 January 1875: Your letter has led me to think over vivisection (I wish some new word like anaes-section could be invented) for some hours, and I will jot down my conclusions, which will appear very unsatisfactory to you. I have long thought physiology one of the greatest of sciences, sure sooner, or more probably later, greatly to benefit mankind; but, judging from all other sciences, the benefits will accrue only indirectly in the search for abstract truth. It is certain that physiology can progress only by experiments on living animals. (Life and Letters 202) S 3</page><page sequence="4">Victorian review ^ Volume 36 Number 2 Perhaps the most interesting thing about this letter is the parenthetical desire Darwin expresses in it for "some new word like anaes-section." In an article that would later come to Darwin s attention, Burt G. Wilder of Cornell University reiterates this call for a more nuanced vocabulary in relation to experimenta- tion on living animals: Is it not time for the distinct verbal recognition of the difference between painful and painless experimentation upon animals? All well-informed persons are aware that the vast majority of vivisections, in this country at least, are performed under the influence of anaesthetics; but the enthusiastic zo√∂laters [worshippers of animals], who desire to abolish the objective method of teaching physiology, practically ignore this fact, and dwell chiefly upon the comparatively infrequent operations which are attended with pain. (210) The right choice of word - whether it be "anaes-section" or "callisection" (from the Latin callus meaning "hard skin") - here seems secondary to the dream of the anaesthetic body, the medical fantasy that both Darwin and Wilder entertain of the experimental animal body that is somehow free from operative pain. I call it a dream or a fantasy in the first place because, given the unsophisticated state of the art at this time, an anaesthetized animal would not necessarily have been free from pain. As Stewart Richards notes, "Genuine volatile anaesthetics, such as ether and chloroform (both in use since the 1840s) were applied only by means of a sponge soaked in the liquid, while other materials, such as opium and its derivatives, were narcotic agents rather than true anaesthetics; in any case, the degree of insensibility could have been assessed only by wilfully inflicting pain and observing reactions" (136). But there is another reason to speak of vivisection in terms of the dream of the anaesthetic body. As I have already suggested, it is possible to see the vivisectionist s knife as producing a metaphysical cut. In the words of John Ruskin, who resigned his Slade Chair of Fine Art at Oxford in 1885 over the prospect of physiological research being conducted at the university, the vivi- sectionists knife cuts "the great link which [binds] together the whole of creation, from its Maker to the lowest creature" (qtd. in Mayer 412). In this schema, vivisection confers a metaphysical power upon the human vivisec- tionist to decide upon what is properly human and what is properly animal. As Agamben notes in The Open: Ontology, or first philosophy, is not an innocuous academic discipline, but in every sense the fundamental operation in which anthropogenesis, the becoming human of the living being, is realized. From the beginning, metaphysics is taken up in this strategy: it concerns precisely that meta that completes and preserves the overcoming of the animal physis in the direction of S 4</page><page sequence="5">CHRIS DANTA: The Metaphysical Cut human history. . . . Man suspends his animality and, in this way, opens a "free and empty zone" in which life is captured and a-bandoned [ab-bandonata] in a zone of exception. (79) Vivisection, as I am presenting it, constitutes a quite spectacular staging of this "zone of exception": a forceful turning of animal means into human ends. Insofar as it humanizes the animal (by allowing the animal to enter into human history), the act of vivisection expresses the capture of animal being that proves essential not only to the advance of human science but also to the constitution of human being. Vivisection politicizes the nonhuman animal by invoking a type of cruelty that is not just physical but metaphysical. In Britain, the Cruelty to Animals Act of 1876 mandated government surveillance of animal experiments by granting annually renewed licences to experimenters. The act legislated the use of anaesthetics in vivisection, but also permitted holders of special cer- tificates to perform a restricted number of experiments without anaesthesia (Certificate A) or to allow a certain number of experimental animals to recover from anaesthesia, thereby introducing the possibility of post-operative pain (Certificate B).The act disappointed the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (rspca), since it did not specifically prohibit any research activities and had the effect of removing vivisection from the public gaze. The prominent antivivisectionist Frances Power Cobbe saw the bill as a victory for the scientists; it did not protect "vivisected animals from torture," she argued, "but vivisectors from prosecution under Martin s act" (qtd. in Turner 92). As we have seen, Darwin was already alert to potential problems involved in leg- islating vivisection. In the above-mentioned letter to his daughter, he wrote, "I would gladly punish severely any one who operated on an animal not rendered insensible, if the experiment made this possible," he writes, "but here again I do not see that a magistrate or jury could possibly determine such a point. Therefore I conclude, if (as is likely) some experiments have been tried too often, or anaesthetics have not been used when they could have been, the cure must be in the improvement of humanitarian feelings" (Life and Letters 203). Rather than a Utopian or humanitarian hope, I would describe Darwin s desire for a painless act of vivisection as the ideological precondition for the practice. From a metaphysical standpoint, vivisection is already a form of anaes- section since, as I've been arguing, it has the effect of desensitizing human beings to the implications of animal suffering. The metaphysical vivisectionist dreams of the anaesthetic body in order to turn animal suffering into a scien- tific rather than an existential problem - a matter of measurable degrees rather than the basis of a subjectivity we share with other animals. In a letter published in the Times on 18 April 1881, Darwin responded to a request from a Swedish physiologist, Professor Frithiof Holmgren, of Upsala, to express his opinion on scientific experiments on living animals. Vivisection was being hody debated in the Swedish parliament at the time. Although the 55</page><page sequence="6">Victorian review ^ Volume 36 Number 2 debate ostensibly centred on the question of cruelty to animals, at stake for some were religious scruples in the era of modern scientific progress. In his carefully measured response to Holmgren, Darwin tries to re-establish trust in modern scientific research: What improvements in medical practice may be directly attributed to physiological research is a question which can be properly discussed only by those physiologists and medical practitioners who have studied the history of their subjects; but, as far as I can learn, the benefits are already great. However this may be, no one, unless he is grossly ignorant of what science has done for mankind, can entertain any doubt of the incalculable benefits which will hereafter be derived from physiology, not only by man, but by the lower animals. Look, for instance, at Pasteur s results of modifying the germs of the most malignant diseases, from which so it happens, animals will in the first place, receive more relief than man. (10) This letter reinforces Preece s observation that for Darwin "animals mattered, knowledge mattered far more." More importantly for my purposes, it also becomes a direct spur for Stevenson s writing about vivisection. The point that animals will receive more benefit from vivisection than human beings captured Stevenson s literary imagination. As we shall see, for the satirically minded Stevenson, this statement constitutes hypocrisy and is thus ripe for the literary picking. III. STEVENSON ON VIVISECTION: A PHILOSOPHICAL pantomime "One cannot be a novelist and not like dogs," writes Stevenson in his typically playful contribution to the French dramatist and author Georges Docquoiss edited collection B√™tes et Gens de Lettres [Animals and People of Letters] ( 1895). "There must be others who prefer crocodiles," he continues in a piece he composed in Samoa in late May 1892. "No doubt it is a matter of circumstance and char- acter" (Booth and Mehew 7: 290). Like Darwin, Stevenson was something of an animal advocate. According to his biographer Graham Balfour, he "hated cruelty of any kind" - and, on at least two occasions, circumstance and char- acter led him to intervene on behalf of dogs that were being treated cruelly. As Balfour recounts in his biography, one Sunday evening toward the end of his life, Stevenson came across a crowd of locals watching a dogfight in Apia, Samoa. Without thinking, the Scottish writer plunged into the midst of the crowd and stopped the fight, exclaiming in the only Samoan he could remem- ber, "Cowards, cowards!" In an earlier incident that took place in Pitlochry, Scotland, Stevenson interfered when he saw a dog being mistreated, berating the offender with a much more metaphysical statement: "It's not your dog. . . . Its Gods dog, and I'm here to protect it" (183). ¬£6</page><page sequence="7">CHRIS DANTA: The Metaphysical Cut Given these passionate exhibitions of the novelist s sympathy for other ani- mals, it is somewhat surprising to discover that Stevenson never wholeheartedly opposed vivisection. Frances Power Cobbe wrote to him in February 1884, praising his recently published essay "The Character of Dogs" and asking him to contribute an antivivisection piece to her journal, The Zoophilist. Stevenson no doubt disappointed Cobbe when he replied to her by avowing his support for a heavily regulated type of vivisection. "Yes, I am anti-vivisection," he writes, but at the risk of falling in your esteem, I would willingly permit to serious doctors, who had, as a first step argued their point before some impartial commission - only, how to compose that - the right to make experiments of any sort ad hoc. I would not willingly put sticks in the wheels of a man like Pasteur. I am even quite ready to give him, once he has named the point he wishes to settle and convinced impartial people of its importance and likelihood, dogs, cats, lions, men and women: and by preference, men and women: not children and other dumb brutes. As for the sanguinary and impudent imposture of free vivisection, I am ready, if I can, to do all in my power against it. (Booth and Mehew 4: 244) While Stevenson's stance toward vivisection is politically conservative, it is nevertheless philosophically radical. To see that the Scottish writer indicts the practice of vivisection with a literary-philosophical - rather than political - eye, we need look no further than his contribution to Docquois's book: "For a long time science had to proclaim loudly the similarity of animal life," he writes. "But science has to mind both its goats and its cabbages. The goat is truth; the cabbages, vivisection. Thus we have the extraordinary sight - enough to make our great-nephews laugh - of a scientist who today tells us that animals don't suffer, and tomorrow bores us stiff with a vast tome on the temperature/ feeling of pain, as studied in animals!" (Booth and Mehew 7: 291). While Stevenson here uses vivisection in the literal or narrow sense of the word, he also means it to be understood more figuratively or metaphysically as a sign of humans' hypocritical tendency to deny their similarity to other animals. For Stevenson, literature tends naturally to affirm the metaphysical connec- tion between humans and animals, whereas the vivisectionist's commitment to science requires him to sever his ontological ties with the rest of the animal kingdom. Ray Lankester tried to deny this aspect of vivisection by arguing that there "is no lack of sympathy with the probable sufferings of animals experi- mented upon in the mind of the physiologist . . . and the mutual suffering of both vivisector and vivisected becomes a sacrifice offered upon the altar of science" (qtd. in Mayer 409). Without wanting to deny the capacity of indi- vidual physiologists to suffer along with the animals they experiment upon, one finds it hard to see how the vivisectionist and vivisected are equal sacrifices offered upon the altar of science. Surely the act of vivisection generates a sense of pathos because of the asymmetrical power engendered between human 57</page><page sequence="8">Victorian review ^ Volume 36 Number 2 and nonhuman animal in which the nonhuman animal becomes the "sacri- ficial" victim of the human scientist? Indeed, "sacrifice" is a term scientific experimenters used to describe an animal that dies as a result of laboratory research. The French physiologist Claude Bernard (1813-78) seemed to cap- ture Stevenson s attitude toward vivisection when he insisted in his seminal Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine ( 186^) that "a physiologist no longer hears the cry of animals, he no longer sees the blood that flows, he sees only ideas and perceives only organisms, concealing problems which he intends to solve" (qtd. in Richards 140). Stevenson shies away from depicting in any detail experiments upon living animals, choosing to present them as a kind of philosophical pantomime in which humans hypocritically deny their similarity to other animals. He treats vivisection less as a discrete scientific practice and more as a metaphysical expression of human identity whose founding gesture is the exclusion of the animal from the realm of the metaphysical. In "The Character of Dogs," he sarcastically refers to those who are "very fond of dogs 'but in their proper place'; who say 'poo' fellow, poo' fellow,' and are themselves far poorer; who whet the knife of the vivisectionist or heat his oven" (Memories and Portraits 93). To clarify his metaphysical point, he inverts the Cartesian theory of the ani- mal as automata medianica by applying it to humans: "An automaton [the dog] certainly is; a machine working independently of his control, the heart like the mill-wheel, keeping all in motion, and the consciousness, like a person shut in the mill garret, enjoying the view out the window and shaken by the thunder of the stones; an automaton in one corner of which a living spirit is confined; an automaton like man" (93). Stevenson likens human and animal not just physically but metaphysically. In so doing, he raises the question of the animality of human beings. According to Agamben in The Open, "It is more urgent ... to ask in what way - within man - has man separated himself from non-man, and the animal from the human, than it is to take positions on the great issues, on so-called human rights and values. And perhaps even the most luminous sphere of our relations with the divine depends, in some way, on that darker one which separates us from the animal" ( 16). Stevenson approaches the human-animal divide from a similarly existentialist and anti-instrumentalist perspective - he engages with science in general and vivisection in particular out of a desire to probe the "darker" sphere that separates us from the animal. In a telling entry from his notebooks of 1873-74, he writes, "Scientific men, who imagine that their science affords an answer to the problems of existence, are perhaps the most to be pitied of mankind; and contemned" (Memories and Portraits 17^, original emphasis) . The vivisectionist would surely top Stevenson's list of scientific men who provoke simultaneously our pity and our spite by imagining that "their science affords an answer to the problems of existence." Indeed, one may see Stevenson's scientific fable Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as, in part, a subtle comment upon vivisection. In this text, Jekyll cuts into his own "Hyde" as he tries to ¬£8</page><page sequence="9">CHRIS DANTA: The Metaphysical Cut test a theory of moral progressivism. Jekyll is a vivisectionist in the metaphysi- cal sense of the word that Stevenson develops, for, like the vivisectionist, he opportunistically disclaims the similarity of animal life and tries to separate the properly human self - the upright Henry Jekyll - from the more troglodytic, the more animal Hyde. One of the myriad ways to explain the hypocrisy of Jekylls enterprise would be to say that it disavows what he calls, in his "Full Statement of the Case," "the animal within me" (^8). Vivisection is problematic for Stevenson not simply because it disavows animal suffering. If it were only a matter of preventing animal suffering, then vivisection could be dealt with in ethical ways. Rather, what renders vivisection most problematic for Stevenson - and therefore a rich topic for the literary writer - is that it disavows "the animal within me," which is to say, it stops one from understanding oneself as an animal. By first telling us that animals do not suffer and then treating the pain of the animal as a scientific finding rather than a metaphysical given, Stevensons hypothetical vivisectionist prevents us from identifying with nonhuman animals on the basis of a shared capacity for pain - on the basis, that is, of Jeremy Bentham s famous reorientation of the human-animal relation: "The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk?, but Can they suffer?" (282-83, original emphasis). According to Jacques Derrida, in The Animal That Therefore I Am, "'Can they suffer?' amounts to asking 'Can they not be able ?' And what of this inability [impouvoir] ? What of the vulnerability felt on the basis of this inability?" (28, original emphasis). What inspires Stevenson to recommend "men and women" before "children and other dumb brutes" for vivisection in his letter to Frances Power Cobbe is this vulnerability that animals can be understood to feel in the face of the scientific power of human beings. Through his writings on vivisection, Stevenson expresses an ambivalence toward scientific progress. Insofar as vivisection sacrifices the nonhuman animal on the altar - or the operating table - of progress, it stages a con- flict between two apparently incompatible orders of knowledge: one ancient, the other modern. By advocating scientific progress through physiological experimentation on living creatures, the vivisectionist subjugates an intuitive, pre -scientific and, I would argue, novelistic type of understanding - one that Stevenson expresses well when he writes to Docquois, "A dog and I understand each other on sight; and when I am on horseback, I feel what goes on deep inside my mount" (Booth and Mehew 7: 290). "One cannot be a novelist and not like dogs," insists Stevenson. And yet, as Claude Bernard is honest enough to admit, one cannot be a vivisectionist and feel affection for them. Take the well-known example of Louis Pasteur: to discover the infectious nature of rabies, a disease transmitted to humans by dog bite, Pasteur injected a number of healthy animals with matter taken from infected animals and then watched the formerly healthy subjects die painful deaths (Ritvo 629). Here, the pursuit of scientific knowledge blinds the vivisectionist not only to the suffering of the other animal but also to the metaphysical implications of this suffering. 59</page><page sequence="10">Victorian review ^ Volume 36 Number 2 IV. "the scientific ape": BABOON METAPHYSICS AND THE POST- DARWINIAN FABLE For Stevenson, then, scientific progress is anaesthetic in the sense that it desensitizes us to the existential possibilities of animal suffering. The nov- elist is to the aesthetic, to sensation, as the vivisectionist is to the anaes- thetic, to the lack of sensation. We can better grasp this point by turning to "The Scientific Ape" - a work with a most unusual publishing history. Even though Stevenson seems to have intended to include the piece in his Fables (the manuscript in the Beineke Library Collection at Yale University is numbered 22-2^), it was left out of the first edition of this work and instead was published posthumously, in 189^, in two installments, in the August and September issues of Longmans Magazine. The story appeared in French translation - in a 198^ edition of the fables - before Ralph Parfect published it in his 200 5 article "Robert Louis Stevenson s 'The Clockmaker' and 'The Scientific Ape': Two Unpublished Fables." The fables precise date of composition is unknown. Stevenson may have begun working on the fables as early as 1874, since he wrote to Sidney Colvin in that year, "I have done no more to my Fables.... I am constant to my schemes; but I must work at them fitfully as the humour moves" (qtd. in Swearingen 1^). Roger Swearingen speculates that Stevenson worked "fitfully" on Fables over the course of twenty years and only completed the final versions of them in 1 893-94. For his part, Parfect hazards a guess that "The Scientific Ape" was written toward the end of thei88os, roughly contemporaneously with "The Ethics of Crime," an essay that defends the primacy of moral law in times of political duress (Stevenson, Ethical Studies 38-39). I contend that Stevenson wrote the piece after Darwin s letter of 18 April 1881 to the Times - and therefore sooner rather than later in the decade. A brief summary of Stevenson s text will show how it engages ironically with Darwin's. "The Scientific Ape" is a third-person narrative about an ape that manages to escape "with only a trifling lesion of one foot" from the cage of a vivisectionist working in the West Indies (Parfect 401). Upon returning to his "clan of anthropoid apes" (401), Stevensons protagonist dubs himself a doctor and urges his fellows to practise vivisection as a way of becoming pro- gressive. "Man is only a promoted ape," he avers. "I believe we shall astonish everyone. Man lost centuries over religion, morals, poetry, and other fudge; it was centuries before he got properly to science, and only the other day that he began to vivisect. We shall go the other way about, and begin with vivisection" (401 ) . After abducting the vivisectionist s baby from its nursery bassinette as a subject for his own experiments, the ape-doctor is eventually forced to return it by the chief of his society, who proclaims: "'Great cocoanuts! ... is this a nightmare? Can apes descend to such barbarity? Take back that baby where it came from'" (402). The story ends by recognizing the sinister continuity of human scientific violence against nonhuman animals: "So they took the baby to the front garden plot. The vivisectionist (who was an estimable family man) 60</page><page sequence="11">CHRIS DANTA: The Metaphysical Cut was overjoyed, and in the lightness of his heart, began three more experiments in his laboratory before the day was done" (402). "A comical story of an ape touches us quite differently after the proposi- tion of Mr. Darwin s theory," writes Stevenson, as a twenty-three-year-old law student and neophyte author, in his June 1874 review of Lord Lyttons Fables in Song (Essays Literary and Critical 140) . In a fascinating but inchoate series of reflec- tions that opens this essay (published in the Fortnightly Review), Stevenson tries to take account of a shift that has occurred in the form of the fable since Darwin: In the most typical form some moral precept is set forth by means of a conception purely fantastic. . . . Such is the great mass of the old stories of wise animals or foolish men that have amused our childhood.. . . [T]he point of the thing lay in a sort of humorous inappropriateness; and it is natural enough that pleasantry of this description should become less common, as men learn to suspect some serious analogy underneath. ( 140) In the traditional form of the fable, as practised by Aesop or La Fontaine, there is a humorous inappropriateness to the comparison between humans and animals, so that the reader immediately recognizes the animals in these stories as thinly veiled masks for particular human characteristics and qualities. "We know the history of fabulization and how it remains an anthropomorphic taming, a moralizing subjection, a domestication," writes Derrida. "Always a discourse of man, on man, indeed on the animality of man, but for and in man" (37, original emphasis). In light of the "serious analogy" proposed by Darwin, however, it becomes harder to see the fabulous animal - and espe- cially the speaking ape - merely as an emblem of an isolated human character trait. The post-Darwinian fable thus becomes characterized by the feeling of ontological uncertainty. As Marian Scholtmeijer notes, "In a post-Darwinian world, all stories are stories about apes told by other apes - or at least primates" (139, original emphasis). Or in the words of my epigraph, "whoever refuses to recognize himself in the ape, becomes one" (Agamben 27). For Stevenson, the post-Darwinian fable begins "to take rank with all other forms of creative literature" when it "ceases to be possible to append [the moral of the fable] ... to the bottom of the piece . . . without the loss of everything that is deepest and most suggestive about it" (Essays Literary and Critical 140) . It is interesting to note in this regard that he originally gave the tide Aesop in the Fog to the manuscript of Fables. Stevensons modernist - or, should we say, existentialist? - fable thus operates on the basis of "an aesthetics of ambigu- ity" (D√∂lvers 93). It deals with a world in which "a man is no longer the dupe of his own artifice, and cannot deal playfully with truths that are a matter of bitter concern for him in his life" (Essays Literary and Critical 140). I would argue that "The Scientific Ape" justifies its place alongside the other published fables for the darkly comic way it captures the ontological uncertainty of the post-Darwinian world. The piece is what Frank Palmeri has recently called 6 i</page><page sequence="12">Victorian review ^ Volume 36 Number 2 an "autocritical fable" - a fable that offers "a critique of human behavior and attitudes towards animals, including anthropomorphism, from within the anthropomorphic form of the fable" (84). The moral of the fable is that the act of vivisection incapacitates - or anaes- thetizes - ethical thinking by disavowing the similarity of animal life. Stevenson thus uses the form of the fable to insist upon the intrinsic animality of human beings. He makes his ape-vivisectionist in the image of Darwin, but only to parody the latter s views of the practice. Our self-taught ape-doctor is thus fully convinced of the point Darwin makes in his letter to the Times that "incalculable benefits . . . will hereafter be derived from physiology, not only by man, but by the lower animals" (10). In Stevensons story, after one of his fellow apes complains that vivisection will inevitably produce suffering, the scientific ape replies, as if he has read Darwin s letter, "√å am much of your thinking . . . and indeed that argument is only fit for the monthly magazines. Say that they do suffer. Well, they suffer in the interest of a lower race, which requires help: there can be nothing fairer than that. And besides we shall doubtless make discoveries which will prove useful to themselves'" (Parfect 402). Here, we notice Stevenson trying to have his cake and eat it too - his ape simultaneously champions and undercuts Darwin s belief in the potential benefits of vivisection for the so-called lower animals. By so aggressively appropriating the dream of the anaesthetic body, the ape-doctor hopes to mitigate the difference between the higher and the lower species that this dream establishes. Not satisfied to have escaped relatively unscathed from the vivisectionist s laboratory, he also seeks to evade the "anthropomorphic taming" that is the form of the fable. "The Scientific Ape" is the forerunner of another darkly comic story of an ape: Franz Kafka s "A Report to an Academy." There are numerous illuminating parallels between these two post-Darwinian fables. Like Stevenson s scientific ape, the ape-protagonist of Kafka s story, Red Peter, is the victim of human vio- lence: he was attacked and captured as he drank with a troop of apes at a water- ing hole in the Gold Coast during a hunting expedition run by the company of the famous German animal trader, Carl Hagenbeck. Like the scientific ape, Red Peter ends up a wounded animal: he is struck twice in the attack - once in the cheek ("a slight wound; but it left a large, naked, red scar which earned me the name of Red Peter") and once in the groin ("a severe wound ... the cause of my limping a little to this day") (Basic Kafka 246-47). Both scientific apes respond to their violent brushes with humanity by becoming human. Red Peter comes to address the scientific academy because, as he says, "With an effort which up till now has never been repeated [by any other nonhuman animal] I managed to reach the cultural level of an average European" (2^4). Both apes confront the scientific community with a darkly materialist mes- sage: being human has got nothing to do with "religion, morals, poetry, and other fudge" (Parfect 401) and everything to do with the sacrifice - or the metaphysical arrest - of "the animal within me" (Jekyil and Hyde ^8) . For Kafka s 62</page><page sequence="13">Chris danta: The Metaphysical Cut ape, becoming human means learning how to imbibe schnapps or shake hands or say "Hallo!" For Stevenson s ape, it means learning how to vivisect - how to dream of the anaesthetic body. Of course, the glaring irony in Stevenson's story is that the scientific ape is proposing to vivisect the human baby without the use of anaesthetics. But this irony is not being restricted to the charac- ter of the ape-doctor. We should not forget that the person being indicted here is the human vivisectionist ("who was an estimable family man"). Both "The Scientific Ape" and "A Report to an Academy" convey the same point: that human beings have no right to separate themselves metaphysically from other animals. In each, the consequence of a supreme - and fantastic - act of ontological mimicry is taxonomical indeterminacy. As Stevenson s budding vivisectionist puts it, "Man is only a promoted ape" (Parfect 401 ) . As Red Peter reports to his colleagues at the academy (who may or may not be other apes), "your life as apes, gentlemen, insofar as something of that kind lies behind you, cannot be further removed from you than mine is from me" (246). Stevenson wrote to Henry James on 29 December 1890: "Darwin said no one could observe without a theory; I suppose he was right, 'tis a fine point of metaphysic" (Booth and Mehew 7: 66). I have been arguing in this paper that, just as one cannot observe without a theory, neither can one vivisect without a theory. The idea inspiring the scientific ape in Stevenson's story is the Darwinian belief that nonhuman animals matter, but knowledge (specifi- cally, knowledge realized through the physiologist's dream of the anaesthetic body) matters more. From this point of view, the fable's key moment comes near the end, when the chief of the ape clan disabuses his charge of this idea: "'I do not know if I have a scientific mind or not,"' says the chief, "'but I have a very thick stick, and if you lay one claw upon that baby, I will break your head with it'" (Parfect 403). Apart from practising some physical humour, the ape-chief here does something very serious: namely, he restores the realm of the aesthetic - of sensation - as the basis for ethical and existential thinking. The ape-chief would no doubt subscribe to something Kafka wrote in his Diaries on i February 1922: "Looked at with a primitive eye, the real, incontestable truth, a truth marred by no external circumstance (martyrdom, sacrifice of oneself for the sake of another), is only physical pain" (410). What Stevenson realizes in his review of Lord Lytton's Fables in Song is that, after Darwin, the fable becomes the literary venue to reassert the similarity of animal life. What he realizes with "The Scientific Ape," more specifically, is that the fable may be used to re-sensitize us to the body of the animal as a properly aesthetic source. Where he differs from Kafka is by casting a chiefly philosophic - rather than excoriating - eye upon existentially fraught acts of human behaviour such as vivisection. In this sense, his fable "The Scientific Ape" reduces to a quite metaphysical cliche: the first cut is the deepest. 63</page><page sequence="14">Victorian review ^ Volume 36 Number 2 Acknowledgements I would like to thank Dennis Denisoff, Morgan Holmes, Paul Sheehan, and Julian Murphet for their helpful remarks on earlier drafts of this essay.
