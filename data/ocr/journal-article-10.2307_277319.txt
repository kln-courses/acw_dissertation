<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ANTHROPOMORPHIC MAT FROM NEW MEXICO Several Southwestern archaeologists who have seen the mat pictured in Figure 136 consider it unusual enough to merit description in print, despite a scarcity of information about its provenience and associations. The mat has catalog number 943/7 in the collections of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum at Canyon, Texas. It was donated to the Museum by Henry Crain of Canyon in 1942. Mr. Crain informs me that he found the mat in a multiroomed cave about 1/2 mile above the mouth of Mule Creek, a tributary of the San Francisco River in the Mogollon Range of southwestern New Mexico, not far from Clifton, Arizona. He and several hunting companions removed the mat and other archaeological materials from the cave in 1899, when he was ranching in the Mogollon region. Other items included 2 small brown pottery bowls, 2 wooden bows 4 or 5 feet long, and a number of obsidian-tipped ar- rows. Smaller bows and poorly preserved arrows were left in the cave. Mr. Crain recalls that the cave was later investigated by someone from New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts at Las Cruces. The shape of the mat is shown in Figure 136. In its present headless condition the specimen is 17 inches long and 12 inches wide. According to Mr. Crain, the head was present when the mat was collected, and was a featureless rectangle somewhat wider than the neck, on which it was centered. Also missing are triangular areas at the outside of the left elbow, the outer corner of the right hand, and the bottom of the right foot. The mat is made of thin yucca strips from 2 to 4 mm. wide. The material is well preserved, retaining its color and flexibility. The mat is loosely twilled in a two-over, two-under technic, except in the lower body and right leg, where a three-over, three-under technic prevails. Strip ends on the back side are long and un- concealed. The mat retains no trace of painting or other decoration. JACK T. HUGHES Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum Canyon, Texas December, 1954 A FLUTED POINT SITE IN UTAH * The Statewide Archeological Survey of the Depart- ment of Anthropology at the University of Utah was recently informed of a site 12 miles east of Ferron, Utah, which has yielded at least one fluted point. Homer Behunin, the local collector who reported the site, found the point (Fig. 137 a) protruding from the wall of Silverhorn Wash about 15 feet below the surface. The Silverhorn Site (42EM8) proved, upon examina- tion, to be a shallow rock shelter in a protected bend of the wash. The shelter contains at least 12 occupation levels separated by sterile alluvial deposits. The upper- * The work herein reported was financed by the University of Utah Research Fund. most occupation level is covered by about 10 feet of hard, compact alluvium which reaches to within about a foot of the shelter roof. The occupation levels are easily detected through the presence of small pieces of charcoal which have been somewhat disturbed by the inundations which brought in the alluvial materials. In addition to charcoal, small burned areas or hearths, chips, bone fragments, and occasional artifacts are to be found. Limited testing by the author and a group of students failed to produce more fluted points but the bases of 2 blades (Fig. 137 b, c) were found. Silverhorn Wash is at the western edge of the San Raphael Swell. It is a short southern tributary of Ferron Creek which in turn is a southern tributary of the San Raphael River. A study of the wash made by Loren W. Slentz of the Department of Geology at the Uni- versity of Utah has brought out several significant facts. The canyon, at most 100 yards wide, and from 20 to 60 feet deep, was eroded into sandstone bedrock. The a ;55~ ~ ~ ?j!: C b FIG. 137. Silverhorn size.)

(Actual 412 [ XXI, 4,1956</page><page sequence="2">FACTS AND COMMENTS wash was then filled with laminated alluvium which at the site is about 30 feet thick. Subsequent to this filling the stream was rejuvenated and cut out most of the alluvial fill to a level about 10 feet above the bed- rock, where it again came to grade. Still later a second rejuvenation of the stream resulted in the cutting of the present channel which is about 20 feet wide and is to bedrock. The remnants of 2 terraces with a single fill are, therefore, to be found along the present intermit- tent stream. Slentz believes that the alluvial material in which the occupation levels are found was laid down as a flood plain deposit by frequent (yearly?) inunda- tions. The 5-foot thick section of fill in which the 12 known occupation levels are concentrated appears to have been deposited in a relatively short time, perhaps not over 50 years. At its mouth, about 1/4 mile down- stream from the site, the canyon broadens into a level area of several square miles which probably represents a fossil flood-plain lake. A lake at this point would have slowed or even backed up water coming down the wash; thus its presence could account for the smoothly laminated deposits at the site which must have been laid down by very slowly moving water. The deposits in the lake proper are even more uniform than those at the site and the bands can be followed for long dis- tances. The proximity of the lake would have made the rock shelter a desirable campsite in spite of the fact that it was occasionally subject to flooding. The fluted point from the site is 56.6 mm. long with a maximum width of 24.5 mm., at about the middle. It is of red jasper(?), is somewhat leafshaped, and has a concave base. The flutes are irregular and about half as wide at the point; one flute is half as long as the point, the other is three fourths as long. The 2 blade bases found during the limited excava- tion were separated vertically by about 2 feet. The exact stratigraphic relationship between the fluted point and the blade bases is not known except that the fluted point was found higher than at least the lower blade base. The upper blade base (Fig. 137 c) is of a brownish translucent chalcedony and apparently was originally almost triangular. The maximum width (26 mm.) is at the base.

The average thickness along the midline is 4 mm. The chipping is not uniform but there is a suggestion of ripple flaking. An interesting feature of this blade is that the basal edge has been beveled on one side with a narrow single flake extending almost all the way across while the opposite side shows a row of small flake scars. The lower specimen (Fig. 137 c) is of a purplish translucent chalcedony and shows chipping of about the same quality and type as that on the upper blade base. The lower blade fragment also has nearly straight sides and a maximum width of 25 mm. This width occurs where the blade is broken, 37 mm. from the base, and is probably close to the maximum width of the original blade. The minimum width of the blade fragment is 20 mm. and is at the basal edge. The average thickness along the midline is 5 mm. There is some fine retouching on the edges near the base and across the basal edge; perhaps intentional dulling. These 2 blade fragments resemble ones found with Fremont culture pottery on the surface of a site about 40 miles away. However, they more closely resemble blades found associated with Plainview-like points at sites in the Plains (Davis 1953; Sellards 1952: 72-4). Work at the site was abandoned only when the occupational debris thinned out and, for practical pur- poses, disappeared. No further work at the site is planned. DAVIS, E.

GUNNERSON University of Utah Salt Lake City, Utah December, 1954 ADDITIONAL DATA ON THE WOODRUFF OSSUARY, KANSAS The Woodruff ossuary (14PH4), a prehistoric com- munal burial site situated just south of the Nebraska line in Phillips County, Kansas, was excavated for the Smithsonian River Basin Surveys in the late summer and fall of 1946. In the report on this work (Kivett 1953) the findings were correlated with earlier observa- tions in Nebraska and the site was assigned to a recur- ring complex called the Keith focus. The Keith focus is but one of several variants--and perhaps an early one- of the widespread Woodland culture of the Cen- tral Plains. It is distinguished chiefly by the following: calcite-tempered pottery designated as Harlan Cord- Roughened; small to large stemmed and barbed projec- tile points, often serrated; small chipped celts; triangu- lar and crescentic shell pendants as grave offerings, along with great numbers of shell disc beads and bead blanks; perforated canine teeth and unperforated rodent teeth; incised tubular bone beads; and secondary burial of disarticulated bodies in communal pits. Keith focus remains as now known appear to occur mainly in western Kansas, south central Nebraska, and perhaps eastern Colorado. Their relationship to other Woodland manifestations remains obscure for want of stratigraphic evidence. It has long been recognized that Woodland remains of one kind or another represent probably the oldest ceramic tradition yet found in the Central Plains, since they seem to recur consistently at the bottom of stratigraphic sequences in which they and other pottery complexes are represented. When the Woodruff ossuary collections were received at the U.S. National Museum, it was found that they included a considerable quantity of charred wood. In addition to many small bits, there were large segments of timbers as much as 4 or 5 inches in diameter. All these were from varying depths in the communal burial pit from which were taken the skeletal remains and artifacts reported by Kivett. Since this carbonized mate- rial was collected in direct association with archaeo- logical and skeletal remains assignable to a defined pre- historic culture horizon, steps were taken to have the charcoal identified as to the species of trees represented, and then to have it tested for radiocarbon dates. The results of these examinations are here briefly discussed, together with some of their possible implications for Central Plains prehistory. For species identification, the 31 lots of carbonized wood were divided into 2 groups. One group was sub- mitted to the School of Forestry, Yale University; the other was sent to the Forest Products Laboratory, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Madison. For these identi- fications, we are indebted to B. Francis Kukachka, Forest Products Laboratory, and Paul B. Sears and William L. Stern, Yale University. Three species were identified, as follows: Ulmus rubra, slippery or red elm; Fraxinus pennsylvanicus lanceolata, green ash; and Pop- ulus sp., cottonwood. Samples of all the identified woods were placed in the national collections; and the rest of the ossuary wood, totaling some 40 ounces, was then sent to W. F. Libby, Institute of Nuclear Physics, University of Chicago, for radiocarbon analysis. Libby reports (letter to Wedel, May 5, 1954) the age of this material as 1343+ 240 years before present, that is, A.D. 611+240 years (or between A.D. 371 and 851). This dating is somewhat earlier than the estimates heretofore made for Plains Woodland materials, which were thought to have a time range somewhere between A.D. 800 and 1200 (see, for example, Wedel 1940: 303; Champe 1946: 85-9, Fig. 17; Lehmer 1954:141). If the Woodruff ossuary date is substantially correct, all these guess-dates are too late; and pottery making in the Central Plains may actually go back as much as 2 to 5 centuries earlier than most of us had supposed.
