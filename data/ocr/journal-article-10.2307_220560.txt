<plain_text><page sequence="1">AFRICAN VODUN: ART, PSYCHOLOGY, AND POWER. By Suzanne Preston Blier. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995. Pp. xi, 476; 165 illustrations. $50.00. Opening with a startling and mysterious human figure sculpture in wood hung with a strange assortment of diverse materials, made by the Fon in the former kingdom of Dahomey (now Republic of B6nin), the author intends to bring to light the multiple codes and conditions that make this kind of Fon art object, called bocio, understandable. Blier's innovative approach is to consider the rarely explored effects of psychological factors, such as emotions, transference, and cartharsis, in the study of an African art form. However, this turn to psychology is directly linked to Blier's understanding of the historical experiences of this population in a region formerly called the Slave Coast.</page><page sequence="2">430 BOOK REVIEWS After a first chapter surveying the historical conditions and religious or metaphysical beliefs (vodun ) that fostered the creation and use of bocio objects, the author devotes several chapters to a methodical, remarkably detailed examination of the people's ideas about how bocio are empowered and perceived, and other ideas about the human body, their psyche, the parts of the figural sculpture, the additive materials, and methods of attachment. This examination, flawlessly academic in organization and writing style, draws on her interviews with numerous Fon people, such as priests, smiths, royals, and family heads, and is supported by the published research of several French and native scholars of the language and culture of this region, and illuminated by an extensive range of references to contemporary philosophical and literary writings. It is a complex book that discusses these vodun arts in relation to social history, aesthetics, function, activation processes, viewer response, body representation, alchemy, genre, and political distancing through art. In line with an increasing number of Africanists (e.g., Rend Devisch, Wyatt MacGaffey), Blier sees art assuming a critical role in African therapeutic practice. Her argument is first that the bocio give evidence of the disturbing effects of war, poverty, insecurity entailed by the earlier slave trade centered in .this region and the subsequent palm-oil plantation labor system supported by the Dahomean monarchy, and second, that through the resulting aesthetic of dissonance, which combines contradictory ideas of strength, resistance, dissolution and decay, the common people aimed to transfer their psychic distress to these objects, thereby achieving a cathartic effect. This transference, she asserts, enabled them to dissipate fury, anxieties, or vengeful desires, thereby strengthening them to survive and better their condition. Blier fills the pages with abundant evidence at the intellectual level (analysis of terms, commentary) that the motivation for making bocio is for psychological betterment. (Understandably, this leaves no space for what happens on the ground.) More daring-and it must have been a daunting research effort-is to take these composite objects which have long stood as the colonial icon of African mental immaturity, superstition, and ignorance ("fetishes") and demonstrate that every element of their composition is a product of intellectual operations of the ldnd explored by contemporary European thinkers, such as Roman Jakobson, M.M. Bahktin, William Dilthey, Joseph Needham, Jacques Derrida, and others. Her implicit scholarly aim is to bring the analysis of African art onto the level of post- modem complexity. In addition to her thorough examination of the particular composite objects of this coastal region, Blier offers insights of exceptional value to the broader field of African art historical studies. For example she departs from the narrow focus on the artist, to point to the contributions of the producers, users, and spokespersons</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 431 such as diviners, priests, and elders to the formation and understanding of the ultimate object. Especially broadly useful is her analytical summary of the means and modes of activation of such power objects. One brilliant original insight stems from her discussion of the (widespread) belief in reincarnation, wherein each child is held to be both unique and a substitute for a deceased relative or affiliated vodun. In this double persona Blier perceives the process of masking (p. 181); this insight illuminates the conceptual basis for the readiness to practice masquerade in sub- Saharan Africa. An interesting innovation is to place her analysis of the animal and plant substances or imagery used in bocio arts within the frame of alchemical discussion. She shows that producers of bocio arts and alchemy share fundanental notions such as material transmutation, medicinal and religious concerns, and numerous other features, such as the primacy of parts, anthropomorphism, oppositional units, and multiple linguistic devices. In the last chapter, Blier turns to the bocio used by the court. While kingly and popular bocio arts share a few features, the differences in contexts of display and formal character are striking. The latter include contrasts of passive and action poses, small versus large, local or imported materials, naturalistic or abstract style, and nakedness or dress. In terms of psychological expression, the commoner bocio seem to show a person turned inside out with emotional intensity on view, while the royal bocio hides feelings but conveys an image of command and defiance in gestures, hands, and feet. This superior book should prove a turning point in African art studies in recognizing the importance of political experience in the formation of art objects as well as the significant conjunction of emotion with mind in the exercise of aesthetic choice.
