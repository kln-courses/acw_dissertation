<plain_text><page sequence="1">STRUCTURING SURFACES: THE LEGACY OF THE WHITES PEGGY DEAMER Taking on the legacy of "The Whites" is a daunting task. To speak of them as a whole gives credence to the idea that they were a group, when in fact the association of Peter Eisenman, Michael Graves, Charles Gwathmey, John Hejduk, and Richard Meier for the publication of Five Architects was, by their own account, as much a publicity device as a position state- ment. Moreover, the issue of "legacy" implies that the influence has passed on to another generation, when in fact at least one of its members, Eisenman, is still a leading figure in that new generation. At what point do we consider the baton to have been passed? And, if one could agree that there was a legacy, it would seem that it comes unevenly from the five architects involved. Indeed, much of it comes from the surrounding rhetoric that did not even originate with the so-called "New York Five." What work, what writings, and what institutional codification can rightfully be treated as primary? And lastly, shedding fresh formal light on the work seems not only impossible at this point, but unappealing. The formal characteris- tics of this work have been examined and reexamined, and doing so again only acquiesces to their aesthetic strategy too easily. Having said this, it is too intriguing not to think through this work his- torically and not to admit there is a legacy to be had. The sense is simply too strong that the discourse would be radically different had the five architects not self-identified and in turn provoked the creation of an oppositional group (the Grays). So it is with certain caveats that one proceeds: namely, that the polemic surrounding the work, both generated by the Whites and by others, is as much a source of the legacy as the work itself; and that two of the figures, Eisenman and Hejduk, contribute to this legacy more than the others. The reach of Eisenman's Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies (IAUS), and the influence of Hejduk's Deanship at Cooper Union are both particu- larly strong. The actual architecture of all five is, in other words, less a source of the discussion than its evidence." To read both critics and apologists for the Whites, the most that can be said for their shared vision is an enduring interest in Le Corbusier. Various evaluations, then, were based on whether or not the continua- tion of this legacy was considered good or not for architecture. The Grays-those architects loosely gathered around Robert A.M. Stern, who promoted a less abstract, remote, and intellectual architecture- certainly felt that Le Corbusier's legacy was not positive. The sins of the Whites were the sins of modernism, with the added guilt that they contaminated America with an imported problem. Colin Rowe, Kenneth Frampton, and Arthur Drexler, on the other hand, all of whom wrote critical pieces in Five Architects, felt that there was poetry still to be had in the forms of Le Corbusier (and Mies van der Rohe) and thus supported this ongoing research into the language of modernism. Insisting that the most compelling position of the Whites was their devotion to Le Corbusier, though, does not identify the nature of their legacy. If it did, then this identity would be indistinguishable from that of modernism proper. Nor can it be said that the insistence on this abid- ing appreciation of modernism in the face of pro-American, pro-vernac- ular forces itself constitutes the legacy. This would simultaneously assign the Whites too much power-the ongoing interest in modern masters in a postmodern discourse extends to realms beyond the reach of the Whites (witness this interest among the Dutch and specifically Rem Koolhaas)-and too little imagination. In other words, the stylistic interest in modernism was and is not the main concern of the New York Five.2 Instead I would suggest that their contribution lies precisely in what distinguishes the Whites from Le Corbusier; namely, their elevation of form from the condition of design to that of epistemol- ogy. What was at stake was the claim that form was a type of knowledge; indeed, an essential type of knowledge. The true legacy of the Whites is not the formal vocabulary of datums, frontalities, rotations, solids, voids, layering, skin, grid, figure-ground, etc., but the fact that we think these operations have systemic intellectual import at all.3 Le Corbusier, we should remember, while precise and articulate in his formal operations, never identified form in and of itself as the ends of architecture. While he does, unlike Mies, admit that form is a signifi- cant consideration of architectural design, it is not because form itself is of interest but because it is the means to emotional, not intellectual, fulfillment. "The Architect, by his arrangement of forms, realizes an order which is a pure creation of his spirit; by forms and 90 Resurfacing Modernism Perspecta 32</page><page sequence="2">A House II Hardwick, Vermont Peter Eisenman, 1969.

Nor, to take the issue even farther, was Le Corbusier interested in proving that he did not "author" his own works, as the above quote indicates. For Eisenman, in contrast, the logical extension of seeing architectural form as an analogue to intellec- tual form was and is letting the structure of thought build itself with no subjective intervention. While it is a simple statement to say that the Whites elevated form- making to epistemological status, there are many issues tangled up with this statement, issues that lead directly to a seeming moral authority regarding our obligation toward form. There is the question of authorship and originality-if form is part of the structure of thought, am I not just an agent of that structure? There is the role of history and the zeitgeist-is the structure of thinking historically determined and if so, am I not merely an agent of the zeitgeist? There is the rela- tionship between percept(ion) and concept(ion)-if architecture is a form of thought, how does visual perception interface with that mental construct?; or the issue of the autonomy of architecture as a discipline and its affinity to painting and sculpture-if architecture is a form of visual thinking, is it quantifiably different from painting and sculpture?; and finally, there lurks the odd role of function-if architecture is a pro- duct of thinking, how can it also be a product of use? For the Five, the attachment of these epistemologically related ques- tions to modernism complicated matters. Not only was the knowledge claim an attempt to grasp the heart of modernism by locating "form" and "formalism" at the center of its discourse, but it was also an effort to attach epistemology to a historical condition. This latter fact tangled the rhetoric enormously, for on the one hand it brought with it the old problem of simultaneously being timeless and "of the time"; and on the other, in referencing work that was already fifty years old, was not even of its time. Despite these awkwardnesses, however, the bold attempt on the part of the Five to face these huge and difficult questions directly makes their agenda as fascinating and appealing as it is off-putting and illogi- cal. And our inquiry into their influence can't help but be as much an explaination of the lasting appeal of this extreme formalism as it is an examination of its content. To understand the formulation of this formalist epistemology, the ideological context that helps explain precisely how different the set of questions facing the Whites was from the interests and preoc- cupations facing Le Corbusier and other Europeans in the 1920s must be laid bare and its origins in Texas in the 1950s analyzed. The initial core of shared intellectual aspiration was formed by the associ- ation of Colin Rowe, Robert Slutzky, and John Hejduk from 1954-56 at the University of Texas School of Architecture at Austin (the "Texas Rangers"), and later Eisenman's work with Rowe in England and Italy. Indeed, these associations formed the basis for highly particular posi- tions regarding history, form, perception, and modernism.6 One should begin with Colin Rowe. Arriving in Austin in January of 1954, after studying town planning on a Fulbright with Yale's Henry- Russell Hitchcock, Rowe brought with him to Texas the legacy of the Warburg Institute, primarily the work he had done there from 1945 to 1947 with Rudolf Wittkower. Aby Warburg, the founder of the Institute, promoted the idea that it was the historian's duty "to penetrate beyond the description of style" in order to examine not how culture determined style but how it formed the backdrop against which the individual would make artistic choices. It was an anti-zeitgeist posi- tion.7 Wittkower joined the Institute's faculty in 1934, at age 32, later publishing Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism in 1949. In this, his focus was less anti-zeitgeist than it was "proof" that the Renaissance was not just an aesthetic style but an overriding intellec- tual, religious, and scientific program. The architecture was "read" by Wittkower as a symbol for this larger enterprise, to which he brought optical and Gestalt psychological concepts to bear. Wittkower assumed form had symbolic meaning and that the historian's task was to reveal it by hermeneutically drawing it out.

Ldz6Mhl-Nagy, 190 Rowe adopted both the anti-zeitgeist principles of the Warburg Institute and Wittkower's Gestalt-based techniques for reading the form of architecture symbolically. But where Wittkower would have been spared even thinking about modern architecture-given England's late and unpolemical embrace of it-Rowe was thrust directly into this context, which given modernism's a-historicism was difficult terri- tory for the architectural historian. And his "Mathematics of the Ideal Villa," published in 1947 in the British journal Architectural Review, did what the proper Warburgian could and would never have done: compare Palladio's VILLA MALCONTENTA with Le Corbusier's VILLA GARCHES.6 He thus implied that form is not a symbol of a particular culture, but something that transcends the specifics of culture and provides the basis for a universal reading of architecture. While this might seem to be good news for form, it nevertheless implied a significant reevaluation of modernism. In applying Renais- sance principles to the analysis of modern architecture, Rowe was in effect criticizing current rhetoric of the "Spirit of the Age." When this anti-zeitgeist perspective was applied to modernism, it deflated the key idea upon which modernism rested. It allowed Rowe to declare that mod- ernism was not unique in its formal typologies and had no claims to being the spirit of the current age. With regard to the architect, Rowe re-empha- sized the Warburgian idea that, once the notion of the zeitgeist is dismissed, architects must admit that they are consciously designing a piece of architecture, not just letting the age flow through them. He insisted that responsibility toward design must be embraced by the designer. Rowe also brought to Austin a particular disdain for the figure (and thought) of Walter Gropius. Gropius, as architect and educator, was anti- history; for him, according to Rowe, designing was about imagination with an overlay of "objectivity." While Rowe allowed that the individual and not the zeitgeist designed buildings, he felt pedagogically that the architect should understand history and the principles it yielded. Thus, while Har- vard concentrated on originality and talent, Rowe and the Texas faculty emphasized precedent, observation and synthesis. And, unlike other schools embracing modernism in America, Austin placed Le Corbusier and Mies as the paradigmatic figure(s) of modernism, displacing Gropius. Robert Slutzky, who joined the faculty in the fall of 1954, contributed another set of concerns. A painter who had completed a thesis on the relationship between twentieth-century art and the Gestaltists Kohler, 92 Resurfacing Modernism Perspecta 32</page><page sequence="4">A Bauhaus Dessau, Germany.

He was interested in "reading" the spatial effect of the surface, and this formed the basis for his connection to architecture and constituted his intellectual link to Rowe. The Arnheimian lesson championed by Slutzky was the idea that depth on the painted canvas was only suc- cessfully achieved when the canvas's two-dimensional surface was emphasized. Frontality-the viewer's parallel and layered position vis- 6-vis that surface-was understood to be the dominant visual order- ing system, and "space" was understood to operate most profoundly in a dialectic relationship to the two-dimensional surface. Strong sep- arations between foreground figure and background field, while obtaining a depth effect, did so by severing the surface too blatantly and were seen to yield a weak, incomplete, and trivial spatial reading. A more complex, difficult, and ultimately more complete sense of space came with depth created through color, texture, shape, and position on the single surface. Slutzky applied this principle to his own commitment to Cubism and neo-plasticism and found there the essential manifold of spatial perception; The various facades and planes of a building were asked to perform a similar demonstration in architecture. It was then the combined anti-Gropius urge from Rowe and the pro- Gestalt thrust from Slutzky and Rowe that yielded the two "Trans- parency: Literal and Phenomenal" articles. Written in 1955-56 in Austin, they did not appear in print for (respectively) another eight and fifteen years.9 In the first of these articles, Rowe and Slutzky promote a notion of transparency that is optical/phenomenal, not literal. Using Gyorgy Kepes' notion of implied transparency (and here Kepes is reit- erating the same concern for frontal, two-dimensional space), in which the shared portion of two seemingly overlapping figures allows for "a simultaneous perception of different spatial locations," the two authors argue that Gropius' architecture, as demonstrated by the BAUHAUS at Dessau fails to achieve anything more than the literal transparency offered by glass.10 To them, Gropius failed to understand the lessons provided by Cubism, they claimed, proof of which is the penchant for photographing the Bauhaus building in Dessau from the diagonal instead of frontally. In contrast, Le Corbusier, himself a painter, fully grasped the spatial potential of phenomenal transparency, as indicated by Garches and his unbuilt League of Nations project. In the second of these articles, the authors extend the argument to other buildings and other formal properties, as well as to non-modern examples. They suggest that certain buildings-the United Nations building in New York City and Pietro Belluschi's EQUITABLE LIFE INSUR- ANCE BUILDING in Portland, Oregon-are examples of literal trans- parency because the gridded fagades are spatially and structurally unambiguous, while others-Le Corbusier's ALGIERS BLOCK sky- scraper and I.M. Pei's Mile High Center in Denver-are examples of phenomenal transparency because the gridded fagades fluctuate in their foreground/background reversals. At the same time, they analyzed Renaissance fagades to reveal similarly ambiguous and fluctuating readings of pattern hierarchy, flatness, and recession. This discussion in turn leads to a comparative analysis between Michelangelo's San Lorenzo fagade and Mondrian's Victory Boogie Woogie and culminates in Gestaltian diagrams and pronouncements that explain the interest in figure/ground reversals. It becomes clear that phenomenal trans- parency is less about transparency per se than about the degree to which a flat surface/fagade can sustain multiple readings of pattern and layering. Visual complexity is the goal. At the same time, the anti- zeitgeist, historical, and typological urge is pushed via the Renais- sance-Modernism cross-referencing. These articles should also be understood as critical responses to Sigfried Giedion's Space, Time, and Architecture, which chronicled a historical development of the notion of space that supposedly culmi- nated with the modern movement, exemplified by Gropius's use of hovering planes and the interpenetration of space." The "Transparency" articles were, then, a poignant critique of Gropius as well as a deci- mation of the notion of linear, Hegelian history that culminates in a triumphant modern present. They were also a claim to prove that concern for phenomenal transparency, and the forms that achieved it, were not merely a stylistic preference. The existence of these forms in both pre-modern and modern buildings is an indication of "a basis in a common vision," an "archetypal response." Gestalt principles are used as proof of a perceptual fact and hence are seen as a formal necessity.= While Rowe would later, in his introduction to Five Archi- tects, himself give up this insistence and suggest that modernism was just a style albeit a particularly fascinating one, at this point, the "true," epistemological claim was present and would exert significant influence on the Five. The last pedagogical import shaping the Whites came with Peter Eisenman, who was a post-graduate student of Rowe's at Cambridge during Rowe's self-imposed exile from the United States from 1959 to 1962. Rowe subsequently returned to America to teach in the School of Architecture at Cornell; Eisenman had, coincidentally, earlier graduated Reading Surfaces Structuring Surfaces 93</page><page sequence="5">65' Rr~? 9Vr L~- ~]~ 7 IiB -raa--*~- ( ~ Q~-e PAn ~ i~i~iI' A Diagrams for House II project.

Importantly, Rowe and Eisenman spent two summers together traveling in Italy, analyzing the same Renais- sance buildings that had been featured in the second "Transparency" article, as well as other more modern buildings. (This is when Eisen- man discovered Terragni.) Eisenman's own contribution to the pedagogy was his interest, developed during his graduate work, in the structuralist linguist Noam Chomsky. Chomsky believed that children have an innate ability to understand-and replicate-the deep structure of language. Our minds, he said, are linguistically wired. Unlike other classical struc- turalists who focused on language itself and who, for the most part, emphasized the cultural production of language, Chomsky emphasized this universal, structural, linguistic capacity of the linguistic subject. The "deep structure" that Chomsky described-a base system of rules about underlying relations and abstract order-was distinguished from the "surface" structure, which is related to the actual physical phonetic form that language takes. In other words, Chomsky's was a theory of epistemology. Eisenman imported this concept directly into his work. One can not really describe his interest in linguistics as an influence; it was the work. But behind his direct use of this material were earlier assump- tions that allowed the application of a linguistic model to architecture. One such assumption was that architecture itself is a language, one that is sufficiently analogous to spoken and written language to be governed by similar principles and to be "read" in a similar fashion." Another was that an analytic device can be made into a generative device, that one could design with a tool meant to analyze language. Yet another assumption was that what is generated, in this case architecture, will demonstrate principles. It does not just exist, it edu- cates. Finally, Eisenman assumed that there was a match between the structuring principles in our brains and the exterior world. It is these assumptions, as much as the overt Chomskian ideas, that form the basis of an architectural epistemology, allowing for an overlap with Arnheimian perceptual psychology and an affinity with Rowe and Slutzky. The world, both positions said, is organized like this. And given that no one knew what deep structure looked liked, it could con- veniently, in Eisenman's hands, take on precisely the same formal characteristics as those produced by Cubism and neo-plasticism, and promoted, supposedly, by Gestalt psychology. Clear compositional strategies are promoted here that will mark the work of the Whites: frontal/rotational; solid/void; layering /recession; figure/ground; grid/dissolution of the grid; virtual/actual solids and voids; whole and partial Platonic figures; regulating lines, datums, and golden proportions. But what seemed God-given-since it came from history and the avant-garde, from psychology and linguis- tics-was clearly a fabricated lexicon justifying an ongoing interest in certain 1920s operations that were linked to Le Corbusier (primarily via his work as a painter and his interested in Purism). In this, the grid dominated and, as both field and figure, provided the framework for operations that located planes, solids, and voids relative to each other, while also allowing for transformations to the grid itself. The elements that were distributed constituted a kit of parts that pre- existed any formal operation, and the operations themselves followed their own logic once the rules of the formal game were set in motion. The final product was less the goal than the nature of the process that got one there. These biases nevertheless formed an amazingly strong methodological and pedagogical framework, one that not only competed with Harvard but with the Beaux-Arts tradition that dominated American schools. And the dissemination of this pedagogy was, given its tiny source in Austin, both vast and powerful. Hejduk, joining the Austin faculty in 1954 with Slutzky, absorbed the lessons of both Rowe and Slutzky and played a major role in translating these ideas into an architec- tural pedagogy. Bernhard Hoesli, the principle motivator behind recon- stituting the nature of teaching at Austin, acted as a catalyst for its codification and larger institutional presence. The dissemination of the pedagogy was unleashed when these teachers were fired from Austin and went to other institutions: Hejduk, Rowe, and Slutzky to Cornell; Eisenman to Princeton; and then later Eisenman and Rowe to the IAUS; Hejduk to Harvard and Yale; and eventually Hejduk, Slutzky and Eisenman to Cooper Union. Hoesli took this pedagogy back to Europe, ending up at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (the ETH).4 Beside the forms, what was disseminated? Mainly, it was the idea that knowledge, architecturally manifest, must look a certain way; it must mirror the way the brain is visually and/or conceptually organ- ized. Eisenman describes the strategy he used for formulating his early "cardboard" houses like this: "The purpose of this procedure was to provide an awareness of the formal information latent in any environment that previously was unavailable to the individual."" And the forms, "abstract and universal," are those "inherent" in "the internal structure of form itself." As he says describing HOUSE II, "[i]t may be in the nature of architecture to present the relationship between what is actual in the environment and some form of deep structure. It may be a fundamental act in the making of architecture 94 Resurfacing Modernism Perspecta 32</page><page sequence="6">A House VI Washington, Connecticut. Peter Eisenman, 1975. A Cloud Prop, City Edge project Berlin, Germany. Daniel Libeskind, 1987 and beyond a mere formalism to take certain regularities which exist in a deep structure and present them systematically so that the user is aware of them."16 Or, as Hejduk writes, in his 1975 analysis of Le Corbusier's Carpenter Visual Arts Center at Harvard: "The very profundity of this piece of visual metaphysics brings into question all that went before. ... [T]he proposed ideas cannot be ignored; they can be viewed squarely and understood. The questions and arguments become inexhaustible; they are like the major thesis-the thesis of simultaneity. ...The human body, its auxiliary senses, and the capability of cerebral workings cause architecture to be involved in the movement and dynamics of space. "17 Thus it is that many of the questions regarding the Five's conflicted attitude toward aesthetics and history that introduced this piece get "answered" by following the logic of this epistemology. Certainly the Corbusian bias becomes something more than just an indication of an ongoing affinity with modernism. The disregard for function becomes inevitable, for form-transcendent, following its own Gestalt/Chom- skian logic-must pursue its own course regardless of program. It is Eisenman who takes the lead in the dismissal of function, stating in his piece in Five Architects that "cardboard" architecture is so named precisely in order to undermine normative, functional associations. And in a 1976 editorial in Oppositions, entitled "Postfunctionalism," he dismisses functionalism as an outdated, humanist preoccupation, one that is merely cultural, not universal.1" Likewise, the admitted disregard for social concerns is both cause and effect of this formal agenda: cause, because the Five would not have arrived at this formalism without the failure of the original modernist agenda, as Rowe points out in his introduction to Five Architects. But effect as well, for now the formal concerns and their direct link to knowledge can be seen as something more fundamental to human make-up than incidental social context. Arthur Drexler, in his "Pref- ace" to Five Architects, doesn't make such a sweeping intellectual claim for the Five, but he does praise them for their dismissal of social concern: "That architecture is the least likely instrument with which to accomplish the revolution has not yet been noticed by the younger Europeans, and in America is a fact like a convenient stone wall against which architectural journalism can bang heads. An alter- native to political romance is to be an architect."" Perception and conception, old adversaries in artistic and architectural practices, are seen in this epistemology to be two aspects of the same form of knowledge, a visual knowledge that supposed a fundamental correspondence between the structure of our mind and the visual land- scape before us. Given that the architect/artist's obligation was to demonstrate perceptual principles, the Whites eliminated the actual vicissitudes of subjective "seeing." While one characterization of the difference between the Whites and the Grays is the supposed privileg- ing of perception by the latter and conception by the former, the Whites in fact have usurped perception to their own end's, making it a conceptual tool. The concern for a language unique and essential to architecture-a concern for its disciplinary autonomy-in the face of the fundamental interest in painting is, in their hands, anything but contradictory. The struggle of the Cubists and neo-plasticists was essentially a spatial struggle, and architecture, having lost its functional and social direc- tive, was primarily a perceptual phenomenon. Thus, Graves, Hejduk, and Meier all began their architectural search with the study of paint- ing. Both painting and architecture, in other words, shared the funda- mental concern for organizing the visual world in a spatially complex, profound and multivalent manner. But all were clear that architecture was still the primary concern, and that architecture needed to dis- cover its own essential principles within these perceptual laws. As Hejduk says: "The painter starts with the real world and works toward abstraction... but architecture takes two lines. The architect starts with the abstract world and... works toward the real world. The signif- icant architect is the one who, when finished with the work, is as close to that original abstraction as he could possibly be."" The unac- knowledged contradictions come in more strongly when the Five give hints that architecture is not just a separate language but the most signif- icant one. This is when they suddenly embrace the functional aspect of architecture to prove its superiority over painting. Thus both Hejduk and Eisenman can suggest that the use of architecture is what puts it into more serious play than other art forms, even as functionalism is dismissed. Likewise, the importing of linguistics into architecture becomes equally "logical" in a search for architectural autonomy. Seemingly transparent as a medium, language could be imported to architecture as a requirement for establishing epistemological structure, while not itself imposing its own disciplinary form. Or, to think it through another way, language's seeming universality as a logic made it a meta-system, not an outside discipline. Eisenman's unwavering desire-to distill architecture to its own essential language, its own deep form, its own "interiority"-is ironically linked to his equally unwavering desire to search beyond architecture for the answer to architectural autonomy. " Reading Surfaces Structuring Surfaces 95</page><page sequence="7">ee d A Lynn graphs of potential geometric morphing V diagrams of transformation al/regenerational potential of flat worms based on cuts and grafts graft Authorship and originality are also fortuitously resolved with the direc- tive to obey archetypal paradigms. With design understood as an act of interpretation, one could be both selfless and creative; whoever grasps the paradigm most completely and exposes it most plastically serves both masters. Hence, there was no conflict in using the forms of architects who had worked fifty years earlier. That work itself was nothing other than a reinterpretation of enduring archetypal forms, forms that were first revealed (not discovered) in all of their intensity by the architects of the Renaissance. Hejduk's trajectory from early geometric work to later anthropomorphic work is consistent on this score, for throughout the work has had its own personality; the poetry of the work is precisely its faith in its factness, ignorant of the will of the author. Eisenman, pushing anonymity to the extreme, insists, both with his early houses and his most current work, that the buildings are authored without him. Implicit in the early idea that cardboard architecture is merely the marking of deep formal operations, not the will of his hand, this position has become explicit by the time he designs House VI, when he claims that the design is merely a palimpsest of its own coming into being. Again, the epistemology allows for the ironic condition that the most "avant-garde" and self- celebratory position of someone like Eisenman is the one that claims to be the most anonymous. Unacknowledged in this is the distance Eisenman's position has traveled from Rowe's. As stated earlier, Rowe's Warburgian position proposed that, in the absence of the zeit- geist, the choices made individually were the essential cultural acts; good and bad design was a personal responsibility. Eisenman sees himself as merely the agent of intellectual structures. While many inconsistencies are evident in these attitudes, the issue of history and with it the fate of "modernism" remains the untidiest, at least for Eisenman, who confronts this issue head on. Rowe makes the Five's historical fate the central focus of his introductory essay, and in doing so, writes modernism's epitaph. In describing mod- ernism's own internal inconsistencies and its self-deluded and ulti- mately failed aim at social reform, he sees the Five as falling into the general pool of alternative successive modernisms, like New Brutalism and neo-classicism, which understood the ridiculousness of the old rhetoric. In being able to hold onto only the "physique" and not the "morale" of modernism, the most that these architects can claim is that in the 1920s, "great revolutions of thought occurred and that then profound visual discoveries resulted, that these are still unexplained, and that rather than assume intrinsic change to be the prerogative of every generation ...certain changes are so enormous as to improve a directive which cannot be resolved in any individual life span."22 This negative evaluation of the historical value of modernism and the Five clearly can not be intellectually shared by the participants. Never- theless, Rowe grasps the essential problem in a way that stymies Eisenman, whose dogged effort to distance himself from previous eras and participate in an avant-garde is both his most marked dis- agreement with Rowe and his most awkward intellectual position. Ignoring the timeless/of the time/ahead of the time dilemma in his early cardboard houses, Eisenman, in "Postfunctionalism," took up the Focauldian idea of epistemic ruptures-dramatic changes in his- tory that have entailed entirely different thought structures-which allowed him to attach himself to an epistemological position that is current and culturally responsive. In this article, he claimed that mod- ernism constituted an unrecognized rupture, one that disengages us from the humanism of previous eras and makes it impossible for us to deploy the same strategies as the Renaissance. It is a move that allowed him to distance himself from the increasingly conservative Rowe at the same time that it allowed him to claim a place in avant- garde practice. The difficulty with this position is not only that the notion of rupture remains wholly unexplained, but the moments of "rupture" become convenient, characterized differently by Eisenman as time passes and styles change. While identified with the 1920s and modernism in this essay (when his work was "modern"), this rupture is later identified with World War II and Hiroshima in "The Futility of Objects" of 1984 (when his work was chaotic and fragmented) and transforming again, is currently identified with the change from a machine-based to an electronically-based society (when his work is "smooth" and computer-generated).23 The legacy this epistemological formalism gives us, then, is less related to the forms themselves (although, as we will see, there are formal relationships) than concerned with being able to update the inter- pretation of the same epistemological urge as changes in style and fash- ion occur. What is constant is an adherence to claims of knowledge and, with them, a moral imperative to design a certain way. The epistemological urge takes on various conceptual formulations since, along with the change in attitude toward modernism altogether, there clearly came the breakup of any singular architectural language and/or position. But the claim for the universality that gives clear formal directive, that insists that the forms must look a certain way, is the same. So is the reliance on forms of thought exterior to archi- tecture, be they philosophical or scientific, as well as the essential afunctional and asocial position that tends to come with such extreme formalism. 24 96 Resurfacing Modernism Perspecta 32</page><page sequence="8">A Korean Presbyterian Church Long Island City, New York.

One case of this is the phenomenological strain of someone like Daniel Libeskind (who studied under John Hejduk at Cooper Union and drew the diagrams of San Lorenzo included in the second "Transparency" article), whose formalist knowledge claims are extremely similar to those of the Five, particularly in the combination of Hejduk-like meta- physical poetry and Eisenman-like conceptual logic. In Libeskind's hands, this combination entails a hermeneutic search for "the real world."

[that] sound the distance that exists between themselves and what stands physically before us... There are hardly any buildings, with the exception of the Carceri d'lvenzione by Piranesi, which bear this double burden of representing both actual buildings and mental structures and therefore have to submit to being measured by both standards."25 The claim that architecture is a physical manifestation of the structure of our minds is remarkably close to Eisenman's. While Libeskind doesn't go into any of the problematics of history or authorship that come with this position, nor give a prescribed image of what this mindset looks like, the consistency of his architectural language, despite differences in location, program, or concept, is an indication that he still has a sense of the composition of this mindset. The language of this architectural scaffolding-the emphasis on unre- lated linear elements; the overall emphasis on line over plane and plane over mass; the disparagement of the rectilinear in any spatial element-while similar in essence to the Five, fortuitously also looks like other current avant-garde work. The blob architecture of someone like Greg Lynn (who worked for Peter Eisenman after being his pupil at Princeton) manifests a differ- ent kind of epistemological look, one that is more conscious of its historical lineage, and more prescriptive about its formal musts. As Ole Bouman writes in the introductory essay to Lynn's Folds, Bodies, and Blobs: Collected Essays: "Only by recognizing the disciplinary autonomy of architecture can Lynn contribute to its modernization. And that is precisely what he has in mind... His line of reasoning is anti-subjectivism. His architecture is no formalistic whim, but a logical step in a post-humanistic architectural theory."26 Here one sees the Eisenmanesque interest in disciplinary autonomy and pre-subjective logic. Trying to avoid the pitfalls of other, earlier geometric formula- tions with claims to transcendence, wholeness, and closed forms, his search for an "anexact," "amorfal," and "amoral" system of form replaces one set of ultimate formal directives with another. "The chal- lenge to architecture, once geometry and the body enter into a new [sic] alliance, is to write-in form-a monument that is irreducible to any ideal geometric type."27 The "monument" he wants to write is one that "can represent a complex relationship irreducible either to the contradictions of the many or the holistic unity of the one."28 Lynn sees himself in a dialectical relationship with Wittkower and Rowe, in the sense of moving past humanist architecture to discover a lan- guage for post-humanist culture, and he sees his work as overturning the Renaissance-Modernism thesis-antithesis with his own transcen- dent synthesis. Like Eisenman (who is never mentioned in Lynn's his- tory but is clearly the pivotal figure linking him to Rowe and Wittkower), Lynn's history is Hegelian-the arrival of post-humanist (folded) culture is inevitable, it is avant-gardist-only he can leap ahead of time and pull us out of our out-of-date, humanist, modernist, geometrical stupor. Because, unlike Libeskind, Lynn's "biological" methods are direct, prescriptive, and sequentially clear, they rely on the same transforma- tive processes that Eisenman relied on, "combinational exchanges between multiple, complex, and intricate systems that interact and evolve over time ...teratological processes where order and identity emerge from differential variation and mutation." 29 This emphasis on transformational processes links Lynn in turn to both the use of the diagram and the anonymous, authorless creation. Diagrams for Lynn "should not be understood as instrumental ideas... Instead, diagrams should be understood as conceptual techniques that come before any particular technology."s3 And, as he says about authoring design: "This recent (folded) work may be described as being pliant; in a state of being plied by forces beyond control."13 The computer both aids in depicting the anexact operations and sets them to analogical formulas, assuring that an "author" is not actually required. One can also see the influence of the epistemological approach in the work of Bernard Cache who, alone among these three examples, has no known direct attachment to the Five.32 Although Cache is much more knowing and sophisticated about the aesthetic, historical, and social implications of his work, on the classification of images as well as his interest in the computer as a means for regulating and predicting the architectural image, he is in the same theoretical territory prepared by the Whites. In Cache's epistemology, all images are classified into three types: inflection, vector, and frame. These are reworkings, respectively, of the circle, the triangle, and the square, the original figures of form- making. "Inflection, vector, and frame would constitute an alphabet whose rules are never determined but are always determinable, as they are always present in the images that have been elaborated Reading Surfaces Structuring Surfaces 97</page><page sequence="9">A Victoria and Albert Museum project.

Bernard Cache, 1997. through the ages.""3 Here he gives us the formal framework for analyz- ing all historical forms, much like Eisenman's "deep structure," and wants to prove not only its universal timeless applicability, but its potential as a generative design tool. "The question then will be to see to what extent our elements might allow us not only to read the works of the past but to understand those of the present, and, we hope, to prepare us for those of the future ...[M]ight we not find in it something today that could afford us the bases of a new constructivism?"34 Beyond this faith in the generative possibility of an analytic tool, or, perhaps, justifying such faith, is the ultimate reliance on numerical predictability, especially that provided for by the computer. Continuing with the above quote: "Moreover, do numerical technologies not give us the tools to realize once again Leibniz's program: 'Everything can be calculated'?" And here, too, is the concern for linking thought with images, percep- tion with the world outside us. The above quote continues: "Finally, we can give the image its widest meaning, designating thereby any- thing that presents itself to the mind, whether it be real or not! In this way, we press from visible objects to visibility itself... Our brain is not the seat of a neural cinema that reproduces the world; rather our per- ceptions are inscribed on the surface of things."3" And negotiating the link between concept and precept, between inside the mind and out- side of it is the diagram, which Cache sees as the quintessential visual description of how images operate in the world. I have emphasized the underlying conceptual/epistemological connec- tion that binds the work of these (and implicitly other) contemporary architects to that of the Whites, trying to avoid delineating any direct formal connection. Yet it isimpossible not to draw formal analogies, both because the images published here beg to be compared, and because the connection suggests that the adoption of an epistemo- logical framework that pre-exists architecture cannot help but produce certain organizational similarities. I will conclude then with a list of these correspondences, both as a way of ending and as a way of sug- gesting that despite the fact that this contemporary work is posi- tioned in the "new," the work as well as the polemic demonstrates how problematic this notion of the "new" is, as long as its parame- ters are formal and based on a shared belief in demonstrating the structure of knowledge. The main point of comparison is the idea of an organizational "scaf- folding" distributing the forms of the architecture. This is a "scaffold- ing" corresponding to the architects' mental one; it is their diagram of how the mind organizes material. For the Whites, this scaffolding was the implied grid that located the datums, the regulating lines, the location of frontal or rotational planes, and the points of recession or layering. For the current architecture, the scaffolding is a sort of an a priori plane or surface. The scaffolding in both cases is seen as having, internal to its own logic, operations that will determine the distribution of forms, thereby sparing the architect the need to make any subjective, willful or arbitrary moves. While the current work emphasizes the surface as the primary concep- tual device-it is the surface Libeskind "writes" on, the surface Lynn folds, the surface the computer turns into a topography for Cache-it nevertheless becomes associated with the grid. In some cases, the grid is the remnant of the mathematical, numerically derived formulas and algorithms generating the planar configuration. The formulas and algorithms then form the context from which the planes are morphed. In other cases, the grid is the structural component holding the planes up or the element that continues the effects of folding through the interior, occupiable space. A cruder way of describing this would be to say that the grids of modernism got twisted by deconstruction and then smoothed by Deleuzian folding, and this transmutation is both diachronic (it describes changes that happened over a fifteen year period) and synchronic (it is embedded in the logic of the forms as they are currently constituted). Moreover, the seemingly new interest in surface can be understood as nothing other than the more recent version of the Arnheimian concern, most strongly articulated by Slutzky, privileging the two-dimensional surface. For the Whites, the grid, the volumes, the layering, the voids were efforts to achieve a "phenomenal transparency" dependant upon two-dimensional surface. While the planes the Whites deployed were not the structural scaffolding, they were the phenomenal datum onto which three-dimensional space collapsed. Thus one can read the more recent surface work as a final victory for that painterly two-dimensional surface, now freed from the no longer dominant context of grid and volume. And while these planes lose their frontal relationship to the viewer, so important to the Whites, one can still claim that the aim of the planar distribution in the current work is the dialectical intertwin- ing, if not collapsing, of three-dimensional and two-dimensional space. There is also, among many contemporary architects, an attitude about space that is shared with the Whites. While space was under- stood to be the essential new discovery of modern architecture, and the Whites continued that legacy in their unbuilt and built work, the epistemological and formal scaffolding is one that ultimately dictates 98 Resurfacing Modernism Perspecta 32</page><page sequence="10">how to distribute solids (columns, beams, walls); the space between is residual. This is not to say that the work was (or is) a-spatial, for the complex organizations of physical matter did yield complex spatial interiors. However the spaces were never conceived of "positively" and rarely thought of as inhabited. This same condition exists with the current work. While enormously complex spaces result from the cur- rent topological, morphed, and inscribed procedures, the conception of space is residual to the physical matter shaping it. As with the Whites, the spatial drama is almost a direct result of the disjunction between considerations of space and its actual, almost incidental occupation. The ultimate visual and spatial goal is the same: complexity and ambiguity. If the plea made in the two "Transparency" articles was ultimately for multiple phenomenal readings of space over singular lit- eral reading of space, the goal of the current work is the same: to be "multiplicitous," non-static, fluctuating, indeterminate, heteroge- neous. The desire to keep the eye "smart," excited, moving, question- ing is a constant. In both cases, the desire, given the link between mind and vision, concept and percept, is to have eye and mind equally challenged, equally knowledgeable. The legacy of the Whites-both the urge for epistemological justifica- tion and for the forms that match it-is not their doing alone. The similarities described here between the generations is due less to a causal connection than to their shared inheritance of what Rowe described in his introduction to Five Architects as the fallout of mod- ernism's failed social and historical vision. In his cynical and prescient evaluation of the impossibility of finding a stable position from which to operate once the nai've blush of modernism has paled, he writes: "For with this failure... it... become[s] apparent that theory itself was never so much a literal directive for the making of buildings as it was an elaborately indirect mechanism for the suppression of feelings of guilt: guilt about high culture-felt to be unreal, guilt about art-the most extreme anxiety to disavow the role of private judgment in any analytical or synthetic enterprise. In the end what is understood as the theory of modern architecture reduces itself to little more than a constellation of escapist myths which are all active in endeavoring to relieve the architect of responsibility for his choices and which all alike combine to persuade him that his decisions are not so much his own as they are, somehow, immanent in scientific, or historical, or social process."36 In this description, both the Whites and the proponents of the current hyper-formalism could be said to flounder in the vacuum left by mod- ernism's moral failure. This may well be the case. But whether one thinks the Whites stimulated this turn of events or were merely its victims is less interesting than our evaluation of the dilemma that still remains. On the one hand, this dilemma can be viewed cynically and tragically, as Rowe does or as die-hard modernists might.37 On the other, it can be viewed less judgmentally and with greater curiosity, for we cannot blame the Whites or the current avant-garde for thrust- ing their vision upon us; we have all been more than receptive. Despite the clear illogic of many of these "masks of guilt," work like theirs indicates our drive for determining the aesthetic dimension of our psyche, and, through this, our culture. Kant struggled with it, Heidegger struggled with it, Freud struggled with it, Adorno struggled with it, Marcuse struggled with it, Lacan struggled with it, and Tafuri struggled with it. It is an unresolved question; it is not inappropriate that we are still struggling with it. Notes 1 What could legitimately be said about the Five as a group: Eisenman completely rational, deterministic, and "objective"; Hejduk entirely poetic, elusive and "subjective". Meier and Gwathmey are more background than foreground not because they don't theorize the work but because the work has proved resistant to further speculation. Graves drops away because of his switch, after the publication of Five Architects (New York: Wittenborn, 1972), to a post-modern vocabulary; his legacy leads elsewhere. 2 As Rem Koolhaas did teach at the IAUS briefly, one could conjecture on the unexamined inter-relationship of these seemingly distinct paths. 3 The linking of form to knowledge was not a new idea. It was a variation of the neo-Kantian formalism of the late nineteenth century thinkers such as Conrad Feidler and Adolf Hilde- brand. It also was linked to the perceptual psychologists, such as Rudolf Arnheim, and later phenomenologists like Maurice Merleau-Ponty. What was new was the particular link being made to architectural modernism in the name of this epistemology. 4 Quoted from "Towards a New Architecture," in Ulrich Conrads, Programs and Manifestoes on 20th Century Architecture (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1964) 59. 5 Van Doesburg and the De Stijl movement, which gave us the square/diamond controversy, dismisses form-for-form-sake soundly. "(T)he idea of art as illusion unconnected to real life has to disappear. The word 'art' no longer means anything to us." Conrads 67. s I am indebted to Alexander Caragonne's The Texas Rangers: Notes from and Architectural Underground, (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995) for his sympathetic, astute, and careful analysis of the "Texas Ranger" years at Austin and later its protagonists' dispersal in archi- tectural academia. The true legacy of the Whites is probably most accurately charted in his six-page graph in this volume depicting the "Texas Rangers" academic family tree: 338-342. 7 The anti-zeitgeist, anti-teleology position was popular at this time with intellectuals such as E. M. Gombrich and Karl Popper. It was a reaction to the Hegelian underpinnings of Nazi rhetoric. 8 Reprinted in Rowe's The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1978) 1-28. 9 The essays appeared in Perspecta 8 and 13/14, respectively.

See Ockman 224. 13 This was not solely Eisenman's idea. The popularity of structural linguistics at this time was pervasive, and language was seen by many to govern or form the model of all aspects of human production. The marriage between structuralism and formalism was evident in many fields, from literature and painting to cultural studies and psychoanalysis. 14 See Caragonne for a full description of the students of these men who became teachers and themselves spread out to these and other institutions. 15 Five Architects 15.

Bernard Cache, who is being put in this category, is attempting to attach himself to a social position by connecting his form making to a social system of production. Hence, the asocial claim here is somewhat unfair. The use of the term is meant to signal that the first commitment is to thought, and only secondarily linked to a or social position. 2s Radix-Matrix: Architecture and Writings (Munich: Prestel-Verlag, 1997) 7, emphasis added. 26 Ole Bouman, "Amor(f)al Architecture or Architectural Multiples in the Post-Humanist Age," in Greg Lynn, Folds, Bodies and Blobs: Collected Essays (Bruxelles: La Lettre volee, 1998) 8-9. 27 Lynn 12. 28 Lynn 183.
