<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arthur M. Sackler Museum Standing, Three-Headed Image of Siva Kashmiri, Karkota period, 8th-gth century Dark gray chlorite, 66.7 x 25.2 X 11.4 cm Ernest B. and Helen Pratt Dane Fund for the Acquisition of Oriental Art, 19go.1 Numerous attributes identify this regally crowned Kashmiri image as Siva: three anthropomorphic heads, a third eye (set vertically in the forehead of the central face), an erect phallus, the sacred Brahmanic cord (in the form of two snakes with linked tails) that traverses the chest, and an animal skin adorning the proper right thigh. In Hinduism's divine triad, Brahma represents the creator, Vis.nu the preserver, and Siva the destroyer. Creation, preservation, and destruc- tion are understood to be cyclical, with Siva destroying what Brahma and Visnu have created and preserved, just as winter brings an end to spring and summer's growth. In his three-headed incarnation, Siva is charac- teristically shown with a benign male face in the center, a smiling female face at the left, and a ferocious male head, symbolizing his destructive aspect, at the right. Situated on vibrant trade routes, Kashmir was prosperous and cosmopolitan in the eighth and ninth centuries. Both Buddhism and Hinduism, religions that originated in India, had taken root in Kashmir centuries earlier and flourished alongside artistic styles also imported from India. Kashmiri artists created their distinctive style by harmoniously syn- thesizing various Indian elements. This sculpture's S-curved stance, well-modeled musculature, fleshy faces, and meticulously combed hair derive from India's sixth- to seventh-century post-Gupta style, yet the crowns-and even the basic iconography- harken back to Gandharan prototypes of the second and third centuries. More than any- thing, however, it is the rare but compelling i -3 _ 9 1 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~h - -~~~~~~~W blend of vital energy, controlled exuberance, and refined elegance that characterizes Kashmiri works. This majestic image is unquestionably the most important work of Indian, Himalayan, or Southeast Asian sculpture acquired during the past decade. -RDM 7</page><page sequence="2">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 YOU QIU (ALSO KNOWN AS FENGQIU), active c. 1540-90 A Gathering of Scholars in a Garden Chinese, Ming dynasty, second half of the i6th century Hanging scroll; ink on paper; 132.1 X 43.5 cm; with a signature of the artist reading Wuxia You Qiu zhi Bequest of David Berg, 1999.230.1 Painted by You Qiu late in the sixteenth century, this elegant scroll depicts seven scholars at leisure in a garden, distinguished by a towering rock, a bamboo balustrade, a wutong tree (Firmiana simplex), and a banana tree. The scholars enjoy the pleasures of a summer afternoon: Four scholars, relaxing around a table, sip wine and converse in front of a screen, while three scholars in the fore- ground compete in a game of touhu, or "pitch pot," an ancient arrow-tossing game. A woman bearing a duster observes the gentlemen, and eight young boys, their hair in topknots, attend them. The son-in-law of the literati painter Qiu Ying (d. 1552), You Qiu was a member of the most elite artistic coterie of his day, the Wu school, which emphasized elegant composition, delicate colors, and refined brushwork. He is best remembered for his figure paintings in the baimiao, or "plain drawing," technique, which eschews color in favor of sure lines and occasional ink washes. Taking inspiration from Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1279-1368) paintings, You Qiu's figural compositions possess an antique flavor that sets them apart from the work of his Ming-dynasty (1368- 1644) contemporaries. Once in the collection of Richard Bryant Hobart, Cambridge, Mass., this famous scroll came to Harvard in 1999 as part of the t~~~~ RI i I . bequest of David Berg, which also includes numerous fine Chinese ceramics. -RDM 8</page><page sequence="3">ARTHUR M. SACKLER MUSEUM Buddhist Triad: The Buddha sakyamuni in Bhamispars'a-mudrd Seated on a Lotus Throne Flanked by Two Standing Bodhisattvas Chinese, Liao dynasty, ioth-lith century Gilt silver, io.8 x 10.2 x 6.8 cm Gift of Ralph C. Marcove, M.D., 1997.254 Cast in silver and brilliantly gilded, this exquisite Buddhist triad depicts the historical Buddha Sakyamuni (Chinese, Shijiamuni Rulai) seated on a lotus throne and flanked by his attendant bodhisattvas, Man-jusri (Wenshu Pusa) and Samantabhadra (Puxian Pusa). His proper left hand resting in his lap, his right hand extended over his knee, the Buddha assumes the bhumisparsa-mudra, or "earth- touching gesture," which symbolizes the moment of his enlightenment, when he not only triumphed over temptation but attained nirvana, realizing supreme truth. A hallmark of Mahayana Buddhism, the bodhisattvas are enlightened beings who have postponed their own entry into final nirvana in order to assist other sentient beings in gaining salvation. Most surviving Chinese Buddhist sculptures depict single deities; triads are extremely rare. That it was cast in one precious metal (silver) rather than the typical bronze, and then sheathed in another (gold), indicates the exalted status this sculpture enjoyed in its day. Once attributed to the Tang dynasty (618- 907), this image actually dates to the Liao (907-1125), as evinced by the elaborate lotus pedestal and the serene, simplified faces. Unquestionably the most important Chinese sculpture to enter the collections since the receipt of the Grenville L. Winthrop bequest in 1943, this triad brings forceful presence to the arts of the Liao dynasty, once poorly repre- sented at Harvard and, indeed, in Western collections in general.

Arching downward from the mouth to the widest point of the belly, the handles, with their strong profiles, complete the jar's amphora-like shape and extend into volutes resembling large eyes. After shaping, this vessel was burnished and then fired to a putty gray-an unusual hue, since most related pieces are slate gray.

SACKLER MUSEUM dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D. 220). They were made by non-Chinese peoples; indeed, their exuber- ant shapes distinguish them from ceramics made by contemporaneous Chinese potters. The Sichuan Basin has recently attracted great scholarly interest, due to the 1986 discovery at Sanxingdui of two caches of monumental bronze masks and related sculptures that are apparently datable to the period between the thirteenth and eleventh centuries B.C., a period contemporaneous with the late phase of the Shang dynasty (c. 17th century-i028 B.C.). Perhaps the makers of the Sanxingdui bronzes were the distant ancestors of the potters who made this vessel. This jar significantly enhances the Sackler's already very strong collection of early Chinese art, introducing a regional style previously unrepresented at Harvard. -HS Censer in the Form of an Archaic Bronze Liding Tripod Vessel Chinese, Southern Songperiod, mid-l2th- 13th century Longquan celadon ware: light gray stoneware with celadon glaze over molded decoration; h. 13.4 cm, diam. i8.o cm Gift of Robert Ferris, 1997.122 Masterful in design and color, this handsome tripod censer is among the finest examples of Longquan celadon ware in the United States. Made at one of the famous kilns near Longquan, in southwestern Zhejiang province, the censer sports a thick, opalescent bluish green glaze with a lustrous jadelike finish; the fine-grained, light gray stoneware of its body is visible at the bottoms of the legs, which were left unglazed to prevent the piece from fusing to the kiln during firing. A single relief bowstring line encircles the vessel's shoulder, while a slender vertical rib bisects each leg. These subtle embellishments, which indicate that the vessel was made using a mold, mimic the flanges that compartmentalize the surfaces of bronze ritual vessels cast during the Shang (c. 17th century-1028 B.C.) and Zhou (1027-221 B.C.) dynasties. .. . ........ . . . _~~~ Made during the Southern Song period (1127- 1279), this censer assumes the form of an archaic bronze liding, a three-legged vessel with a lobed body that culminates in a circular rim. In antiquity, such cauldrons were used for cooking and offering food in ceremonies honoring the spirits of deceased ancestors. The appropriation of this bronze form reflects the passion for antiquities that was prevalent among Chinese scholars of the Song dynasty (960-1279) and signals an awakening interest in China's ancient past that would become a hallmark of later Chinese culture. This magnificent censer considerably enriches the Sackler's already strong collection of Song ceramics. -MAM 11</page><page sequence="6">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 Cylindrical Censer in the Form of an Archaic _ .......... .

Apart from its commanding form and excellent potting, this jar's most distinguishing features are its tea- dust glaze and its extraordinarily calligraphic brushwork. The glaze, which matured to a handsome, deep brownish green color with undercurrents of midnight blue, was surely intended to be pitch black; the exact reasons for its unusual color remain unknown but doubtless have to do with firing time, kiln temperature or atmosphere, or perhaps the components or thickness of the glaze. Com- plementing the taut form and sumptuous glaze, three stylized birds emblazon the jar's shoulder; painted with a brush dipped in an iron-oxide slip, the birds embody some of the most exquisitely calligraphic brushwork to be found on any Chinese ceramic. The Sackler Museum boasts great strength in Chinese ceramics of the Song (960-1279), jin (1115-1234), and Yuan (1279-1368) periods. The Museum's excellent collection of dark- glazed wares enabled Robert D. Mowry, curator of Chinese art, to organize Hare's Fur, Tortoiseshell, and Partridge Feathers: Chinese Brown- and Black-Glazed Ceramics, 400-1400, which opened in 1995. Borrowed from a private collection for that exhibition, this magnificent jar was acquired by the Sackler in 1997, bringing even greater strength to the Sackler's already formidable holdings. -HS Large Ovoid Jar with Stylized Floral Decor Chinese, Yuan dynasty, probably mid-14th century Cut-glaze ware of Cizhou type: ivory white stoneware with medium brown glaze, the decoration cut into the glaze before firing; h. 29.6 cm, diam. 31.1 cm Partial purchase through the Ernest B. and Helen Pratt Dane Fund for the Acquisition of Oriental Art and partial gift of Peter W Scheinman, i999.11o 13</page><page sequence="8">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 ~~~4M~~~~ .. . .........X 1S4 4 - (I- CHONG YUSUJNG (ALSO KNOWN AS CH'UI-UN), born c.

Despite the paintings' foreign flavor, the bold, expres- sionistic brushwork and the large figures that dominate the landscapes they inhabit distin- guish the screen as a work of seventeenth- century Korea. The sages-some mythical, some historical-are shown in acts that identify them as exemplars of Confucian or Daoist virtue. The figures display a variety of physiognomies and personalities, just as the landscapes reflect the changing seasons. Each painting bears the artist's signature-a sobri- quet reading Ch'ui-un (Drunken Hermit)-in its upper left corner and a poetic title of four characters in its upper right corner; the sages and their stories are so well known in East Asia that a quatrain suffices to identify each scene. Arguably the most important Korean literati screen in the United States, this is one of four Korean screens acquired by the Sackler in the l990S. The acquisition of these screens, of sev- eral Korean hanging scrolls, and of the Nelson Goodman collection of Korean paintings- thirty album leaves dating to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries-signals the com- mitment of the Sackler Museum's curators to the formation of a comprehensive collec- tion of Korean art that includes paintings, ceramics, and Buddhist sculptures. -ARK 14</page><page sequence="9">ARTHUR M.

Henderson and partial purchase through the Ernest B. and Helen Pratt Dane Fund for the Acquisition of Oriental Art, 1991.554 Probably intended as a container for liquid cosmetics, this exquisite little bottle reflects the cultivated sensibilities and luxurious taste of the ruling elite of the Kory6 dynasty (918- 1392). Its simple yet elegant form and its per- fectly hued bluish green glaze rank this piece among the very finest Korean celadons. Inlaid in black and white slips (colored clays ground to a fine powder and mixed with water), three peony sprays decorate the bottle's shoulder. This inlay process, invented by Kory6 potters, involves the fitting of slip into incised and carved designs. The tastefully restrained design and meticulous attention to detail mark this bottle as an early example of the acclaimed inlaid ware. In fact, the bold design elements and the harmonious balance between decorated and undecorated areas confirm the date of this jar to the second half of the twelfth century. This small treasure is from the collection of Korean ceramics assembled by Gregory and Maria C. Henderson, which is among the finest outside Korea and includes one hundred fifty pieces that range in date from the second to the nineteenth century. The acquisition of this superlative collection symbolizes the Sackler Museum's commitment to building a strong, comprehensive assemblage of Korean art. -MB 16</page><page sequence="11">ARTHUR M.

Henderson and partial purchase through the Ernest B. and Helen Pratt Dane Fund for the Acquisition of Oriental Art, 1991.590 The ceramics of Korea's Chos6n dynasty (1392-1910) reveal a marked taste for white wares, whose starkness reflects the austere aesthetic sensibilities of a ruling elite steeped in Neo-Confucian teachings. Chos6n ceramics fall into two basic groups: fine white porcelains and humble punch'ong wares, the latter comprising coarse gray stonewares covered with white slip under a pale celadon glaze. Unlike porcelains, which were used by the court and nobility, punch'6ng wares were used by ordinary people. Enjoying widespread cur- rency throughout the peninsula, punch'ong wares were unquestionably the dominant ceramics of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Fifteenth-century examples typi- cally have either stamped designs or decora- tive elements incised or carved through the white-slip ground. Sixteenth-century examples, by contrast, characteristically boast decoration painted in brown slip on the white-slip ground. Among the finest examples of painted punch'ong ware in the United States, this exceptional wine bottle from the Henderson collection sports stylized floral decoration. White slip, rapidly applied in broad brush strokes, creates a visually striking ground; together with the bottle's broad, curving sides, the white ground provides the perfect canvas for the boldly calligraphic floral design painted in iron-brown slip on either side of the vessel. -MB IF- 'ts1&lt;; E s ''w 17</page><page sequence="12">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 Broad-Shouldered Jar with Decoration of Rock, Chrysanthemums, and Insects Korean, Chos6n dynasty, second half of the i8th century Blue-and-white ware: porcelain with decora- tion painted in underglaze cobalt blue; h. 30.5 cm, diam. 22.0 cm Partial gift of Maria C.

Japanese artists began using lacquer as early as the fifth millennium B.C. A major innovation was the development of the maki-e, or "sprinkled design," technique in which tiny particles of cut gold are sprinkled onto an uncured lacquer surface in order to create detailed pictorial compositions. The decoration on this extraordinary scroll-storage box typifies a style that became popular with Japan's warrior elite during the turbulent Momoyama period (1568-1615). Sprinkled gold lozenges alternate with fields of black lacquer to emblazon its surfaces, which are further enlivened by stylized floral crests and more naturalistic renderings of the "seven plants of autumn." The combination of chrysanthe- mum and paulownia crests suggests that this box was made for Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1537- 1598), whose military campaigns helped to unify Japan in the early seventeenth century. This magnificent Japanese lacquer box is one of fifty-six donated to Harvard by Elaine Ehrenkranz in 1996. Thanks to this generous gift, the Sackler Museum now houses one of the finest, most comprehensive, and most important collections of Japanese lacquer in the United States. -ARK 19</page><page sequence="14">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 Inkstone Box (Suzuribako) with Monkey- and-Persimmon Fan Design ((Cl)ckwise frs 1 upper lLft: ilterior of box, exteri-or- oflid, inten-or oflid) Jalpanecsc, Edo per1 iod1, earl-ly i8tli cen1turl1y LtacquIfer- oni wvootd wvit/i decoCration in gold, silver, and sabN urushi (tlick la-cquier palste) uttiliziniig the hiramaiki-e (low-relief sprinkled dlesigni), takaimaki-e (hiigh-relief sprinikledl dcesigni), tint!i inashiji ("peair-skintned" grotu.nd) techliu( ties, wl'itli (pplied kirigane (Ctut goldl and1 l silver) and wilitli shibuchi (copper-silver allo)y), brass, silver, anid coral inlays; stone, mcetal, and etnamnel fittinlgs; 23.1 &gt;x 21.5 x 5.3 cvil i'1lie Eltain e E1liren krani iz Collection of Japanesce Lacquer B3oxcs, Gift ohf Elain ie Ehrenkranz, IIIIIII 1996.2* 42 ` *) 0-g&gt; .. .. 20</page><page sequence="15">ARTHUR M.

On the right Impy, wearing a rounded wig and short kilt and holding a staff and scepter, is followed by his wife, Hatkau, and his eldest son, Impy II. On the left, dressed in a similar fashion but with a different headdress, Impy is followed by his three daughters, Kerefet, Ity, and Tuit. Their names are inscribed above their heads along with the phrase "whom he loves." Between the two scenes is an offering formula written in three columns of hieroglyphics. This relief probably functioned as a door lintel of a mastaba, or funerary chapel, constructed by a wealthy private official near the burial pyramids of the king and his family. It possibly comes from a mastaba in the great necropolis of Saqqara in Lower Egypt and was excavated by the Egyptian Department of Antiquities in 1929-30. The style and technique of this relief are characteristic of the last part of Dynasty VI. A careful examination of the two figures of the elder Impy suggests that they were carved by two different artists, a practice not uncommon during this period. The figure at the left is slightly shorter with a more rounded belly, while the figure at the right is taller and more slender. -AB - ~ ~~~~~~~~~~ - 4- Sf * { r e 8 .. - _ _ , ; 7 L X . r 21</page><page sequence="16">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2  Foundation Figure Mesopotamian, C. 2300-2200 B.C.

Phinney Fund, 1994.122 The meaning of the horse heads that peer through the reserved panels on each side of this two-handled storage jar is unclear. The heads are painted in the black-figure tech- nique, and each wears a halter and faces right. Added red slip was used for the manes of the horses and for the lines that mark the edges of the reserve panels. Incised lines on the manes suggest locks of hair. Horses were the prerogatives of the aristo- cratic landed families who governed Athens and Attica from the ninth through the end of the sixth century B.C. Many horse- head amphoras have been found in Etruria, suggesting that they were prized for their design as well as for their contents, possibly wine or olive oil. Horse heads also have funerary connections when they appear in later grave reliefs. If these and related amphoras were awarded as prizes in athletic contests, they may have been precursors of the famous Panathenaic prize amphoras. The horse heads continue a tradition in Athenian vase painting in which painters, and presumably their cus- tomers, preferred large, iso- lated motifs to a rich variety of smaller ones on the sur- faces of their vases. This is the earliest intact Athenian black-figure vase in the Sackler Museum's ancient art collections. -DGM  24</page><page sequence="19">ARTHUR M.

Surviving intact bowls of this kind are decorated with horizontal zones of animals and imaginary composite creatures, such as the siren that appears here. The artist to whom this fragment has been attributed, Sophilos, is the first Athenian maker of painted vases to sign his name as both potter and painter. The surfaces of these elaborate vases, uninter- rupted by handles, formed ideal spaces for creating continuous horizontal bands filled with wildlife and figural processions, such as the gods of Mount Olympus riding in their chariots to attend the wedding of the goddess Thetis and the human hero Peleus, the parents of Achilles. This particular scene appears on two surviving dinoi by Sophilos and may well have decorated the shoulder frieze of the origi- nal wine bowl from which this fragment came. -DGM Black-Figure Hydria Depicting Herakles Playing the Kithara Greek, Athenian, c. 510 B.C. Ceramic, h. 38.1 cm Gift of the Florence Gould Foundation, Dr. and Mrs. Jerome M. Eisenberg, and William Collins Kohler, Purchase from the Alpheus Hyatt Pur- chasing Fund, Anonymous Fund in memory of Henry Berg, Henry George Berg Bequest in gratitude to John Coolidge, Gift of Leslie Cheek, Jr., and Director's Discretionary Fund, 1994.121 This virtually intact black-figure hydria depicts Herakles playing the kithara before a helmeted Athena. Herakles, wearing his customary animal skin, stands facing right. Athena faces him, wearing a high-crested helmet and aegis and holding a spear in her left hand. Behind Athena stands Hermes, facing left, holding a kerykeion (herald's staff) and wearing winged boots, a chlamys, and a pointed cap with a long brim. To the left behind Herakles stands a woman, facing 25</page><page sequence="20">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 26</page><page sequence="21">ARTHUR M. SACKLER MUSEUM right. Possibly Hebe, the wife of Herakles, she holds a branch and wears a long shawl over her peplos. The shoulder panel of the vessel is decorated with three pairs of hoplites (armored foot soldiers), all moving right and engaged in combat. The faces, hands, and feet of both goddesses are painted in added white slip. Added red slip decorates parts of the drapery, the animal skin, and the warriors' greaves. This exquisitely rendered and well-preserved vase, originally used as a water jar, was found at the Etruscan site of Vulci in 1833 and was part of the Campanari collection in Rome. Although a number of Athenian black-figure vases feature this scene, its interpretation remains unclear. -AB Two Fragments of a Plate by Psiax Greek, Athenian, c. 510 B.C. Ceramic, terracotta, h. i6 cm Gift of Dr. Dietrich von Bothmer, 1998.97 These two joining fragments belong to a circular plate probably pierced by two holes at the top so that it could be suspended from a wall, like a panel painting. Preserved are the hindquarters of a man wrestling with a stag, whose hindquarters are also preserved. This must be the greatest Greek hero, Herakles, performing one of the seemingly impossible twelve labors ordered by King Eurystheus of Argos: to capture and bring back the Cerynian stag to the king. A subtle draftsman equally at home in silhou- ette black-figure painting as here, with deli- cately incised details, and with the red-figure drawing technique, which had been invented only around two decades before he made this piece, Psiax created a number of such plates as well as many larger vases. He attained the very highest level of quality in vase painting at the time when the city of Athens was changing from rule by the Peisistratid family to a democracy. The underside of the plate is exquisitely shaped, with delicately and precisely formed ridges. -DGM 27</page><page sequence="22">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 Odysseus and the Ram Greek, first half of the sth century B.C.

Eisenberg and Purchase in partfrom the Alpheus Hyatt Purchasing Fund, 1991.63 Menander (342/1-293/89 B.C.) was one of the leading writers of New Comedy theater, which became popular in Athens around 300 B.C. and delighted Athenians with its humorous tales of the trials of daily life. This bust, which shows the poet emerging from a roundel or imago clipeata, is a copy from the second century A.D. of an original that was probably made around the time of Menander's death. It shows the playwright dressed in a chiton and cloak. His hair is short and wavy, his brow is furrowed, and his carefully articulated eyes gaze out- ward. The nose is a later restoration. An open scroll in the background is a reference to his trade, and an inscription in Greek on the border reads MENANDROS. Roundel busts such as this were often placed on walls to decorate the interiors of Roman theaters or the libraries of wealthy citizens. This bust was first known in the collection of the Hon. James Smith Barry of Marbury Hall, Cheshire, England, and was published in 1814 in a catalogue of his collection. Along with an inscribed bronze bust of Menander in the J. Paul Getty Museum, this sculpture provides evidence for the identification of this portrait type, of which there are close to fifty surviving examples. -AB Military Diploma Roman, dated 7 January 210 A.D. Bronze, hammered and incised, 14.9 x 11.4 cm David M.

Diplomas such as this, found throughout the Roman Empire and its provinces, existed in great numbers from the late Roman Republic through the time of Constantine the Great. One half of this pair of tablets was presented to the soldier, a member of the elite Praetorian Guard, while the other tablet, according to the text, was "posted at Rome on the wall behind the temple of the deified Augustus, by the temple of Minerva." After establishing the lineage of the reigning emperor, the text records the honorable discharge from imperial military service of members of the Praetorian Guard and stipulates, among other provisions, that the wives of these soldiers be recorded as their legal spouses. This tablet was purchased in honor of Professor Mason Hammond, Harvard Class of 1925, who dedicated his career as a scholar and teacher at Harvard University to Latin languages and literature and to the culture and history of the Roman world. AB Aphrodite Wearing a Bird Headdress Roman, from Egypt, 2nd-3rd century A.D. Bronze, solid cast, h. 14.8 cm Gift of Max Falk in memory of Joseph Ternbach, 1993.8 Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty, stands here in a characteristic pose with her right knee slightly bent and her left hip curving out. Her left hand is raised and holds a round object, possibly an apple or a pomegranate. Her right hand is extended to the front and holds the remnant of an attribute, now broken and unidentifiable. Her hair is parted in the middle over her brow and is gathered in a bun that extends down her back. A few tresses of hair escape and fall on her shoulders. Except for her unusual bird-shaped headdress, she is represented completely nude, as was popular from the fourth century B.C. through the Roman Empire. Small bronze statuettes such as this were com- mon during the Roman period and were used either as private devotional images within the home or as public votive objects. The bird headdress probably indicates that this figure comes from Egypt or the eastern edge of the Roman Empire, where several examples of Aphrodite with unusual crowns are said to have originated. The bird may represent a vulture and may serve an apotropaic function. -AB 30</page><page sequence="25">ARTHUR M.

With its serenely balanced composition and meticulously painted ornament, this painting is not only Shaykh Zada's masterpiece, but it demon- strates that he was one of the greatest practi- tioners of the late Timurid style of painting. Although the manuscript lacks a colophon, it was probably made-for Sam Mirza (1517- c. 1577), younger brother of the Safavid ruler Tahmasp I, for the prince's name is inscribed in another painting from the manuscript. The painting contains opening couplets to three odes from the Drvan, but Hafiz's text does not literally describe the unseemly episode taking place, in which a religious #1.

We are perhaps meant to understand the scene from the verses written above the main portico. This ode admonishes the cleric not to counsel the lover with reason, for by entering upon the stage of love, the lover has passed beyond the stage of reason. The gift of Incident in a Mosque compounds earlier generosity. The painting is now reunited with the manuscript's illuminated frontispiece, text block, and lacquer binding, all of which were earlier gifts from Stuart Cary Welch. -MM ATTRIBUTED TO AQA MIRAK Day of Judgment Folio from a manuscript of the Falnama (Book of Omens) of ja far al-Sadiq Iran, Tabriz or Qazvin, Safavid period, c. 1555 Ink, opaque watercolor, gold, and silver on paper; 58.5 x 43.7 cm (image) Gift of Stuart Cary Welch, 1999.3002 Attempting to predict the future was a wide- spread practice in the Islamic world. One of the most splendid tools ever devised for divination was a book known in Persian as the Falnama. To use this text, the seeker deter- mined an intended course of action and then opened the book at random; the text and illus- tration to which the book opened provided guidance as to whether the intention should be carried out. This spectacular, large-scale painting of the Day of Judgment is from a dispersed manu- script of the Failnaima compiled in Iran about 1555, probably for the Safavid shah Tahmasp I (r. 1524-76). The most flamboyant figures in the painting are the three archangels: One holds trumpets that announce the Day of Judgment; one holds scales that weigh good deeds against bad; and another contemplates the damned, who suffer punishments specific to their sins. Interceding for the dead are the Prophet Muhammad, seated under a green banner, and his son-in-law'Ali, standing in the center of the painting. Witnessing the event from above are eleven seated figures who represent the other imams, plus the Prophet's daughter Fatima, who appears as a flaming nimbus. -MM 32</page><page sequence="27">ARTHUR M.

A boldly calligraphic line of black and gold emphasizes the dragon's undulating spine; delicate pen and brush strokes render fine details of texture: tiny bristles on his knuckles, the scales of his hide, curling tendrils along his jaw. A subtle use of ink wash gives volume and contrast to the image and clarifies the intricate interlacing of motifs. The only known work signed by Mir Sayyid Muhammad, Dragon in Foliage is one of the most vivid examples of the sdz style, which had its roots in the artistic traditions of fifteenth-century Iran and flourished in the court arts of Ottoman Turkey in the sixteenth century. The word saz may derive from the reed pen used to create the drawings or from an ancient Turkish word referring to enchanted forests filled with fantastic crea- tures. The characteristic foliage of twisting, serrated leaves is often inhabited by birds or supernatural creatures such as phoenixes, dragons, or peris (fairies). Potent and enig- matic, numerous drawings of dragons in foliage have survived in imperial Ottoman albums compiled during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. -MM 34</page><page sequence="29">ARTHUR M.

This dramatic, yet sensitively rendered drawing has been attributed to Abu'l Hasan, one of Jahangir's favorite artists, whose technical expertise and keen sense of observation resulted in some of the most marvelous works produced for the Mughals. The drawing is nearly contemporary with an episode that occurred in 16io while Jahangir and his son Khurram (later Shah Jahan; r. 1628-58) were out hunting. As Mughal artists often accompanied their patrons on hunts and expeditions, it is possible that Abu'l Hasan Ali."

The dramatic story was narrated in the Jahdngirnama, the emperor's memoirs, and later in the Padshahnama, a chronicle of Shah Jahan's reign. A finished version of this episode was painted circa 1640 by the artist Balchand for inclusion in a copy of the Padshahnama (now in the collection of Windsor Castle), and he may have used this drawing as a model for the central composition. -RK ATTRIBUTED TO PAYAG The Battle of Samugarh India, Mughal period, c. 1658 Ink, opaque watercolor, and gold on paper; 22.4 x 32.6 cm Gift of Stuart Cary Welch, 1999.298 This remarkable tinted drawing documents the culminating moments of a battle that occurred on a scorching June afternoon in 1658 on the plains of Samugarh, near Agra.

N.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0 36</page><page sequence="31">ARTHUR M. SACKLER MUSEUM element of treachery, or perhaps just a cruel twist of fate, Dara was dealt a crushing defeat. This drawing has been attributed to the Mughal artist Payag, a master of historical narrative painting. Payag's topographic renderings of battle scenes contain lively and often gruesome martial swirls of activity in the fore- and middle grounds, and tiny vignettes in the distance are peopled by armies with horses and elephants. Here, the artist has conflated a succession of events in which participants are identified by tiny inscriptions in Persian. The central focus depicts Dara stepping down from his elephant to mount a horse, a signal tragically misread by his troops as a sign of surrender. Framing this are earlier episodes: the removal from his horse of a slain general loyal to Dara, and an attempt to capture Dara's brother and Alamgir's ally, Murad Bakhsh, who is seen fleeing on his elephant. -RK ATTRIBUTED TO USTAD MURAD Sujan Singh and Ladies Shooting Heron from a Terrace India, Rajasthan, Bikaner, 1710 Opaque watercolor, gold, and metallic pig- ment on paper; 31 x 22 cm (folio); with an inscription on the reverse in Devanagari: 1710 presented by Ustad Murad The Stuart Cary Welch Collection, Gift in grati- tude to John Coolidge, Gift of Leslie Cheek, Jr., Anonymous Fund in memory of Henry Berg, Richard Norton Memorial, Louise Haskell Daly, and Alpheus Hyatt Purchasing Funds, and through the generosity of Albert H.

Sujan Singh (r. 1700-35) spent the early years of his rule posted to the Deccan, where he remained until 1719 when he returned to Bikaner. This exquisite painting was probably a gift to the 37</page><page sequence="32">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 young ruler from Ustad Murad, one of his chief artists. The setting of this work might be the terrace of Sujan Singh's residence near Aurangabad. Ustad Murad's use of a subtle palette and his precisely rendered figures remind us of the familiarity of Bikaner artists with paintings produced in the Mughal court. Adding to the jewel-like beauty of this painting are pastel greens, pinks, and purples combined with delicately patterned details in an idealized composition, suggesting exposure to Deccani works of art. This fusion of elements contrib- uted to the Bikaner style of painting, which, at its peak, was superbly refined and elegantly innovative. -RK Krsna Swallows the Forest Fire Episode from the Bhagavata Puran.a (Ancient Stories of the Lord) India, Punjab Hills, Basohli, c. 1730 Opaque watercolor and metallic pigment on paper; 28.5 x 23 cm (folio) Gift of Suzanne and Frederic Weinstein in memory of Eleanor Dodge Barton and Marjorie R. Hubbard, 1991.177 This brilliantly colored folio may have once been part of a Bhagavata Purana (Ancient Stories of the Lord) manuscript, the early Hindu text that enumerates the earthly mani- festations of the god Visnu, preserver of the cosmic order. The most frequently illustrated portion of this text was the tenth chapter, which narrates the story of Visnu's incarnation as Krsna, the beloved cowherd prince. Krsna is portrayed here ingesting the flames of a raging forest fire that threatened to destroy the gopas (his cowherd companions), their cows, and all the forest creatures. Although some illustrations of this episode depict Krsna, the gopas, and the animals within a fiery landscape, here the artist por- trays Krsna alone in order to dramatize the moment when he manifests his divine power. The effect is enhanced by the dynamic posture given to Krsna and the dramatic contrast of his cool dark-blue skin against the whirling cres- cent of hot orange and red flames. According to the narrative, Krsna did not want his com- panions to see this display of his divine power and so instructed them to cover their eyes. We alone are privy to this marvelous event. -RK 38</page><page sequence="33">ARTHUR M.

Gordon and Emily Rauh Pulitzer, 1995.89 Hunting was a popular sport of the Rajput aristocracy, and in emulation of Mughal practice, paintings were commissioned to document these displays of royal prowess. The main character depicted here riding home on a richly caparisoned horse after a successful hunt is Maharana Bhim Singh (r. 1778-1828), the ruler at Udaipur, the Mewar capital. This hunting scene has been attributed to Chokha, who, like his father, the artist Bakhta (or Baghta), worked at both the Udaipur and Devgarh courts. Chokha painted a number of portraits and hunting scenes depicting Bhim Singh, who can be distinguished by his facial features and the nimbus-a prerogative of the ruling maharana-that surrounds his head. Typical of Chokha's style, humans are rendered amply and sensuously, animals are sympathetically characterized, and modeling is achieved by the use of minute stipples and crosshatches. -RK 7 7 D -M. 39</page><page sequence="34">HARVARD UNIVERSITY ART MUSEUMS BULLETIN - VOL. 7, NO. 2 _ -q~~~- Courtier's Robe Iran, Zand or Qajar period, mid-i8th- early 1gth century Silk, metal-wrapped silk, and cotton; main fabric of plain weave, float-patterned by discontinuous, supplementary wefts; multiple borders of dyed cotton, hand-printed cotton, and compound weave of silk and metal- wrapped silk; 1. 99 cm (neck to hem), w. 175 cm (cuff to cuff) Gift of the Estate of Margaret F. Schroeder, 1999.321 Because traditional Iranian fashion was remarkably constant over time, this close- bodied coat was a popular style for about two centuries at the courts of the Safavid, Afshar, Zand, and Qajar dynasties. The exaggerated flaring at the hip and the minute scale of the floral motifs place it into a later phase of this time frame. The almond-shaped buttons, of which only two survive, were essentially a decorative feature, for front-opening outer robes were rarely closed. An Iranian courtier would have worn this long-sleeved robe over numerous undergarments. The decreasing scale of the motifs allowed weavers to experiment with different pattern- ing techniques. Patterning wefts are usually woven in a regular binding structure (neces- sary to secure the weft over a large span), but here they float irregularly as needed to fill the width of a leaf or petal. The floats of brightly colored silk floss have a shiny, slightly convex appearance, creating a dramatic contrast with the flat matte ground weave of dark blue taffeta. -MM 40</page></plain_text>
