<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON A NEW VIEW OF THE NATURE OF THE MEDIAN CARPELS IN THE CRUCIFERAE EDITH R. SAUNDERS (Received for publication July 12, 1928) In a paper appearing in a recent number of this Journal, Eames and Wilson 1 re-open the question of the precise construction of the cruciferous gynoecium. As the result of their observations they concede that the gynoecium is composed of 4 carpels, 2 solid, median, and fertile, 2 valve- like, lateral, and sterile; but they qualify their acceptance of this view by superimposing on this main, fundamental conception the further idea that the ovules arise within the tissue of the solid carpels, and either push their way through this tissue and so come to lie naked in the loculus, or remain enveloped by it as with a skin. In support of this contention the authors cite only a single case, Lepidium virginicurm, but they state their belief that the condition which they describe as existing in this species is present in other genera of the family. To quote their own words (p. 253) "the ovules can only have attained a position in the loculus of an adjacent carpel by pushing out through the wall of the carpels bearing them." And again (pp. 261-2): How can ovules borne by a carpel lie outside that carpel and within the loculi of otlher carpels? The only answer is [italics mine] that their position must be a false or derived one. That this is the case is clear on structural evidence. The ovular traces are derived froin the inverted bundles (this is the typical origin from ventral bundles) and lead through long funicles to the ovules. These funicles pass out through the septum-evidence in itself that the ovules belong within the carpels. The septum wall cloaks, usually very loosely, the bases of the funicles, and may in some cases be clearly seen over the bases of the ovules. It is thus evident that the ovules have "pushed out" from the "solid" carpels, which bear them, and lie outside the carpel body, in evaginated folds of the septum wall. It will be observed that in the presentation of their case the authors proceed from argument on a priori grounds to evidence. If one starts with a dictum it clearly becomes necessary to prove it. Let us then first consider the merits of the dictum regarding the position of the ovules. The form of the opening question of the longer argument which re- asserts and amplifies the earlier pronouncement cannot be said to be altogether happy. For ovules, wherever they occur, if they are the super- ficial outgrowths from the carpel tissue that they have hitherto been believed to be, always do (in the ordinary meaning of the words) "lie outside the 1 Eames, A. J., and C. L. Wilson. Carpel morphology in the Cruciferae. Amer. Jour. Bot. I5: 25I -270. 1928. 122</page><page sequence="2">Feb., I929] SAUNDERS - CARPELS IN CRUCIFERAE I23 carpel that bears them." If, on the other hand, as the authors apparently intend, we are to inte,rpret this expression as signifying that the ovule lies in a loculus which is bounded partly but not entirely by the carpel that bears it, is not the question superfluous? Is it not obvious that this con- dition, which they appear to regard as anomalous, is to be found in all polymerous unilocular ovaries? Why then is any special explanation required in the case of the cruciferous gynoecium which comes properly under this category? The authors take the view that other investigators have failed to see that the positional relation of ovule and loculus in the Cruciferae needs to be 'explained,' yet they appear to take as a matter of course the condition obtaining in the ovary of Viola (see p. 252, text fig. 4). Now whether we adhere to the traditional view (which the authors apparently follow) that the ovary of Viola consists of only 3 carpels, or accept the more recent interpretation (based on the polymorphic theory) that it is composed of 6 carpels, it remains the fact that the ovules borne by any particular carpel lie in a chamber enclosed partly but not entirely by that particular carpel. But this is precisely the condition obtaining in the Cruciferae, as well in those types in which the two median carpels fuse for a longer or shorter distance on their inner faces, as in those in which their less extended development leaves the ovary unilocular throughout. In these circumstances there appears to be no ground on which any a priori argument in favour of an endogenous 2 development of the ovules in the Cruciferae can be based. Let us then turn from the dictum to a consideration of the evidence brought forward in its favour. It hardly needs to be said that a view which requires us to accept that the ovules of the Cruciferae develop in a manner profoundly differenlt from that in which they arise in other families calls for the most unequivocal evidence in its support. What is forthcoming is a diagrammatic figure of a single species (Lepidium virginicum); arguments such, e.g., as that "The often noted persistence of the seeds attached to the replum after the valves have fallen is doubtless due to this very enclosure of the funicles within the tissue of the septum" (p. 262): and statements culled from other authorities which the authors point out would fit in with their view, such, e.g., as De Candolle's description of the seed coat as "rather thick, sur- rounded as it were by a pellicle." After citing this description they have, however, deemed it well to add that "It is of course not wholly clear that this 'pellicle' represents the septum wall about the ovary [? ovule], but this seems probable" (p. 262). It will be convenient to deal with these points in turn. i. The evidence from Lepidium virginicum.

These two columns are prolonged inwards by loose assimilating tissue similar to the spongy mesophyll in a foliage leaf. The tw-o carpels at this level are radially continuous, no line of demarcation being visible either in this mesophyll or in the epidermal layer bounding the loculus on either side (text fig. I). As the median diameter of the ovary increases, a large central lacuna makes its appearance, separating the portion of mesophyll belonging to the one carpel from that of the other, so that the two are now connected only by the rather weakly coherent cells of the two epidermal layers as by two ropes (text fig. 2). At the level of origin of the ovules, of which there are two, one in each loculus, these carpels become disjoined, the epidermal layer is completed along the free inner face of both, the central lacuna disappears, and the tissue becomes generally more compact, owing, in part to the presence of the strand of vascular tissue which is given off from the main cord to the funicle, now seen in the inner angle of the loculus (text figs. 3, 4). Now an examination of the septum shows that at the free ends, where the tissue beneath the epidermis is devoid of chlorophyll, the epidermal layer remains joined to this subjacent tissue. But in the more central region, where the epidermis overlies spongy mesophyll, it becomes detached from the subjacent assimilating cells. This separation, which extends from the bottom of the loculus to the top, is due to the fact that as the superficial area increases the mesophyll tissue does not enlarge sufficiently to fill the whole space between the two epidermal layers. Cer- tain other genera show this feature in an even greater degree. In Capsella Heegeri, e.g., the chlorophyll-containing cells form loose chains after the manner of the cells in the sub-epidermal chambers in Mllarchantia. On the other hand, in types where the sub-epidermal layers of the septum consist of non-assimilating tissue, as in Lunaria and Ricotia, these cells remain in connection with the epidermis both in the septum aiid in the funicle. A section of a flower bud of Lepidium taken at the level of origin of the ovules shows that they are formed from the superficial tissues of the carpel. As the parts of the ovule become differentiated it can easily be seen that verse section of the flower showing the vascular cords for the 4 petals (diagonal), one of the two outer lateral stamens (the other has passed out into the already exserted filament which is not shown), the 4 inner stamens (diagonal) and the 4 carpels (orthogonal). 6.

For this distance the epidermis becomes loose from the underlying layer as it is in the adjacent region of the septum. But as the funicle begins to merge into the nucellus and its integuments, the spongy cells pass into a more compact type of tissue which remains in connection with the superficial layer. It appears then that the ovule is, as has hitherto been supposed, exogenous in origin, but that whether the superficial (epi- dermal) layer of any part remains in connection with the layer beneath or becomes separate depends, as it does also in the septum, upon the character of this underlying layer. It is clear that in this case the ovule does not perforate the tissue of the carpel. Until undeniable evidence of such perforation is at hand, one may be permitted to remain sceptical in regard to the suggestion that the ovule is originally enclosed by carpel tissue and that it develops, not in a proper loculus, but in an intercellular space which has neither defined boundaries nor a limiting cell layer. 2. The argument from the adherence of the funicles to the partition after the valves have fallen. A familiar instance of this condition is afforded by species of Lunaria in which it is exhibited in marked degree. Sections taken through a flower bud of Lunaria rediviva again show that the developing ovule is not enclosed in a sheath, nor does it burst through a covering layer of tissue. At this stage it is not even closely applied to the partition. The superficial layer of the funicle is clearly continuous with the subjacent tissue. So that again evidence in support of an endogenous origin of the ovules is entirely lacking. In these circumstances it seems unnecessary here to accumulate further negative evidence. For it has to be remembered, as I have emphasized elsewhere, that no solution of the carpel relations can be regarded as satisfactory for the Cruciferae which is not also applicable to comparable types among the Papaveraceae, Fu- mariaceae, and Capparidaceae; that in those members of these families with ovaries of more than 4 carpels the relations are the same as in those with only 4. Furthermore, if it be laid down that the solid carpel of a crucifer cannot bear exogenous ovules, then one must suppose that this pronouncement is generally applicable to solid carpels in other families, and hence one must then be prepared to hold that ovules are almost always endogenous in origin, since the number of types in which the solid and not the valve carpels are fertile far outnumbers, so far as observation has yet gone, those in which the relation is reversed. 3. Statements of other writers. Seeing that no evidence could be found under either of the two preceding heads to support the idea of an endogenous origin of the ovules, it seems hardly necessary to consider characters in the mature seed coat which could be harmonized with this conception were it found possible to establish it. But the dictum already discussed concerning</page><page sequence="6">Feb., 1929] SAUNDERS - CARPELS IN CRUCIFERAE 127 the ovules is followed by another relating to the carpels. The authors state (p. 253) that "Normally, in the majority of angiosperm families, a carpel receives three traces-a dorsal, or midrib bundle, and two ventral or marginal bundles." The reader might take this to be a statement of fact, but the statement holds only if the theory of polymorphism is rejected altogether. For the cords which, if the polymorphic character of the carpels be accepted, represent the midribs of consolidated carpels, are interpreted by those who adhere to the traditional view (that all carpels are of the valve type) as the marginal veins of two adjacent carpels which fuse along their edges. This will become clear if reference is made to the authors' figure of Viola (text fig. 4) which may be taken as illustrative of such cases. On the polymorphic view the ovary of Viola consists of 6 carpels, each of which receives a single cord which becomes the midrib. These midribs give rise, in the case of the 3 sterile members, to a pair of marginal veins, and in the case of the fertile members (here simi-solid), to twin placental strands.3 On the monomorphic view the 6 cords are taken to represent 3 midribs and 3 pairs of marginal veins. Now these "marginal " veins are not lateral. From the first moment of origin they are distinct from the midribs. Further, although these 3 latter cords, like the 3 midrib cords, leave the residual vascular cylinder as single bundles they are assumed to consist of a vein from the carpel on one side fused with a vein from that on the other, and in this way the carpels (regarded hence as only 3 in number) are conceived as receiving 3 traces each. But when one comes to a consideration of the Cruciferae, the question of adherence to the monomorphic or acceptance of the polymorphic view is not involved, for here the authors agree that consolidated as well as valve carpels are present. In their diagram (text fig. 5) of the vascular system of the ovary in this family, marginal veins to all 4 carpels are shown as arising not as lateral veins but separately and individually from an apparently continuous vascular cylinder. But in no crucifer genus that I have examined is this the case. If such a condition ever occurs in the development of the gynoecium it must be very rarely indeed.4 The two conditions met with as a rule are: (i) The case where the residual vascular tissue, after exsertion of the stamens, consists of 4 separate cords lying in the orthogonal planes, separated by broad medullary rays and enclosing a pith (text figs. 5, 6). These 4 cords become the 4 midribs of the 4 carpels. Those destined for the lateral members usually soon give off a pair of lateral veins (text fig. 9), sometimes even before the level of the loculus is reached, as is the case in Cardamine (text fig. 8). Those running to the solid carpels often continue undivided for some distance before giving off twin placental strands, or in cases where these cords are unusually massive, they may, on 3Saunders, Edith R.

(2) The case where the residual vascular cylinder shows not only the 4 cords in the orthogonal planes, but in addition 4 residual portions in the diagonal planes which also become cords.5 This condition is met with in many genera which, now and again, produce 4-valved ovaries. Here the 4 outer cords serve a whorl of 4 valve carpels, and the 4 inner ones, as many solid carpels. In both (i) and (2) only as many cords as carpels enter the gynoecium, and the secondary veins arise as lateral veins from these cords and not directly from the residual vascular cylinder. It thus appears that the authors' diagram (text fig. 5) designed to represent the mode of origin of the carpel vascular system in the Cruciferae in general is incorrect, in that it indicates that the pairs of secondary veins arise directly from the residual vascular cylinder instead of as lateral branches of the midrib cords. Similarly their diagram of Cardamine (text fig. 7), though correctly representing the arrangement at a later stage, does not show that the secondary veins in both types of carpel spring from the cords which become the midribs. In this latter case the erroneous deduction (of 3 traces to a carpel) is due to the fact that the authors' observations start at too high a level. I myself fell into this error at an early stage of these investigations when dealing with the case of IHypecoum. This genus, like most Cruciferae, has one whorl of 4 carpels in the orthogonal planes, but the very low level of origin of the valve marginal veins caused me at first to miss their true lateral origin (op. cit., p. 6I7). Among a very large number of genera belonging to many different families which have so far been investigated from the polymorphic stand- point, I recall but a single exception to the 'one cord to each carpel' rule,6 and in this case-that of Prunus-the cause of this exceptional behavior is not difficult to understand. Here the residual vascular tissue consists of a large number of bundles arranged in a ring. These bundles, one can scarcely doubt, represent the surviving remnants of the cords which in some ancestral form supplied one, or perhaps two, complete carpel whorls. To sweep together into a single consolidated cord a whole series of strands distributed around almost an entire circle might not only mean in this case the overcoming of a phylogenetic trend towards individuality, but might well involve a certain mechanical difficulty. Be that as it may, the surviving valve carpel does, in this case, receive a number of separate bundles. At a later point the authors appear to withdraw somewhat from their earlier position, for they state that " the number [of traces] in a few families is doubtless more [than 3], and in the case of reduced pistils the three bundles are clearly reduced to one." So that their generalization thus modified appears to say only that the number of traces to the carpel is 3 when it is not some other number. The authors lay great stress on the orientation of the (so-called) ventral 5 In Capsella Viguieri there is yet a third set of cords. 6 The Ranunculaceae and Leguminosae are still under investigation in this connection.</page><page sequence="8">Feb., I929] SAUNDERS - CARPELS IN CRUCIFERAE I29 pair of veins in the solid carpels. This attitude no doubt springs from the misconception regarding their origin, for as lateral veins their arrangement is natural, and what is to be expected. In an expanded valve carpel the midrib and lateral veins face the same way, as in any dorsiventral organ. In the solid carpel, as usually in a cylindrical organ, the veins all face the center. Whether the laterals face the midrib exactly, or at an angle, will depend upon the point in the circle at which they take up their position. The authors note that in Dicentra spectabilis these laterals are not truly 'ventral' but inclined at an angle to the midrib, but for the reason given above they apparently fail to appreciate that this orientation is the inevitable outcome of their intermediate position, and that here and elsewhere this relation has no special significance. That these bundles should, however, have deeply engaged the attention of the earlier observers who believed in a bicarpellary gynoecium is but natural, for on this view their presence at all calls for explanation, apart from the problem of their orientation. In this connection I would point out that the authors have misundern stood the description which they cite (p. 263) from my account of the vascular distribution in the solid carpel of the Cruciferae. I did not anticipate that the description of the main cord as sometimes becoming double, when read in connection with the context and with an illustration,7 could be taken to imply two radially placed halves. The feature referred to here is the fact that in some species the main cord divides in two, the two halves standing side by side. When the solid carpel has a considerable width, the two halves may diverge laterally and lie some distance apart, an arrangement which may well bear some relation to the distance which must be traversed by the placental branch in reaching the funicle. This condition is well seen in Lunaria rediviva (see text fig. 7), where this division of the solid carpel midrib is continued right up to the stigma level. (In this type the valve carpel midribs come to an end at a very early stage.) It is this splitting which is reflected in such stigmas as that of Crambe, which shows 4 ill-defined quadrants in the diagonal planes.8 In certain other instances where the authors have occasion to refer to my account of the Cruciferae, they so mis-render my view by the terminology which they employ (which the reader may take to be mine) that a clear disavowal of their version is rendered necessary. I. The authors state (p. 253) that they "follow Miss Saunders and earlier students in believing that the fertile carpels are reduced or abortive," and on p. 26I: "If the reduced fertile carpels be considered as reduced to their dorsal bundles (as suggested by Henslow, Miss Saunders and others), with the ovules borne upon these naked remnants of carpels," . . . . These statements are gravely inaccurate, and misleading. Indeed they could hardly be more so. For in my view the median carpels of the 'See Saunders, Edith R. On carpel polymorphism I. Annals Bot. 39: 136, fig. 31. I925. 8 Ibid., fig. 35. it</page><page sequence="9">130 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol i6, Cruciferae are not "reduced to their dorsal bundles," are not "naked," are not " remnants," and are not "abortive." I have been at pains to emphasize the fact that the dimensions of the median carpels, which in some genera (e.g. Matthiola) reach an appreciable size, are indicated by the two bulges in the median plane in the outer contour lines of the siliqua in most species. That is to say, I have made clear that they extend to the surface of the ovary between the valve carpels. Further, that they show, in addition to their vascular bundles and the colorless tissue which surrounds them, an epidermis on their outer and their inner free surfaces, and assimilating tissue. In other words their tissues are differentiated in the same manner as those of the valve carpels.' Yet the authors describe these median carpels as "abortive and specialized, yet still fertile." An organ which possesses all the features of normality and is functional cannot surely be appropriately described as "abortive." Nor is this the only case where the authors' preconceived ideas appear to color their presentation of the views of other writers. For one cannot but think that the reader would have a truer appreciation of the historical situation if it had been brought out in the part of their paper devoted to this aspect of the subject that among the numerous writers on the interpretation of the crucifer gynoecium, who, in the past, have put forward the idea of 4 orthogonal carpels, the great majority have supposed (as a perusal of their papers makes clear) that 4 were probably present in some ancestral form, but that two are suppressed or aborted (in the customary sense of the word) in the species of to-day. While the few (Lindley, Kunth, Kerner, and Klein) have held that 4 carpels exist as carpels in the present-day types. It is of some interest to note in this connection that Lindley (I828) based his suggestion on an erroneous idea (that the septum is double in the sense that the duplicate parts lie side by side), and an impossible analogy (between the median members of the crucifer gynoecium and the lateral members in Eschscholtzia, and vice versa); that Kunth (I83I-3), who disputed the priority of Lindley to this interpretation, advances no additional grounds in its support; that Kerner (I89I) gives as his reasons for this "divergence from recognized views" the late development of the placental commissures and the appear- ances seen in certain cases of antholysis; and finally, that although Klein (I894) based his conclusions on the sound evidence afforded by the vascular system, this evidence brought about no change in botanical opinion, no later writer on systematic botany up to the present time having (so far as I am aware) taken the view that G = 4, not merely in theory but in fact. 2. In regard to the Capparidaceae and Fumariaceae the authors write (p. 267): As to the nature of the placental region in these groups, the authors are again in agreement with Miss Saunders, believing with her that such placental regions represent See Saunders, Edith R. A reversionary character in the stock (etc.). Annals Bot. 37: 463. 1923.</page><page sequence="10">Feb., 1929] SAUNDERS - CARPELS IN CRUCIFERAE 13 I consolidated carpels-the 'solid' carpels of the Cruciferae. Their evidence is however again different from that presented by Miss Saunders, being derived from the vascular anatomy of the base of the ovary. The anatomy of this region is identical with that of the corresponding region of a cruciferous ovary. As in my account of the Fumariaceae (and analogous cases in the Capparidaceae) I have stressed the complete similarity of the gynoecium construction with that occurring in the Cruciferae, it should be clear that my ground for regarding the ovary as composed of 4 carpels is the same in each case, viz. that the ovary receives 4 vascular cords which become the midribs of the 4 carpels. The character of the "vascular anatomy of the base of the ovary" lies at the foundation of the theory of carpel poly- morphism and has been used throughout these investigations as the ultimate test of carpel number, though in many cases, as here, it has been possible to cite further corroborative evidence, such e.g. as the number or position of the stigmas, number and appearance of the sutures, and various other features. 3. It is perhaps not hypercritical to point out that a position defined by me as on "either side of the center line" is scarcely accurately rendered by the authors' expression "midway between the margin and the midrib" (pp. 265-6). Certain other points also call for brief comment. For example, on p. 256 the authors refer to "the very unusual relationship of the lower carpels to this upper pair-a nearly complete enclosure," and again on p. 261 they describe the upper set of carpels as having become enclosed by the lower set. But if 4 units together make up the circumference of a structure is it quite accurate to describe one pair of these units, even though they be smaller than the other pair, as being "enclosed" by the latter? Presumably no two sectors of one circle can be considered as enclosing the other two. At what point or degree of inequality between the portions is "enclosure" deemed to occur? This unusual form of description (unless I have mis- understood the authors) seems to me to lead to fallacious arguments, not only in the present case but when, e.g., reference is made to the placenta as though it were not an integral part of the carpel (see p. 252, "if the septum is not a placental outgrowth and really is made up of parts of the carpels," and p. 259, "If the septum is not placental, it must be carpellary"), and elsewhere. And again, to the funicle as though it were not an integral part of the ovule (see p. 262, "The funicles are nearly always loosely surrounded by the projecting pockets of the septum wall, but the ovules show no such loose cloak," and again, " Efforts to find stomates upon the ovules were unavailing"), yet we are told (p. 26i) that several species bear stomates on the funicLilus. The presence of these stomata is a very interesting feature, but are the authors justified in concluding that their distribution affords further proof that the funicle in these cases is enclosed in a layer of the septum, since</page><page sequence="11">132 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. i6, stomata also occur in this latter structure? In the crucifer the solid carpels (where they are disjoined) have a complete inner as well as a complete outer epidermis. This inner epidermis bounds an air-containing space and overlies assimilating tissue very abundantly supplied with chlorophyll in some cases, as in Lepidium. At the level of origin of the ovules in this genus some of this loose mesophyll as well as epidermal and vascular tissue are continued along the base of the funicle, which also lies in the air-con- taining loculus. As the funicle merges in the integuments, the loose chlorophyll-containing tissue ceases. We should therefore not expect to find stomata in the integuments (which are devoid of vascular tissue) even in cases where they occurred on the funicle. But if the superficial layer of the funicle is regarded as belonging to the septum (i.e., as being carpellary) on the grounds that it has stomata and is continuous with the epidermis of the septum, should not the subjacent mesophyll cells also be considered to be carpellary on the ground of continuity, and for that matter the vascular strand also? The logical outcome of such an argument would be to look upon the funicle as belonging to the carpel rather than to the ovule, but I do not gather that the authors are prepared to go so far as this. I am unable to follow either the authors' arguments and deductions in regard to stigma position or their criticism (if such it be) of my interpretation of the facts (see p. 266). In these circumstances it seems advisable, as briefly as possible, to restate the case. The value of the theory of carpel polymorphism in this connection is that it leads in the case of the Cruciferae to the view that 4 carpels are present-2 median and 2 lateral. This is the important point, not that the median pair happen to be solid. The position and in some cases the form of the stigma are indicative of the number but not necessarily of the character of the carpels. On the old monomorphic view the "commissurally-centered" stigmas typical of the family constituted an anomaly, only to be explained by a hypothetical splitting of the valve carpel apex accompanied by an equally hypothetical fusing of the halves of neighboring carpels. On the polymorphic view there is no difficulty, and hence no need to have recourse to morphological fictions. If the median carpels alone bear stigmas there will be two, "commissurally- centered." In the less common case where 4 independent stigmas are formed, both types of carpels bear them. The two pairs may then be functional and similar (Matthiola incana, Cochlearia armoracia),1, or the two pairs may be dissimilar and only one functional, as in the familiar case of Parolinia. From this latter type of case the authors incidentally deduce "that there are two quite separate whorls of carpels in the crucifer pistil, and the outer set are distinctly lower and embrace the inner set" (see p. 266, also the Summary and elsewhere, where the valve carpels are described as 10 See Saunders, Edith R. A reply to comments on the theory of the solid carpel and carpel polymorphism. New Phytol. 25: 303, fig. I. 1926.</page><page sequence="12">Feb., I929] SAUNDERS - CARPELS IN CRUCIFERAE 133 enclosing the solid pair). This statement is at variance with the facts. The outward appearance of the gynoecium might suggest that the valve carpels stand higher than the median pair, but could not possibly be in- terpreted in the opposite sense. This external appearance is, however, deceptive. All 4 carpels, in fact, arise at the same level, i.e., as one whorl, as is at once apparent when the test by which we judge other floral whorls is applied to them, viz. the level of emergence of the vascular cords (see text figs. 5, 6). The authors apparently adopt a dimerous ground plan for the Cruciferae, and are concerned therefore to bring the gynoecium into line with this interpretation. As the valves are described by them as embracing the solid carpels they could not very well be supposed to stand higher than the others; it therefore becomes necessary to make them arise below the solid members in order to complete the scheme. But now that we have full knowledge of the order of origin of the vascular cords in addition to the evidence of ontogeny, there no longer remains any ground on which a dimerous ground plan can be upheld. The whole body of facts are, on the contrary, in harmony with the following formula: 11 K2 + 2 orthogonal (derived, there is good reason to believe, from an ancestral condition in which the calyx formed a single whorl, K4). For in types having 4 equal nectaries the two pairs of sepals, as noted by Godron,'2 are almost equal in size. In such types the vascular cords for all 4 sepals are found to leave the residual vascular cylinder at the same level (see text fig. io). Furthermore this view enables us to understand why the members of the corolla arise as one whorl on the alternate (diagonal) radii. C4, diagonal. A4, orthogonal, though in most cases the two median members are suppressed. This view is confirmed by the two following facts: (i) In early vigorous flowers of some genera (e.g. Matthiola) one or both of the missing members are sometimes present; (2) In species of Senebiera and in Lepidiztm virginicum the two median stamens are usually the only ones present, the two lateral members together with the whole inner whorl being absent. But exceptionally 3 stamens are formed, which may then be disposed in any of the following ways: 13 2 median i lateral (right); 2 median I lateral (left); i median (posterior) 2 diagonal (antero-lateral); I median (anterior) 2 diagonal (postero-lateral), unexpected confirmation of the full formula in a type showing a minimum degree of development. +4, diagonal. The 4 vascular cords leave the vascular cylinder simul- taneously and in line with the petals (text fig. 5). The old idea represented in the formula A22 is quite erroneous, and should no longer be perpetuated in our textbooks. G4, orthogonal. 11 See Saunders, op. cit., I923, p. 48I. 12 Godron, D. A.

On the other hand, the bulk of the residual xylem in the lateral plane passes out to the lateral stamens, while a small remnant is made to suffice for the ster- ile valves (text fig. 6). It seems therefore not improbable that consolidation of the median carpels may have been the prime cause of the suppression of the median stamens. Further evidence that the crucifer flower is constructed on a tetramerous ground plan [K2 + 2 derived from K4 C4 A4 + 4 G4 (+ 4)] is afforded by the 4-valved ovaries which occur occasionally in so many different genera. In these ovaries two carpel whorls are developed. All 4 members of the outer (orthogonal) whorl in this case are of the valve type, all those of the inner (diagonal) whorl are solid. The fact that all the members of each whorl are of the same class allows the simultaneous origin of the vascular cords for each whorl to be seen in perfection. Such ovaries, when viewed from outside, often show one pair of valves standing at a much higher level than the other pair. This difference in the level at which the valve form is assumed is however as deceptive here, in regard to the true level of origin,'4 as is the outward appearance in the ordinary i-whorled ovary that the lateral valve carpels arise at a higher level than the solid members. We find corroborative evidence again in that most interesting form Capsella Viguieri, which is probably unique among the Cruciferae in having as a constant feature a third carpel whorl. This third whorl is isomerous with the other two, and in typical flowers the whorls are tetramerous.'5 Before leaving this subject I would urge that, seeing that the recognition of the polymorphic character of carpels has dispelled the old ideas which have clung around the replum framework and its inward extension, causing it to be regarded as a unique structure peculiar to the Cruciferae (and certain members of allied families) and deserving of a special designation, it would be wholly to the good if the terms 'replum,' now rendered superfluous,' commissural,' now obviously inaccurate, and 'false' (as applied to the partition) with its anthropomorphic taint could be allowed to fall into disuse. Lastly the authors reject the idea of a distinction between the solid and semi-solid forms of the consolidated carpel (p. 266) and criticise the value of the secondary venation system as a criterion of carpel boundaries. But with regard to the lateral venation system one may point out that they themselves employ this very criterion as a means of fixing the line of junction between one (supposed) valve carpel and another in Viola (see text fig. 4); is it not therefore somewhat inconsistent to impugn its value for the same purpose in the case of the Cruciferae? 4 See Saunders, op. cit., I923, p. 460. 15 For a fuller account of the gynoecium of Capsella Viguieri see Saunders, Edith R.

It is therefore convenient to be able to distinguish these two forms when they are well defined, even though in the less extreme cases they shade into one another. As the conception of the solid carpel has provided a satisfactory solution of the long-standing puzzle presented by the crucifer siliqua, so the conception of the semi-solid type has served to elucidate such different forms as Epimedium, Begonia, and Fritillaria imperialis. The silicula of the Cruciferae offers in general a less straightforward case, owing to the fact that until fertilization has taken place the vascular system of the ovary, in many genera, at least, as e.g. Capsella, Iberis, and Lunaria, consists solely of the midribs together with (in the case of the fertile carpels) the placental strands. Only as part of post-fertilization development does further secondary venation make its appearance. Nevertheless one may presume that this later development reflects the character of the carpels unless we obtain definite evidence throwing doubt on this supposition. Now if an ovary of Capsella Bursa-pastoris taken shortly after it has been fertilized is rendered transparent and mounted whole, the first development of this post-fertilization venation system is easily traced. Fine vascular strands can be seen turning out both from the lateral and the median carpel cords. The former usually branch almost at once, the latter generally run transversely for a much longer distance before breaking up into the network which eventually connects the two sets of laterals. As the lateral veins are formed in order from above downward, it is possible to obtain a stage in which the connections have been completed between the upper laterals but in which the lower ones still end blindly and hence clearly show from which midrib they take their rise (text fig. I I). The evidence from develop- ment as well as the appearance of the pattern seen in the mature fruit and the results of injecting with a colored fluid are thus all in harmony,'6 and support the conclusion previously advanced that the median carpels are consolidated and develop a distinct lateral expansion, i.e. they are semi- solid, while the lateral carpels are small contracted valves. Precisely the same relations are to be seen in Iberis, another angustiseptal type (text fig. 12). In Lunaria rediviva, a latiseptal form, the origin of some of the lateral veins from the consolidated carpels is particularly easy to trace. For here, in the flowering stage, the lateral carpel midribs end blindly at the ovary base, hence the uppermost lateral veins, which arise first after fertilization, are formed only by the consolidated carpels (text fig. I3). Again the difference between the flat expanded silicula of Capsella Bursa-pastoris and the top-shaped fruits of its derivative C. Heegeri becomes intelligible if one supposes a shift of balance to take place between the two 16 See Saunders, op. cit., 1925, pp. I38 and I39 and fig. 20.</page><page sequence="15">I36 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY [Vol. I6, 13 12 TEXT FIG.

At this stage the vascular bundle in the funicle is only differentiated part way towards the placental strand, hence these bundles appear as so many detached lengths and are therefore easily distinguished from the secondary venation system of the fruit wall, which springs from both the lateral and the median carpel midribs. These secondary veins have already become connected up by a network in the upper part of the ovary, but in the lower portion</page><page sequence="16">Feb., I929] SAUNDERS CARPELS IN CRUCIFERAE I37 pairs of carpels, of which one pair shows the semi-solid character either in a greater or lesser degree; greater in C. Bursa-pastoris type and the grades approaching it, to a less extent in forms of C. Heeger'i, which dehisce, not by a clean split but by a ragged tear in the fruit wall, which leaves a narrow wing on each side of the median carpels after the valves are shed. Finally, one wonders what explanation the authors offer of another crucifer, viz. Bwnias. Here is an illustration of the semi-solid carpel which is diagrammatic in its simplicity. For the median carpels give off a pla- cental strand in the middle line and also a pair of lateral veins which, in every way, are the counterparts of those formed by the lateral carpels. Thus there is a body of evidence all fitting in with the interpretation here given of the silicula in the types cited above. Eames and Wilson reject this interpretation, but without adducing any evidence in support of their view or attempting any explanation of the above facts. Is it perhaps the case that the conception of the semi-solid carpel does not fit well with the notion of the endogenous ovule? SUMMARY The median carpels of the Cruciferae are held by Eames and Wilson to be of a quasi-solid nature. In proof thereof they state that the ovules arise from these carpels endogenously, but neither the a priori argument which they develop nor the evidence wh;ch they allege in support of their views is found, when further examined, to support this conclusion. I am greatly indebted to Miss D. F. M. Pertz for kindly making the accompanying drawings. both those given off from the lateral and those from the median carpel midribs still end blindly. The latter midribs are not exactly superposed but lie a little to the right and left of the middle line, respectively. TEXT FIG. I2. Iberis semperfiorens.

Towards the apex the first-formed, post-fertilization, lateral vein is seen on either side arising from a consolidated carpel midrib.</page></plain_text>
