According to the latest dating methods, the three- thousand year duration of Neolithic society, from its incipient phase to its climax, extends from 6500 to 3500 b.c. The most significant remains left of this culture are its many figurines, which are made of marble, clay and bone and which appear by the hun- dreds in European excavations. Usually small enough to fit with ease into one's hand, these artifacts are rather stylized in their form and execution; in spite of their formalism, how- ever, they convey a great deal about the people who made them and their religious beliefs and rituals. They are found most often on specially elevated structures or platforms within the house- holds; these platforms are situated next to ovens and seem to have functioned as domestic shrines. Many of the figurines are depicted as masked, a fact of particular iconographie interest and im- portance. What follows is intended as a brief survey of these masked figurines: their geographical dis- tribution, their historical occurrence, and, so far as can be determined, their religious and social significance. ^íeolithic man, in adapting the mask to his own modes of ritual and artistic expression, was following an ancient tradition established by his Palaeolithic forebears many millennia before the new food-producing economy began to transform life patterns throughout southeastern Europe. This economic transformation occurred some time around 7000 b.c., and during the next thou- sand years, there took place in this part of Europe a roughly uniform cultural development which attained relatively high levels of sophisti- cation in many of its aspects, particularly in the art of sculpture. This development is represented in the Thes- salian Plains of northern Greece by the "Sesklo" culture; in the central Balkans (Yugoslavia, Ro- mania and southeast Hungary) by the "Starčevo" culture. From about 6500 to 6000 b.c., the ceramic and stone wares produced by these cul- tures were numerous and noteworthy. Figurines with oval, diamond or triangular masks have been recovered from excavated settlements dating back to this time. The mask alone, either plastic -• or painted, was also an important decorative 263</page><page sequence="3">A white-slipped clay phallic pillar or stand with a removable mask.

Sesklo culture, ca. 6000 b.c. motif on ceramic vessels and other objects. For example, masks are modeled in relief on the cylindrical necks of large vases, and they are also present on carved marble figurines. Such practice is attested, for example, by the impressive body of relevant material recovered at an excavation I conducted in 1973 at Achil- leion, near Farsala in northern Greece. Two hundred whole and partial figurines as well as a quantity of vases were found. Masked heads adorn the necks of vases, and almost all of the faces of the figurines are masked. These finds in- cluded a unique and hitherto unknown type of artifact, a cylindrical stand with a discrete re- movable mask. The mask was modeled to slide securely onto the conical pillar, whose sloping sides prevented its total descent. Two such com- pound pieces were found; both belong to the Sesklo culture. Their discovery in well-defined strata dated by radiocarbon tests would place them about 6000 b.c. The Achilleion materials and other masked figurines from the Thessalian region contribute to the understanding of those different, more ab- stractly rendered Neolithic pieces in which the mask is a less clearly defined projection from the pillar neck. I believe that the mask represents a superhuman personage, a deity. Furthermore, it 264</page><page sequence="4">Chalcolithic Old Europe and its regional groups at the climax of development in the fifth millennium b.c. is quite clear that not one but several specific gods are being represented by certain sorts of masks; each deity is indicated by characteristics of the mask and of the bodily posture which are consistently associated with it. One figurine type of the pçriod extending from 6500 to 5500 b.c. depicts a standing female with arms crossed over the bosom. Her neck and head are cylindrical - that it to say, phallic - and the eyes, nose and mouth are plainly articulated. Another type of figurine is without a mouth, and the nose is beaked to suggest a divinity in bird-women form. Ahe Chalcolithic era, which extended from roughly 5500 to 3500 b.c., was Old Europe's most flourishing period. By that time, civilization in Europe had crystalized in some ten geographic and cultural districts, each of which had de- veloped a characteristic style of ceramic art - and with it a particular way of treating figurines. Common to them all, however, was the portrayal of masked faces devoid of realistic features. Artists of the Vinca culture produced notable examples of such masks.

On many Vinča figurines the mask is clearly out- lined, its angular projections extending beyond the face it purports to conceal. Vinča masks, moreover, display considerable variation of form: the roughly triangular or oval shapes of the sixth millennium developed, by the fifth millennium, into pentagonal forms; thereafter, the pentagon remains the basic shape for masks from the Mid- dle Vinča and Late Vinca periods (5000-4000 and 4000-3000 b.c., respectively).

At its culmination in the period around 4000 b.c., the Vinča style enriched the plastic form with incision and painting, and the range of shapes was extended to include peaked ovals, broad triangles and lozenges. The most striking sculptures representing the climax of Vinča art are the monumental, almost life-sized heads from the site of Predionica at Pristina in southern Yugoslavia. ML were Neolithic masks intended to por- tray? That some represented deities of various sorts has already been mentioned, but there are others for which no answer is available. But the majority can be roughly categorized in terms of their generally human or animal features. They are, in fact, clearly a blend of human and ani- mal forms - quasi-bird creatures, combinations of man and bull, man and he-goat, woman and bear, woman and pig, woman and water bird. All have the mysterious and decidedly awesome qualities appropriate to their religious and ritual essence. In Vinča art specifically, beaked and mouthless masks predominate; the human form with avian features symbolizes the attributes of the Bird Goddess. The postures of certain figurines, and the signs incised Upon them, further help to distinguish what the masks represent. This is especially true of those figurines depicting gods and goddesses, some of which can be identified in a general way. A few such identifications can be briefly cited. Masks with bird- or snake-like features were probably used for representations of one of the two ancient water deities, the Bird Goddess and the Snake Goddess. A figurine depicting preg- nancy is taken to represent a Fertility Goddess. The Goddess of Regeneration (the Great God- dess) is an anthropomorphic deity with animal features or an animal mask. The nonhuman ele- ments represent animals of symbolic significance - bees, butterflies, deer, bears, hares, toads, turtles, hedgehogs or dogs. They are symbols of certain aspects of the Goddess' control over life, her powers of death and regeneration with re- spect to all living things, human, plant or animal. A young vigorous male deity was often repre- sented by an ithyphallic dancer with the mask of a horned animal, such as a bull or he-goat. A final point to be made about the interpretation of these masked figurines of gods and goddesses 268</page><page sequence="8">Bird Goddess' mask in the form of a duck's head, now in the National Museum, Belgrade. Especially noteworthy are the semicircular eyes, the deeply incised F-signs above the eyes, traces of black over the forehead and beak, as well as four holes for attachments. Height, ca. 5 cm. Late Vinca. Photograph, courtesy of M. Djordjevic. Head of a Vinca figurine wearing a mask with stylized semicircular eyes and F-signs in the corners above the perforations. The seven pairs of perforations in the crown probably served for attachments which have not survived. Height, 6.4 cm. After M. M. Vasič, Praistorijska Vinca , III. is that the masked sculptures symbolize one of two things - either certain deities, or else masked worshipers who are dressed in the likeness of a deity for • the purpose of performing a ritual. Thus the animal-masked dancer may be an archetypal Dionysos or a worshiper of the Great Goddess. Many Neolithic masked figurines have perfora- tions in the mask itself and in the flattened top of the head; these holes were provided for the insertion of various decorations and accouter- ments. For the most part, these ornaments, which were made of organic materials, have not sur- vived. There is evidence, however, that plumes, flowers, fruits and other natural decorations were used to enhance the figurines; the heads of Minoan figurines from Crete, for example, were periodically decked with poppies, pomegranates and horns as well as with crowns having repre- sentations of birds and snakes lifting their heads above the head of the figurine. The ornaments probably related to the type of divinity repre- -• sented by the mask. Thus, plumes apparently adorned masks depicting the Bird Goddess ; snakes and ribbons those representing the Snake Goddess; fruits and flowers the masks of the Pregnant Fertility Goddess - the Great Goddess of Regeneration. Tlhese masked figurines all strongly imply that our Old European ancestors were versatile in their use of religious symbols and quite devout. It is not inconceivable that clusters of figurines were used in the household shrine for the purpose of representing - indeed, possibly even reenacting - significant mythical events and ritual perform- ances, much as was done in ancient Greece, and even today in the creche which decorates many houses at Christmastime. A variety of gods and goddesses were assembled, and their masks were such as to make clear who they were. The masked figurines are of very great import- ance in the culture history of Europe. They con- stitute a direct religious expression from the earliest and perhaps most formative levels of European civilization. Predating the glory of Greece by some five thousand years, they provide an essential understanding of religious elements which persisted in the gods and cults of Crete and Greece.
