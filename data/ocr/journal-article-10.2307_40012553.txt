<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEOLOGICAL REALISM JEROME GELLMAN Ben-Gurion University of the Negev I In philosophy of religion there are two views on the logical status of reli- gious language. These are called in the literature "cognitivism" and "non- cognitivism," respectively. The cognitivist affirms that at least some religious language is typically used to make assertions (true or false). The non-cognitivist denies what the cognitivist affirms, holding instead that the uses of religious language are all non-assertional. Non-cognitivists have stressed the emotive, conative, regulative and persuasive functions of religious language. Now, let us say that a person, S, is a religious believer if there is a set of sentences, G, each of which is about God, such that S uses the sentences of G in typically religious ways to talk about God. Initially, then, we identify a believer not by the propositions he believes, but by the kind of language he uses. The religious language of a particular religion, of a religious tradi- tion, or of the "Judaic-Christian tradition" is definable alternatively either as the union or as the intersection of the sets, G, of certain believers, or as an authorized, official set of sentences, G, or as the union or intersection of such authorized sets of sentences. Hereafter, I shall refer indifferently to all of these as "religious language" ("RL"), unless otherwise noted. In order to focus on meaning, rather than truth or justification, I want to consider the cognitivist believer and non-cognitivist believer, rather than simply the cognitivist and the non-cognitivist views of RL. The non-cognitivist believer while employing a RL similar to that of the cognitivist denies that any sentences of RL have truth-value, and thereby avoids any ontological commitment to God. For him, RL is "about God" in a linguistic sense only, that sense having to do with the role the word "God" plays in his discourse. The non-cognitivist believer resembles a type of instrumentalist in philosophy of science. This type of instrumentalist is prepared to use a theory having theoretical terms, but denies any truth- value to its theoretical sentences. That the theory is about theoretical Int J Phil Rel 12:17-27 (1981) 0020-7047/81/0121-0017 $01.80. Â©1981 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, The Hague.

A further point of resemblance between the two is that the instrumentalist employs a theory solely for its effectiveness as a technique, for the purpose of predicting observations. As far as he is concerned, to "believe" the theory is just to use it for that aim. The non-cognitivist believer too uses RL solely as an effective technique to achieve certain aims (e.g., to express deep emotion, express intentions to live a moral life, etc.). He is a "believer" just in that he does use RL, for those purposes. Because of these similarities the non-cognitivist believer may be said to espouse theological instrumentalism ("TI"). We may distinguish two types of cognitivist belief. The reductive cogni- tivist believes that at least some sentences of RL are true, but like the theo- logical instrumentalist makes no ontological commitment to God. Rather, he reduces the sentences of RL to sentences of profane discourse. I shall simply beg the question here against reductive cognitivism and consider only the second type which includes both (a) the assertion that some sentences of RL are true and (b) an ontological commitment to God in a non- reductive way. Let us call this view theological realism ("TR"). It is important to be clear on what distinguishes TR from TI. The instru- mentalist's language in use may be indistinguishable, or nearly so, from the realist's. It may possess ostensible features of propositional meaning such as linguistic transformations, translations, and deductive relations, as well as include ostensible signs of ontological commitment to God, such as pro- nomial references tied to the word "God," substitutivity of "God" in ref- erentially transparent contexts, and even the sentence "God exists." The instrumentalist differs from the realist in what he believes about the language he uses. For him, both the assertional character of his RL, as well as its ontic machinery are illusory. This is not because he reduces his religious language to a different language in his "regimented theory" of the world, in which he asserts what he really believes (cognitively), but because for him RL, despite appearances, is devoid of any cognitive, pro- positional content at all. Thus his ontology is not dictated to by his use of RL. The theological realist, on the other hand, takes the assertional and ontological features of RL seriously, and in his regimented theory of reality both reasserts at least some sentences of the RL that he uses in the religious life and ontologically commits himself to God. Whether a believer is a realist or instrumentalist, cannot, therefore, be determined by looking at his language alone. If we acknowledge the possi- bility of instrumentalism, we must admit the possibility of divorcing one's beliefs and ontology from one's language in use. So, the apparent realist commitments of RL can always be dismissed instrumentally. We may distinguish two questions about TR versus TI. The first is: Are</page><page sequence="3">19 believers in fact realists or instrumentalists about their religious language? The second: Which view is a better proposal for believers? The first, while not without philosophical interest, is basically a question addressed to the social sciences. The second calls for arguments in favor of one or the other view. No answer to the first question could settle the matter for the second. If it were established, for example, that believers were actually realists, this fact would be entirely consistent with there being decisive arguments in favor of TI.1 Let us therefore consider TR and TI as competing proposals for religious belief, and let us weigh the considerations that can be brought in favor of one view rather than the other. Initially, the facts favor TR and place the burden of proof upon TI, for at the onset, linguistic morality creates a presumption in favor of TR. After all, since RL does bear internal marks of assertion and of commitment to the existence of a subject matter, it would be perverse for the believer to disown the realism of RL unless he had a good reason to c}o so. The instru- mentalist, therefore, is called upon to overcome the prima-facie case in favor of TR. He can, of course, point to the obvious and prominent non- cognitive functions of RL, such as the emotive, conative, inspirational, etc., but this doesn't count at all against TR. The realist cheerfully acknow- ledges the variegation of non-cognitive uses of RL, but adds to them the assertional function. And, after all, the same language, and even the very same sentence can be used simultaneously both assertively and emotively, conatively or whatever. Since the realist in any case recognizes non-cognitive uses of RL, the theological instrumentalist can hope to make TI an attractive alternative to TR only by setting forth difficulties with the view that in addition RL has an assertional function. These difficulties need not be decisive against TR, but merely strong enough to counter the initial case in its favor. Historically, theological instrumentalists supported their view with some general theory of meaning, or other, such as the verifiability principle or translatability into a sense-data or physicalist "empiricist language." It was argued that RL could not qualify as cognitively meaningful, given one or the other of these criteria of meaning. So, if, nonetheless, one wished to persist in using RL, one would have to adopt an instrumentalist attitude towards it. It is highly unlikely, however, that any such general theory of meaning can do the trick, since it is doubtful whether any theory of meaning can be formulated which excludes religious discourse and at the same time is independently acceptable. In any event, the issues surrounding theories of meaning are wide-ranging and highly-complex, and a treatment of them will not be attempted here. Instead, I will focus on three problems which when taken together form a case against TR, but which do not arise for TI. Strictly speaking, these problems, except perhaps for the second, do not favor TI over a view which holds that RL is false (hence cognitively</page><page sequence="4">20 meaningful) yet instrumentally useful or indispensable.2 But I will not consider that view here. 1) In the first place, there is the problem of the predicates. Often, predicates applied to God in RL seem to imply by their very meaning the having of a body as well as bodily behavior on the part of their possessor. This is true not only of "gross" anthropomorphisms ("sits," "speaks," and the like), but also of predicates such as "is just" or "is loving." This seems to be a fact about these predicates themselves, not a consequence of a general theory of meaning.3 Yet it is essential to RL that God has no body at all. Hence, these predicates beg elucidation. The task is two-fold: to explain what these predicates mean when taken not to entail bodily exist- ence, and also to explain why these predicates are used in such a seemingly unfamiliar way. Attempts to solve this problem have been less than impres- sive. Now of course from the fact that these predicates appear to involve bodily behavior and from the fact that they have not (to my mind) been satisfactorily explicated until now, it does not follow that they are meaningless in the religious context or that they cannot or will not be ex- plained. Nonetheless there is a persistent, stubborn problem with these pre- dicates, which is a problem for TR. The problem of the predicates does not exist for the instrumentalist. He may supply some kind of "super" body in the background of his religious imagery and think of the divine predicates accordingly. Such pictures in the mind suit the avowed instrumentalist aims of RL. Imagery alone, not asser- tion, is the function of the "divine predicates." True enough, RL typically includes "God has no body," but that too is for him but another piece of language, alongside the bodily predicates, having instrumental value only. In any event, since for him none of RL is used assertively anyway, no contradictions occur in his discourse (more on this below). 2) Typically, RL contains sentences seemingly sortally incoherent. To say things like "God is love," or "God is His goodness," is on the face of it to identify God with some attribute or other, whereas otherwise God is spoken of as a thing or person. Such sentences seem, therefore, to disobey metaphysical constraints upon meaningful predication, in accordance with which the categories "object" or "person" are mutually exclusive with "attribute."4 The onus is surely upon the realist to make coherent, cogni- tive sense of these prima-facie sortal incoherences. Of course, attempts have been made to do so, but it is not clear that they have been at all successful. Typically, they rely upon terms like "essence," "essential property," "necessary existence," and the like, which themselves are con- troversial and require elucidation. Also, because these prima-facie incoher- encies mesh so extensively with other parts of RL, it would be implausible for the realist to suggest that they form an isolated purely instrumentalist enclave in his otherwise realist language.</page><page sequence="5">21 For the instrumentalist the problem of sortal incoherence does not arise. After all, his RL is cherished solely for its usefulness, and there need be no constraints, either grammatical or sortal, upon what is useful from the in- strumentalist point of view. One may question whether just anything verbal is "language," but that's a minor problem easily adjusted. 3) Finally, there is the problem of apparent inconsistencies within RL. These include the problem of evil in various forms, the problem of fore- knowledge and free-will, paradoxes of omnipotence, various alleged in- compatibilities between divine predicates, the clash between transcendance and immanence, the doctrines of incarnation and the trinity, and so on. Furthermore, more fundamentalist RL often has entailments in conflict with what is commonly believed in avowedly cognitive discourses, giving rise to conflicts between "science and religion." Of course, that these problems exist does not in itself in the least count against TR. First of all, apparent inconsistency is fully compatible with actual consistency. And secondly, even actual inconsistency is compatible with realism. However, a realist posture requires a readiness to make required readjustments in one's theory in the event that a contradiction really is discovered. One cannot be a realist and rest content with contra- diction. This readiness to solve contradictions has two expressions: the active attempt to re-formulate one's theory, and the present recognition of the offending formulation as an interim makeshift to be abandoned as soon as satisfactory adjustments have been made. Now a common feature of religious belief is the tenacity with which believers hold their RL, tending to preclude in principle the very possibility of tampering with its language or taking it as makeshift or provisional. RL is dogmatic in a way that scientific theories are not. This is not to say that dogmas do not change. They do. But what typically results is new dogma. This dogmatism remains steadfast in the face of the large number of prima- facie inconsistencies in RL. The attempts to work through these problems take place wholly within the given language, and the possibility of revising the very terms of the problem is hardly countenanced. The longer these problems prove recalcitrant, the less justified is such an attitude from a realist point of view. It is an insincere realism that will invariably prefer tenacity in the face of prima-facie inconsistencies, to revision in principle and the possibility of conferring provisional status upon RL. There is an inherent attractiveness in instrumentalism for a language that remains dogmatic in the face of apparent inconsistencies. After all, there is no reason why a language cannot at the same time be actually inconsistent (from a cognitivist point of view) and yet be perfectly suited to the instru- mentalist needs of its speakers. From an instrumentalist point of view, dogma is rooted in the suitableness of the language to serve such permanent deep-seated needs, and is free from the requirement to record a</page><page sequence="6">22 consistent reality. For the realist, on the other hand, the consistency of the language must not be subservient to its instrumental value. Now these problems are not decisive against TR, but taken together do make TI an attractive alternative. This attractiveness is stronger for not being based on any controversial general theory of meaning. Rather, the argument is that an instrumentalist view of religious language is more reasonable than a realist one, based on an inspection of that language itself. TI is more reasonable than TR because it avoids suspicious predications and sortal incoherence, as well as propositional dogmatism in the face of recalcitrant charges of inconsistency. II I believe that the initial attractiveness of TR can be re-established by a logical reconstruction of the realist approach to RL. Towards that purpose I propose a two-tiered reconstruction of TR. The more fundamental tier I shall call the realist basic doctrine, and the higher tier, the realist theory. As I shall construct it, the basic doctrine displays the actual use of RL and RL gets its most fundamental core of cognitive meaning in the basic doctrine. At the same time realist commitments are restricted therein to a level at which the problems raised agains TR in Part I are vitiated. Next, the realist theory is a program to over-lay the core-meaning of RL at the basic doctrine with additional components of realism that had been omitted at the base. I shall argue that the reinstatement of the prima-facie case for TR at the level of the basic doctrine is independent of the success, or lack of it, of the realist theory. Recall that TR includes both (a) the assertion that at least some sentences of RL are true, and (b) an ontological commitment to God in RL. Now, if the realist wanted to distinguish levels of cognitive meaning in RL he could not restrict the first level to (a) alone, without (b). For the assertion that RL has true sentences, without an ontology of God, would require a reductive cognitivism. Rather, the realist could begin with (b) at the basic level of meaning, and add (a) at a second level of meaning. As paradoxical as it may seem, that a believer is ontologically committed to God, does not entail that the RL he actually uses is intended to have truth value. And this very lack of entailment vitiates at the basic level the problems with realism. Let's see how this goes. Let what we have hitherto called RL, hereafter be called religious object- language ("ROL"). Now I propose that in the realist basic doctrine the sentences of ROL have no truth value. They serve instrumentalist ends only, and none of them reappear, at this level, in the believer's regimented theory of reality. So far, then, the basic doctrine is indistinguishable from</page><page sequence="7">23 TI. Nonetheless, the basic doctrine differs from TI by having an ontology of God. How is this possible? This is accomplished in the meta-language, by the statement: (3jc) (ROL is about jc). Suppose, for example, we take the emotive function of RL as representative of non-cognitive uses. In the basic doctrine, ROL has this emotive function, and has no assertive role. But this is compatible with the meta-linguistic assertion that ROL expresses emotions towards God. In the religious meta-language ("RML") it is asserted that something exists such that ROL is about it in just the sense that ROL is expressing emotions towards it. "God," then, plays a role in ROL similar to that of an El variable, naming just that x of RML that ROL is about (in the above sense). A believer who holds that ROL is emotive, and not assertive, and also provides in his RML a subject matter towards which ROL is expressed is maintaining a minimal realism. His religious language in use conforms to a non-assertional view (agreeing in this with instrumentalism), but in his official theory of reality he reveals the belief that there exists a being towards whom his ROL is directed. An analogy may be helpful. Suppose we define Bob Object-Language ("BOL") as the set of sentences: "Hooray, Bob!" "Yeah, Bob," and "Good going, Bob!." Now none of the sentences of BOL has truth-value. Let Bob meta-language ("BML") contain the single sentence: "(3x) (BOL is about *)," and let "Bob" name that x that according to BML, BOL is about. Then Bob language, comprised of BOL and BML, contains an ontological commitment to Bob, though none of the sentences of the object language have truth-value. Yet the sentences of the object language are about Bob. The analogy to Bob language is not complete, since outside of Bob language presumably there are sentences describing Bob and saying who Bob is. At the level of the basic doctrine, however, there are no sentences outside of RL (ROL + RML) by which to describe God and say who He is. Nonetheless, there does exist a minimal concept of God in RL given con- textually, viz., as that thing towards which ROL is directed, or ROL is about. It may be objected that one is not able to express emotions toward a being that one cannot describe in some way or other. Hence, the language of the basic doctrine would not be functional. However, the emotive use of RL was only meant to be representative of non-cognitive uses, not exhaustive of them. I believe that the emotive, conative, and inspirational uses of RL, and perhaps others, are rooted in a more basic non-cognitive use: the expression of pro-valuational feelings and attitudes towards God. Focusing on this evaluative use of religious language, in the basic doctrine the sentences of ROL need not have truth-value. They may be no more than the expression and evocation of certain feelings toward God that can be characterized as feelings of high commendation or of worship. That</page><page sequence="8">24 these feelings are valuations of something in existence is stated in the meta- language, hence the ontological commitment to God. Thus the sentence "God is worthy of worship," can play a dual role in the basic doctrine. It can be in the object language, used itself to express sentiments of worship towards God. But it can also be given a meta-linguistic meaning, wherein it expresses the belief that there exists a being towards whom the object language is appropriately used, i.e., (3*) (the evaluative use of ROL is appropriate to x). Once again, "God" appears in ROL as the name of just that being who is a value of the existential quantifier in the meta-language. The emotive, conative, and inspirational uses of RL, and perhaps others, are supervenient upon this non-cognitive evaluative use of RL, and upon the basic belief that there exists a totally perfect being, worthy of worship, expressed in the meta-language. By being ontologically committed to God, while yet construing the sentences of ROL instrumentally (as lacking truth value), the basic doctrine is a minimal departure from TI. And this minimal realism, as I have called it, is capable of meeting the objections against TR brought in Part I. First, the problem of the predicates does not arise for minimal realism, since it, like TI, does not use divine predicates cognitively. The predicates used of God are chosen, rather, for their evaluative, emotive, etc., capabilities only. The minimal realist deals in a similar way with prima-facie inconsis- tencies in his religious discourse. Since the terms of the prima-facie incon- sistency are interpreted instrumentally, and not cognitively, the problem need not worry him any more than it does the pure instrumentalist. Finally, the minimal realist has a neat analysis of sortal incoherencies in RL. In line with the evaluative function of RL, he construes them as persuasive defini- tions. Sentences like "God is love," are disguised attempts to transfer to "God" the network of pro-evaluations and feelings surrounding "love." (Compare, for example, "God is true goodness," with "Strong self- discipline is true freedom.") What we feel towards "love," it is being said, should be felt (instead?) towards God. In this way, sortal incoherencies are given instrumental meaning. The upshot is that minimal realism emerges as a viable alternative to theological instrumentalism. The realist interpretation of RL has as its foundation the core-meaning of the basic doctrine, as characterized above. Upon this base is built the realist theory. The realist theory is a theory of God. The data for the theory of God is the basic doctrine itself, and the question the theory attempts to answer is what sort of being it is that the basic doctrine is about. To put it differently, the theory is an attempt to say what a being must be like in order that the evaluations and emotions, etc., expressed in the RL of the basic doctrine be appropriate to it. Realists sharing the same basic doctrine may have competing theories of God, as influenced by their value theory, metaphysics, and religious intui-</page><page sequence="9">25 tions or allegiances. In fact, what makes them competing theories is the shared basic doctrine taken as the same data for each theory. This is also the sense in which they are different theories about one and the same God, i.e., the being to whom the RL of the basic doctrine is fitting. In principle, the sentences of the realist theory might none of them be part of the basic doctrine, since it is possible that the sentences used instru- mentally about God may not be asserted prepositionally about God. In practice, however, at least some of the sentences of the basic doctrine are affirmed propositionally as well. This completes the realist thesis, TR, which I defined as combining an ontological commitment to God with an assertional view of at least some RL. In the realist's theory of God we should distinguish the theological object language ("TOL") from the theological meta-language ("TML"). The TOL consists of those sentences of ROL reaffirmed propositionally. The choice of the TOL requires a decision between three groups of ROL sentences: the purely instrumental, the metaphorical, and the non- metaphorical. The purely instrumental are excluded from the theory of God altogether. The metaphorical are asserted to be true, but are translated into non-metaphorical ROL. For example, "God sees my every action," may get translated into "God knows everything I do," and "God is my shepherd," into "God loves me." Admittedly, the division between metaphor and non-metaphor depends on what analysis is to be given, since it may turn out that even "God knows everything I do" is itself metaphori- cal, on a given analysis. At the level of TOL, the division represents more of a commitment to a program of analysis wherein the criteria of metaphor and non-metaphor will be found. The result of the process of selection and translation is a core-set of ROL that is asserted non-uietaphorically about God. At the level of TOL there is no analysis of the language, and the idea of a realist authorized language about God finds its place at this level. Dogma, realistically interpreted, requires believing that certain sentences are propo- sitionally true of God, non-metaphorically and non-reductively, but there is no insistence on how such sentences are to be analyzed. Indeed, one characterization of the adherents of a dogma is that they form a community of persons who speak a certain way and have a realist meta- belief about their mode of speech. Many believers may never get beyond the bare belief that the TOL is to be asserted propositionally about God, while they themselves infuse TOL in their own discourse with no propositional meaning whatever. This is not an empty gesture. Their own use of TOL conforms to that of the basic doctrine, being instrumentalist in the fashion of minimal realism. Their belief that the same language is true of God is tantamount to a belief that some program or other of analysis of TOL will succeed, in accordance with</page><page sequence="10">26 which true propositions about God are expressible in a natural way by the very same sentences used by them non-propositionally. In the theological meta-language ("TML") we come to the realist attempt to analyze TOL, and to a full-blown theory of God. The central criterion of success here is whether the analysis fits the basic doctrine, that is whether the being that emerges from the analysis is such that RL, on a minimalist realist interpretation, is appropriate to it. Realists sharing the same TOL may have differing initial intuitions on the matter. Some may claim, for example, that no being who shares any properties with creatures can be an appropriate object of RL. Others may deny this. It is important to emphasize that the TML is not at all intended to ana- lyze the way religious language or the TOL is actually used by realist believers. Instead the TML intends to go beyond actual use to a theory of God. The actual realist use of religious language conforms to minimal realism and only places constraints of adequacy upon one's theory of God, in the way mentioned in the previous paragraph. In addition, the theory in the TML may be fluid, experimental, and frequently changing. The same may be said for the TOL, except for the restraints of dogma upon it. The major task of the TML is to analyze the divine predicates of the TOL. Three types of views are possible: (1) the view that divine predicates are univocal with the same predicates in profane discourse, (2) the view that divine predicates and their profane counterparts are equivocal, and (3) an analogical view. The first must overcome the "problem of the pre- dicates," of Part I, which poses a prima-facie case against univocity. The second is obligated both to provide the special meanings of divine pre- dicates and to justify the borrowing of profane predicates to express these special meanings. The third view must develop an acceptable theory of ana- logy in general, as well as make an acceptable application of it to God. Combinations of these views are possible, whereby some divine predicates may be rendered analogically and others literally, for example. A second task for the TML is to deal with the problem of prima-facie in- consistencies internal to the TOL. Those lying outside the TOL may remain at the instrumentalist level of the basic doctrine. The realist will hope to deal with problems of consistency via a proper analysis in the TML of the divine predicates whereupon the problems will dissolve. I have argued else- where that not all prima-facie inconsistencies can be handled in this manner. At least some will have to be resolved entirely by arguments in the object language or else simply accepted "on faith."5 Finally, in the TML the realist will have to tackle the problem of sortal incoherence in his object language. At this point realism promises to become highly metaphysical. In summary, my logical reconstruction of theological realism recognizes levels of meaning in religious discourse. At the core of RL lie the instru- mentalist non-assertional uses (in the ROL of the basic doctrine), com-</page><page sequence="11">27 bined with a minimal realism consisting of an ontological commitment to God (in the RML of the basic doctrine), A sub-set of ROL is elevated to the status of propositional truth (in the TOL of the realist theory), and the program of analysis of these truths then ensues (in the TML of the realist theory) giving rise to a theory of God. I have already shown that at the level of the basic doctrine, that of minimal realism, the three problems raised against TR in Part I do not arise. Furthermore, the basic doctrine is, relative to the realist theory, self- sustaining, in the sense that its meaning and its ability to meet, the problems with TR are independent of the success of any realist theory of God. In fact one can be a minimal realist at the basic doctrine level without having any theory of God at all. The basic doctrine is impervious to the failure of theory. It is rather the secure base upon which theories of God get built. Those theories are to be judged on their merits. If found wanting they will have to be replaced or revised. But that need not require any revision of the basic doctrine itself. It follows, I believe, that there is no longer a case for TI as against TR. It also follows that since religious language typically possesses features of propositional meaning such as linguistic transformations, translations, and deductive relations, as well as signs of ontological commitment to God such as pronomial references, substitutivity in referentially transparent contexts, and the sentence "God exists," then in the name of linguistic morality there is at least an initial case in favor of theological realism.

I therefore agree with the following remark by Kai Nielsen, "If we are to analyze the meaning of religious utterances, we must take as our given the first-order religious dis- course of the various confessional groups . . .
