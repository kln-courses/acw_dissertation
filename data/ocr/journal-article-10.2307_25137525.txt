<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BULLETIN OF THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART IN TWO PARTS TWENTIETH YEAR FEBRUARY, 1933 NUMBER TWO: PART ONE A BRONZE VISHNU THE little figure' reproduced on the cover of the Bulletin falls under the general category of bronze by virtue of similarity of patination. Actually, it is made of brass, which, like copper, has been far more usually employed than bronze in India. The whole is now invested with a moderately shiny, dark green, to which in some places the metal itself adds a brownish tint. Other parts are entirely encrusted with a lighter green, easily observed in the photograph. Makers of religious images must necessarily keep within certain iconographic bounds, in order that worshipers can distinguish one deity from another. Thus, it is by posture and attributes rather than by appearance that the idol under discussion is identified as the old Vedic god, Vishnu, who has more recently taken his high place as the protector in the Hindu trinity, along with Brahma, the creator, and Siva, the destroyer.2 Here he is seen in that pose known as yogasthanakamurti, which means that it is a standing image of Vishnu to be worshiped by yogis. He has four arms, each of which is held in a symbolic attitude. In the upper right hand he holds the disc, or chakra, with which he is supposed to have cut down his enemies; in the upper left is the mace, or gada, that he employed for a similar purpose; the lower left grasps the conch, or sankha, on which he blew to terrify his adversaries; and the lower right, holding the lotus, or padma, is in the pose designated as varada mudra, signifying charity. He stands on the circular pedestal that takes its name, padmapitha, from the lotus petals encircling it. According to Rao,2 the sankha, chakra, and gada are peculiar to Vishnu. To one unfamiliar with Indian religious pieces the little god is at first more laughable than laudable, but a brief explanation of his background may help to put him in a more favorable I Total height I3W (34 cm.). 2 See T.

He was made in western India and evidently, judging by the features, for or under the influence of the Jain religion, best known in the Occident by the small, illustrated leaves of many manuscripts. Both the Buddhists and the Jains have freely appropriated gods from the Hindu hierarchy, changing them during the years only enough to satisfy their own special needs. But the Jains have gone further and built up a rigid set of rules that permits to the fashioners of images the minimum of individuality of expression. In India this is not considered an impediment, for "art is here a function of the social order, not an ambition. The practice of art is typically an hereditary vocation and not a matter of private choice. The themes of art are provided by general necessities inherent in racial mentality, and more specifically by a vast body of scripture and by written canons; method is learnt as a living workshop tradition, not in a School of Art; style is a function of the period, not of the individual, who could only be made aware of the fact of stylistic change and sequence by historical study. Themes are repeated from generation to generation, and pass from one country to another; neither is originality a virtue, nor 'plagiarism' a crime, where all that counts is the necessity inherent in the theme."' Thus, the figure of Vishnu was produced by a man skilled in the casting of idols, who was simply supplying the demand for his output, with no thought of art in his mind. The result is a stiff-legged image modeled above the hips according to the symmetrical and pleasing sense of design current at the time, emphasizing curves and angles, with no attention to planes and straight lines. That the piece has a good deal of naive appeal or charm can hardly be denied by a Westerner capable of conquer ing its element of strangeness. The reason for the existence of such an image is adequately explained by Rao.' "To the Hindu, the omnipresent God, who is the father of the universe, appears to reside in everything, as much in the loving heart of the devotee as in stocks and stones. His God may or may not be conceived as anthropomorphic; the form of the conception depends upon the stage of advancement of the worshipper in the culture of divine knowledge and spiritual wisdom. To a yogin, who has realised the Supreme I A. K. Coomaraswamy's "Introduction to the Art of Eastern Asia," The Open Court, March, I932, p. 213. Op. cit., Vol. I, Pt.

The Hindu sastras prescribe image worship to weak unevolved persons in particular. The 7abala upanishad distinctly asserts that the yogin perceives Siva in his heart, and that images are meant for ignorant men." The figure was cast according to the cire perdue process, possibly in the twelfth century, but certainly before I400. H.C.H.</page></plain_text>
