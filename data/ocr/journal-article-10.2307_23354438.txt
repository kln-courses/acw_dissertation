<plain_text><page sequence="1">Elhanan Yakira The Anachronism of Parallelism: A Chapter in Historical Irony When I first became Professor Yirmiyahu Yovel's assistant - I was then a rather shy student, grappling seriously with Spinoza's texts for the first time - I used to address him, the distinguished teacher, as precisely that - Professor Yovel. He soon explained to me, with, if I recall correctly, a mixture of irritation and amusement, that I should call him Yerri. Which is what I have been doing ever since. Yerri indeed has become since then the world renowned Spinoza scholar we all know. Not only did he write important studies on Spinoza - notably, on his Marrano roots - and not only has he made Israel into a central meeting point for Spinoza scholars from all over the world, but he has also made a special and much appreciated contribution to the local interest in Spinoza, both academic and public. During the long years of collaboration on and around Spinoza we have had, of course, our disagreements. But since it has not been with Professor Yovel that I have had to disagree, but with Yerri, it has been part of the fun. On Spinoza too we did not always see eye to eye. The following paper is a typical example. It falls completely within Yerri's fundamental idea of Spinoza as a philosopher of immanence; it departs from him on a specific point - that of parallelism. Yerri has not written much on the mind-body question. Although sometimes - e.g., in chapter 6 of his Spinoza and Other Heretics, vol. 1 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1989) - it seems that he attributes to Spinoza some kind of parallelic thinking, he has always rejected the idea that what unites mind and body for Spinoza was a relation of parallelism. In this, I think, he was right. The very rich literature on Spinoza's philosophy deals extensively with what we refer to as the mind-body question. More often than not, Spinoza's theory about the unity of mind and body is referred to as a kind of "parallelism."</page><page sequence="2">100 Elhanan Yakira If the first part of the Ethics establishes the substantial unity of thought and extension - or what is known as Spinoza's monism - the second part fleshes out the abstract metaphysical principle of unity by developing a concrete metaphysics of man and a philosophical anthropology based on a peculiar theory of the mind-body unity. E2p7 is usually taken as the key for understanding the latter. It famously says that "the order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things," 1 and it is usually interpreted as meaning that the "union of mind and body" is a similarity of order or of structure, or what is called sometimes "isomorphism" or, more precisely, a "parallelism" of the mind and the body. According to a recent work, which seems to typically accept its allegedly unproblematic exegetic value, the parallelism thesis means "that for each thing there is a corresponding idea, and for each idea there is a corresponding thing... [and] in each case, the idea enters into causal relations with other ideas that match the causal relations the corresponding thing enters into with other things. The networks of ideas and of things are causally isomorphic."2 In what follows I wish to offer the beginnings of a (future fuller) refutation of the parallelism thesis. I aim to show that the pertinence of this concept as an exegetic key to Spinoza's mind-body theory is, at best, limited; in fact, it is detrimental not only to an adequate appreciation of the so-called mind body theory, but also to a better understanding of Spinoza's philosophy in its entirety. Despite its quasi-universal presence in the literature on Spinoza, and despite a number of Spinoza's own pronouncements that seem to give credibility to this interpretation, it in fact conceals the full significance of 1 The Collected Works of Spinoza, ed. and trans.

One of the more curious aspects of his discussion is the way in which it takes as apparently unproblematic the notion of mental causality, or "causal relations," allegedly holding among ideas. Another typical formulation is to be found in Jonathan Bennett, A Study of Spinoza's Ethics (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1984), a classic of Spinoza scholarship: the parallelism doctrine "seems to be the doctrine that there is a one-one relation correlating mental items with physical ones, mapping similarities onto similarities and causal chains onto causal chains" (127). About what I for one take to be the core of Spinoza's mind-body doctrine, namely, that the mind-body relation is an idea-object relation, Bennett says that "this is not a doctrine ... but merely terminology" (ibid.).</page><page sequence="3">The Anachronism of Parallelism: A Chapter in Historical Irony 101 Spinoza's doctrine rather than explains it. The interested reader will thus find in the following pages a part of a more general discussion of the parallelism thesis; notably, it contains an inquiry into its genesis as a key interpretative term in the literature on Spinoza. Although iconoclastic in many ways, Spinoza's thinking on this matter was an immediate reaction to Cartesian dualism. According to the customary view of the major difficulty involved in Cartesian dualism, the latter is a theory about the fundamental furniture of the world or the entities which constitute reality: there are two separate kinds of thing in the world, two "stuffs," as it is sometimes called. It is difficult, if not impossible, to give an intelligible and satisfactory theoretic account of the ways in which these stuffs are related. The difficulty results from two contradictory claims imposed on the Cartesian dualist: there is a radical difference of nature between these two stuffs; they are somehow connected or related to each other. The first claim is purely conceptual (a priori); the second, a fact known through undeniable experience. But every relation - causal or otherwise - that may link these two stuffs presupposes some elementary common denominator or shared qualities, a condition rendered impossible by the first assumption. Cartesian metaphysics - this is the meaning of the cogito - is thus an assertion of the absolute unavoidability of the concept of 'spirit' or 'thought' in any serious attempt to give a scientific and a philosophical account of man. It is also an assertion of the existence of a counterpart of thought - matter or extension - as well as of the union in man of thought and extension. It is, thus, a metaphysics of two (created) substances - mind and matter or thought and extension - where 'substantiality' means that these are real entities which are ontologically independent and conceptually irreducible to one another, but which are also somehow connected in man. It is undoubtedly true that Cartesian metaphysics, especially the thought extension dualism, is the framework within which the modern mind-body question was framed. This has been so already since the second half of the seventeenth century, and its specificity vis-ä-vis its pre-modern discussions depends to a large degree on the so-called scientific revolution. As the new science was rapidly gaining the status of the one true science of Nature, the nature of body had to be understood in terms borrowed from the mechanistic theory of matter. This was also the background for Spinoza's discussion of man in general, and of the mind-body problem in particular. But this was not the whole story. In many ways - and this was true for Descartes too,</page><page sequence="4">102 Elhanan Yakira and certainly for Spinoza, Malebranche, and Leibniz (just to mention a few names) - the full context of this discussion was much more complex and rich and, so to speak, multi-layered, than what has come to be known as Descartes' dualism and his mind-body theory. Because the full context of the early modern discussions is not always fully taken into consideration, dualism and of the debates about and יcontemporary accounts of Descartes around it are sometimes limited and even distorted. This is presumably also one of the reasons for the ease with which the parallelism exegetic thesis has become universally accepted as Spinoza's alleged solution to this problem. There are exceptions, of course, but by and large it seems that there is in fact a quasi-unanimous agreement that Spinoza's doctrine is a doctrine about mind-body and thought-extension parallelism. Treating the mind-body question, or any other major philosophical question for that matter, outside its historical context is anachronistic. It conceals, for example, the fact that the mind-body question as it is understood in our times, and as it is often read back into the seventeenth century, is conditioned by the appearance of new fields of scientific conceptualization and research, by the institutionalization of scientific, medical, and social practices, or by the professionalization of diverse forms of taking care of human beings. It is notably the emergence of the fields of psychology and experimental psychology and, more recently, of what is known as neuroscience and cognitive science, as well as the need to coordinate between different scientific disciplines and their typical ways of theorization, which affect current attempts to understand seventeenth-century discussions of mind and body. The ways in which the mind-body question is raised in contemporary discussions often take for granted the existence of a certain scientific culture and ignores the latter's historicity. The fact that the 'mental' has become the subject of theorization and that a science of the 'mental' has been institutionalized is relatively recent. Although it had been anticipated in Descartes and his successors, the real terms of the question have been deeply transformed: from a philosophical attempt to understand human nature - as a thinking thing, of thought and of reason, and as a moral agent or as an agent tout court - it has become a question about the possibility to coordinate different, allegedly parallel, scientific discourses, therapeutic practices, and scientific, academic, and medical types of institution. The anachronistic discussion of classical philosophy masks the real stakes of its grand debates as well as the full significance of the changes that have taken place since. In particular, it glosses over its sense as a living</page><page sequence="5">The Anachronism of Parallelism: A Chapter in Historical Irony 103 philosophical concern, namely, its emergence as a whole body of problems, a whole problematique, with its own inner logic. Indeed, rather than an interrogation about the relation that holds, or should hold, between different scientific disciplines and practices, its thematic core was supplied by the rapidly changing relations between science and philosophy. The emergence of the 'new science' as an autonomous field of intellectual work raises the question of the pertinence of the notion of different, sometimes competing or at least not compatible, rationalities - philosophical and scientific - and of the sui generis nature of philosophical knowledge and the possibility of a properly philosophical theorizing. Spinoza never uses the term parallelism. As is well known, it was coined by Leibniz; more importantly, he used it in the context of his critical discussion of Spinozism. It was not used by Leibniz, however, as a convenient representation of Spinoza's doctrine of the unity of mind and body, but, on the contrary, as a title of his own doctrine. In fact, Leibniz conceived the term of 'parallelism' as expressing a principle which is radically opposed to Spinozism, both in the field of ontology, and in that of the theory of rationality. The term itself first appears in several technical - mathematical and logical - writings, and in the sense that interests us here, in a famous phrase in Considerations sur la doctrine d'un esprit universel unique (1702). Leibniz criticizes in this work what would become known as 'pantheism' or, more precisely, different versions, ancient and modern, of alleged Averroist negations of the existence of particular, or "separated," souls. He portrays Spinoza as belonging to this tradition, and then explains his own, opposite, position: "I have established a perfect parallelism between what happens in the soul and what takes place in matter."3 This parallelism, which is just another name for the general principle of harmony, is supposed to offer a systematic defense of the substantiality of the particular, or individual, soul, a position diametrically opposed to Spinoza's, at least according to Leibniz's portrayal of him. On other occasions, directed explicitly and exclusively against Spinoza, Leibniz exposes his radical opposition to Spinoza on this matter: Spinoza says (E3p2s) that spirit and body are the same thing, only expressed in two different manners, and (E2p7s [i.e., the parallelism proposition]) that the thinking 3 In G. W. Leibniz, Philosophical Papers and Letters, ed. Leroy E. Loemker, 2nd ed. (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1969), 556 (Gerhardt, 6:529-538).</page><page sequence="6">104 Elhanan Yakira substance and the extended substance are one and the same substance, that one conceives either under the attribute of thought or under the attribute of extension.... I contest this. Spirit and body is not the same thing, no more than the principles of action and passion.4 There is indeed a real irony in the fate of parallelism. Not only a Leibnizian term, expressing a radical opposition to Spinoza, has come to designate Spinoza's doctrine, but, moreover, this very use of the term risks reversing the whole sense of the controversy. Although he too goes beyond it, Leibniz can still be said to think within the framework of the Cartesian and Occasionalist problematique: he tries to show that order alone, or structure, are enough to rationally explain a union between what is metaphysically separate. This idea transcends the more restrained nature of Descartes' dualism (let alone its contemporary readings) as it is conceived by Leibniz as a general principle of rational thinking: it is true of mind and body relations as a special case of other, seemingly disparate, entities or realms of reality - theological, ethical, and political - which can thus be rationally related. For Spinoza the terms of the difficulty are different altogether: the sameness of order or structure - parallelism - is an obvious and trivial element of unity. Spinoza reverses, in fact, the order of the argument. He did not mean to offer a better solution to the difficulty Descartes raised; he wanted to show that it was a pseudo-difficulty and that it was based on completely wrong presuppositions. What had been for Descartes a fact one needs to explain - the union of the body and the soul - became with Spinoza the first principle, the non plus ultra of rational explanation, the ultimate condition of the intelligibility of everything else: the absolute unity and uniqueness of reality and, hence, of mind and body. For Descartes this non plus ultra had been the cogito, namely, the metaphysical experience in which the I as a thinking substance was discovered. The union of soul and body was a fact we should accept and trust as truth, on the basis of the demonstrated veracity of God, but without fully understanding its nature, or without attaining full intelligibility of this fact. What makes the Leibnizian notion of parallelism seem applicable to E2p7 is the use of the words ordo et connexio. The concept of 'order' and particularly its function as a foundation of scientific rationality, however, is no less Leibnizian than the notion of 'parallelism'. For Leibniz, indeed, the 4 Leibniz, Refutation inedite de Spinoza, ed. M. de Gaudemar (Aries: Actes Sud, 1999), 25, my translation.</page><page sequence="7">The Anachronism of Parallelism: A Chapter in Historical Irony 105 former is a generalization of the latter. Spinoza, on the other hand, expresses often by 'order' the idea of the contingent and rather arbitrary givenness or factuality of natural things, which from the philosophical point of view constitute rather disorder. On other occasions he underplays the philosophical pertinence of the concept of 'order', depicting it as an anthropomorphic construct of reality. Isomorphism, or identity of structure existing between two disparate entities, or realms of entities, is the basis of Leibniz's doctrine of expression, or of the pre-established harmony. It can be seen as an attempt to thematize and generalize the essential role structure and order have in rational theorizing. This has to be seen also against the background of his general formalistic conception of logic and of truth. In Spinoza's non-formalistic theory, 'order' in itself cannot be the foundation and source of intelligibility, which is the ultimate goal of rational activity. As such it is not altogether the same as scientific rationality in the sense - or even senses - usually given to this notion. Leibniz's doctrine of expression is much closer to what can be regarded as a doctrine of scientific rationality, and its appropriation by scientists looking for some philosophical inspiration or corroboration for their theories is perhaps more appropriate than the frequent, perhaps more symbolic, looking for Spinoza.5 What isomorphism basically yields is, according to Leibniz's often repeated metaphor, the possibility to "map" one realm (i.e., the body) to another (i.e., the soul) in a systematic and unequivocal way. In this way what is accomplished is "representation," and insofar as it is given to effective manipulation it can be said to satisfy the scientific point of view, or the demands of scientific rationality. This was in fact a central part of Leibniz's theory of rationality. From the point of view of Spinoza's ontology, a claim about an alleged parallelism between thought and extension, even if one ignores the implicit - but necessary - assumption of their disparateness, would amount to a statement of a fact and, hence, to an acknowledgement of incomprehensibility and lack of understanding of the relations actually holding between thought and extension and, more specifically, between 5 "Looking for Spinoza" is of course the title of Damasio's famous book, which is precisely this: the testimony of a modern man of science in search of some philosophical inspiration and corroboration of his scientific work; see Antonio Damasio, Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain (Orlando, Fla: Harcourt, 2003).</page><page sequence="8">106 Elhanan Yakira mind and body. The suppressed incompatibility of these two points of view - the Spinozistic and the Leibnizian - results in such hybrid notions as "representational parallelism," which is supposedly "transparent" and opposed to the more habitual "bare" or "blind" parallelism.6 It is true that the relation between mind and body in Spinoza's Ethics is anything but "blind": the corrolary of E2pl3 states that "man consists of a mind and a body, and that the human body exists, as we sense [sentimus] it" (italics added; Curley's translation slightly altered). But this is so precisely because there is no parallelism there, either transparent or blind. From a Spinozistic point of view parallelism can be at best a mere statement of a fact - the existence of identity of order between two separate realms - and nothing more than the trivial truth that one complex thing has two, or even many, parallel sides. The ways in which 'parallelism' has become a Spinozistic term are no less significant. It surfaces again, after its first formulation by Leibniz, in the second half of the nineteenth century as a name of an allegedly Spinozistic kind of mind-body theories, and soon of Spinoza's own theory as well. It appears first in the writings of Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887), who more or less inaugurated, around the mid century,7 the new discipline of psychophysics.8 It was conceived as an empirical science, which meant for Fechner, roughly, a theory based on experimentation, its findings expressed in a mathematical form. A main presupposition of this enterprise was the existence of systematic relations between the physical and the mental, or psychological, phenomena. It was to this relation that Fechner referred as a parallelism between the kinds of phenomenon he was measuring. Fechner also thought that these different phenomena were manifestations of one and 6 See Delia Rocca (note 2 above), 19, who quotes M. Gueroult, Spinoza (Paris: Aubier-Montaigne, 1968), 2:76; for referential transparency, see Delia Rocca, 121. 7 Exactly, on 22 October 1850. According to his own testimony, he had suddenly, on that day, an insight about the way to measure the intensity of a sensation and its relation with the energy of the corresponding stimulus. What is known as the 'Fechner law' states that there is a logarithmic functional correspondence between the two: when the energy of the stimulus increases according to geometric progression, the sensation increases - in parallel - algebraically. 8 Elemente der Psychophysik, 2 vols. (Leipzig, 1860). There is an English translation of the first volume, see G. T. Fechner, Elements of Psychopysics, vol. 1, ed. D. H. Howes and E. G. Boring (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1966).</page><page sequence="9">The Anachronism of Parallelism: A Chapter in Historical Irony 107 the same unitary entity - an individual organism.9 He borrowed the term 'parallelism' from Leibniz, and was very explicit about his debt to him, but thought that his presuppositions were in fact closer to Spinoza's philosophy and that the parallelism he was investigating could be better understood in Spinozistic terms. Referring to Leibniz's famous clocks parable,10 he adds that in it Leibniz disregarded a fourth option, which is in fact the simplest and most reasonable one. To the three doctrines Leibniz talks about in his parable - causal interactionist (as it is called nowadays) dualism, which he attributes, somewhat hastily, to Descartes; occasionalism; and his own theory of the pre-established harmony - Fechner suggests adding Spinoza's doctrine as well. According to the latter, the two clocks would be in fact only one. And, of course, if it is only one clock, no wonder that it/they always show(s) the same hour; or, more accurately (one may suggest), that it always shows the hour it shows. As suggested above, Spinoza's mind-body theory is meant to undermine the very basis of the Cartesian thematic Leibniz refers to in his parable. In fact, Fechner commits here a number of errors. The most obvious one is the forcing of Spinoza's mind-body theory into Leibniz's clockwork maintenance shop. By this move both the parable and Spinoza's doctrine lose their specific significance. Although with Leibniz it is always difficult to know for certain, one may assume that in this case at least he sincerely thought that he had good philosophical reasons for not including Spinoza in his parable. Indeed, Spinoza does not fit in here, and the whole point of Leibniz's criticism of Spinoza, as we have just seen, is to affirm precisely this. The possibility of representing Spinoza's position by the image of two clocks is discarded at the outset and the fact of the correspondence between 9 Fechner was a very prolific writer and during his long and rich career went through different stages. Although he never gave up a certain metaphysical vision of reality, his conception of psychophysics, and within it of the nature of the organic entities, is non-metaphysical. There are a few studies of Fechner's work; two of the more recent ones are Michael Heidelberger, Die innere Seite der Natur: Gustav Theodor Fechners wissenschaftlich-philosophische Weltauffassung (Frankfurt a.M.: Klostermann, 1993), English: Nature from Within: Gustav Theodor Fechner and His Psychophysical Worldview, trans. Cynthia Klohr (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2004); and Isabelle Duperon, Le Parallelisme psychophysiologique (Paris, Presses universitaires de France, 2000). 10 From the third Eclaircissement on the Systeme nouveau de la nature. This reference appears at the very beginning of Elements of Psychophysics׳, see Duperon, 29-30.</page><page sequence="10">108 Elhanan Yakira them explained away, rather than explained, by his theory of the unity of mind and body: the whole point of the parable is that the two clocks are fully distinct, this distinction representing the substantiality of the individual souls, affirmed by Descartes, Malebranche, and Leibniz, but rejected by Spinoza. Leibniz, unlike many modern readers of both his own and Spinoza's theories, understood perfectly well that Spinoza's mind-body theory was not a direct contribution, in the last analysis, to the kind of question that he was referring to in his parable, and which he considered, just as Malebranche and the other occasionalists did, as emerging out of Descartes' mysterious 'union of body and soul'. Union and unity are two different things. Although obviously a blunder, Fechner's suggestion was very effective. It is apparently here, with the imposition of Spinoza's conception into the framework of Leibnizianism, and with the tendency to consider the two doctrines as two competing, albeit commensurable, theories about the mind body correspondence, which can even be combined to some degree, that the traditional use of the term 'parallelism' to represent Spinoza's doctrine of mind and body commences. It is also here that a typical and hard-to-get rid-of misrepresentation of Spinoza begins. It might seem that Fechner, as he himself thought, was indeed closer to Spinoza than to Leibniz. The two allegedly share the view that there is one original unity which is the common source of two different manifestations ('attributes' in Spinoza's language, 'phenomena' in Fechner's) conceived by us as mind and body or spirit and matter. It might seem then, as indeed many subsequent experimental psychologists, but also commentators of Spinoza, thought, that a similar notion of 'parallelism' is applicable to both Fechner's study of the nature of the correspondence which allegedly exists between physical, physio logical, and psychological phenomena, and Spinoza's theory as it is expressed in E2p7, but also in his theory of the affects, which are undeniably psychological phenomena that seem to have bodily counterparts or, precisely, parallels. This, however, is not the case. Fechner's phenomena are not the same as Spinoza's attributes, and Spinoza's original substantial unity is not the same as Fechner's unity of the individual organism. Obviously, 'organism' and, in particular, 'phenomena' do not carry the metaphysical sense of Spinoza's 'substance' and 'attribute'. Fechner did not think otherwise, but he did think that his psychophysics brings the mind-body parallelism from metaphysical skies to the firm ground of empirical science and of measurement. What his</page><page sequence="11">The Anachronism of Parallelism: A Chapter in Historical Irony 109 case shows, perhaps, is that the relations between 'science' and 'metaphysics' are not as simple as that. Fechner's, in fact, is a particularly revealing case, which can help illuminate the nature and causes of the ease with which the Leibnizian term of 'parallelism' has become so common in Spinozistic literature. Fechner was, on the one hand, the main founder of a new scientific discipline or, as it has been said, the author of an important research program. The latter is still pertinent to the present, incredibly richer and more sophisticated, scientific research. Some commentators claim that the roots of experimental psychology, and even of quite recent developments such as cognitive science as well as neuroscience, can be traced back to his pioneering work. It is also not rare to find contemporary psychologists, neurologists, and practitioners of other experimental or therapeutic disciplines, who find in Spinoza, just as Fechner did, both an ancestor and a source of inspiration for a reflection that, they think, can give meaning to their own scientific work. Fechner indeed conceived his new science of psychophysics as part of a much larger program, philosophical and ethical in nature, perhaps religious in some sense, even proto-my stical. In his youth he had been deeply influenced by German Naturphilosophie (notably Schelling's philosophy of nature), and he had always been opposed to what he called later in his life the "night view" (in contradistinction to his own "day view"), by which he meant the reductionist mechanism and materialism of much of his day's scientific worldview. This is significant, because the fascination with Spinoza is typically associated with some kind of philosophical interest in science or, more specifically, with a certain desire to transcend the boundaries of experimental work in its strict sense. It often expresses attempts to acknowledge some aspects of a scientific worldview, while looking for a reassurance of its philosophical, even ethical, soundness and validity. But, and this is also typical, by this reference to Spinoza, Fechner, in the last analysis, missed out on much of Spinoza's original intention. Fechner's own attribution of the thesis of parallelism to Spinoza did not necessarily hamper his own scientific work; but when this has become a commonplace of Spinozistic literature, the hastiness, or even a certain philosophical clumsiness, which characterizes his attitude to Spinoza, is more problematic. There is no question of giving here a full, or even partial, account of Fechner's rich and complex work. It seems, however, not unimportant to emphasize a point or two. The three orders of phenomena Fechner</page><page sequence="12">110 Elhanan Yakira investigated were conceived by him as different manifestations of one underlying unity. He did not think that the unity behind the parallel phenomenal manifestations was an unattainable 'thing-in-itself, but a real and scientifically accessible reality - that of the living organism and of the natural world in general. Although it has been argued that one can interpret some of Spinoza's main insights in light of the concept of organism, it would be wrong to push the rapprochement with Fechner too far. Spinoza's is a metaphysical theory of man, Fechner's psychophysics a scientific theory. It is of course impossible to draw a rigid and clear-cut line of separation between 'science' and 'philosophy' in general; yet, there are deep and irreducible differences between Spinoza and Fechner, differences that can be considered as paradigmatic, and which also bestow on Fechner's misunderstanding of Spinoza paradigmatic significance. These differences are not about the accessibility or non-accessibility of the original unity supposed to underlie phenomena. Neither did Spinoza think in Kantian-like terms of phenomena and things-in-themselves. The fundamental unity was, for him, neither a heuristic principle nor the accomplishment or result of empirical or experimental work. It was not only fully attainable, but indeed, and in its full and original intelligibility, the very foundation and condition of any further rational work. Nor does the difference between the two concern so much 'ontology', if one understands in this word, as it is often done in contemporary literature about Spinoza's (and others') mind-body theory, some conception about the constitution of the entities in question, e.g., 'matter' or 'spirit', or about the nature of the main manifestations of the 'underlying' unity; it is rather about the modes of access to them, or kinds of intelligibility they enjoy. Although Fechner's three orders of phenomena are not particular beings but three domains of characteristic natural lawfulness, and in this respect might have seemed to be not that different from Spinoza's attributes, the differences are in fact far more important than the similarities. Sphere of characteristic lawfulness is not the same as "that which the intellect conceives as constituting the essence of a substance" (Eldef4). Moreover, 'thought' in Spinoza's rationalistic philosophy is much closer to what we would rather call 'reason', or 'rationality', than to Fechner's sphere of inwardness and privacy, or to what is often referred to as the 'mental'. Fechner, in fact, gives a typically modern, non-metaphysical, character ization of the mind, or soul, as a special phenomenon, or sphere, defined essentially as 'private' and 'internal'. For Spinoza, thinking (i.e., rational</page><page sequence="13">The Anachronism of Parallelism: A Chapter in Historical Irony 111 thinking in the first place), as one of the infinite attributes of the substance, or (infinite) intellect, as one of infinite modes, and as that which constitutes the essence of the singular soul, is not private in an essential sense, and the internal/external distinction is seen as, at best, a metaphor which does not do justice to the real, metaphysical, reality of mind and body, even falsifying it. The importance given to the privacy and internality of the mental is characteristic not only of Fechner's work, but of the emerging science of psychology in general. This characterization of the soul is quite different from the absolute self-presence of the Cartesian subject. No less than the subjectivist nature of psychology as a theory of the psychic, it expresses its ideal of scientificity: among other things, because it is defined as private and internal, from the point of view of the scientific observer and experimentalist. Precisely because it defines the mind on the basis of what is conceived to be opposite to science's self-conception as being essentially public, it expresses in fact the search of the new science for acceptable and legitimate methods that could be considered "empirical" or "observational" and non metaphysical. It is against this background that one has to consider Wundt's method of "introspection," the fact that it has become after him, and for a very short while, the preferable method of access to psychological reality, only to be rejected shortly afterwards and give way to behaviorism.11 Fechner conceived his new science of psychophysics on the model of mathematical physics (as it was developing then, notably in France), understood as a program of mathematization of experimentally gathered data. In fact, of course, he was doing nothing of the sort. He developed ingenious strategies of experimentation, methods of measurement, and formulated - in what has come to be known as the "Fechner law" - what is basically a heuristic rule, formally expressed, for a research strategy based on the idea that since there is a correspondence between mind and body, a correlation 11 See Kurt Danziger, Constructing the Subject: Historical Origins of Psychological Research (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), passim. It is not uninteresting to note that Wilhelm Wundt, the major figure in the emergence of the new discipline and its institutionalization, writes in a programmatic article from 1896 that psychology and the different natural sciences are irreducible to one another; they have to be coordinated "and the perspectives of both complement each other in such a way that only together do they exhaust the empirical knowledge open to us" (cited by M. Kush, Psychologism: A Case Study in the Sociology of Philosophical Knowledge [London: Routledge, 1995], 133).</page><page sequence="14">112 Elhanan Yakira can be established between measurable phenomena such as external stimuli, the excitation of the sensing apparatus, and sensation. The presupposed correspondence between different spheres of being, which is also, perhaps even more, a presupposition about the possibility to correlate different strategies of scientific research,12 seems to be a fundamental presupposition of the emerging science of the psychic, and an essential guarantee of its scientificity. As Boring says, already at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries, the phrenologists, the founders of what was to be proven to be pseudo-science, built their theories "upon the central problem of correlation" - in their case, the alleged correlation between the form of the skull and the nature of the mind or of its functioning.13 Now this correlation is a correlation conceived from the point of view of the scientific 'external' observer: it is a correlation between what is hidden from him on the one hand, and the measurable and public on the other. And it is precisely as such that it can be said to express an ideal of scientificity, constitutive of the new science of psychology. Scientific or academic psychology emerged out of philosophy. The first psychologists, notably Wundt, thought of their work as a continuation of traditional philosophy. This was certainly true insofar as the sociological and institutional aspects of this history are concerned. Thematically, however, it is a somewhat more complicated issue. Although traditionally the 'soul' or, more precisely, the attempt to talk rationally about it, had been largely an affair of philosophers, there is no simple continuity between its philosophical discussion and the new science of psychology or, for that matter, of psychophysics. It is often said that modern science, or at least some of its important disciplines, emerged out of philosophy and gradually proved to be 12 Whether science is a kind of ontology, positivist construction of theories, pragmatic methods of prediction, or strategies of rational work (and there are more possibilities, either skeptical, relativistic, or not) is not a question which has to concern us here. It is not without interest, however, to note that Fechner also misses the true sense of Leibniz's theory of pre-established harmony. The latter expresses not so much a theory about the constitution of the world, as a conception about the nature of scientific rationality - structure, order, and regularity of relations are the sources of intelligibility, not causality of imaginary mechanisms, nor suppositions of supernatural intervention. Ironically, Fechner, in a sense, carries out Leibniz's program of rational (or scientific) work rather than Spinoza's. 13 E. G.

It is thus often claimed that it is science that can deal rationally with, perhaps solve, the questions philosophy had asked before. Bacon and Comte, to cite just two older cases, gave two of the better known, explicit, and systematic formulations of this widely held view. Although this is certainly the case sometimes, the course that thought follows is often more complex. Sometimes much of the sense of the original concerns is lost in the course of the emergence of new scientific disciplines. Sometimes a new and more profound understanding of a properly and irreducibly philosophical significance of old questions emerges as science solves, or deals in its own way, with other aspects of these old questions. Germany of the second half of the nineteenth century is the main scene of experimental psychology becoming an autonomous discipline. It is no wonder that it was there and then that the notion of parallelism became central for a whole scientific culture, struggling for recognition, trying to delineate its proper field of research and to justify its positing of the feeling and sensing human being as its legitimate subject matter. It is through this notion that a relation was supposed to hold between diverse research fields and thus, as has just been suggested, guaranteeing its scientificity. In this context, Fechner,s mistake in talking of a Spinozistic parallelism is perhaps only one manifestation of a more general phenomenon, and it characterizes not only the self-conception of experimental psychology and of academic psychology as they have become autonomous disciplines (or one general autonomous discipline with a few sub-disciplines), but also, more generally and, admittedly, vaguely, of the positivistic spirit of modern science and of much of scientific philosophy. It also expresses a certain tendency to lose the ability to see the sui generis nature of certain philosophical issues. Fechner's use of the term 'parallelism' as an adequate representation of Spinoza's mind-body theory is symptomatic of a general difficulty to capture what was truly at stake - philosophically, ethically, theologically, even politically - in Spinoza's mind-body theory and in his particular contribution to the debates about this question in his time. This is where the charge of an anachronistic reading of Spinoza becomes pertinent.14 14 The emergence of psychology provoked a general criticism of 'psychologism', which is the context where two of the main philosophical traditions of contemporary philosophy were born, notably in the work of Husserl and Frege. Both were trying to reclaim, and redefine, the sui generis nature of philosophical reflection.

It is here that not only the irony of using a Leibnizian anti-Spinozistic term turning into an allegedly adequate representation of Spinoza becomes apparent, but also that a whole tradition of Spinoza scholarship begins, which uses the parallelism thesis without suspecting that this might distort Spinoza's original teaching and fundamental motivations, as well as, in particular, the stakes of the original debates in which the term first appears. Although the use of such term as 'parallelism' is not necessarily detrimental to sound and adequate interpretation of Spinoza's philosophy in general, the fact is that Fechner's misunderstanding provided subsequent generations of Spinoza scholars with an allegedly key term for a sound understanding of his mind-body theory, and thus perpetuated the misunderstanding. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem an interesting dialectic here: these attempts follow the - partial but real - loss of the ability to see the sense of classical philosophy, a loss exemplified also in Fechner's use of the notion of 'parallelism'.</page></plain_text>
