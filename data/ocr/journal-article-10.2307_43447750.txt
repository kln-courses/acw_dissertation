<plain_text><page sequence="1">SANDRA SHERMAN Trembling Texts: Margaret Cavendish and the Dialectic of Authorship It might be appropriate to begin this essay by stating "I am going to discuss Margaret Cavendish. ..." Yet any discus- sion of Cavendish inserting a complementary "I," even that of an expositor, is already problematic, since Cavendish builds a case that she is so singular as to be exempt from inter subjectivity. In another sense, however, it is appropriate to insist upon the critical "I," since Cavendish's discourse of the self-in-isolation generates its own mirror-image, still reflecting a self but only as that can be located and fixed in a text, a self constructed entirely through discourse with others. This bipolarity has not been considered in the criticism of Cavendish, whose most prominent critic, Catherine Gallagher, has argued that Cavendish exploits images of absolute monarchy to con- struct a self-enclosed autonomous nature "isolated and complete unto herself."1 1 wish to correct that characterization by demonstrating that Cavendish's retreat from contemporary discourse into a world of her own imagining, implying a self anterior to any text, is continually undermined by an appeal to the judgment of history, implying a self determined by discourse and entirely intertextual. Images of mon- archy contend with a rhetoric of submission. This is not to deny that Cavendish constructs an autonomous self, but rather to demonstrate that the construction is unstable; concern for the self s own survival in history compels literary strategies that threaten to dissolve the self in textuality. Fame comes at the price of engagement with discourse, opening the self to conventions of intelligibility that breach bound- *The author gratefully acknowledges the assistance of Margreta DeGrazia and David Nor- brook in the preparation of this essay. i.

The "self in Cavendish is therefore paradoxical, complicating theories of literary creation in which litera- ture is both generated as "fancy," unmediated by intertextuality, and inserted into discourse as the bringer of Fame. It is not so much the "monarchical" but the double-valenced cre- ative self that defines Cavendish: isolated in its mental world, it also engages history, hoping to survive in the memory of culture. At the very least, a "self" configured from Cavendish's Royalist politics should balance paradigms of disengagement with the monarch's pre- rogatives of historical agency. Gallagher suggests that Cavendish identified with Charles II in exile, both monarch and sovereign pri- vate person. Yet this analysis, which seeks to empower Cavendish, actually refuses to her an engagement with discourse and the forces of history attributable to viable monarchs. Even more fundamentally, Cavendish's obsession with literary production generates metaphors of a different authority: authorship. This is an authority complicated by Cavendish's rhetorical involvement with intertextuality. This in- volvement underlies any analysis of self-creation in Cavendish, since if one can speak of a "self" anterior to a text, one must also, as in current literary theory, approach the self as a construct entirely of language. Cavendish opens up the possibility of both.2 Approached through an "authorial" rather than a royalist model of empowerment, Cavendish can be seen as reflecting her moment in history. It is commonly recognized that after the Restoration, new forms of political consent were perceived to be necessary.3 A monarch isolated in absolutism, at least one proclaiming to be absolute, was no longer viable. An author, on the other hand, endures and prevails by 2. This paper is obviously written in the context of criticism such as that of Roland Barthes and Julia Kristeva, arguing that there is only inter-textuality - the "self' and the "author" do not exist prior to their inscription in a text. Cavendish could be said to rebel against a notion that "there is only discourse," even though she must accommodate discourse. With regard to the discursive status of the self, see Her Own Life - Autobiographical Writings by Seventeenth Century Englishwomen (London and New York: Routledge, 1989), ed. Elspeth Graham et al, which starts from the assumption that women such as Cavendish did have a "self" anterior to their auto- biographical texts. The book has an excellent theoretical discussion of the whole problem as it relates to these early autobiographies. See also Mary G. Mason, "The Other Voice: Autobiogra- phies of Women Writers," in Autobiography: Essays Theoretical and Critical ed. James Olney, (Princeton, 1980), pp. 207-35, featuring Cavendish as an example of the developing sense of self among women. 3.

The concept of authorship implies that submission and the consent of the discursive community become the basis of authority. Cavendish, writing during the decline of the Commonwealth and into the Restoration, reflects in her preoc- cupation with authorship a nostalgia for absolutism, tempered un- consciously by a revision in the idea of absolute monarchy. I will examine here such of Cavendish's works as may be consid- ered "first person" writing.4 The primary text in this regard is A True Relation of My Birth, Breeding and Life (1656), a prose autobiography.5 The work is a self-conscious narrative, not so much a relation of Cavendish's "fancies" as a description of the contemplative, inward- looking personality that produces them. It is characteristic of Caven- dish that this narrated self dissolves in her other works into a flagrant display of the author's mental processes and of the "fancies" pro- duced. In these works the "absolute" self detached from discourse enacts its self-enclosure, even while it is undermined by anxious appeals to history. These works include Poems and Fancies (1653), Sociable Letters (1664), and The Description of the New World Called the Blazing World (1666). 6 As I hope to demonstrate, the "self" in these texts is fluid, intending an ideal fixity which necessitates contingency. However, it is always the creative self, engaged or disengaged, that defines the incredible energy in Cavendish's work. II In her poem "The Motion of Thoughts," Margaret Cavendish de- scribes a vision when "[mjusing alone, mine eyes being fixed."7 Light, apparent as a medium, resolves itself into Motion, as if obedi- 4. Almost all of Cavendish's vast oeuvre is, to a degree, "first person," in view of the numerous prefaces, dedications and personal observations. Moreover, as I hope to demonstrate, virtually all of the oeuvre participates in Cavendish's self-construction by embodying a narrative of the mind's creativity. However, in the works that I have chosen, the "self' is more or less the actual subject. 5. The text cited is that reprinted in C. H.

How- ever, after appearing to acknowledge a logic that the motion of light carries it everywhere ("This light had no Dimension, nor Extent / But fil'd all places full, without Circumvent"), Cavendish allows the quality of Motion a volition (equating it with "Life") that distributes light into varying "Shapes . . . [n]o sooner made, but quickly pass'd away." The universe is plastic, reimagined as a projection of the poet's mind. As if to confirm that motions of light are subject to motions of thought, Motion departs its evanescing Shapes, contracting into a point which then reveals itself as the poet's own mind: Tis its own Center, and Circumference round. Yet neither has a Limit, or a Bound. A fixt Eternity, and so will last, All present is, nothing to come, or past. A fixt Perfection nothing can add more, All things is It, and It self doth adore. My Thoughts then wondering at what they did see, Found at the last themselves the same to bee (p. 41) In the last two lines of this passage the poet's thoughts wonder at "what" they see, identify it as "themselves," and so designate this sight as the site of the poet's mind, contemplating itself as a universe of its own creation. The site is one point and everywhere, "without Limit, or a Bound," and it is in love with itself. This remarkable image of imploded, self-reflexive generativity, its potential for infinite regress begetting at each stage further self- conscious affirmations, is the curious reality of Margaret Cavendish. The poem, which enacts the logic informing all her work, stages an act of creation in which the creations are themselves creators of a perfect mental world. The narrative moves inward, expelling dis- courses external to imagination, enclosing the author in language which is totally known because it is always already existent in the author's own being. Thus, in "The Animali Parliament," in which Parliament is composed of the Soul, the Body and the Thoughts, the King makes a speech to "defend you from the allurements of the World . . . and to beat out incroaching falshoods, which make in- rodes . . . and to quench the rebellion of superfluous words" (p. 200). Cavendish's work is about containment, and the seclusion of creative energy, with the peculiar twist that creative artifacts command respect</page><page sequence="5">1 88 English Literary Renaissance only as they are disciplined to exclude elements not of the self. The corollary is that the self as creator stands outside discourse, congruent with its perfect mental world of inwardly ramifying thoughts. The self, which in Cavendish's oeuvre is always Margaret Cavendish, is always aware of and promoting an aesthetic of englobement. Caven- dish appears in her works as an audience of one. She instantiates herself in writing about herself writing. Contrary to prevailing notions that women should eschew author- ship, Cavendish's aesthetic allows her to assert that "Poetry, which is built upon Fancy, Women may claime, as a worke belonging most properly to themselves: for I have observ'd, that their Braines work usually in a Fantasticali motion. . . . For Fancy goeth not so much by Rule, and Method, as by Choice" (P/F, sig. A3). The poetical enter- prise is valuable because the order it assumes, its shape, is the shape of the self and particularly that of the self s idiosyncratic mind. Signifi- cantly, the poet's agency is not bounded by norms. Nevertheless, in Sociable Letters , the author writes in "Upon Her Excellency the Au- thoress": This Lady only to her self she Writes, And all her Letters to her self Indites; For in her self so many Creatures be, Like many Commonwealths, yet all Agree.8 The passage is curious, and not only because it deliberately eschews the absolutist model. It appears as preface to a work that breaks down that model. On the one hand, Cavendish compliments the perfection of her self and offers this as grounds for self-communication. On the other, the tactic of inscribing letters to such a self - then publishing - broaches Cavendish's paradoxical relationship to discourse: commu- nication from the world is shunned, while one's thoughts (however much outside discursive conventions) are submitted to the world. This paradox of unstable isolation appears in Cavendish's addresses to herself in the third person. Fluidity between first- and third-person is a Cavendish trope. In A True Relation , she asks: [W]hy hath this 8. Sociable Letters (1664), page unnumbered, in the Scolar Press reprint (Menston: 1969), hereafter cited as SL. In the first letter, Cavendish cannot resist a compliment to herself: "Truly, Madam, I take so much delight in your wise, witty, and virtuous Conversation, as I could not pass my life more pleasing and delightfully; wherefore I am never better pleased, than when I am reading your Letters, and when I am writing letters to you" (pp. 1-2).</page><page sequence="6">Sandra Sherman 189 lady writ her own life?. ... I answer that it is true that 'tis to no purpose to the readers, but it is to the authoress" (p. 178). As in Sociable Letters , the public is at once excluded and addressed in a self composed of grammatical declensions. In a curious aside, Cavendish notes in A True Relation that her brother "writ A Treatise of the Arts of War y but by reason it was in characters, and the key thereof lost, we cannot as yet understand anything therein, at least not so as to divulge it" (pp. 158-59). The project of writing in undecipherable code a treatise on so public a subject as war inverts but maintains the contra- dictory impulses in Cavendish's own work. Her invocation of the treatise is a submerged metaphor for such impulses, the contradiction never fully taken into consciousness. Rather, she insists that her arti- facts are congruent with her mind, their creation attesting to a self that excludes itself from all but its own creations. Cavendish thus resists acknowledging a notion of authorship that accepts discursive norms. She writes into existence a parthenogenetic self, seeking to maintain a theory of authority that does not compro- mise with intertextuality. Creation is by the mutual elaboration of Thoughts, which "run agen with swifter speed / And by this course new Fancies they could breed" (P/F, p. 47). Since the inwardly rami- fying mind is continuous with a marginal, englobed self uncom- promised by "Rule, or Method," the same metaphors of birth apply to the poet Margaret Cavendish as apply to her "breeding" thoughts. In her preface "To The Reader" she observes that she is "so fond of my Book [Poems and Fancies] as if to make it as if it were my Child," and notes that writing it took nine months. In yet another preface Caven- dish denies discourse, noting that her verses proposing a possible order in the universe are uninformed, not contingent upon the dis- course of seventeenth-century empiricism: If any Philosophers have written of these Subjects ... of all that Nature hath discover'd, either in meere Thought, and Speculation, or other waies in Observation; yet it is more then I know of. ... I cannot say, I have not heard of Atomes, and Figures, and Motion, and Matter; but not thoroughly rea- son'd on: but if I do erre, it is no great matter; for my Discourse of them is not to be counted Authentick (P/F, "To Naturall Philosophers")9 9. Cavendish's engagement with seventeenth-century science was initially explored in Lisa Sarasohn, "A Science Turned Upside Down: Feminism and the Natural Philosophy of Margaret Cavendish," Huntington Library Quarterly 47 (1984), 289-307, and Sylvia Bowerbank, "The</page><page sequence="7">190 English Literary Renaissance If this were Sidneian logic that poetry cannot lie because it does not attempt the truth, Cavendish would be inside one discursive conven- tion even as she shunned another. However, "truth" is not invoked as irrelevant so much as it is reduced to bare categories which the poet can reimagine and fill. In a challenge to scientific convention, Caven- dish offers her own imaginings as a potential counter-reality unavail- able to Philosophers: Just like unto a Nest of Boxes round, Degrees of sizes within each Boxe are found. So in this World, may many Worlds more be, Thinner, and lesse, and lesse still by degree; Although they are not subject to our Sense, A World may be no bigger then two-pence. Nature is curious, and such worke may make, That our dull Sense can never finde, but scape. (P/F, p. 44) The wonderful image of a world of nesting boxes exactly corresponds to the regress of thoughts bounding a universe in the poet's mind ("The Motion of Thoughts"). The paradigm of "inside" is validated by a theory of the "outside," so that imaginative self-absorption becomes a species of the condition of possible worlds. To the extent that the poet is her own creation, a possible world disconnected from discourse - that is, outside the contingent world subject to verdicts of "dull Sense" - no one has standing to judge the legitimacy of her creative acts (authorized by a whole universe of corresponding re- cessiveness). Cavendish authorizes her self-enclosure, and hence the artifacts which bespeak its generative potential, by casting herself as continuous with the structure of an alternative reality based on im- ploding self-enclosure, beyond the reach of conventional judgment. However, Cavendish uses the word "may" three times in the forego- ing lines postulating a world of nesting boxes. If she wanted to assure herself of protection by virtue of being continuous with such a world, the "boxes" would have to be torn open, unpacked, and displayed. The very argument for her self-enclosure requires, in order to be Spider s Delight: Margaret Cavendish and the Female Imagination," English Literary Renaissance 14 (1984), 392-408. Both argue that Cavendish, left out of scientific discourse because it is exclusively male, adopts an idiosyncratic science. An excellent refinement of this position is in Sylvia Brown, "Margaret Cavendish: Strategies Rhetorical and Philosophical Against the Charge of Wantonness, Or Her Excuses for Writing So Much," Cultural Matrix: Princeton Working Papers in Women's Studies 6 (1991), 20-45.</page><page sequence="8">Sandra Sherman 191 demonstrable, a disclosure, just as her regression requires expression, to assure the self of its survival. In both instances the assurance itself undoes its own purpose. As a contingent warrant of her own idio- syncrasy, therefore, the choice of nesting boxes is a fascinating em- blem of the contingency of her own absolute selfhood. Again, how- ever, the instability is implicit, never fully disclosed. In her most famous statement Cavendish is more assertive in link- ing the notion of creating alternative worlds to a strategy for remain- ing impregnable (that is, eluding a dominating power by excluding external discourse): That though I cannot be Henry the Fifth, or Charles the Second; yet, I will endeavor to be Margaret the First; and, though I have neither Power, Time, nor Occasion, to be a great Conqueror . . . yet rather than not be Mistress of a World, since Fortune and the Fates would give me none, I have made one of my own. And thus believing, or, at least, hoping, that no Creature can, or will, Envy me for this World of mine.10 In The Blazing World the world she creates is a fiction, but in the fiction she appears as herself ("The Duchess of Newcastle") creating a fic- tional world in the mind. The artifact, Blazing World, enacts a ra- tionale for creating, asserting, and preserving the self through infinite regress into private mental space. At the same time the "Duchess of Newcastle" is chosen to be a scribe from among a number of discursive subjects, by creatures which the real Duchess has created. The author- ial posture of engagement infiltrates the text, even while the text enacts a politics of withdrawal. In virtually all of her works Cavendish's ostensible strategy is that of the female with no access to literary /scientific discourse - she discredits engagement and announces that privation confers an en- abling privacy: [T]he Lady M. L. spoke of me, saying, I liv'd a Dull, Unprofitable, Unhappy Life, Imploying my time onely in Building Castles in the Air. Indeed, if I were of her Ladiships Humour, I should be Unhappy, but as I am, 10. The Description of the New World Called the Blazing World (1668), "To All Noble and Worthy Ladies," n.p., hereafter cited as BW. The 1666 edition varies in two important respects. The address (which is substantially different) is "To The Reader," rather than to aristocratic women. The last few phrases imply that Cavendish's creative ability is common, a suggestion that the later edition removes: "since Fortune and the Fates would give me none, I have made a World of my own: for which no body, I hope, will blame me, since it is in every one's power to do the like."</page><page sequence="9">192 English Literary Renaissance I would not change the Course of my Life with her Ladiship . . . and as for the Minds Architecture, as Castles in the Air, or Airy Castles, which are Poetical Conceptions, and Solitary Contemplations, which produce Poems, Songs, Playes, Masks, Elegies, Epigrams, Anagrams, and the like, they will be more lasting than Castles of Wood. (SL, pp. 226-27) Yet the passage consumes its own logic, slipping toward an intima- tion of Fame. This throws into indeterminacy its conscious purport of asserting the solitary construction of "the Minds Architecture." Cavendish does not attempt to resolve the paradox. Her riposte to Lady M. L. is consistent with the logic that producing "fancy" is proper work for females excluded from male discursive practice. At no point does Cavendish associate her writing with the common - and male - posture of stoic withdrawal. She recognizes that she is always already withdrawn by virtue of her gender. Rather, by claim- ing that she is superfluous, she recedes from the conventional private sphere of "spinning" - designated by male discourse as the space of female rustication - and opens up a homologous area of "spinning" in the brain, from which to create in private: "True it is, Spinning with the Fingers is more Proper to our Sexe, then Studying or writing Poetry, which is the Spinning with the braine: but I having no skill in the Art of the first . . . made me delight in the latter; since all braines work naturally, and incessantly, in some kinde or other" (P/F, "Epis- tle Dedicatory"). A comparison with Anne Bradstreet, her almost exact contempo- rary, is instructive. Bradstreet invokes the "needle" as the emblem of female enterprise, and acknowledges that exchanging it for a pen imports a male activity into the private sphere. All she can say in defense is that she might "prove well": I am obnoxious to each carping tongue, Who say es my hand a needle better fits, A Poet's Pen all scorne, I should thus wrong: For such despite they cast on female wits: If what I doe prove well, it won't advance. They'l say its stolne, or else, it was by chance.11 1 1 .

Joseph McElrath and Allen Rabb, (Boston, 1981), p. 1.</page><page sequence="10">Sandra Sherman 193 For Bradstreet, writing is not a withdrawal from the conventional private sphere into one even more private. It is conceived as a frus- trated incursion into discourse that merely disturbs the conventional private sphere. Cavendish is distinct in that unlike Bradstreet 's, her own position is unassailable: inside the brain, spinning alternative realities are not subject to conventional sanctions.12 Images of spinning from the self appear everywhere in Cavendish's work, so that her own acts of creation are always already original, exempt from the intertextuality and hence from the authority of shaping discourses: "Yet I must say this in the behalf of my thoughts, that I never found them idle; for if the senses bring no work in, they will work of themselves, like silk- worms that spins out of their own bowels" (TR, p. 155). In one of her most ingenious fancies, a poet's feast becomes a grotesque, Roman nightmare of putrid literature done into nauseating food: her ultimate repudiation of discourse. The feast is her furthest extension beyond the domestic of the "spinning" metaphor, such that the accoutrements of fine dining (napkins, table- cloths, those things which are the female's responsibility) become the very lineaments of the poetic enterprise. It is the total transformation of spinning into "spinning": Then was every one Placed round the Table, and we took our Places according to every ones Poetical Inspiration, but the Table we were set to, was a strange Table, for never was seen the like, it was made of all the Famous Old Poets Seuls, and the Tablecloth or covering was made of their Brains, which Brains were Spun by the Muses, for they are Spinsters of Mens Brains, as the Fates are of the Lives of Men; but these Old Poets Brains 12. There is an interesting discussion of seventeenth-century women's apologetic strate- gies for writing poetry in Margaret Ferguson, "A Room Not Their Own: Renaissance Women as Readers and Writers," in The Comparative Perspective on Literature ed. Clayton Koelb and Susan Noakes (Ithaca, 1988), pp. 93-116. With particular regard to Cavendish's strategies, less apologetic than pre-emptive, see Sylvia Brown, "Margaret Cavendish: Strategies Rhetori- cal and Philosophical," above at n.9, and James Fitzmaurice, "Fancy and the Family: Self- characterizations of Margaret Cavendish," Huntington Library Quarterly 53 (1990), 199-209. Cavendish's efforts to co-ordinate public and private spheres has preoccupied critics. In "Dra- matic Dreamscape: Women's Dreams and Utopian Vision in the Works of Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle," in Curtain Calls: British and American Women and the Theater, 1660- 1820, ed. Mary Anne Schofield Macheski, (Athens, Ohio, 1991)» PP- 29-30, Linda Payne suggests that "Cavendish's ambivalence towards her heroines seems to mirror the insecurity that shines through all the apologies and prefaces about her own efforts to master the written word:, she alternately portrays her vocation as a heroic assay into the male competitive sphere and a harmless diversion for days filled with domestic duties in a wealthy and childless household."</page><page sequence="11">194 English Literary Renaissance were Spun into Cobweb Threads, as Soft and Thin as Air, and then Woven into a Piece, or web, and Old time was the Weaver which Weaved this Web like Damask or Diaper, in Works and Figures of Golden Numbers. (SL, p. 418) In a remarkable assertion of freedom from intertextuality, Caven- dish defends her authorship by arguing that failure to remember texts - including one's own - marks any true originator: But certainly they that remember their own wit least, have the most of it; for there is an old saying, and surely true, that the best wits have the worst memory, I mean wit-memory; for great memories are standing ponds that are made with rain; so that memory is nothing but the showers of other men's wits; and those brains are muddy that have not running springs of their own, that issue out still fresh and new. Indeed, it's against nature for natural wits to remember; for it is impossible that the brain should retain and create. (TR, p. 152) Liberated from remembered discourse (even her own), Cavendish can be original. The paradigm of worlds within the mind, coextensive with a self inhabiting an alternative world vacant of the world's discourses, is endlessly elaborated in her texts, "spun" into substantial fantasies that mediate between mind and world and enact original creation. Cavendish asserts that the private sphere of the mind can supersede the conventional private sphere inhabited by women, so that traditional isolation becomes the setting for acts which are cre- ative and (as in poetry) justifiable as female work. Yet Cavendish's logic is vulnerable to her own repeated assertions of authorship, which depend upon the memory of her own oeuvre. She notes that because she has not been heard to repeat her own verses, "some would say, that my writings are none of my own" (TR, p. 151). Likewise, in the dedication to her biography of her husband, she also notes that some deny her "to be the true authoress" of her books (p. xxxv). The vigor with which she responds suggests her own sense of identity as an author, and it may be of significance that by the time that the True Relation and her husband's biography were written, she had already written several other books. As Phillipe Lejeune notes, a person is perceived to be an "author" when he has written at least two texts, so that he cannot be reduced to the name on one in particular.13 But Lejeune's observation could as well apply to 13. See Phillipe Lejeune, Ott Autobiography (Minneapolis, 1989), pp. 1 1-12: "An author is not a person. He is a person who writes and publishes. Straddling the world-bey ond-the-text and</page><page sequence="12">Sandra Sherman 195 the author - to his sense of himself as an "author" - as to the reader. In fact, knowing that one's texts are in other people's memories, reinforcing their memories with reminders, gives the author confi- dence to assert his own status. Thus at some level, even though Cavendish claims not to remember her prior texts, at another level she remembers their production; this very memory reinforces a sense of self even as, concerned with other people's lasting memory of her texts, she undermines that sense of herself as outside discourse. Cav- endish "remembers" her texts enough to revise and republish them, noting in the Preface to Sociable Letters , for example, that she has revised her Philosophical Opinions to make them more understandable. Revision in this case functions as an aspect of her quest for fame and an acquiescence in intelligibility as a basis for judgment. Nevertheless, the private sphere as Cavendish would define it be- comes for women the site of intense self-affirmation, since original authorship thrives on self-enclosure: I by this Retirement live in a calm Silence, wherein I have my Contempla- tions free from Disturbance, and my Mind lives in Peace, and my Thoughts in Pleasure . . . and though I do not go Personally to Masks, Balls, and Playes, yet my Thoughts entertain my Mind with such Pleasures, for some of my Thoughts make Playesr and others Act those Playes on the Stage of Imagination, where my Mind sits as a Spectator. ... so my Mind takes Delight in its dear Mecaenas, which is Contemplation, and to have its Poetical Thoughts, although not like Virgil or Horace, yet such as they are, it is pleased to have them repeat their Poems, and other Works which they make; and those my Mind likes best, it sends them forth to the senses to write them down, and then to send them out to the publick view of the World. (SL, PP- 56-57)14 the text, he is the connection between the two. The author is defined as simultaneously a socially responsible real person and the producer of a discourse. . . . Perhaps one is an author only with his second book, when the proper name inscribed on the cover becomes the 'common factor' of at least two different texts and thus gives the idea of a person who cannot be reduced to any of his texts in particular, and who, capable of producing others, surpasses them all. [If the autobiogra- phy is a first book, its author] lacks, in the eyes of the reader, the sign of reality which is the previous production of other texts (nonautobiographical), indispensable to that which we will call 'the autobiographical space.' " 14. The stage in the mind is a common figure in Cavendish. In "Fantasies Masque," for example, "The Scene is Poetry. The Stage is in the Braine, whereon it is acted" (P/F, p. 155). In the seventeenth century the world is a stage. One might argue that if the world is a stage, and the mind is a World (as in Cavendish), the mind is a stage - through this equation, Cavendish internalizes what is perhaps the most common trope in Renaissance drama. The drama is within. In British Autobiography in the Seventeenth Century (London, 1969), pp. 11-12, Paul Delaney</page><page sequence="13">196 English Literary Renaissance Contemplating her own mind outside the public sphere, the private woman is the truer Wit than the worldly man whose "Wit &amp; Expres- sions are Stoln out of several Excellent Poets ... he only Varies other mens Wits, but Produces none of his Own, and such Writers may rather be nam'd Translators than Authors" (SL, p. 151). In "The Mine of Wit," Cavendish avows, "Give me that Wit, whose Fancy's not confin'd / That buildeth on it selfe, not two Braines joyn'd" (P/F, p. 1 54). Yet even as Cavendish elaborates a logic of isolation eschew- ing the mental copulation of "two Braines joyn'd," she has in mind to send her works "out to the publick view of the World." There is a persistent subtext of engagement even in her most outspoken denials of intertextuality. And yet engagement does not impair Cavendish's conception of authorship, in which the self is its own subject. Resisting contamina- tion by external discourse, the self is its own plenitude in idiosyncratic array, protected from indecorous appearance by tranquillity: [F]or every human Creature can create an Immaterial World fully inhab- ited by Immaterial Creatures, and populous Immaterial subjects . . . and all this within the compass of the head or scull; nay, not onely so, but he may create a World of what fashion and Government he will, and give the Creatures thereof such motions, figures, forms, colours, perceptions ... as he pleases. And since it is in your power to create such a World, What need you to venture life, reputation and tranquility to conquer a gross material World? (BW, p. 96) Of course Cavendish does "venture," and is venturing in the very act of inscribing Blazing World with the intent to publish. However, she states that "The new man [in the Renaissance] . . . succumbs to a more or less destructive schizophrenia . . his core of self-hood splits and his very identity becomes doubtful. The great symbol and epitome of this new state of being in the Renaissance is Hamlet. His conscious- ness of playing a part which is in some sense alien to his real self finds innumerable echoes in contemporary literature; in fact, the dominant metaphor for human existence is now the stage." By internalizing this metaphor, Cavendish collapses the distinction between persona and "real self," and never conveys the sense that she is playing a role which obscures an inner reality. Indeed, in A True Relation, Cavendish tells the reader that her personality is contemplative, that is, consistent with the inner world she reveals in the rest of her oeuvre. On the other hand, she displays a "schizophrenia" of another sort, since her creative impulses are directed both toward alternative realities of "fancy" and realities amenable to the judgment of history.

Her works offer a narrative of the self in isolation disciplining the fecund mind into literary production: When I did write this Booke, I took great paines, For I did walke, and thinke, and Breake my Braines, My Thoughts run out of Breath, then down would lye, And panting with short wind, like those that dye. (P/F, p. 47) The body's motions are transferred to the Thoughts, which them- selves exhibit near-collapse, drawing the physical author into an in- timacy with abstract ideas that blurs the categories defining each. The discipline that the author finally achieves overthrows any dis- course that would conceptualize the literary enterprise as subject to the Mind/ Body disarticulation of Descartes. Cavendish uses "mind" and "head" interchangably, and her insistence on the body's involve- ment in literary creation literalizes the grounds for her assertion that writing poetry is a gendered activity. Cavendish states: [W]hen I am writing any sad feigned stories, or serious humours, or melancholy passions, I am forced many times to express them with the tongue before I can write them with the pen, by reason those thoughts that are sad, serious, and melancholy are apt to contract, and to draw too much back, which oppression doth as it were overpower or smother the concep- tion in the brain. But when some of those thoughts are sent out in words, they give the rest more liberty to place themselves in a more methodical order, marching more regularly with my pen on the ground of white paper. (TR, p. 172). In this extraordinary passage body and mind work together toward expression, the spoken word assisting the written. Order is achieved by the body, not by enlisting any convention of order from outside the self. The governing image of unruly words worked into a fine parade supports the notion of an internal polity of anthropomorphic ideas expressed in Cavendish's poetry. There is a sense in which, shouting, Cavendish literally expresses a self anterior to the text. She notes that "but my letters seem rather as a ragged rout than a well-armed body, for the brain being quicker in creating than the hand in writing or the memory in retaining, many fancies are lost, by reason they ofttimes outrun the pen" (p. 172). This oral self is the original, spontaneous, greater self, reduced somewhat</page><page sequence="15">198 English Literary Renaissance in the text; the true self is in the mind, and while the literary creation takes the shape of the fancy in the mind, inevitably something is lost to friction. On the other hand, since Cavendish's handwriting is so bad, there is pressure to print the text, so that the maximum self can be salvaged. It is a fascinating calculus, if only because it reveals that the pressure toward textuality derives not only from the search for fame but also from physical considerations, the mundane limits to intel- ligibility imposed by messy penmanship. This drive toward order, premised in the physical as well as metaphysical, is reflected in the notion that the mind has boundaries, physical boundaries defined by the head. When these limitations are threatened because the mind is surcharged with fancies, the excess must be expelled so the poet can work efficiently. The sense of the physicality of the mind contradicts the poet's obvious anti-materiality, yet it is a basic feature of Caven- dish's self-conception. She states that "though my words run stum- bling out of my mouth, and my pen draws roughly on my paper, yet my thoughts move regular in my brain; for the several tracks or paths that contemplation hath made on my brain, which paths or tracks are the several ways my thoughts move in, are much smoother than the tongue in my mouth, from whence words flow, or the paper on which my pen writes" (p. 1 54). The passage concerning Cavendish's "marching," anthropomor- phic thoughts illuminates the continuity of voice from one genre into another in Cavendish's oeuvre, in this case from poems into auto- biography. Another passage from A True Relation employs metaphors of childbearing for literary creation. More particularly, it anthropo- morphizes fancies into "company" whose "conversation" involves the poet in a dialogue with her own creations. The continuity between fictional accounts of the self and "true relations" suggests that Caven- dish is constructing a self in her writing from a pre-existing self, that she does not want to appear and disappear coterminously with a text. By her own assertion she is militantly not intertextual, as when dismissing the importance of other texts in "memory" to any concep- tion of authorship. In The Blazing World Cavendish is summoned to be a character in her own fiction, to serve as "scribe" to an Empress, and she opines that surely the summoning Spirit "is ignorant of my handwriting" (p. 90); the obvious "original" is The True Relation, where the real Margaret Cavendish admits to an awful hand (p. 172). In a hilarious</page><page sequence="16">Sandra Sherman 199 passage in The Blazing World, Cavendish sets out to construct a World and systematically rejects as tutors Thaïes, Pythagoras, Plato, Epi- curus, Aristotle on through Descartes and Hobbes, concluding that since "no patterns would do her any good in the framing of her World, she was resolved to make a World of her own Invention" (p. 101). When choosing a scribe, her Spirit-creations also reject Ancients and Moderns. In both instances the pattern is the same as in all her work, where discourses external to the self (such as seven- teenth-century science) are firmly excluded in favor of the self s own inwardly ramifying thoughts. Of course since Cavendish is writing Blazing World while inhabiting its eponym - where she creates more worlds - one sees the same pattern as in her poetry, defined by "nest- ing boxes." In The True Relation, Cavendish states: For I being addicted from my childhood to contemplation rather than conversation, to solitariness rather than society, to melancholy rather than mirth, to write with a pen than to work with a needle, passing my time with harmless fancies, their company being pleasing, their conversation innocent (in which I take such pleasure as I neglect my health, for it is as great a grief to leave their society as a joy to be in their company), my only trouble is, lest my brain should grow barren, or that the root of my fancies should become insipid, withering into a dull stupidity for want of maturing subjects to write on. (p. 172) One hears the same voice in "A Dialogue between Melancholy and Mirth," which begins, "As I sate Musing, by my selfe alone, / My Thoughts severall things did work upon." It is arguable that Caven- dish is artistically naive, that she only knows how to write herself, and it has been suggested that all the characters in her plays speak in the same voice. 15 Yet if one attends to self-referentiality in her work, then the uni vocal character of Cavendish's "characters" suggests that they are representations of her particular project: the creation of an abso- lute, unassailable self uncompromised by discourse and beyond the reach of predatory "envy." In the "Dialogue" just cited, after an array of Thoughts assault the mind, Melancholy and Mirth arrive, and the poet s body is imme- diately engaged: 15. See the discussion of Cavendish's plays in Henry Perry, The First Duchess of Newcastle and Her Husband as Figures in Literary History (Cambridge, 1918).</page><page sequence="17">200 English Literary Renaissance Mirth laughing came, running unto me, flung Her fat white Armes, about my Neck she hung, Imbrac'd, and kis'd me oft, and strok'd my Cheek, Telling me, shee would no other lover seek. (p. 77) The eroticism of this passage ("imbrac'd," "kis'd," "strok'd," "no other lover seek") merges the poet's body and an embodied thought (thought as a body, embracing the poet, and in the poet's body, as a mental phenomenon): mental abstraction and the poet's physicality are inseparable. Mirth thus shares the poet's substance, hence the same sex. If one cannot delineate the created fancy and its creator, and if the poem enacts this involvement, then the poet's body, her mind, the fancy and the poem are indiscrete and indiscreet, more nearly whole than in relation. Together, shaped on the stage in the poet's brain with no intruding discourse, they enclose art and life in a world of absolute self that is insisted upon across Cavendish's oeuvre. The involvement of the mental and physical in this poem is ideationally continuous with the "real life" account of shouting the fancies into order. When Mirth describes Melancholy, one hears again language from A True Relation, in which Cavendish describes herself as "addicted to . . . melancholy rather than mirth" (p. 172): For all shee heares, or sees, is in the Mind. But in her Mind luxuriously shee livs, Imagination severall pleasures gives, (p. 78). The language is almost identical with that of Sociable Letters as well ("My Thoughts entertain my Mind with such Pleasures"). Indeed, Cavendish's texts address each other specifically, so that Sociable Let- ters, clearly a "fiction," nonetheless provides accounts of Cavendish's atomism as set out in the poems and philosophical works. 16 Sociable Letters is particularly interesting as Cavendish's elaboration of an erotic hysteria which is only hinted at in The True Relation. Ostensibly writing to her Sister Pye (a letter which is of course never sent, although it is in effect transmitted through publication), Caven- dish states: Distance of Place, nor length of Time, cannot Lessen my Natural, or rather, Supernatural Affection to you, for certainly my Love for you is more 16. For an account of Cavendish's "atomism" see Sarasohn. Cavendish's theories of the physical universe were so eccentric as to embarrass even committed atomists.</page><page sequence="18">Sandra Sherman 20 1 than a Sisters Love, nay, such a Love, as when I Lived with you, it could not choose but be somewhat Troublesome, by reason my Love was Accom- panied with such Fears, as it would neither let you Rest, Pray, nor Eat in Quiet, for though it was a Watchful Love, yet it was a Fearful Love, for I remember I have oftentimes Waked you out of Your Sleep, when you did Sleep Quietly, with Soft Breathing, fearing you had been Dead, and oftener have I laid my Face over your Mouth, to feel if you Breath'd, insomuch as I have kept my Self Waking, to Watch your Sleeps, and as Troublesome as I was to you concerning your Feeding, as I was in your Sleeping, for I was Afraid that that which was to Nourish you, should Kill you. (SL, pp. 422-23) In The True Relation Cavendish notes that toward her Sister Pye, she bore a "supernatural affection" (p. 163), the exact phrase used in Sociable Letters but without elaboration.17 One has the sense that all of these works run into one another at a furious pace ("the brain being quicker in creating than the hand in writing [fancies] ofttimes outrun the pen, where I to keep speed in the race write so fast" TR, p. 172). Genre does not condition expression; "the truth is, they are rather scenes than Letters . . . [b]ut the reason why I have set them forth in the Form of Letters, and not of Playes, is, first, that I have put forth Twenty Playes already" (SL, "The Pref- ace"). That is, the works are transparent evocations of Margaret Cav- endish, shaped by no mediating discourse. No matter how fantastical, or as Cavendish insists, "harmless," they convey a self which defines itself by withdrawal into fancy. The anxiety that Cavendish expresses over losing her capacity to imagine ("my only trouble is, lest my brain should grow barren, or that the root of my fancies should become insipid"), is an anxiety over the loss of self, which she conceives as constituted in the mind. While there is no display of "fancies" in The True Relation , we are constantly told of their existence, and of the pleasant company their "conversation" provides. As one reads the oeuvre, which is filled with the contents of Cavendish's inner life, it is as if the autobiograph- ical narrative diffuses into other genres as one of many coequals embodying the self. The sense of narrative is lost, but the sense of 17. One wonders whether there is a suppressed homoeroticism in Cavendish, since she remarks that she "dreadjed] marriage, and shunned men's company" (TR, p. 163). Regarding her love for her husband, she states "it was not amourous love (I never was infected therewith, it is a disease, or a passion, or both, I only know by relation, not experience)" (TR, p. 163). Cavendish was childless. She does, however, "imbrace" the female Mirth.</page><page sequence="19">202 English Literary Renaissance "self intensifies. All of the works are in this sense autobiographical, preoccupied with the self. In the nominally "non-autobiographical" writings, we are shown (somewhat paradoxically) Cavendish's actual inner life, the fancies unmediated. This is not an undifferentiated inwardness. One might say that Cavendish elaborates her inner life through several genres, that she has founded a discourse not of the self, but of herself. The picture is essentially static - the more that is added, the more it remains the same, limited to the idiom of Cavendish's idiosyncratic, non-intertextual self. Cavendish argues that fancy is necessary for selfhood lest one go mad or (worse) become a bore: I Print this Book [Poems and Fancies ], to give an Account to my Friends, how I spend the idle Time of my life, and how I busie my Thoughts, when I think upon the Objects of the World. For the truth is, our Sex hath so much waste Time, having but little imployments, which makes our Thoughts run wildly about, having nothing to fix them upon, which wilde thoughts do not onely produce unprofitable, but indiscreet Actions; winding up the Thread of our lives in snarles and unsound bottoms. And since all times must be spent either ill, or well, or indifferent; I thought this was the harmless- est Pastime: for sure this Worke is beter then to sit still, and censure my Neighbors actions, which nothing concerns me. (P/F, "An Epistle to Mistris Toppe") If the female does not "spin" fancies from the mind, the "thread" of her life will wind up "in snarles and unsound bottoms." The aristo- cratic woman, with no private sphere for real spinning and no legiti- mate business outside the home, can still "think upon" "Objects," and so create the female subject through a self-enclosed private life. The continuity of logic between metaphor and personal reality through- out Cavendish's work; the elaboration into homologies that allows (domestic) spinning to be replaced by "spinning" (in the mind); the justification of this retreat on the grounds that these are just two (equally appropriate) modes of winding up the Thread of life; all these tie Cavendish's works together into an argument reflecting her per- sonal condition. Cavendish does not construct a persona from texts; she creates texts that would attest to her as a person. As she states in A True Relation, one must order one's "wilde thoughts" in order to express them. In the foregoing "Epistle," such thoughts threaten to overwhelm again, but reined in they become the stuff of useful fancy - useful to Cavendish in the construction and representation of</page><page sequence="20">Sandra Sherman 20ļ self. Yet contrary to Cavendish's tendency toward absolute intense implosion is an equal and opposite intertextuality which I shall now consider. Ill Anxiety is a feature of Cavendish's work, for all its wild exuberance, and it reflects the fear that the self is ephemeral, that the self could die. In the final passage of The True Relation , she states, [W]hy hath this lady writ her own life? since none cares to know whose daughter she was or whose wife she is, or how she was bred, or what fortunes she had, or how she lived, or what humour or disposition she was of. I answer that it is true, that 'tis to no purpose to the readers, but it is to the authoress, because I write it for my own sake, not theirs. Neither did I intend this piece for to delight, but to divulge; not to please the fancy, but to tell the truth, lest after-ages should mistake, in not knowing I was daughter to one Master Lucas of St. Johns, near Colchester, in Essex, second wife to the Lord Marquis of Newcastle; for my Lord having had two wives, I might easily have been mistaken, especially if I should die and my Lord marry again, (p. 178) Cavendish at once implodes inward, creating an absolute, private self with no cultural memory, while she would also lodge herself in cultural memory, and so mitigate death. The self is at once autono- mous - outside discourse - yet for that very reason precarious in history, since discourse goes on without (meaning "outside" and "excluding") the self. Discourse threatens the self with dissolution in intertextual noise, and preserves the self as it becomes part of that noise in the memory of culture. Cavendish posits an asymmetrical relationship to history, therefore, in which she seeks to remain imper- vious to eroding discourses while seeking to attain the authority of one who is remembered.18 That she should care about her place in history, while eschewing the discourses of the past and present, sug- gests a profound sense of self-creation and of the specialness of that creation; yet the very act of caring pushes her toward ultimate sub- mission to discourse and textuality. All we can ever "know" of Mar- is. For a discussion of Cavendish in relation to the Renaissance discourse of Fame, see Jean Gagen, "Honor and Fame in the Works of the Duchess of Newcastle," Studies in Philology 56 (1959)» 519-38. It is, of course, disingenuous of Cavendish to claim that " 'tis of no purpose to the readers," since if the readers do not "care to know," then her project will be defeated.</page><page sequence="21">204 English Literary Renaissance garet Cavendish is a text, and we can only know it because she has engaged with discourses that dissolve absolute selfhood. She inscribes the instability of the self in the act of trying to stabilize it. In "To all Writing Ladies," she states, [F]or they are poore, dejected spirits, that are not ambitious of Fame. And though we be inferiour to Men, let us shew our selves a degree above Beasts; and not eate, and drink, and sleep away our time as they doe; and live onely to the sense, not to the reason; and so turn into forgotten dust. But let us strive to build us Tombs while we live, of Noble, Honourable, and good Actions, at least harmlesse; That though our Bodies dye, Our Names may live to after memory. (P/F, following p. 160, unnum- bered) To write ones creations is to perpetuate one's name, not merely a (female's) derivative name, but the name that stands for the creative - created - individuated self. Cavendish makes a fascinating juxtaposi- tion between the work as "child," which does perpetuate a woman's name (as a creator), and real children, who do nothing in that regard: "a Woman hath no such reason to desire Children for her Own Sake, for first her Name is Lost to her Particular, in her Marrying, for she quits her Own, and is named as her Husband; also her Family, for neither Name nor Estate goes to her Family acording to the Laws" (SL, pp. 183-84). That one finally lives in one's works, provided they merit survival in culture, creates a profound anxiety over their recep- tion; it becomes a matter of life or death: But my desire that they [the "Atomes" in her verse] should please the Readers, is as big as the World they make; and my Feares are of the same bulk; yet my hopes fall to a single Atome agen: and so shall I remain an unsettled Atome, or a confus'd heape, till I heare my Censure. If I be prais'd, it fixes them; but if I am condemn'd, I shall be Annihilated to nothing: but my Ambition is such, as I would either be a World, or nothing. (P/F, "To Naturall Philosophers") Instead of the text assuming the shape of her mind, Cavendish as- sumes the shape of her text, submitting it - and herself - to "Cen- sure." The Cavendish that contains a "World" disciplined into order and impervious to external measurement is now so radically destabi- lized by submission to discourse that the World/Cavendish could collapse into "nothing." Endurance in history implies contingency.</page><page sequence="22">Sandra Sherman 205 The consequent anxiety becomes palpable in her most scarifying passage, bringing to bear metaphors of spinning and thread in an almost medieval discourse of death: Ballads are only proper to be Sung by Spinsters, and that only in Cold Winter Nights, when a Company of Good Huswifes are Drawing a Thread of Flax; so Time Draws their Thread of Life, as their Web makes them Smocks, so Times Web makes them Deaths Shirts, to which, as to Death, afterwards those Good Huswifes are married, and lie in the Bed of Earth, their House being the Grave, and their Dwelling in the Region of Oblivion; and this is the Fate of Poor Spinsters, and Ballad-Singers, whenas such a Singer as you, such a Composer as your Brother, such a Poet as my Lord, are Cloth'd with Renown, Marry Fame, and Live in Eternity, wherein Death hath no Power, Time no Limit, and Destinies Shears are Useless; but though I am willing to Sing an Old Ballad, yet not to Dwell in Oblivion, for I love your Company so well, as I would live in Eternity with you, and would be Clothed as you, with Renown. (SL, p. 429) 19 Spinning in its non-metaphorical sense, as appropriate to the private space of domesticity, is the way to death and oblivion. One exceeds that space by entering history, "spinning" poems, songs, the mind's creations, defeating death with Renown. The opposition between spinning away one's life and "spinning" into history, exempt from "Destinies Shears," is the counterpart of another opposition: living in the conventional private sphere, bored, annoying one's neighbors, or imploding into the private sphere of an alternate world, where "no Creature can, or will, Envy." Each set of oppositions provides a strategy for survival through transcendence, one by moving outward into time through Fame, the other by moving inward toward abso- lute selfhood, exempt from discourse. The crux is that Cavendish wants both: survival in history ("Eternity"), which requires submit- ting the self to judgment, and survival by exemption from discourses that corrode the self, thus eluding judgment. There is, therefore, a tension in Cavendish, who makes her self an impregnable "World," but seeks simultaneous fame and ultimate immortality ("If Fortune be my Friend, then Fame will be my Gaine, which may build me a Pyramid, a Praise to my Memory" [P/F, "To The Reader]). The endless prefaces to the reader, like nesting boxes, attest to a concern 19. In this passage, Cavendish is referring to relatives and to her husband, whom she regarded as a fine poet.</page><page sequence="23">2o6 English Literary Renaissance that she be understood and appreciated, even as her texts enact a retreat from discourse into private, mental reality. The inescapable irony is that this creator of an absolute self ulti- mately desires to be known as a text. Texts endure. As handwriting merges into print to avoid oblivion, so the self must yield to tex- tuality. The pressure in Cavendish's work is toward the text to the same degree as it is inward toward a point in the mind. Putting the "self" into a text is a form of attenuation from the original; an auto- biography (a displacement from the original, spontaneous, shouting oral self on the one hand, submitted to judgment on the other) is a form of suicide even as it is salvational. Cavendish's fear of death is the extreme expression of her sense that the creative self is limited by the physical (the hand cannot write fast enough; the head has only so much room). The text is a foil to the physical. It limits the attenua- tion of creativity which occurs through bad handwriting and ulti- mately through death. Giving in to the text is acknowledging one's physicality.20 Nevertheless, the tension between absolute selfhood and textual- ization is not a major concern to Cavendish. She appears to believe that submission of her work to contemporary judgment still permits a disavowal of contemporary discourse, a hiding out in the mind while the artifact goes forth to meet its fate. Her fear of death and oblivion are so real, her desire to survive in history so pressing, that one can only speculate that any contradictions these desires created with the desire to experience an absolute self were suppressed in her logic. They are clearly suppressed in her work: [Tļhere is nothing I Dread more than Death, I do not mean the Strokes of Death, nor the Pains, but the Oblivion in Death, I fear not Death s Dart so much as Death's Dungeon, for I could willingly part with my Present Life, to have it Redoubled in after Memory, and would willingly Die in my Self, so I might Live in my Friends . . . And this is the Reason I Retire so much from the Sight of the World, for the Love of Life and the Fear of Death: for since Nature hath made our Bodily Lives so short, that if we should live the 20. The tension in Cavendish is nicely drawn in "The Poetesses hasty Resolution," where Cavendish debates with her "Reason" whether or not to publish. In a curious twist, Reason takes the part of the absolute "self," whereas Cavendish herself is jealous of the opportunity to engage in discourse: "Reason observing which way I was bent / Did stay my hand, and ask't me what I meant; / Will you, said shee, thus waste your time in vaine, / On that which in the World small praise shall gaine? . . . / Angry I was and Reason strook away, / When I did heare what shee to me did say."</page><page sequence="24">Sandra Sherman 207 full Period, it were but like a Flash of Lightning, that Continues not, and for the most part leaves black Oblivion behind it ... I am industrious to Gain so much of Nature's Favour, as to enable me to do some Work, wherein I may leave my Idea, or Live in an Idea, or my Idea may Live in Many Brains, for then I shall Live as Nature Lives amongst her Creatures, which onely Lives in her Works, and is not Known but by her Works. (SL, p. 177-78) The discourse of death is tied up with a version of "good works" that is salvational, in the secular sense that they defeat the lapse of cultural memory. Cavendish's notion of good works is of course not charita- ble but profoundly self-regarding, intended to perpetuate the created self through its creations. The rhetoric is outside the Christian dis- pensation, outside its discourse : damnation is Oblivion, salvation is through aesthetic production. If ever there were an illustration of how far Cavendish has removed herself from potentially infringing dis- courses, it must be her modulation of the exigencies of achieving eternal life into strategies for attaining Fame. Indeed, she uses Eter- nity when she means history. She is outside discourse, creating the absolute self, inside discourse, submitting her works to the courts of Fame and Memory that may save her from Oblivion. It is a fascinat- ing paradox. Yet amid all the concern over death and survival, again precipitat- ing paradox, is the wildest hilarity, often associated with a description of the creative process. That this process should be funny, while having as well the function of saving the poet from Oblivion, is consistent with Cavendish's portrayal of a raucous self in need of the discipline required for art. Creation of an artifact and creation of the self run together; both are highly self-conscious, and what finally emerges is Cavendish's awareness of herself as a creator. She can anatomize her method: Warm Inclosed in a Mantle, and Easily Seated in my Coach, [I] began to take some Pleasure to see [skaters] Slide upon the Ice, insomuch as I wished I could, and might Slide as they did, but yet I would Slide as one of the Skilfullest, and most Practiced, and with a Security the Ice was so Firm as not to Break; but since I neither had the Agility, Art, Courage, nor Liberty, I returned Home very well Pleased with the Sight, and being alone to my self, I found I had a River, Lake, or Moat Frozen in my Brain, into a Smooth, Glassy Ice, whereupon divers of my Thoughts were Sliding, of which, some Slid Fearfully, others as if they had been Drunk, having much ado to keep on their Incorporeal Legs, and some Slid quite off their Feet, and Fell on the</page><page sequence="25">2o8 English Literary Renaissance Cold hard Ice, whereof some Sliding upon Imaginary Shoes, with the Imagi- nary Fall were tossed up into the Air of my Brain, yet most of my Thoughts Slid with a good Grace and Agility, as with a Swift, and Flying Motion. But after I had sat by the Fire-side some time, the Imaginary Ice began to Melt, and my Thoughts Prudently Retired, or Removed, for fear of Drowning in the Imaginary River of my Brain. (SL, p. 400-01) Reality slides into the enclosed coach, into the privacy of the brain enclosed in fire-lit space. Once enclosed, it is no longer reality, but capering on a stage in the mind, it is incorporated into the self, whose physical situation - returning warmth - engages paradoxical "incor- poreal" bodies which literally melt away. The scene is an extended conceit of the author's characteristic process of creation. In the artifact Cavendish is aware of herself being aware of herself creating. The process seems so natural; Cavendish seems so bemused at the total lack of effort; it is hard to imagine the same person working "indus- triously" to turn out good works in the face of Oblivion. We cannot penetrate to the "real" Margaret Cavendish, even though it is possible to demonstrate that she wanted us to. That in itself marks a shift in first-person writing during the seventeenth century, and designates Cavendish as part of that shift in consciousness, in particular among women. It is perhaps even more important that Cavendish's withdrawal into an impregnable position within the mind constitutes a politics. In another famous statement she asserts: As for the matter of Governments, we Women understand them not, yet if we did, we are educated from intermedling therewith, and almost from being subject thereto; we are not tied, nor bound to State or Crown; we are free, not Sworn to Allegiance, nor do we take the Oath of Supremacy, we are not made Citizens of the Commonwealth, we hold no Offices, nor bear we any Authority therein; we are accounted neither Useful in Peace, nor Ser- viceable in War; and if we be not Citizens of the Commonwealth, I know no reason we should be Subjects to the Commonwealth: And the truth is, we are no Subjects. (SL, p. 27) As Gallagher points out, it is because women are "no Subjects" that they can create a subjectivity, a Commonwealth in the mind unas- sailed by discourses in the public sphere which subjugate men. Cav- endish's politics are non-subversive, "harmless" as she never tires of saying. This is a feminism which asks nothing - no rights, no priv-</page><page sequence="26">Sandra Sherman 209 ileges. It is completely passive, and in that sense stereotypical. What is different is that it dislocates the private sphere and the means of production of selfhood. Spinning must become "spinning" if women are to have authority; children must be "children." She opines: "[T]he Safest Way is to Live a Single Life, for all Wives, if they be not Slaves, yet they are Servants, although to be a Servant to a Worthy Husband, is both Pleasure and Honour . . . but where there is a Hazard in the Choice, and a Security in not Choosing, the Best is to be Mistress of your self, which in a Single Life you are" (SL, p. 427). Her arguments therefore challenge women, not men, and the anxiety she expresses "lest [her] brain go barren" displaces traditional female fears of child- lessness. The domestic sphere of "significant others" is of less value than self-absorbed creation, the products of the mind. In this regard Cavendish creates a self distinctly modern. She is not in the least a blue-stocking - she is the opposite - but rather more like the woman who today tells other women they're cheating themselves by giving up Julliard for a man. While Cavendish is poignant in fearing death, her self-absorption hardens into disdain as it implies the judgmental. Indeed, Cavendish is forever criticizing other women as silly, unedu- cated, boring, and unproductive. At the poet's feast she is the only woman. There is an underlying assumption in Cavendish that every woman without "waste time" is a doomed "huswife," with no possibility of surviving in the memory of anyone. Her arguments for absolute selfhood, while not determined by the monarchic paradigm are still ultimately aristocratic. In one of her most famous - and brutal - comments, she states: Wherefore the commons should be kept like Cattel in Inclosed Grounds, and whensoever any did Break out of their Bounds, they should be Im- pounded, that is, the Commons should be kept Strictly, not to Exceed their Rank or Degree in Shew and Bravery, but to Live according to their Quali- ties, not according to their Wealth; and thośe that be so Presumptuous should be Imprison'd and Fined great Summs for that Presumption, and this would keep the Commons in Aw. (SL, p. 137) As Cavendish increases as a "subject" for the study of women's writing, her intense insistence on self should not be regarded as "harmless": her aesthetic is based on exclusionary theories of order which implicate the same in her politics ("the Commons should be</page><page sequence="27">210 English Literary Renaissance kept Strictly"). There is an ominous consistency between excluding the Commons from Cavendish's turf and the sense of physical bound- edness in her head requiring expulsion of excess fancies to order her thoughts into art. Disorderly elements have no place. Moreover, in a grim reversal, her disordering thoughts are personified into a march- ing army, while actual people are reduced to "Cattel." Thus while Cavendish recognizes the necessity to submit her art to judgment, it is not to the Commons'. She tempers the absolutist paradigm, but is always still a Duchess.
