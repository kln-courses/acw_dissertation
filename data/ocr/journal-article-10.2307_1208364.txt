<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE "POST-ANTI-ESTHETIC" POETICS OF FRANK O'HARA John Lowney It's so original, hydrogenic, anthropomorphic, fiscal, post-anti-esthetic, bland, unpicturesque and WilliamCarlosWilliamsian! it's definitely not 19th Century, it's not even Partisan Review, it's new, it must be vanguard! -Frank O'Hara, "Poem Read at Joan Mitchell's" In "Personism: A Manifesto," Frank O'Hara writes that "Personism" was "founded by me after lunch with LeRoi Jones on August 27, 1959, a day in which I was in love with someone" (Collected Poems 499). In accentuating the moment in which this "movement" was "founded and which nobody knows about," this manifesto/"diary" (498) mocks the pretentiousness of vanguardist polemics. Similarly, "Poem Read at Joan Mitchell's," O'Hara's celebration of Jane Freilicher's impend- ing marriage to Joe Hazan, playfully inscribes his poetic stance within the "vanguard," as "it's" signifies not only the poem's occasion but the act of celebration itself. Like "Personism," "Poem Read at Joan Mitchell's" dramatizes a moment of emotional urgency: the fear of losing his close friendship with Jane Freilicher informs O'Hara's subtle satire of the institution of marriage. Yet like so much of his poetry, this "occasional poem" self-consciously reflects on its own place in the "tradition of the new." The description of the marriage combines economic and aesthetic terms, situating this poetic act within the cultural politics of representing the "vanguard"; an "original" act, as the intensifier "so" implies, is original only insofar as it is mediated by definitions of the "new." The proper name describing this "original" marriage, "WilliamCarlosWilliamsian," epitomizes this recognition, for Williams's name represents a site of contention in the 1950s "poetry wars," not only for his literary reputation but for the meaning of American modernism. While Williams was variously invoked as a predecessor for the "new American poetry," the academic writing of him into the modernist canon was blunting the critical edge of his early "vanguard" poetics.'

The parodic tone of this gesture furthermore suggests O'Hara's critique of the masculinist, Americanist stance associated with Williams's postwar prot6g6s.2 Whether in mock manifesto or mock epithalamion, such references to modern literary history - although seemingly offhand - challenge claims like Helen Vendler's influential overview of O'Hara that "the will not to impute significance has scarcely been stronger in lyric poetry" (183). Instead O'Hara's modulations of vanguardist rhetoric frequently foreground not only the politics of literary repu- tation but also his own position within conflicting constructions of modernism. In the following pages I will examine how the intertex- tual devices of parody, appropriation, and allusion operate in O'Hara's revision of modernism, especially of the modernist lyric, to show how his "post-anti-esthetic" poetics of the quotidian addresses the issue of cultural memory in postwar America. The majority of O'Hara's academic readers have concurred with Vendler that his poetry levels the "significant" with the mundane, thus rejecting traditional modes of poetic transcendence. His best-known poems, the occasional poems he called his "'I do this I do that' poems" (Collected Poems 341), are most frequently cited to exemplify his interest in the "ordinary incident" instead of the "important public" event (Perloff 147). Vendler attributes O'Hara's refusal to "impute sig- nificance" to his effort "to make the personal the poetic" (183), thus severing the personal from the ideological. Other critics have explained O'Hara's evasion of symbolist correspondences by demonstrating his radical transformation of lyric subjectivity. In his reading of O'Hara's revisionary "poetics of immanence," Charles Altieri stresses the anxiety informing O'Hara's play of surfaces, his landscape without depth, without underlying significance (108-22). In emphasizing the ever- changing experience of temporal process in O'Hara's poetry, James E. B. Breslin similarly concludes that experience in his poetry is "absorbed with a kind of evenly suspended attention that does not 2Marjorie Perloff (44-45) documents O'Hara's professed admiration for Williams, especially his early lyric and prose poetry, in unpublished letters and notes. She quotes from O'Hara's notes for a 1952 lecture, "The New Poets," that he praised Williams's "'liberation of language,' his 'attempt to find an honest, tough, hard, beautiful thing' " (45). This praise, however, is tempered by a critique of his "WilliamCarlosWilliamsian" contemporaries, "the 'WCWilliams-ites' with their 'I am the man your father was Americanism,' their 'cleanness thinned down to jingoism,' their cult of the 'He-Man' " (45). o' HARA 245</page><page sequence="3">permit discrimination, emphasis, or even interpretation" (217). Even those analyses that situate O'Hara's poetics in socioeconomic terms, such as Charles Molesworth's summation that his poetry represents the "highest product of commodity-market capitalism" (94), or in the oppositional politics of gay language practices (Boone), base their claims on the leveling process effected especially by his paratactic syntax. I would like to concentrate on one question this leveling process raises, that of O'Hara's postmodernist representation of modern literary and cultural history. None of O'Hara's readers fully account for his intertextual evocations of the vanguardist stance whose critical edge he seeks to retain yet whose critical mode appears inadequate for addressing postwar American historical conditions. The tone of crisis so prevalent in O'Hara's poetry is informed by an acute sensitivity to the oppressive mechanisms that an ideology which represses difference can deploy. And this tone evokes the more general threat of nuclear annihilation, a threat which paradoxically levels distinctions between kinds of experience while heightening awareness of the ephemerality of the quotidian. O'Hara's poetry demonstrates that the progressivist faith in technology and technique that animates Williams's vanguardist dictum to "make it new" can no longer be asserted unproblematically. If formulations of postmodernism tend to dispute how postmod- ernist texts reflect or subvert the social effects of postwar capitalism, they generally agree that postmodernist and modernist aesthetics can be differentiated by their positions toward the past. Fredric Jameson has argued that postmodernism's "commitment to surface and the superficial" signifies a retreat from the "protopolitical vocation and the terrorist stance of the older modernism" (Foreword xviii). In dis- tinguishing pastiche from parody, Jameson further argues that post- modernist art thematizes the failure of the modernist project ("Post- modernism and Consumer Society").3 Given the eclipse of conditions for modernist stylistic innovation-that is, of individualism and of any linguistic norm with which to contrast styles - postmodernist imi- tation lacks any satirical impulse. Instead of parody, pastiche is thus the only possible mode for responding to the past: "All that is left is to imitate dead styles, to speak through the masks and through the voices of the styles in the imaginary museum. But this means that con- temporary or postmodernist art is going to be about art itself in a new kind of way; even more, it means that one of its essential messages will involve the necessary failure of art and the aesthetic, the failure 3For the expanded version of this argument, see Jameson's "Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism." 246 1 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="4">of the new, the imprisonment in the past" (115). Jameson's formulation accurately describes the play of allusion and quotation on the textual surface of a writer like O'Hara. O'Hara's writing, however, represents less an "imprisonment in the past" than the recognition that history is accessible only through its representations. If O'Hara's multivalent texts suggest that style is not freely expressed but is written through cultural codes, they also reveal that history is not a given that is immediately accessible by allusion but rather must be always con- structed. Furthermore, Jameson's totalizing formulation of postmod- ernism as a cultural dominant, following Ernest Mandel's socioeco- nomic periodization, obscures how postmodernist practices often retain the vanguardist oppositional impulse while rejecting the formalist notion of textual autonomy, as Andreas Huyssen and Linda Hutcheon have argued. Huyssen's analysis of postwar American cultural politics is especially germane for analyzing the poetry of the New York school. He underlines the importance of the reception and institutionalization of modernism - in the academy, as well as in the "burgeoning museum, gallery, concert, record and paperback culture"- for defining the adversarial stance of 1960s postmodernism: "It was this specific radical- ism of the avantgarde, directed against the institutionalization of high art as a discourse of hegemony and a machinery of meaning, that recommended itself as a source of energy and inspiration to the American postmodernists of the 1960's. . . . The irony in all of this is that the first time the U.S. had something resembling an 'institu- tion art' in the emphatic European sense, it was modernism itself, the kind of art whose purpose had always been to resist institutionalization" (192-93).4 From his prominent position within "institution art," that is, within the New York art-publishing and museum world, O'Hara in his poetry actually invokes a dialogical relation between past 4Huyssen bases his analysis of postmodernism on Peter Buirger's theoretical formulation of the "historical avant-garde" in Theory of the Avant-Garde. Biurger argues that Continental movements such as dada, surrealism, and futurism challenged the function of art's autonomy status, revealing the separation of art from bourgeois society as the basis for aestheticism. In rejecting the autonomy of art, self-critical texts like Marcel Duchamp's ready-mades succeeded in making "art as an institution" recognizable, as they critiqued the systems of the production, distribution, and recep- tion of art works. Biirger restricts his argument to European movements, but I would argue that Williams's commitment to experimentation and the destruction of tradi- tional forms exemplifies the critical stance of the "historical avant-garde." But although he shares the European vanguardist goal of integrating art into the praxis of life, Williams of course articulates his commitment to the local and the quotidian as a distinctively Americanist, antielitist response to modernization. O' HARA 1247</page><page sequence="5">traditions and the present more analogous to Charles Jencks's examples of postmodernist architecture and Hutcheon's examples of "historiographic metafiction" than to clearly politically marked postmodernist practices. Jencks argues that postmodernist architec- ture subverts modernist aestheticism through a process of "double coding," an interplay of modernist technique with allusion to popular traditions to communicate both with "experts" and a more general public audience (14). In O'Hara's case, if the "experts," literary critics and historians, concentrate primarily on the narrative surface of his poetry, it is because his process of double coding challenges this dichotomy of experts and public. Many of his most obscurely auto- biographical texts also participate in the general project of rewriting modern literary history. While his poetry appeals to a general audience through its recognizable narrative structures, it challenges "experts" to become conversant with the details of his life, especially within the New York art world and the gay community, as well as with modern literary history. In stressing the moment and site of enunciation, and frequently the specific receiver as well as the sender of the poetic text, O'Hara subverts the expertise of literary critics while enhancing the value of "local" knowledge. An early O'Hara poem which cogently, although obliquely, evokes the postwar crisis of historical memory that Jameson associates with the postmodern is "Memorial Day 1950." This "pastiche" of modernist styles critically interrogates the concept of the "vanguard," anticipat- ing O'Hara's more specific, more explicit practice and explanation of intertextuality in his later lyric poetry and criticism. Marjorie Perloff cites this poem, written during O'Hara's final year at Harvard, as a breakthrough which adumbrates his later distinctive poetic achieve- ment, the fusion of the surrealist "dialectic of polarized images" with Williams's colloquialism (49). Yet this poem not only replicates the vanguardist techniques of the artists it names, it enacts an interroga- tion of the subtexts relating modernism and modernity. From the poem's title - specifying a moment of reflection at the midpoint of the twentieth century - until its enigmatic yet apocalyptic conclusion, "Memorial Day 1950" fuses and confuses personal memory with codified historical memory, personal desire with textual knowledge, imagination with recollection. The title memorializes not only the moment of reflection but the moments reflected on, from the reflection on the war dead designated by the official holiday to the poet's reflec- tion on his biological and literary "parents." In what seem like random associations between fractured literary fragments and recollections of 248 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="6">childhood trauma, the poem explores the structures of feeling linking aesthetic vanguardism with military vanguardism. While mocking the self-aggrandizing posture of both the aesthetic manifesto and the bildungsroman, the poem conveys a version of modern literary history that acknowledges the rhetorical appeal of vanguardist utopianism while questioning the corresponding impulse to destroy past accom- plishments. In parodying modernist texts, it mocks its own destructive impulse. In leaving the poet's attitude toward his modernist predeces- sors ambivalent, "Memorial Day 1950" implicates its readers in a ques- tioning of how aesthetic forms represent modes of interpreting history. The semantic instability of "Memorial Day 1950" begins with its cryptic opening sentence: Picasso made me tough and quick, and the world; just as in a minute plane trees are knocked down outside my window by a crew of creators. (Collected Poems 17) The comma which separates "and the world" from the initial clause is especially puzzling, as it raises questions concerning both the pro- duction and the reception of complex artistic texts. What is the status of "made" in this clause? Do we locate the semantic stress on the act of making, the "made" text, or the audience "made . . . tough and quick" by the text? Did Picasso make "me ... and the world," thus implying the poet's total identification with Picasso's made world? Or is he maintaining some distance from Picasso while affirming the effects of his painting? Such interpretive questions are specific to complex artistic texts, but they also foreground the interpreter's his- torical difference. To consider Picasso in 1950 calls into question the relation of cubist aesthetics to modern warfare posited by such com- mentaries as Gertrude Stein's: "I very well remember at the beginning of the war being with Picasso on the boulevard Raspail when the first camouflage truck passed. It was at night, we had heard of camouflage but we had not yet seen it and Picasso amazed looked at it and then cried out, yes it is we who made it, that is cubism" (37). Furthermore, it is impossible to read "Picasso," perhaps the signifier for the inter- national avant-garde, without acknowledging the diverse appropria- tions of his aesthetics and his name. As the poem's parody of Stein's syntax and diction suggests, the effect of Picasso's multiple technical revolutions on the poet's own development cannot be severed from the objectification of Picasso as a cultural icon. As the opening line of "Memorial Day 1950" dramatizes the semantic instability of van- O 'HARA 249</page><page sequence="7">guardist texts through its fractured syntax, the conclusion of this open- ing sentence, although an apparently straightforward statement, becomes more questionable in its equation of destruction and creation. The textualized trees, "in a minute plane" of the cubist surface, fuse with the "plane trees . . outside my window." The mundane act of knocking down trees to "create" a new landscape, an act epitomizing bourgeois progressivism, evolves into the image of Picasso the ax wielder. In the understated tone of this first verse paragraph, the poem establishes a problematic affiliation of vanguardist manifesto rhetoric with the rhetoric of warfare: "to fight for the last ditch and heap / of rubbish" in response to Picasso asserts the value of the quotidian and the demotic for artistic texts, but only because the context of modern warfare animates our awareness of such value. It could be argued that "Memorial Day 1950" is hardly surrealist at all, that the images of artistic production, warfare, and bourgeois family life follow an internal logic of violent rebellion that challenges the polarity of destruction and creation. The poem does not follow consistently logical rhetorical patterns, however. Its generative prin- ciple appears to arise from the exhaustion felt by the artist in the wake of the historical avant-garde, as the second verse paragraph implies: Through all that surgery I thought I had a lot to say, and named several last things Gertrude Stein hadn't had time for; but then the war was over, those things had survived and even when you're scared art is no dictionary. Max Ernst told us that. This passage epitomizes the anxiety of the postmodernist poet that everything has been said, that formal innovation is no longer possible, and that the world wars have achieved the act of revolutionary destruc- tion that vanguardist rhetoric called for. The postwar artist must then accept a role analogous to that of Alice B. Toklas, the "autobiographi- cal" subject constructed by Stein, as the poet is "made" by Picasso. The remainder of the poem enacts this process of literary ventriloquism, as the names and words of Klee, Auden, Rimbaud, Pasternak, and Apollinaire, among others, comically reverberate through the frag- ments of battles the young poet has with his parents. In fusing van- guardist models of rebellion with the recollections of his own adoles- cent rebellion, O'Hara imparts an absurd sense of the quotidian to these artists whose earlier transformations of everyday life had earned them a monumental status by 1950. And in situating these fragmentary 250 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="8">fusings of manifestos and family disputes in the bloodshed of modern warfare, O'Hara imparts an urgency to his poem's articulation of its own historical moment. "Memorial Day 1950" enacts a process of appropriation and distancing from O'Hara's modernist predecessors, as one of its buried narratives, the transformation of Picasso's "The Man with the Blue Guitar," epitomizes. At first the original "maker," Picasso is next invoked through his best-known commentary on war- time destruction: "Guernica hollered look out." Immediately following this, the poet figures himself as the artist in "tight blue pants," as he confronts his disapproving parents. His parents are then generalized as the "older people" who "entered / my cheap hotel room and broke / my guitar and my can / of blue paint." The figure made by Picasso has now become the maker, the man with the "can / of blue paint," as well as the made, the man with the guitar. This image reappears in the poem's conclusion: Guitar strings hold up pictures. I don't need a piano to sing, and naming things is only the intention to make things. In distancing himself from the maker of "The Man with the Blue Guitar," O'Hara does not reject the technical accomplishments of Picasso, not to mention Wallace Stevens; rather, he rejects the defi- nition of art that limits the object to its exchange value as a commodity. In figuring his own poetic stance as an improvisational act of holding up pictures with guitar strings, O'Hara portrays the postmodernist rep- resentation of the past as a mode of bricolage. "Memorial Day 1950" is indeed a pastiche of vanguardist rhetoric, yet its parodic play on modes of rebellion underscores the complex historicity of any aesthetic, including (and especially) that of its own. O'Hara's statements on the social functions of art are diffuse and sometimes contradictory, but his occasional writings on his contempo- raries, in both the literary and visual arts, express a more complex consideration of the historical difference of the avant-garde in postwar American culture than is generally acknowledged. In differentiating between the European notion of vanguardism and its American coun- terpart in "American Art and Non-American Art," O'Hara claims that European art treats the aesthetic and the political as equally impor- tant distinct categories, whereas American art combines the aesthetic with the political, thus resulting in its "metaphysical quality" (Stand- ing Still 97). Yet this does not mean that art in America serves no social function. Citing Gregory Corso's poem "Bomb," he writes: "It is the O 'HARA 251</page><page sequence="9">character of the avant-garde to absorb and transform disparate qualities not normally associated with art, for the artist to take within him the violence and evil of his times and come out with something. . . . In this way society can bear and understand and finally appreciate the qualities of alien and even dangerous things" (98). This description of the avant-garde's relation to "society" corresponds with O'Hara's understanding of how the vanguardist stance is internalized. In a 1965 interview with Edward Lucie-Smith, O'Hara generalizes that the avant- garde can no longer be defined by a political or socioeconomic condi- tion of detachment or isolation, arguing that when artists such as Andy Warhol become celebrities, such a stance is absurd: "there's no reason to attack a culture that will allow it to happen, and even foster the impulse - and create it. Which is a change, you see, from the general idea of, that all avant-garde art has to be attacking the bourgeoisie" (Standing Still 9). As postwar American capitalism contains opposition to the extent that the marketplace even encourages it, the vanguardist impulse for innovation no longer plays such a viable critical role. What becomes most important, then, is how art positions itself within tradi- tions of innovation and in doing so transforms our perception of past forms. O'Hara's monograph on Jackson Pollock is especially instruc- tive for explaining this conception of intertextuality. There is nothing unusual about situating the urgency of Pollock's "action painting" in the context of cold war tensions, but the terms of O'Hara's analysis are rarely considered in relation to his own poetic practice: "it is not surprising that faced with universal destruction, as we are told, our art should at last speak with unimpeded force and unveiled honesty to a future which well may be non-existent, in a last effort of recognition which is the justification of being" (Jackson Pollock 22). Pollock's painting thus responds to the inescapable demands of the historical moment with a heightened sensitivity to the passing of time. His paintings are "painfully beautiful celebrations of what will disappear, or has disappeared already, from his world, or what may be destroyed at any moment" (21). If Pollock's method of painting represents a process fundamentally different from that of previous generations of modern painters, it is because his world compels a reconception of history. The postwar threat of annihilation represents an unprecedented scale of apocalypse, for the destruction of the entire world indeed becomes as fundamentally possible as the destruction of the individual body. Action painting's mode for inter- nalizing this sense of crisis is its revolutionary use of scale. The scale of the painting becomes the scale of the painter's body, and the setting 252 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="10">for the scale becomes the canvas surface itself. And foregrounding the act of painting preserves the act of resistance to totalizing systems in its historical specificity. For O'Hara's poetics, breath becomes the physiological analogy to the painter's body as a compositional force (Blasing, "Frank O'Hara's Poetics"); foregrounding the act of enuncia- tion similarly enacts resistance to totalizing systems, including those of closed poetic forms. What ultimately distinguishes O'Hara's interpretation of Pollock from the conventional image of the heroically destructive modern artist is his emphasis on how Pollock's painting preserves what is valuable in previous traditions of painting. Differentiating Pollock's "spirited revaluation" of modern painting from Arshile Gorky's more destructive mode of "assimilation," O'Hara writes that Pollock did not appropriate . . what was beautiful, frenzied, ugly or candid in others, but enriched it and flung it back to their work, as if it were a reinterpreta- tion for the benefit of all, a clarification and apotheosis which does not destroy the things seen, whether of nature or art, but preserves it in a pure regard. Very few things, it seems, were assimilated or absorbed by Pollock. They were left intact, and given back. Paint is paint, shells and wire are shells and wire, glass is glass, canvas is canvas. You do not find, in his work, a typewriter becoming a stomach, a sponge becoming a brain. (16) Although analogous to T. S. Eliot's familiar concept of intertextuality in "Tradition and the Individual Talent," O'Hara's explanation not only rejects the priority of a canonical tradition of high art but empha- sizes the way artistic texts transform our perception of the world, or "nature," as well as our perception of previous texts. Pollock's paint- ing retains the materials, techniques, and imagery of modern art, but they are transformed by his interpretation: the past takes on "reality for us outside his work, as a cultural by-product of his own achieve- ment" (16). With this emphasis on the historicity of formal innova- tion, the act of preservation O'Hara attributes to Pollock involves a nondestructive, nonadversarial attitude to the past that differs from the historical avant-garde as well as from Eliot's high modernism. Furthermore, Pollock's oeuvre exposes the limitations of reductive defi- nitions of "tradition" or "the individual talent." In noting that artists who succeed in sustaining a "multiplicity of truths" in a multiplicity of styles are "met with the accusation of 'no coherent, unifying style,' rather than a celebration" (11), O'Hara could be answering his own critics. His formulation of Pollock's intertextual "revaluation" of past traditions is especially appropriate for reinterpreting his relation to 0' HARA 253</page><page sequence="11">his modernist predecessors. I will now concentrate on one key example of O'Hara's "revaluation" of vanguardism, the example of his revi- sion of Williams's objectivist poetics, to show how his appropriations of Williams's form, prosody, syntax, and diction play a role similar to Pollock's in accentuating the historical transmission of aesthetic forms. In 1944, after repeated rejections by publishers who blamed the wartime shortage of paper, Williams published a volume of poems he had first conceived of as "The Lang(WEDGE)" then simplified to "The Language" before finally settling on a military metaphor for his title, The Wedge.5 Williams's introduction to The Wedge is an impor- tant wartime reconsideration of the social function of poetry, but perhaps more importantly, it represents a crucial point of reference for "avant-garde" poets in the 1950s and 1960s. In emphasizing the continuous "war" of poetic forms, Williams simultaneously univer- salizes and historicizes the place of formal innovation. To make new forms, the poet must meet the linguistic demands of his or her imme- diate time and place. Or, to transpose what Williams once said about Whitman ("America" 2), the only way to write like Williams is to write unlike Williams. If this paradox informs the reception and transfor- mation of Williams's poetics by the postwar "new American poetry," O'Hara's early parodies of him enact a postmodernist revision of his objectivist poetics that inverts his modernist dictum: the only way to write unlike Williams is to write like Williams, but to foreground the intertextual act of doing so.6 If we consider "A Sort of a Song," the introductory poem of The Wedge, as a sort of a summary of Williams's objectivist poetics, we can examine O'Hara's resport~e i.i two significant instances, in "Today" and in "Poetry." Its title accentuating its historicity, O'Hara's poem "Today" answers the conclusion of "A Sort of a Song," Williams's demand for "No ideas / but in things," with a motley assortment of objects: "kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas" and "pearls, har- monicas, jujubes, aspirins" (Collected Poems 15). This "stuff they've always talked about" that "still makes a poem a surprise!" is hardly "what they've always talked about" in American poetry, hardly the "things" Williams refers to, and hardly the "stuff" which makes a poem 50On the editing and publication of The Wedge, see Mariani, New World 480-83, and Baldwin. 6The most detailed account of O'Hara's appropriation of Williams's technique remains Perloff, especially 38, 44-48, and 54-56. See also Blasing, Art, especially 139; Baker; Breslin 218; and Molesworth 20. 254 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="12">a "small machine made of words." Yet what ultimately makes this short poem a surprise is its shift in tone as it concludes. The association of "these things" with "beachheads and biers" compels a reconsidera- tion of their significance, as "Today" refers to the immediate postwar years. Rather than defamiliarizing the everyday, "Today" foregrounds the ephemerality of everyday "stuff," including everyday language, as objects seem to be linked as much by the sonorous sequence of names as by appeal to any readily apparent semantic codes. The poem affirms the "meaning" of "things" but does not impose a recognizable order on these things. The use of "stuff" to summarize these objects seems to flaunt a lack of specificity involved in quoting colloquial lan- guage. It raises the question of whether these objects are the "stuff" of which this poem is made or the "stuff" from which a poem may yet be made, engaging readers to question their role in producing the poem's meaning. The semantic range of "stuff" itself recalls the war, but its connotations of drugs, of other forms of contraband, and even of literary or journalistic copy call into question the rhetorical func- tion of the poetic image. As if in direct response to "A Sort of a Song" ("through metaphor to reconcile / the people and the stones"), "Today" exerts no demonstrative control over readers' interpretations of the sequence of objects. Instead of Williams's "saxifrage," the poet's metaphor that "splits / the rocks," the "things" named are "strong as rocks." In relinquishing the will to power (to "reconcile," to "split"), "Today" affirms not "things" in themselves but the dialogue inherent in interpreting the codes that inform this surprising network of names, and that inform our conceptions of poetry's relation to the world of "today." O'Hara answers "A Sort of a Song" even more explicitly in "Poetry," as comparison of the poems' beginnings shows: Let the snake wait under his weed and the writing be of words, slow and quick, sharp to strike, quiet to wait, sleepless. (Williams, Collected Poems 55) The only way to be quiet is to be quick, so I scare you clumsily, or surprise you with a stab. (O'Hara, Collected Poems 49) O' HARA 255</page><page sequence="13">"Poetry" differs from "A Sort of a Song" most noticeably in its comic, self-deprecating tone. But more significantly, "Poetry" resembles a conversation in its address to an unidentified interlocutor, a "you" that gives this poem a sense of intimacy missing in Williams's more polemical mode. Accordingly, O'Hara replaces Williams's phallic figure of the "snake . . . under his weed" with the less aggressive, more enig- matic praying mantis, crickets, and zebra, images united by "time," the measured time of the poetic line figured in three diverse "natural" rhythms. But these "times" are also allusions to inevitable, unpredict- able change, the historical "time" which makes such confident proposals as Williams's seem archaic to O'Hara. The conclusion of his poem reiterates this hypersensitivity to time and transformation. The return to the conversational mode of address is accompanied by the speaker's recognition of the fictionality, and perhaps even solipsism, of his projections. Williams's imperative mode of address is replaced with "all this I desire . . . as if you / were logical and proven, . . . as if / I were used to you; as if / you would never leave me." Yet the method of rejecting solipsism, of affirming a dialogical relation with the addressee, is adapted from Williams's characteristic use of enjambment, where the breaks of the short lines occur at surprising syntactic junc- tures. Thus to "deepen you by my quickness / and delight as if you" simultaneously suggests the speaker's production and reception of "delight." Similarly, with the line break in the concluding lines, "inexorable / product of my own time," the addressee/reader is simul- taneously the "inexorable" and the "inexorable product" of the poet's time. In appropriating Williams's strategies of enjambment, O'Hara achieves a dramatic structure that engages readers to reflect on the desires informing their own sense of time and historical difference. From the playful subversion of interpretive authority in "Today" to the more complex dramatization of historicity in "Poetry," O'Hara's early parodies of "A Sort of a Song" exemplify the prominence of his "appropriation" of Williams's technique during the immediate postwar years. They also exemplify the significance of O'Hara's wartime experi- ence for his ironic interpretation of the 1950s "poetry wars."7 In his "I do this I do that" poems, especially in "lunch poems" such as "The Day Lady Died," "A Step Away from Them," or "Personal Poem," 7Despite the prominence of war imagery in O'Hara's early poetry, this topic has received surprisingly little attention. O'Hara himself was reticent about his war experiences. According to Joe LeSueur, in over nine years of living with him, O'Hara never spoke about "what he did in the war" (x). The fullest account of O'Hara's Navy years can be found in an essay he wrote while at Harvard, "Lament and Chastise- ment: A Travelogue of War and Personality." 256 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="14">O'Hara's postmodernist "revaluation" of modernist poetics more subtly confronts the philosophical and ideological subtexts of vanguardism. There is certainly minimal subordination of seemingly insignificant elements to greater patterns of meaning in these poems. Because they are narratives, the sequencing of events often overshadows any pattern of symbolic meaning. Although such poems resemble what Roland Barthes would call the classical "readerly" text in their apparently straightforward narrative structure, they continually submit the nar- rated events to questions concerning their ideological significance, con- curring with Barthes's notion of structure in the "writerly" text: "structure is not a design, a schema, a diagram: everything signifies something" (51). The two polar hypotheses describing O'Hara's poetry-the "will not to impute significance" and "everything signi- fies something" - inform the process of "double coding" which compels readers continually to decide on what is significant while concurrently reflecting on the grounds for such decisions. Such tension makes readers simultaneously attentive to significance in the seemingly insig- nificant and wary about attributing significance at all, as closer examination of O'Hara's best-known "lunch poem," "The Day Lady Died," will show. "The Day Lady Died" is probably the poem most frequently cited for demonstrating O'Hara's antipoetic stance. Because this poem is an elegy, it is somewhat atypical of the more casual "I do this I do that" poems. The occasion of the poem, the death of Billie Holiday, heightens the significance of the poem's details. Nevertheless, the rela- tion of the details to the poem's generic form remains problematic. The majority of critics agree that the details observed by the poem's speaker are random, that there is little significance to the times, people, places, and events mentioned. These details are the poem's "anti-poetic weight" (Molesworth 19) or mere coincidences which contrast sharply with the seriousness of the occasion. Robert von Hallberg's assess- ment that the poem's impact depends on its "inadvertent, banal approach to an earnest genre" (178) typifies this critical reaction. On the other hand, critics such as Altieri have argued that the details of the poem do contribute to the feeling of the elegy, although these critics still maintain the contrast between the discontinuity of the reported experiences and the poem's elegiac conclusion (Altieri 120-22). Despite this disagreement about the relation of the poem's details to its impact as an elegy, no one is willing to read too much significance into the details; the appearance that the poet just coincidentally and randomly notices them forecloses such conjecture. "The Day Lady Died" epitomizes the tension between first and O 'HARA 257</page><page sequence="15">second readings of O'Hara's "I do this I do that" poems. Except for the cryptic title, whose significance would be noted only by those familiar with Billie Holiday, there is no indication that the poem is an elegy until the closing stanza. Like so many of O'Hara's poems, "The Day Lady Died" narrates events in the present tense; the events occur concurrently with the utterance itself. This process of simul- taneous composition is less stream of consciousness than conscious- ness of stream, the stream of urban streets reported in rapid succes- sion. The rapidity of reporting, emphasized through paratactic syntax, constant enjambment, and minimal punctuation, precludes attention to detail. It is only with the poem's apocalyptic closure ("everyone and I stopped breathing"), closure which unites the remembered event with the present, the performance of Holiday's song with the performance of the poem, that the narrated events become significant. Yet even when the poem has "stopped breathing," the details do not fit into a readily apparent design other than that of the speaker's lunchtime walk itself. The genre of the poem demands the reconstruction of design from its disparate details, but the details resist such reconstruction. There are a number of references to time in "The Day Lady Died," typical for the lunch poems O'Hara wrote with one eye on his wrist watch, but particularly significant for a poem about death. These refer- ences are hardly uniform, however; there is quite a difference in saying "It is 12:20 in New York a Friday" and saying "three days after Bastille Day" (Collected Poems 325). The first reference situates the poem in a specific yet repeatable time frame, while the second calls attention to the poet's selection of a dramatic descriptive term. "Bastille Day" gives the poem a sense of historical depth which contrasts with the matter-of-fact reporting of departure and arrival times of the Long Island trains the poet plans to take that evening. The reference to Bastille Day hardly seems gratuitous, for many of the poem's succeed- ing historical and geographical references represent examples of oppres- sion, imprisonment, and revolution, issues intimately related to Billie Holiday's life. When the poet buys "an ugly NEW WORLD WRITING to see what the poets / in Ghana are doing these days," he refers to a country (formerly the Gold Coast) which had gained independence in 1957, only two years before the "day Lady died." The reference to Ghana, rather than to another African country, is especially relevant for Holiday's African-American genealogy, for the Gold Coast had been an important center for the slave trade. Similarly, the books the poet considers buying for "Patsy" are relevant for the final years of Holiday's life, years in which she was trailed by the FBI. The books 258 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="16">mentioned, "Brendan Behan's new play or Le Balcon or Les NMgres / of Genet," concern oppression and rebellion, and the authors were not only noted rebels but had spent time in prison themselves. Behan was twice imprisoned while a member of the IRA, Jean Genet spent much of his life in jails, and Paul Verlaine, whose book the speaker finally decides to buy, spent two years in a Belgian prison after shoot- ing his lover, Arthur Rimbaud. As casual and coincidental as such references to authors and literary texts appear, the pattern of oppres- sion and rebellion they convey casts a powerful shadow over a life the poem elegizes but never explicitly describes. The other names the poet mentions, names of friends, familiar places, and consumer products, become more resonant with their his- toricity when juxtaposed to other historical periods, people, and places. The juxtaposition of names ("Patsy," "Mike") and places ("the GOLDEN GRIFFIN," "the PARK LANE / Liquor Store," "the Ziegfeld Theatre," "the 5 SPOT") the poet knows with historical figures and foreign places personalizes the poem's historical references. The mention of people the poet does not know ("the people who will feed me," "Miss Stillwagon") along with international trade names ("Strega," "Gauloises," "Picayunes") conflates the impersonal and the interna- tional with the personal and the local. As the literary and artistic center of 1950s American culture, New York offers unlimited choice, but only in exchange for the reified subjectivity of consumer capitalism. Finally, except for the reference to Bastille Day, all of the poem's references to "foreign" and "past" history (the poem as well as consumer capi- talism problematize the meaning of "foreign" and "past") are refer- ences to texts. History is always represented, in this case bracketed between the covers of the journals and books the poet browses through at newsstands and in bookstores. Even the first mention of the figure the poem celebrates appears in a "NEW YORK POST with her face on it." This emphasis on the textuality of history foregrounds the rela- tion of this literary text, "The Day Lady Died," to its immediate his- torical referent, the day "Lady" died. "The Day Lady Died" is con- currently a repeatable, ahistorical script and an unrepeatable historical transcript of events; the poem loses much of its resonance without historical knowledge of the day it records. In accentuating historical difference, the transience of the local people, places, and events named, the poem also suggests patterns of historical repetition, revolution in France and revolution in Ghana, persecution of artists in France and persecution of artists in America. By placing the death of Billie Holiday in the context of Bastille Day and official oppression of artists, O'Hara O'HARA 259</page><page sequence="17">subtly comments on the state of the "avant-garde" artist in 1950s America. All of the actions represented in "The Day Lady Died" are acts of selection, especially the consumer's selection of what to do and what to buy for specific social occasions. Most of these are automatic or socially constrained acts of selection, but beginning with the decision of the bank teller, Miss Stillwagon, not to "even look up my balance for once in her life," the process of selection raises fundamental inter- pretive questions. The poet does not speculate on Miss Stillwagon's intentions for her change of behavior, but by stressing the singularity of this occasion, he suggests his own act of reflection and encourages readers to consider the significance of the bank scene to the rest of the poem, and even the semantic possibilities of "Miss Stillwagon" and "my balance." The next act of selection initially seems to be as unprob- lematic as the other purchases: "and in the GOLDEN GRIFFIN I get a little Verlaine / for Patsy." This seemingly unreflective act is modi- fied, however, by the catalogue of book titles the poet has already considered, a catalogue which concludes with the striking oxymoron "I stick with Verlaine / after practically going to sleep with quandari- ness." "Quandariness" implies a state of agitated or distressed aware- ness, a state not normally associated with sleep. "Going to sleep with quandariness" suggests a weariness with selection, in this case the con- sumer's weariness with selecting a literary text to give to his friend, but a weariness as well with selecting the appropriate literary refer- ences to elegize Holiday. On the other hand, "going to sleep" also sug- gests an erotics of "quandariness," as this weariness is belied by such linguistic inventiveness. The poem asserts that imaginative inventive- ness can subvert imprisonment in tradition; likewise art can momen- tarily release one from the imprisonment of self-consciousness inherent in such anxiety of selection. The final act of selection in "The Day Lady Died" appears not to be a conscious choice at all; the photograph of "Lady Day" invokes a memory of the artist's power literally to take one's breath away, and in doing so, to make the scenario of the poem's closure more vivid, more lasting. In closing the poem on this note, O'Hara not only closes the process of selection but heightens the significance of the poem's details as well. As the image of "Lady Day" conjures the precise memory of "leaning on the john door in the 5 SPOT," the conclusion of "The Day Lady Died" sharpens the images portrayed earlier. Such lines as "and I don't know the people who will feed me" or "Miss Stillwagon... doesn't even look up my balance" become laden with 260 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="18">possibly ominous significance when viewed through the lens of Billie Holiday's death, a lens colored by the questions of oppression, revolt, and imprisonment which inform the references to other artists in the poem. It is possible to go to "sleep with quandariness" with the details of "The Day Lady Died" only by refusing to select how they are sig- nificant. Such a reading risks falling into a state of historical amnesia that the details of the poem insistently militate against. In place of the specific intertexts invoked by his earlier pastiches and parodies, O'Hara's "lunch poems" foreground the New York cul- tural text in which modernism is disseminated, both in the institutionali- zation of "high art" and in mass culture. The temporal structure of the lunch break itself dramatizes the sense of exhausted urgency inform- ing the "quandariness" of selection: the lunch break positions the poet within, but liminally outside, the restrictions of the employer's time clock, the employer of course epitomizing the "institution art" in post- war America, the Museum of Modern Art. Yet the lunch break also evokes the circular structure of what Harold Bloom has called the romantic "crisis-poem." In accentuating the disjunctions of his auto- biographical reflections with romantic and modernist constructions of subjectivity and landscape, O'Hara's lunch poems exhibit not so much "anxiety of influence" as a "revaluation" of lyric subjectivity, a revaluation that foregrounds the postmodern reception of "tradition." As O'Hara claims in "Nature and New Painting," "nature" cannot be distinguished from "human nature" in his modern urban landscape: "In past times there was nature and there was human nature; because of the ferocity of modern life, man and nature have become one" (Standing Still 42). The description of the local in an urban setting therefore always leads to consideration of the modes of signification that define the landscape. Similarly, the circular structure of O'Hara's lunch poems cannot be distinguished from the structure of the lunch break itself. Just as the urban landscape is a product of signification, the lunch break is a product of the work schedule. The urban scene does provoke meditation in these poems, but it is rarely depicted sym- bolically; significance is immanent in the names of people, places, and events. By adapting the circular pattern to the lunch break, and by transforming that pattern by attention to quotidian urban details, O'Hara interrogates the subject-object relations constructed in the romantic lyric. And by furthering the formal and linguistic experi- mentation of Williams's use of the vernacular, O'Hara "revaluates" the romantic definition of the local, both geographically and linguis- tically. In doing so he underscores the romantic impulse of Williams's O'HARA 261</page><page sequence="19">desire to merge subject and object, while recuperating the formal and linguistic experimentation that revealed the impossibility of such a "marriage." O'Hara simultaneously renews and deconstructs the romantic lyric; the dissonance resulting from this project arises from his postmodernist questioning of the expectations such a form raises. The "I" which perceives the urban landscape in O'Hara's poetry is more a composite of multiple subject positions, the site of associa- tions with the names of friends, places, and objects portrayed, than a coherent presence that stands apart to comment on them. O'Hara's poetry rehearses the paradox of modern urban subjectivity explained by sociologist Georg Simmel in "The Metropolis and Mental Life": On the one hand, life is made infinitely easy for the personality in that stimu- lation, interests, uses of time and consciousness are offered to it from all sides. They carry the person as if in a stream, and one needs hardly to swim for oneself. On the other hand, however, life is composed more and more of these impersonal contents and offerings which tend to displace the genuine personal colorations and incomparabilities. This results in the individual summoning the utmost in uniqueness and particularization, in order to preserve his most personal core. (422) O'Hara's poetry dramatizes the tension between what Simmel calls the "metropolitan blase attitude" - the blunting of discriminations between the meanings and values of things which results from the money economy and from the "intensification of nervous stimulation" - and the compensatory exaggerated personality. A half century after Simmel's essay, O'Hara's "post-anti-esthetic" poetry repeatedly fore- grounds how both representations of the "metropolis" and enactments of the exaggerated personality are culturally coded in "traditions of the new." Yet this self-conscious process itself enables O'Hara's per- sonality, in all its dramatic multiplicity, to become the site which "still makes a poem a surprise": and I read the letter which says in your poems your gorgeous self-pity how do you like that that is odd I think of myself as a cheerful type who pretends to be hurt to get a little depth into things that interest me and I've even given that up lately with the stream of events 262 CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="20">going so fast and the movingly alternating with the amusingly (Collected Poems 336-37) Frank O'Hara's poetry subverts the distinctions he posits here in "Post the Lake Poets Ballad." The romantic dialectic of the "I" and the land- scape becomes transformed into a colloquy of subject positions with the "stream of events / going so fast and the movingly / alternating with the amusingly." The poet of "gorgeous self-pity," who "pretends / to be hurt," and the poet carried along by the "stream of events" con- tinually collide and converge with each other in a pattern of the "movingly / alternating with the amusingly." Neither the "pretend- ing" poetic voice nor the "stream of events" predominates; the poems constantly remind us that the subject both constructs and is constructed by the "stream of events." By foregrounding how the poetic enuncia- tion is always situated, O'Hara's poetry is not restricted to the "merely" personal; rather, this poetry continually reveals the historical and ideo- logical forces which inform the "personal" at every moment.
