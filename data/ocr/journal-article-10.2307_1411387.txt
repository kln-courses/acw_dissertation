LEUBA, Fellow in Psychology, Clark University. INTRODUCTION. The passage from the standpoint of knowledge for knowl- edge's sake, to that of knowledge for life's sake, expresses one of the aspects of the widest movement of modern intel- lectual evolution. Our age, and in particular the Anglo- Saxon race, has gained the reputation of being intensely practical. This tendency has a deeper philosophical mean- ing than is generally recognized. As the child passes with advancing years from actions having no objective end to activities for definite results, in a like manner do nations turn from the delusive grandeur of the knowledge for knowl- edge's sake ideal to that of knowledge for life's sake, and substitute the Gospel of Being and of Doing for that of Knowing. Intellectual pursuits have been powerfully stimulated and their direction much altered by this great life-wave. Until the beginning of our century the formal operations of the mind and the framing of cosmological schemes were the chief objects of philosophical meditation. Schopenhaner, following in the steps of some predecessors, and reacting against what we like to call static philosophy, brought us face to face with the unconscious, the emotional, the striv- ing forces of nature. Up to him philosophy was anatom- ical; he made it physiological. It is in psychology that we find this "practical"</page><page sequence="2">tendency working the most decisive changes. With the increased interest in the impulsive, the instinctive, the affective side of life in general, a number of new lines of research, all having a close relation to life, have been opened: Child study, the psychology of growth, of adoles- cence, of sex; some branches of anthropology, psychi- atry. And instead of standing aloof from life on barren heights, modern psychology feeds on biology and on phys- iology, and is the handmaid of pedagogy and of ethics. There remains a domain in which psychological science has not yet planted its standard: it has ignored the manifesta- tions of religious life. Yet there are few questions engross- ing so much the attention of our thinking world as that of religion, and there are no spheres in which more powerful creative forces are at work. 1 The fall of Christian orthodoxy is accompanied with a recrudescence of religious fervor. Neo-Christian movements are in progress in France2 and in Germany, and have long since begun to agitate England and the United States. All over the civilized world men's hearts and brains are in travail with a new Revelation. It is true that a great deal of historical and philosophical work bearing on the religious problem has been done during the past decades, but no researches, from the standpoint of modern psychology, on the subjective phenomena of religious life have appeared. Comparative studies of religions, histor- ical accounts of their growth and development, investigations into the contents of the religious consciousness, are valuable contributions to our knowledge. They accomplish for religion what would have been done for medicine, before dissection was practiced, by historical researches, comparative expo- sitions of the various notions and systems in vogue in differ- ent countries, and the like; all of which is very good and use- ful; but the essential work, the scientific work par excellence, that was to give to medicine a solid foundation, was the actual study of the body by means of scalpel and micro- scope. If religion has any reality, it must perforce express itself in pyschic and physiological phenomena. The work of a true Science of Religion, as we understand it, is to find out what these subjective manifestations are, and then to treat them as it would any other psychic fact. Neither the theories, nor the external practices, rites or ceremonies, but the deeper 1 Consider the amount of life poured into the veins of humanity by such men as Gautama, Jesus, St. Augustine, St. Francis of Assisi, Luther, Wesley, Booth, and others. 2 For an account of the Neo-Christian Movement in France, see the AM.

Never mind the old and the new popular beliefs concerning these realities, never mind the body of doctrines held by the sub- ject of these experiences; mind the subjective fact in itself. To it science must apply its tools, for it is the essence of re- ligious life. After all, the questions which must be solved are the following: What are the gifts in the hands of Religion, and how can man become partaker of them How and by what in religion is life transformed and ennobled? How is man "born again"? These are the questions con- fronting Science and Philanthropy alike. We would not convey the impression that we hold in con- tempt the labors of the eminent workers in the field of the history and philosophy of Religion. We would only direct the attention of those interested in this problem to another line of research, and emphasize our conviction-which, we cannot help thinking, will be shared by all those who have learned the lesson given us by the history of the Natural Sciences,- that its solution will come only from the scientific psychologi- cal study of every one of the particular subjective manifesta- tions of religious life. Supposing that these several phenomena have been singled out, and that, as far as our means permit, they have been determined in their cause and in their nature, we should possess in these theoretical results the elements of a science of religion. The new creed would be born; the wings of youth would no more be clipped in the spring of life by a scholastic dogmatism; and the soul-midwifery now ex- tensively, but ignorantly, practiced by our revivalists and pastors, could be based upon a positive knowledge of the psy- chology of regeneration. ' What a fantastic dream!" many will exclaim. It must be admitted that the difficulties in the way of such a task are serious, and that we are as yet far distant from the goal; nevertheless, that it is no Utopia, but the sure conquest of a near future, is warranted by the recent advances of psychology; for, wherein do religious phenomena essentially differ from some of those with which that science is now dealing? The religious experiences named sense of sin, repentance, remorse, aspirations toward holiness, regen- eration (conversion), trust, faith, belong to the same class as the affective problems now under study, as, for instance, the question of pain and pleasure, the relation of the feelings to the intellect, the motor power of ideas, attention, effort, etc. If they do not include the whole of religious life, the facts we have mentioned constitute at least the essence of Christian life; for what reason should we pry into the latter 311</page><page sequence="4">and refrain from inquiring into the former 1 The subjective facts of religious life belong to psychology. It is the duty and the privilege of that science to extend its beneficial sceptre over this realm also. The time is particularly favor- able for such an annexation; the power that ruled during the past centuries has grown senile, its authority is denied; a painful anarchy prevails. Let psychology accept the succes- sion that falls to it by right. Led by considerations, some of which are indicated in the preceding pages, while others are to be mentioned in the fol- lowing section, we have undertaken a study of the phenomenon commonly called "Conversion." We have chosen conversion because of its striking and well delineated characteristics, and on account of its paramount importance in religious life. Moreover, material for the study could be collected without too much difficulty. The reader may feel that our choice has been presumptuous. However that may be, it is with a painful feeling of its incompleteness and insuffi- ciency that we send forth the following essay. Had it no other value, it would at least be an indication of what might be done in this department of psychology. As a number of records of conversions has been appended, we shall dispense with a description of the experience going under that name. We have limited our material to sudden and well marked cases, for the reason that violent psychic phenomena, by their very emphasis, bring to light what remains obscure in less intense and slower events. In the main the conclusions reached by the study of sudden conversions apply with equal exactitude to slowly progressing regenerations. THE RELIGIOUS MOTIVE. We are aware that many will be of the opinion that the subject of our inquiry is an abnormal phenomenon, which would not occur in a healthy and enlightened community; they will see in it mere idiosyncrasies extraneous to the main current of life. That such an estimate ignores the true nature of conversion will be made apparent, we hope, by the follow- ing rapid glance at the evolution of religious conscious- ness. Religious philosophers have experienced perplexing difficulties when they have attempted to extract from the various known forms of religion, common characteristics which could serve in the making of a definition of Religion. Herbert Spencer finds the vital element of Religion in the impulse of the human race to seek for first principles:- 312 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. Religions diametrically opposed in their overt dogmas, are yet perfectly at one in the tacit conviction that the existence of the world with all it contains and all which surrounds it, is a mys- tery ever pressing for interpretation. On this point,rif on no other, there is entire unanimity. . . That this is the vital element in all religions is further proved by the fact that it is the element which not only survives every change, but grows more distinct the more highly the religion is developed. No definition considering religion as a noetic impulse and making it dependent upon particular conceptions, as that of God, of soul, of spirit, of immortality, can possibly be ade- quate. The essence of religion is a striving towards being, not towards knowing. If Spencer, and the many philoso- phers who think with him, were right, religion, purified of superstitions, would be neither more nor less than philosophy and science, and the natural culmination of the various forms of religion could only be, as Auguste Comte affirmed, Positive Philosophy, following upon Metaphysics, itself the child of Religion. That which the term Religion embraced in early societies was a complex product, made up of all the fundamental needs and aspirations of men. It was an embryo containing poten- tially several different parts and functions as yet undiffer- entiated, and consequently going under a common name. Thinkers of the opinion quoted above have followed the de- velopment of one limb-of the head, if you please-and ignore whatever else grew out of the embryo. The noetic impulse was one of the elements contained in the primitive conglom- erate, to be sure; but not the only one, perhaps not even the chief one. Auguste Comte's three stages correspond truly to three links in the chain of evolution, but he failed to see that at every link other links branched off. Positive philosophy is the form assumed in our time by one of the germinating elements contained in the primitive plasma known originally as Religion; the thirst for knowledge. But something else issued forth from primitive Religion-a something essen- tially different from a propensity to solve the riddle of the universe. It is this other shoot which is to-day the vital force of that which has inherited the name of religion. In the remainder of this chapter we shall try to point out the nature of that motive power. It is not yet completely differ- entiated from the philosophical motive; they are still blended together in practice and in theory. However, theologies and philosophies are being rapidly winnowed out by the blind intelligence of growth, and religion will soon have assumed an independent and definite figure clearly separated from the latter. The religion of the savage, roughly described, includes 313</page><page sequence="6">beliefs in spirits, good and bad, endowed with the power of harming and prospering. It finds expression in emotions of fear and of hope, of anger and of good will; in rites and ceremonies destined to please the spirits, with the expecta- tion of direct returns, or prompted only by a desire for fel- lowship. Let beliefs in spirits cease, and this form of re- ligion is at an end. When the relation between man and the Powers above assume a higher aspect, we rise to the Jewish and Christian religions, for instance. Fear, which plays such a preponderant rble in primitive religions, as also in the childhood of the individual, is replaced by love. God is now pictured as a sympathetic Father, listening and answering, never angered against His truly repentant children. He stands at the door of the paternal mansion with outstretched arms to receive the prodigal son. If the belief in a bene- ficent personal divinity watching over the actions of men, able and ready to answer prayers directly, is lost, this form of religion also ceases to exist. Yet religion need not be impaired. History has preserved a famous example of the in- dependence of religious experience from those intellectual con- cepts. Buddha Sakyamuni was a godless man, in the narrow meaning given to the term God in Christian theology. He discouraged formal prayer, for it ascended but to strike against the adamantine vault of causal connection and to come back in a mocking echo. Yet we recognize in him a remarkably powerful and elevated religious nature. What shall we say of the intellectual vanguard of our day? What is the religion of the few bred in the atmosphere of intel- lectual freedom and scientific thought, whose strong faith in nature boldly discards the ragged garments inherited from the past ? Such men, we venture to say, disavow any fear referring to possible action of the divine power; they have no belief in an interfering Providence, and con- sequently none in prayer; responsibility they feel towards none but themselves and those affected by their doings; im- mortality of the " Ego " they, possibly, cannot even hope for; adoration, worship, devotion, piety, in the common acceptation, are incompatible with these negations; out- wardly they have no cult, return no thanks,and ask for noth- ing from the Powers of the world, for they know them to be deaf to such supplications and insensible to human thank- fulness; narrowly construed, these words have become dead letter to them. Have these men passed beyond the religious stage? Yes, if religion consists in the intellectual beliefs they discard. If we have in this essay insisted upon the absolute divorce which must be recognized between intellectual beliefs and 814 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. religion, it is because in the rupture of this mischievous identification lies one of the most pregnant practical con- clusions which modern life can derive from psychological in- vestigations in religious life. The most evanescent aspects of religion are precisely its intellectual formulations, includ- ing the idea of the soul, of the future life, of God, etc.; and the most exalted religious consciousness is consistent with the negative intellectual creed sketched above. These common conceptions-generally regarded as essential -rejected orignored, the religious sense remnains, modified per- haps but unweakened, in the feeling of unwholeness, of moral imperfection, of sin, to use the technical word, accompanied by the yearning after the peace of unity. No intellectual conviction can rob man of this subjective treasure. Its reality transcends all possible belief concerning the origin and the end of things, because, as we hope to show, it is the psychic correspondent of a physiological growth, and consequently can in no wise fail, except together with that growth. Around this religious root, springing from it, or otherwise function- ally related with it, cluster all the familiar religious feelings. For instance, altruistic love is implied in the efforts to attain unity of moral consciousness, for we learn in such experi- ences that the " sacrifice of self " gives ease to the pain of sin; the failure of one's efforts to attain moral perfection develops the sense of dependence, of subjection, which has of late been made the centre of many definitions of religion. He who has these feelings - which are rooted in the sense of sinfulness - possesses the efficient essence of religion. Herbert Spencer's opinion quoted above, as well as al theories making religion depend upon the desire to know, instead of upon the desire to be, are belied by the biographies of the great founders or promotors of religions. They were not, as we shall presently see, preeminently preoccupied by the riddle of the objective universe. On the contrary they often ignored almost completely the philosophical problems re- ferred to by the author of the Synthetic Philosophy. Their concern is the attainment of moral perfection, of inward unity; their speculative interest--as far as it exists - is the result of the activity of the ratiocinating wheels put in motion by the moral needs. The life of Gautama, however lacking in historical cer- titude, leaves no doubt that what launched him into his re- ligious career was not the goading riddle of the universe, but the deep moral struggle from which he suffered. After the Great Renunciation under the Bow tree and his victorious en- counter with temptations, he declared, " I am now going to the city of Benares to establish the kingdom of righteousness, 315</page><page sequence="8">to give light to those enshrouded in darkness, and open the gates of immortality to men. I have completely conquered all evil passions, and am no longer tied to material existence, and I, now, only live to be the prophet of perfect truth." The end he has sought-to conquer all evil passions-is now attained; henceforth he can consecrate himself to his fellow- men and live to show them the way of salvation, which he conceived as absorption in the Great Cosmic-All, made possi- ble by triumph over every evil tendency. Much less than his predecessors did he concern himself about metaphysical queries. His disciples, it is true, obscured the practical end he had in view and the practical means devised to attain it, by developing a system of metaphysical doctrines; the same happened to Christ. The Masters were content with dealing in experiential realities; the disciples fed upon theories and abstractions. For Gautama salvation is a practical psy- chological reality: it is deliverance from suffering; from the moral suffering due to the thirst leading from birth to birth; thirst for pleasures, for becoming, for power. It is nearly synonymous with Schopenhauer's " will to live," and also with the Christian conception of the desires of the " Natural Man," or rather we should say that these various ideas are the outcome of the same experience: of the consciousness that the deepest cause of our suffering is lodged in warring de- sires, and the perception that the selfish will must be de- stroyed before happiness can be enjoyed. The life of Gautama expresses powerfully this truth. Pfleiderer, in his " Philosophy of Religion," Vol. III, p.65, in commenting on the spirit of Buddhism, has the following remarkable passage: Nowhere is the elimination of metaphysics from religion (which. is so much demanded in our days) in favor of a purely ethical and psychological way of looking at things, carried out to such a degree as in Buddhism; but just on this account it proved a religion with- out God and without soul, a religion in which religious mystery is contracted to a mere vanishing shadow of a possible outer world, a religion, therefore, which completely lacks motive power both for progressive and deepening knowledge, and for world-conquering action. For only out of the depths of the divine mystery do the never-ceasing streams of living spiritual power issue forth; the streams which spring from the mere surface of experience do not flow to life eternal. We quote these words to make clearer by contrast the view we are trying to make good in this part of our essay, i. e., that the essence of Religion in its modern form, in con- tradistinction to Philosophy and Metaphysics, is properly the more or less clear consciousness of what Pfleiderer is pleased to call " the mere surface of experience," and that the power 316 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. of religion is proportional to the depth and intensity of the feelings connected with that experience. The lives of Jesus and of Buddha give a flat denial to the distinguished author of the "Philosophy of Religion." The "divine mystery" is not the craving for metaphysical knowledge, it is the universal and unquenchable thirst for wholeness, for moral harmony. We shall have occasion to observe in the chapter on self-surrender that the only apparent motive power in the deepest religious experiences is the feeling of unrighteousness and the effort towards holiness. It is only when " Salvation " was secured that St. Augustine sought for the how and the why, and elaborated out of what passed in himself the theories concerning total depravity and election. His religious beliefs were the product of ratiocination on his experience of conversion, and not the cause of it. The comparative inferiority of Buddhism to Chiistianity is not due to its metaphysical bareness, but to the greater weakness of the moral promptings of the Hindoo race. The advent of Christ marks a step further in the growth of the dual moral consciousness. Psychologically his influ- ence could be defined on one hand as bringing about a deeper and consequently a more painful differentiation of motives, a deeper cleavage of consciousness, into warring parts, and, on the other, as leading and helping men to a solution of the dualism. We know not through what crisis Christ may have passed previous to his appearing on the scene of the world. Indications of a possible moral turmoil of the same nature as that of Gautama and of other great re- ligious leaders, are nevertheless not entirely lacking in the life of Jesus. His baptism by John in the Jordan and the temptation of forty days in the wilderness, following hard upon the baptism of repentance, according to the gospel nar- ration, lend themselves easily to such an interpretation. Per- haps his affirmation to Nicodemus, who does not under- stand how a man can be born again of the Spirit, " Verily, verily, I say unto thee, we speak that we do know, and bear witness of that we have seen" (John iii:11), should be con- strued as a reference to his own "new birth." At any rate, when he begins his career, he possesses the serene unity for which the founder of Buddhism had had to struggle for years. Christ expresses his inner condition in august words like these: "I and the Father are one." This and like utterances are but the objective formulations of his moral unity, of his sinlessness. His central desire now is to bring men to the Father, that they also may be one with Him. Sin has estranged man from the Holy God, hence reconciliation and 317</page><page sequence="10">the establishment of relations of perfect love with the Father presuppose the voluntary abandonment of all wickedness. This sin is regarded as the source of man's misery, and the goal of religious life becomes regeneration, by which unifica- tion of motives,-i. e., union with God, when objectively con- sidered-is achieved. Christ refrained from formulating elaborate doctrines of salvation, he remained close to the empirical facts of regen- eration. From practical and empirical, his disciples have made religion speculative and theoretical. Although we have had as yet neither the good sense nor the courage to return to plain religious empiricism, the first steps in that direction have been taken. The later creeds of Chris- tendom show a well-marked tendency to revert to the simple formulation of the contents of the religious consciousness, and dwell with less and less weight on the metaphysical in- terpretations given to them by the early church. It is a fact of common observation that our pulpits have almost com- pletely forgotten those articles of the creed which formerly attracted chief attention, and that they are absorbed in preaching regeneration and sanctification. To be religious is no more to conjure and sacrifice, no more to adore, no more to believe in dogmas; it is to live righteously an altruistic life. A conversion unifying the newly born energies of the soul is coming to be the immediate and exclusive end of Christian preaching. And if salvation is still pictured under the form of an objective reconciliation, of a readjustment of relation between man and God, it is never- theless affirmed with increasing emphasis that subjective renovation is its essential condition. That the need and the means of regeneration are the motor powers of Christianity, is a truism. Christ made the new birth the centre of His teaching; Paul experienced and preached it. In the first days of Christianity sudden conversions seem to have been the rule, and subjective regeneration continued to be the con- dition of entrance into the church until formalism displaced, more or less completely, living faith. Then baptism became, for long dark centuries, not only the symbol,but also the sub- stitute for regeneration. Yet the word Regeneration was kept, and the church persistently and illogically affirmed that without it-or its symbol-there was no possible salvation. A side current, however, preserved the living doctrine. It is manifest in the ascetic spirit of the saints of the Middle Ages; the experience of many of them reads like the con- versions of the revivals of the eighteenth and nineteenth cen- turies. Most if not all of the religious reformers of the Re- naissance, as also the instigators of the great religious move- 318 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. ments of the last century-Assisi, Loyola, Luther, Fox, the Wesleys, Whitefield, Edwards, may be instanced-received their life-impulse from a conversion experience, which they embodied in the famous motto, "Salvation by faith." Re- ligious reformations in the Christian church have always been, at bottom, returns to the fact of deliverance from sin (what we have termed unification of motives) through faith, i. e., a return to the biological teachings of Christ and of Buddha concerning the new birth. We know the dominant role which this motive plays in our modern orthodox churches, particularly in the United States.' It is less known that outside the pale of orthodoxy, in those confessions of faith which had, in their poverty of religious The following facts concerning the influence of Revivals may be of interest to our readers: The Rev. Mr. Albert Barnes in his sermons on Revivals, New York, 1841, says: . . . . they [Revivals] have done more than any other single cause to form the public mind in this coun- try." " Society has received some of its most decided directions from these deep and far pervading revolutions." P. 20. We find in the memoirs of the Rev. A. Nettleton, the famous Re- vivalist, edited by B. Tyler: During a period of four or five years, commencing with 1798, not less than 150 churches in New England were favored with special effusion of the Holy Spirit; and thousands of souls, in the judgment of charity, were translated from the kingdom of Satan into the kingdom of God's dear Son." P. 13 of 5th ed. In 1829 a circular was sent to the pastors of Congregational churches in Connecticut, with questions on the usefulness of Re- vivals. " It appeared [from the returns] that a large proportion of all who are now members of the Congregational churches in this state became such in consequence of Revivals; .. . . that the most active and devoted Christians are among those who came into the church as fruits of Revivals, . . . . . . Very interesting information regarding the opinion of the fore- most " educational" men of the time on Revivals and conversions, can be gathered from the Appendix to Dr. Sprague's '" Lectures on Revivals of Religion," 2d ed., 1833. The book itself is meant to be a text-book for Revivalists, or professional convert-makers. The Appendix is composed of letters from ten or more college presi- dents, including Yale, Brown University, Princeton, Amherst, Wil- liams; and from prominent divines, as the Rev. Noah Porter, the Rev. Archibald Alexander, the Rt. Rev. Ch. M'Ilvaine, Bishop of Ohio. These gentlemen relate the Revivals they have witnessed and express their convictions concerning their nature, and the most effective methods of conducting them. They are all, in various degrees, in sympathy with Revivals. Better than any- thing else to estimate the rble played by conversion in giving direction to individual and national life in this country, are the chapters on religious life in the histories of colleges, such as Amherst, Yale, Williams, where conversion was looked upon as the normal culmination of Christian education. 319</page><page sequence="12">sense and abundance of intellectualism, more or less dropped the corn with the husk, and whose resulting deadness had become a popular argument against their negations, a re- vival of the religious spirit is in process. It manifests itself in a new interest in Regeneration and in a growing sense of its meaning and necessity. The book of Edmund H. Sears on "Conversion," and especially the two essays entitled "Re- generation," one by the Rev. Thomas R. Slicer, the other by Francis C. Lowell, read before the National Conference of the Unitarian churches, held at Saratoga Springs, N. Y., Sept., 1894, are characteristic tokens of the movement we signal. The doctrinal setting is greatly changed, it is evi- dent, but the fact itself is acknowledged as the distinguish- ing mark of the true Christian. " What we are concerned to know is this: Does the new birth of which I have spoken give an entrance here and now into the kingdom of heaven which can be won by no other road ? I think it does. Though it seems a paradox, I believe that no one can fully know him- self a child of God until he comes to realize how deeply he has sinned. . . . Such an experience, then, it seems to me, is to be desired by every man; that is to say, it is typi- cal of the best, the most nearly perfect religious experience," said Mr. Lowell in the address mentioned. The Rev. Thomas Slicer's essay is in the same spirit, and contains nothing that suggests disagreement with the above quoted opinion. We can profitably bring the preceding passage side by side with the following from the great Trinitarian, Jonathan Edwards: "I am bold to say that the work of God in the conver- sion of one soul, considered together with the source, founda- tion and purchase of it, and also the benefit, end and eternal issue of it, is a more glorious work of God than the creation of the whole material universe." 1 Unitarians and Calvinists agree on the question of ex- perience, on the essence of religious life; they disagree on the theory, on the metaphysics of conversion. When the division between metaphysics and science has been fully recognized in Religion, the church will take cognizance of facts only, and leave to independent specialists the post-experiential specu- lations. To sum up, religious consciousness has been gradually clearing itself from the philosophical motive with which it has been associated from the beginning. The religion of primitive man born of a sense of physical dependence, gradually yields, as the sense of sin is realized, to ethical re- 1 In his " Thoughts on the Revival of Religion." 320 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="13">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. ligions, in which man is actuated by a sense of moral de- pendence, or, to state the same fact in other words, by a feeling of sinfulness, of moral imperfection and weakness; he exclaims with Paul: " For what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I." This feeling is the religious motive as felt-at our stage of development. Religion has be- come - or is coming to be - the conglomerate of desires and emotions springing from the sense of sin and its release. Silently along with the struggle for existence of indi- vidual against individual, another one, purely subjective, often eclipsing the former by its grim relentlessness and tragic seriousness, turns the heart of man at all times into a duelling ground, and some times into a hellish tempest. Those who escape least the torments of this dualism, are, it seems, the best. The fastidious conscience, as also the callous, pro- verbially honest man, find rising from the very centre of their being unquenchable yearnings for the attainment of a moral unity which will bring with it the deep peace and joy of which glimpses are obtained in spite of the thousand little compromises in which we wallow. The philosopher pants for what he terms the realization of himself; the Hindoo falls in ecstasy before the vision of an abode of rest from the hard conflicts of this sensuous life; the Christian prays for deliv- erance from sin, pardon, purification and holiness. The reduction of the dualism thus variously expressed is, in the broadest sense, what we mean by conversion. Anticipating conclusions to be reached in the third part of the essay, we may say that moral dualisms and their reduc- tions are the psychic correlates of the establishment of new physiological functions. Conversion might be defined in the favorite terms of Herbert Spencer, as the unification, by coordination, of the parts segregated by differentiation of the homogeneous. Instead of being an abnormal process, con- version-not necessarily the violent type which we have chosen for our analysis-is the very creating method of nature. It represents a physiological as well as a psychic step in the evolution of man. Prejudices and ignorance have had free scope to discredit the value of the class of experiences herein dealt with. That a considerable number of reported conversions were only temporary stimulation to better living, and that some of them were mere pretence, is evident. Concerning the permanency of conversions, the following quota- tions may be of interest:-The Rev. Chas. Hyde, pastor of a church in Ashford, wrote May, 1844: " His influence [A. Nettleton's] was permanently good." Concerning the eighty-two converts who were the fruit of Nettleton's activity in the parish, he writes, " Of 321</page><page sequence="14">the character of these converts, I cannot speak particularly, ex- cept of those who are now here. Twenty-two have died, twenty- seven have removed from the place, three only have been excom- municated. The remainder are, with hardly an exception, now consistent members,-some of them pillars in the church."-" Me- moirs of Rev. A. Nettleton," p. 89, 5th ed. In 1832, eleven years after the Revival mentioned in the following quotation, the Rev. Dr. Porter declares: "Within about three months, I suppose there were about 250 members who supposed they had passed from death unto life. On the first Sabbath in June, 115 were added to the church, and at subsequent periods 120 besides. Of these a few have since been rejected, and others have declined from their first love. But I have not perceived that a greater proportion of hopeful conversions in this Revival than in others, previous and subsequent to it, have proved unsound. Many have died, and many have removed from our immediate connection, but those who remain, now constitute the chief strength of the church."- From Appendix to Dr. Sprague's "Lectures on Revivals of Re- ligion " 2d ed., 1833. In ' The Testimony and Advice of an Assembly of Pastors of Churches in New England at a Meeting in Boston July 7, 1743," signed by sixty-eight ministers and otherwise endorsed by forty- three others (ninety of them were from the Province of Massachu- setts Bay) we read: " Yet of those who were judged hopefully con- verted and made a public profession of religion, there have been fewer instances of scandal and apostasy than might be expected. So that, as far as we are able to form a judgment, the face of Religion is lately changed much for the better in many of our towns and congregations." Similar testimonies could be multiplied at pleasure. The present essay when complete will contain three parts. Of the two parts now published, the first is an analysis of the conversion process; it is divided into six subdivisions, corre- sponding to the natural phases of the experience: The Sense of Sin, Self-surrender, Faith, Joy, Appearance of Newness, The Role of the Will. In Part II we place, side by side, the Christian doctrines concerning Justification, Faith, the Grace of God, the Freedom of the Will, and the corresponding facts as they appear in Part I. PART I. ANALYSIS OF CONVERSION. 1. SENSE OF SIN. The sense of sin is the first manifes- tation of the religious experience ending in conversion. That the phrase " to be under conviction of sin " means more than mere knowledge of one's imperfections, we shall see presently. To have the full meaning of the quotations introduced in the following pages, the reader will have to refer to the complete account of the conversions given in the appendix. In them the age, education, state of health, etc., of the subject will be found, together with the circumstances of his conversion. We shall assume, for the sake of brevity2 that the reader has perused these records. For an investigation into the nature and the physiological basis of the sense of sin, see Part III. 322 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="15">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. The primitive and immediate sin-quale is variously modi- fied by the affective value of diverse ideas concerning the nature and consequences of sin. Our records class themselves in two groups: one composed of those in which the natural sin-pain is altered and intensified by the belief that a divine Judge has pronounced sentence, it becomes sense of guilt and of condemnation; to these, God is first of all a Judge. The other group is made up of persons who, having escaped theological teaching, stand in the truth of nature, and of those who have outgrown its artificial instruction; for these, guilt, condemnation, fear of judgment, the need of pardon, do not exist; their experience remains untinged by speculative beliefs: they feel their sinfulness, i. e., their physical and moral misery, their inability to do what they feel to be right and desire to do; they want deliverance,- of pardon they have no thought. To them God is a Helper, a Saviour, and not a Judge. To the first group salvation is a state that follows upon a legal transaction; to the second salvation is essentially a subjective affair: it is deliverance, now and for earthly life, from besetting sins. It does not appear that the conception of God as a Judge by whom man stands condemned to eternal perdition, is par- ticularly efficacious; it proves much less powerful than the idea of thelloving Fatherhood of God. Henry Ward Beecher deplores having been imbued in his youth with these Cal- vinistic ideas, and thinks they retarded his entrance into the Christian life. "I thought I was an awful trans- gressor; every little fault seemed to make a dreadful sin; and I would say to myself, 'There! I am probably one of the reprobate."' "For a sinner that had repented, it was thought there was pardon; but how to repent is the very thing I did not know. . . So I used to live in perpetual fear and dread, and often wished myself dead." . My feeling [at the age of fifteen] was such that if dragging myself on my belly through the street had promised any chance of resulting in good, I would have done it.^ . . "If I had had the influence of a discreet, sympathetic Christian person to brood over and help and encourage me, I should have been a Christian child from my mother's lap, I am persuaded. ' We begin with quoting some experiences belonging to the first of these two groups. Edwards describes as follows the manner in which persons are wrought upon: " Persons are first awakened with a sense of their miserable condition by 1 Beecher's Biography," by Wm. C. Beecher and Rev. S. Sco- ville. 323</page><page sequence="16">LEUBA: nature, the danger they are in of perishing eternally, and that it is of great importance to them that they escape speed- ily." . . . He speaks of his own sense of sin in very strong terms: "When others have expressed the sense they have had of their own wickedness, by saying that it seemed to them that they were as bad as the devil himself, I thought their expression seemed exceedingly faint and feeble to represent my wickedness, . . and yet. it is enough to amaze me that I have no more sense of my sin." A rather strange passage! The Calvinistic doctrines when preached without palliation were amply sufficient to produce tragic fears and induce grave bodily disorders. The terror produced by the thought of yawning hell, ready to engulf the sinner, would dispose to submission to whatever remedy might be offered, but would not love have had a still greater potency T When fear becomes extreme, as under the ministration of Revivalists of the past centuries, ithinders the saving transformation. Expressions as strong as the following are common in the religious literature of the last two hundred years: . . . "The Lord seemed to run upon him, like a giant, throwing him to the ground, and with such a terrible discovery of sin, caused him to roar in anguish and oft rise in the night on that account, which continued for diverse months."' Every one knows the role these morbid fears played in the hysterical manifestations which have so often disgraced Revivals.2 Concerning such " bodily exercises" Edwards wrote: ". . . . they have often suffered many needless distresses of thought, in which Satan probably has a great hand, to entangle them, . . . and sometimes the distemper of melancholy has been evi- dently mixed, of which, when it happens, the tempter seems to make great advantages." . . . But we cannot dwell on this interesting chapter; let us pass to more normal ex- periences of the sense of sin. Finney: " I became very restless. A little consideration convinced me that I was by no means in a state of mind to go to heaven, if I should die. On a Sabbath evening in the autumn of 1821, I made up my mind that I would settle the question of my soul's salva- tion at once, that, if it were possible, I would make my peace with God." Some days later, going in the morning to his office, he was assailed by such questions as: " What are you waiting for . Did you not promise to give your heart "'The Fulfilling of the Scriptures," Flemmihg, ed. 1671. 2See, for instance, pp. 131-169 on the Kentucky Revival of 1800, in "History of the Presbyterian Church," by Davidson, 1847. 324</page><page sequence="17">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. to God ? Are you endeavoring to work out a righteousness of your own I" P. had a very clear and vivid idea of sin. He was kept awake and tossed in bed, for fear of the Judgment. He knew he would be lost. The most potent influence was the thought of the Judgment itself, not the fear of punishment. M.: "As I saw myself drifting down, and friends who at one time would have gladly recognized and courted my company shunned me, I sometimes was almost at the point of asking God to forgive me and make me a better man .... I became a wreck, separated from wife and children. Poverty stared me in the face almost always." . At a later period he had one night a vision of God: " He said to me, ' Thus far shalt thou go and no further. You have despised Me and my Son. You have gone into the ways of sin and death. Now you are guilty and condemned.' And as I lay on my back on the bed, it seemed as if every sin I had com- mitted came up before me. God spoke again as at first and added: 'If you will turn to Me now, I will forgive you.'" (See also appendix, case of A.) F., on hearing a sermon on Luke x:42, feels that there was something else needed in his life, " the sermon had made me feel miserable. . . . My moral disposition was somewhat crushed by the sense of my sin. On Feb. 24th between 11 and 12 A. M., I could bear theweight of my sins no longer. I was affected most by my sins and my Saviour's great love." In the second group we shall see the sense of sin in a more natural aspect :-St. Augustine has not a thought for his happiness or misery in a future life. He lives in his sub- jective reality; condemnation and punishment he ignores. God compels him to see himself. . . . "setting me be- fore my face, that I might see how foul I was, how crooked and defiled, bespotted and ulcerous. And I beheld and stood aghast; and whither to flee from myself I found not. And if I sought to turn my eyes off from myself. . . Thou again didst set me over against myself and thrustedst me be- fore my eyes, that I might find out mine iniquity and hate it. ..... What said I not against myself . With what scourge of condemnation lashed I not my soul, that it might follow me striving to go after Thee! . . I was trou- bled in spirit, most vehemently indignant that I entered not into Thy will and covenant, O my God!"' John B. Gough, the famous temperance orator, is movedto renovation by his misery, by nothing else: " I had no hope of ever becoming a respectable man again-not the slightest --for it appeared to me that every chance of restoration to 1 " Confessions of St. Augustine." 325</page><page sequence="18">decent society and of reformation were gone forever. Utterly wretched and abandoned, I have stood by the rail- way track with a vague wish to lie across it, drink myself into oblivion, and let the cars go over me."' G.'s condition was as pitiable as that of Gough when he arrived in Worces- ter. The kindness of a lady made him look within. He thought that " if there was a God that could save a drunkard, I would let Him." " I had no other thought but that if there was a God disposed to save me, I would let Him. I said, 'Here I am.' 72 In the experience of O. will not be found a word referring to the need of pardon, or fear of punishment; he wanted deliverance from the shame and degradation of drunkenness, that was all. L. wrote: " I had no desire for anything good, only at times there would come a longing in my heart for something better. But it was soon over, and I would, if possible, go deeper into sin." Later, when he real- ized that if he continued in the same way he would die, he sought for salvation; " I did not realize that I was a sinner, only that I was a drunkard. And I think my prayer was, ' O Lord, take away this appetite, I cannot do it myself. ' K I. has but one thought-to become good: " God sent an arrow of con- viction to my soul, and for the first time I saw it as God sees it; 0, how vile and black my heart looked! I thought that Iwould give the whole world to become as good as those Salvation Army people." I.: " When I got utterly hopeless, help- less, in the darkest despair, when I felt the slavery of sin when I knew that I was utterly and forever lost, then God raised up a human instrument. My employer put me in the Christian home [for intemperate men]. . I wanted to escape from the evil effects of my sins, in my physical life, but I do not especially recollect any desire to seek deliverance from all my sinful nature." Referring to his conversion he says, " Yet I believe that the thought was more to escape from the bondage of the appetite for drink than from the whole sinful man.' E.: "In all this period [up to conversion], I never had a desire to reform on religious grounds, but all my pangs were due to some terri- ble remorse I used to feel after a heavy carousal; the re- morse taking the shape of regret after my folly in wasting my life in such a way - a man of superior talents and educa- tion." During the conversion-crisis he was shown that he had "never touched the eternal, i. e., God, and that, if I died then, I must inevitably be lost: 7" . . . "there was no terror in 1 John B. Gough, "&lt; Autobiography." 2 A little before he had said that during that night memorable to him, he knew that if he died, he would go to hell. 326 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="19">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. it; I felt God's love so powerfully upon me that only a mighty sorrow crept over me that I had lost all through my own folly, and what was I to do ? What could I do? I did not repent even. God never asked me to re- pent. All I felt was I am undone, and God cannot help it, although He loves me. No fault on the part of the Almighty.'" In the chapter on the Sense of Sin in Part III, we attempt an analysis of the feeling of sin; here we desire to remark only that the conglomerate of affective experiences known by that name - made up essentially of general physical discom- forts due to unhealthy living (the yearning of the flesh after righteousness), and of conflicting moral tendencies, whose painfulness has also its physical basis - is in many, perhaps in most, cases complicated with the affective value of various theological conceptions, such as responsibility to a divine Judge, possible condemnation to eternal misery, etc. Al- though these ideas originally derive their reality timbre from the elemental sense of sin, yet, strangely enough, when they are once accredited, they frequently supplant it by the power- ful emotional reaction they arouse, and the grosser emotions of apprehension and fear pass for the sense of sin. As, in many cases, these primitively anthropomorphic conceptions are ignored without apparent detriment to the progress of the Regeneration-process, the natural and immediate working of the sense of sin might safely be trusted. 2. SELF-SURRENDER. Self-surrender is the turning-point in conversion. We might expect to find the will striv- ing with increased ardor as its antagonists yield ground. Strangely enough, that which we commonly term "will" seems to weaken as deliverance approaches, and, against all expectation, the victory is won when the self-assertiveness of the individual has given place to complete resignation to "the will of God." This self-surrender motive is generally con- sidered an essential condition of the higher religious life:- When all that separated from God is taken away, when every inordinate desire has undergone the process of excision, so as to be reduced into its place, and to be put into entire position and agree- ment with one great and overruling desire of conformity to God's will, then begins the new life in the higher sense of the term. The soul no longer possesses anything which it calls its own, but may rather be spoken of as a subject, and instead of possessing, may be said to be possessed by another. Disrobed of the life of nature, it is clothed with the life of grace.-From " Correspondences of Faith and Views of Mme. Guyon," by Henry T. Cheever. Confidence and resignation, the sense of subjection to a higher will which rules the course of events, but which we do not fully comprehend, are the fundamental principles of every better re- 327</page><page sequence="20">ligion.-"Unterhaltungen" of Goethe with Chancellor Miller, p. 131. Resignation to the will of God is the whole of piety. Our resignation may be said to be perfect when we rest in His will as our end, as being itself most just and right and good.-" Fifteen Sermons," by Joseph Butler, Lord Bishop of Durham. Sermon on the Love of God. In the famous "Sure Guide to Heaven" of Joseph Alleine, we find among the directions for Salvation: "Resign up all thy powers and faculties and thy whole interest to be His." The cur- rent phrases: " to accept or receive Christ," " to yield one's self to God," or the like, are expressive of the same psychological reality. At this point of the conversion-process the sense of sin, of impotency, of dependence, is about to pass over into confi- dence, trust, love and joy. Let us attempt an analysis of this turning-point and its surroundings. In his "Confessions" we see St. Augustine violently lamenting over his double-direction will. For a number of years his sense of duality had grown in intensity. When the final crisis is upon him, he is clearly aware of the one remaining thing that prevents him from "entering into God's will and covenant." "The very toys of toys and vani- ties of vanities, my ancient mistresses, still held me; they plucked my fleshly garment and whispered softly, ' Dost thou cast us off; from that moment shall not this or that be law- ful for thee forever V " It seems that this desire was the last bond that prevented the realization of the peace he sought. From this moment the struggle becomes a tug-of-war between two currents, two classes of affections: the love of his mis- tresses and the love of God. "But now it spoke very faintly [the voice of his mis- tresses]. For on that side whither I had set my face and whither I trembled to go, there appeared unto me the chaste dignity of continency, serene, yet not relaxedly gay, honestly alluring me to come and doubt not, . . . and she smiled on me [and said]. cast thyself upon Him, fear not, He will not withdraw Himself that thou shouldst fall; cast thyself fearlessly upon Him, He will receive and will heal thee! And I blushed exceedingly, for that I yet heard the muttering of those toys, and hung in sus- pense." The struggle goes on; " a mighty storm, bringing a shower of tears," supervenes and indicates the progress of surrendering. But trust in God's forgiveness, and in His readiness to deliver him from his sin is not yet complete. He exclaims: "'And Thou, O Lord-how long . how long, Lord, wilt thou be angry, forever ? Remember not our former iniquities,' for I felt that I was held by them. I sent up these sorrowful words: ' How long . how long ? to-morrow and to- morrow ? Why not now . why is there not this hour an end 328 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="21">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. to my uncleanness "' Presently he thinks he hears a voice telling him to take up and read the word of God. This supposed manifestation of God's interest works hope and faith in him, for he remembers one Antony who was converted through an oracle. The first passage on which his eyes fall is, Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strifes and envyings; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh in concupiscence. ' " Instantly at the end of this sentence, by alight, as it were,of serenity infused into my heart, all the darkness of doubt van- ished away," and now what he feared to be parted from, his mistresses, had become a joy to part with. This voice and this passage, taken as indication of God's paternal care for him, contributed the impulse yet lacking to enable him to achieve the sacrifice of that which had been for years his de- light. Self-surrender was absolute; consciousness unified; joy and peace followed in the track of grief and bitter contrition. That day St. Augustine began his Christian career. We note that the transformation took place when the last inhibi- tion to the godward current gave way. Until then no peace, no unity, no conversion. It should be noticed that although the conversion-conflict may be compared to the daily moral struggles with which we are all familiar, it differs from them in some such way as a fight to the death differs from a fight for first blood. In the latter case the whole man is not involved, only a few eccen tric cells and nerve paths are in play. It is a skirmish of some stray soldiers. In the former event, the hostile individ- uals have been gathering from all over the land, leaving no stragglers behind. Every one has been called upon to join one or the other of the armies, and now the conflict is final: the issue involves the whole man, every cell and nerve fibre. One by one the divisions of the weaker army are destroyed, until there remains but the main body, and then the final crisis comes. In the case we have just considered, every conscious resistance but one had yielded; this one over- powered, the victory is complete, the land passes under a new ruler. Henceforth all strife ceases; harmony, a sense of unity and corresponding joy pervade the organism. Every- thing becomes new, the foreign as well as the internal policy has changed, and a new organic life begins. It is evident that although the consciousness of sin is spe- cifically the same in every individual, the particular points at issue may differ very much. But whatever it may be, the tendency, or the direction of the effort, is always the same: unification of consciousness through the subjection of a class of desires in opposition to another class of desires. 329</page><page sequence="22">LEUBA: In the case of Finney the opposing tendencies finally crys- tallize around one well defined feeling, pride. His unwilling- ness to be seen praying betrays unreadiness to abandon him- self absolutely to the promptings of God's spirit, and to es- pouse without reserve all the consequences and results in- volved in the new relation to God which he craves. This in- hibition, although trivial in its external aspect, brings to light the fundamental resistance: consideration for self, self- assertion. He knew in a general way what was required of him. " I had to submit myself to the righteousness of God through Christ." To conceal himself from possible passers-by he creeps into a space left open between two large trees fallen to the ground. " In attempting to pray I would hear a rustling in the leaves, as I thought, and would stop and look up to see if somebody were not coming. This I did several times. . . Finally I found myself verging fast to despair. . . I began to feel deeply that it was too late, that it must be that I was given up of God and was past hope. . . . I again thought I heard some one approach me, and I opened my eyes to see whether it were so. But right there the revelation of my pride of heart, as the great difficulty that stood in the way, was distinctly shown to me. An overwhelming sense of my wickedness in being ashamed to have a human being see me on my knees before God, took such powerful possession of me that I cried at the top of my voice, and exclaimed that I would not leave that place if all the men on earth and all the devils in hell surrounded me. . . . The sin ap- peared awful and infinite. It broke me down before the Lord." At that instant a passage of the Bible comes to his mind and brings a flood of light, and Finney finds him- self for the first time in the possession of a heart-faith which fills him with peace and the assurance of salvation. Self- annihilation, absolute self-surrender brought with it joy be- yond words, the sense of confidence in God-Faith-and of pardon. Pride is often the centre of the residual resist- ance. The sense of sin, as we have observed in the preceding chapter, is at times little more than a feeling of physical misery, the anguish of the sickened flesh. In such cases the expres- sions " regret " and " desire for relief " should properly take the place of "remorse " and of "repentance, " which designate experiences modified by specific intellectual considerations ignored by the persons we speak of. This primitive conscious- ness is especially noticeable in persons addicted to some gross vice. Drunkards, for instance, frequently show no sign of the sense of condemnation, although fully aware of their utter 330</page><page sequence="23">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. worthlessness. They feel shame at their degradation, but are not conscious of any responsibility towards God for breaking His laws. They do not exclaim, "Oh, my sins, my sins!" but rather: " Oh, cursed wretch that I am!" The ideas of punishment, of eternal death or of damnation make no impres- sion upon them; the realities of their daily life go beyond the pictorial power of imagination. What they want is deliver- ance-deliverance from the unbearable misery of this life. Let us examine, with reference to self-surrender, the regen- eration of some grossly vicious persons. S. H. Hadley, superintendent of the old Jerry MIcAuley Water Street Mission:--Thirteen years ago, in the Water Street Mission in New York city, after having listened to twenty-five or thirty persons relating in words burning with earnestness their deliverance from dypsomania, he made up his mind that he "would be saved or die right there!7 When the invitation was given for those desiring to reform, to come for- ward, he accepted the call and knelt down at the foot of the plat- form with a number of other drunkards " How I wondered if I would be saved! if God would help me! I was a total stranger; but I felt I had sympathy, and it helped me. Jerry [the famous Jerry McAuley] made the first prayer. I shall never forget it. He said: ' Dear Saviour,won't you look down in pity on these poor souls? They need your help, Lord; they can't get along without it. Blessed Jesus, these poor sinners have got themselves into a bad hole. Won't you help them out ? Speak to them, Lord, do, for Jesus' sake- amen!' "7 Then they were asked to pray for themselves. "How I trembled as he approached me! Though I had knelt down with the determination to give my heart to God, when it came to the very moment of grand decision, I felt like backing out. The devil knelt by my side and whispered in my ear crimes I had forgotten for months: ' What are you going to do about such and such matters if you start to be a Christian to-night ? Now you cannot afford to make a mistake; had not you better think this matter over and try to fix up some of the troubles you are in, and then start '. Oh what a conflict was going on in my poor soul! A blessed whisper said, ' Come!' The devil said, ' Be careful!' Jerry'S hand was on my head. He said, 'Brother, pray.' I said, ' Can't you pray for me?' Jerry said, ' All the prayers in the world won't save you unless you pray for yourself.' I baited but a moment, and then, with a breaking heart, I said: ' Dear Jesus, can you help me ?7 Dear reader, never with mortal tongue can I describe that moment. Although up to that moment my soul had been filled with indescribable gloom, I felt the glorious brightness of the noonday sun 331</page><page sequence="24">LEUBA: shine into my heart; I felt I was a free man. Oh, the precious feeling of safety, of freedom, of resting on Jesus! From that moment till now I have never wanted a drink of whiskey." This man has given his life to the rescue of drunkards. In this record the approach towards complete surrender can be followed step by step. He had laid aside pride enough to respond to the invitation and thereby con- fess publicly his inability to cease drinking. Old crimes, and that which the settlement of them will require of him, pass before his mind; for a moment he hesitates to accept the atti- tude towards them which submission to God would demand. His humble prayer for succor, and its effect, indicate that all the resistance of which he was conscious had given way, and that, as he called upon Christ, he threw himself unre- servedly at his feet. Case of O. (Appendix.) After every drinking-bout until the last, 0. felt confident that he would be able to restrain his appetite. The sorrow and deep shame that accompanied his last debauch were also experienced after the preceding ones, but the one characteristic element of this last post-debauch state was that all hopes of self-deliverance had left him. For the first time he felt convinced that his passion was stronger than his determination; the light that had illumined the hori- zon had gone out; the future was all darkness; no effort of his could avert the coming calamity. In that state of will- surrender he turned his doubting thoughts to God for help, ready, as he has said to me, to do whatever God would require of him. In this attitude he found the strength he lacked. Case of E. (Appendix.) An Oxford graduate, the son of a clergyman of the Church of England. "About mid-day I made on my knees the first prayer before God for twenty years. I did not ask to be forgiven; I felt that was no good, for I would be sure to fall again. Well, what did I do? I committed my- self to Him in the profoundest belief that my individuality was going to be destroyed, that He would take all from me, and 1 was willing. In such a surrender lies the secret of a holy life. From that hour drink has had no terrors for me; I never touch it, never want it. The same thing occurred with my pipe: after being a regular smoker from my twelfth year, the desire for it went at once and has never returned. So with every known sin, the deliverance in each case being permanent and complete. . . Since I gave up to God all ownership in my own life, He has guided me in a thousand ways, and has opened my path for me in a way almost incredible to those who do not enjoy the blessing of a truly surrendered life." Case of K. (Appendix.) A colored man. "I began attending 332</page><page sequence="25">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. their meetings [the Salvation Army meetings] in the Opera House. The oftener I went, the more miserable I became; but I could not stay away; there seemed to be some unseen power that forced me to go, and so I went until I could endure it no longer. The night I went to the altar it seemed to me it was a last chance for me. I went to the altar to give my heart to 'God, not a part, but every idol, my time, my talents, and all. I made a full surrender of everything, and God for Christ's sake set my captive soul free. . . My pen fails me to describe the joy that thrilled my soul . . . The preceding cases illustrate conversions in which resist- ance focuses on one special vice. The struggle is against one well determined appetite or desire. In the generality of cases this concentration is not apparent; the subject is in presence of his sinful tendencies; no particular sin is singled out. The following are examples of such diffused sin-con- sciousness: Eleanor Emerson in the course of her awakening came to the discovery that " all my external goodness sprung from the motives of self-exaltation; or, what is still more displeas- ing to God, that it was designed as a substitute for the right- eousness of Christ." She tried repeatedly to " reconcile my- self to the idea of being in His hand as the clay in the hand of the potter. But, alas, I found this idea more and more dreadful." The prayer meeting, where she knew she would be urged to make a decision and yield herself to the solicita- tion of God's voice, was a terror to her soul. Although she had determined to attend no more, being one day invited, she concluded to go for the last time. not, however, from a com- mendable motive, and " in all the obstinacy of despair to hold up my head, which had long been bowed down, like a bulrush.'" Various feelings agitated her during the meet- ing: " AIy soul seemed humbled in the dust in view of my condemnation; while I was constrained to cry in spirit, 'Even so, Lord Almighty, true and righteous are Thy judg- ments!' At this view of my wretched, hopeless situation, the following words passed sweetly through my mind, and with such delightful energy as thrilled through my whole soul, and filled me with rapture unspeakable: 'Jesus, to thy dear faithful hand, My naked soul I trust.' The person through whom this testimony was secured, writes: "He was a very bad man and, since conversion, he has lived hon- estly for nine years. He was the keeper of a saloon and gambling den, and, of course, gave up that means of support. He has since struggled with poverty, ill-health, and old age. I have been pro- foundly impressed with the mystery of an experience like his." 333</page><page sequence="26">LEUBA: " At this most cordial disposal of myself into the hand of a glorious Redeemer, the thick clouds seemed to disperse, and give place to such a transporting view of the glorious Saviour as no words can express." The crisis of John Wesley as he describes it in his journal, is in every essential respect analogous to the preced- ing one. Until the event called his conversion, he had not obtained that organic transformation which works unity in the moral consciousness. In his famous letter to Law he describes himself as groaning under the effort to fulfill the works of the law and to find in them peace and justification. Elsewhere he says, "In this refined way of trusting to my own works and my own righteousness, I dragged on heavily, finding no comfort or help therein." For a number of weeks preceding his conversion, he was thoroughly convinced that he was not a Christian, and that he needed a radical change to become one. He resolved to seek the living faith by ab- solutely renouncing all dependence, in whole or in part, upon his own works of righteousness, on which he had really grounded his hope of salvation, though he knew it not, he tells us; and by praying continually for a full reliance on the blood of Christ shed for him as his sole justification. He found that assurance about a quarter before nine Wednesday, May 24th, 1738, according to his own statement. White- field's experience, as far as it is recorded, conforms with that of Wesley. Case of P. (Appendix.) Had lost all hope of salvation; his uppermost thought in the meeting in which what follows took place, was that he would never be able to obtain pardon and sal- vation. At the close of the sermon the minister started the hymn, " Just as I am, without one plea.''1 He joined in the sing- ing. Suddenly the Spirit of God-to use his own expression -seemed to make every word of that first line work within him. He felt the depth of its meaning and its truth regard- ing him. With all his heart he sang : " Without one plea," and realized as he had never done that Jesus Christ's sacri- fice was for his benefit, rthat he also was intended to be saved; Christ was calling for him. These thoughts and their accompanying feelings flashed like lightning upon him while the singing proceeded. The last line expressed his very de- sire, "0 Lamb of God, I come, I come." Before the last word of the first stanza was pronounced, he realized that his 1 Just as I am,-without one plea, But that thy blood was shed for me, And that thou bidd'st me come to Thee, O Lamb of God, I come." 334</page><page sequence="27">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. sins were forgiven and that he was saved. When, while the second verse was being sung, the pastor, walking down the aisle, stopped near him, arrested by his illumined face-and offering his hand said, "'You are a Christian -" Yes, sir," he responded from the fullness of his heart; a minute before he had despaired of ever being saved. What was required from Rev. J. O. Peck was-as he thought--his consecration to God's service. "Sharp and short the struggle. Then and there, I dropped on my knees and dedicated myself to God's service from that hour. I prayed until I felt peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. When I arose the storm had ceased and the sun was shining. I was in a new world, etc.' We have chosen the preceding cases among many for the clearness with which they set forth the self-surrender move- ment. Many others might be added nearly as explicit, for instance: " I yielded myself to what I conceived to be Higher Guidance. I yielded with trembling, but with im- portunity. At the close of the period I found myself at one with all things." Or, " I found my heart glowing with the most ardent love towards the Saviour. Tears flowed without control. The language of my heart was, O my dear Saviour, come and take everlasting possession of my soul. . . The verbal expressions vary, but their purport is always the same: I feel, realize, my absolute incapacity to live right- eously by my own endeavors; it is all over, I am undone. From my efforts can come no righteousness, no peace, no salvation; now, I lay down my arms and am unreservedly ready to do whatever Thou shalt command. This attitude corresponds to a peculiar physiological condition. The self-surrender movement may not be always explicitly mentioned, but it is always implied in what is expressed; for instance, in such sentences as the following: "I did not dare to give myself wholly to Him "-(Dr. John Living- stone); or, " I cannot say that I felt strong, but rather weak like a child, and yet not in a sense that I must sin"-(J.); or many expressions of IM.and of . in the story of their remarka- ble transformation; or in Jonathan Edwards' striking expres- sion that God's absolute sovereignty and justice with re- spect to salvation and damnation has often appeared to him delightful! (See Edwards' Conversion.) The attitude of absolute dependence could not be more beautifully expressed. Man's reason revolts against the abuse of power of a Creator who dooms his creatures to endless perdition, before the foundation of the world. But Edwards' " abandon " to the will of God gives him such a sweet trust and peace that even this apparently fiendish decree brings delight to his heart. 335</page><page sequence="28">LEUBA: He is the lover who, careless of the fate awaiting him, gives himself up to fond embraces, and would find even death ac- ceptable were it to come from the hands of the beloved. The following observation from "' A Narrative of Surpris- ing Conversions in Northampton," by Edwards, deserves quotation here: "The drift of the Spirit of God in His legal strivings with persons, has seemed most evidently to be to make way for, and to bring to, a conviction of their absolute dependence on His Sovereign power and grace and the uni- versal need of a Mediator, by leading them more and more to a sense of their exceeding wickedness and guiltiness in His sight: . . . . that they can in no wise help themselves, and that God would be wholly just and righteous in rejecting them . . . and in casting them off forever. . . . . A considerable part of our material having come from in- dividuals of colmmon school education, and conversion being often related after a considerable interval from its occur- rence, it cannot be expected that every subject will be able to dissect his experience finely enough to set forth clearly the various phases of so complicated a process. The difficulty of introspection is extreme because of the emotional tempest that usually reigns at the time. A gentleman of fair culture answered as follows question five: "I think some of the questions unuder No. 5 are rather ridiculous, as if a person could remember the various thoughts and feelings in his mind and heart at the moment of conversion! " Despite this difficulty, surrender is explicitly mentioned in most of the records. The reader has likely noticed the striking diversity in the feelings apparently uppermost in the conversion-experience of various persons. Some give prominence to their desire for humility; others are absorbed in the feeling of their impotency and unutterable woe; still others are annihilated and lie pros- trate in complete self-surrender, while the attention of some is held by the warmth of confidence, - they speak of hope, of trust; and still others seem to ignore humility and their pow- erlessness, and are carried on by a love impulse to faith in God and Christ. The words sin, humility, impotency, utter wretchedness, despair, self-surrender, hope, trust, love, faith - in the order we have placed them - mark in a rough way stages in the evolution of the conversion-process. According to one's temperament and disposition, or depending upon more trivial circumstances, certain phases of it stand out in more intense color and occupy longer the field of consciousness. It is evident that humiliation cannot precede, but will follow upon the discovery of one's own wickedness; that impotency will be realized only after repeated defeats; that it may be 336</page><page sequence="29">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. accompanied by despair; that absolute self-surrender can be consented to only when the former stage has been realized, and that living faith, born of loving confidence, cannot pre- cede, but may follow upon the realization of the need of help. These words, then, describe the stages of a continuous pro- cess. That process may stop anywhere and never be com- pleted, as in the case of most men. Although it must be looked upon as continuous, there is in it a turning point which divides it into two parts: the " way down " and the " way up ;" or the " negative " and the " positive " phase. Between absolute surrender at the end of the way down and the first glimpse of hope, constituting the first step of the second part of the process, there is a change of direction. That changeis conversion, if one wishes to use the word in its strict etymological meaning; and the positive phase is prop- erly called regeneration; it might be termed atonement; while the negative stage might be named diremption. Al- though it may seem that there is no necessary link between the end of the way down and the beginning of the way up, the process never comes to an end at this point, while it frequently stops somewhere in the negative phase. There are, nevertheless, a number of cases where what appears to be complete self-surrender is not immediately followed by the advent of the upward-move. Confidence and trust, love, are made impossible by some inhibition, as in the case of Liv- ingstone,who could not believe that the Lord Jesus was will- ing to receive and save a wretch who had resisted His grace so long; or in that of Bunyan, who for years did not know whether he was included among the elect or not. Gardiner, after being delivered from his sin, had no joy because he did not know whether eternal damnation was not properly to be his lot. But it should not be thought that the efficient cause of the arrest of the process is necessarily an intellectual doubt. Much, rather, are the doubts the token of a remaining inward resistance, ignored perhaps by the subject. 3. FAITH. We have seen that when self-surrender is com- plete, a turning point is reached at which the affective state changes toto ccelo. Despair, guilt and the feeling of isolation are superseded by joy, the sense of forgiveness, confidence and faith. This small word " Faith 7 has probably received more attention in Christian countries than any other word belonging to religion, if we except the names "God" and "Jesus." "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life" (John iii:36)--" Justification by Faith "--" The just shall live by Faith "--" Believe [have Faith] and thou shalt be saved. '-From generation to generation these mighty phrases 337</page><page sequence="30">LEUBA: have filled the mouths of Christians; they have passed from heart to heart and quickened them to better living; about this word, endless discussions have arisen and momentous battles have been fought, councils have decreed, creeds have been built up. This word must have a potency of meaning adequate to the role it has played; to what psychological reality does it correspond t The most perplexing confusion reigns as to the use of the terms " belief," "faith," " knowledge." There is in re- ligious circles a deep-rooted conviction that there exists a something different from intellectual belief and knowledge; that obscure something is, by general agreement, called Faith; but what that mysterious word means is too vaguely perceived, it seems, to allow of a consistent use of clearly differentiated terms. One defines Faith as " the intuition of eternal veri- ties," another as "'the organ for the supernatural and divine ;" the definition in Hebrews xi:1 is known to all. Others enlarge it to make it simply a " conviction of truth founded on testimony," and use "belief" as synonymous with " faith ;" for instance, Hodge in his "Systematic Theology," and the English Bible. Assuming at the beginning of our investigation that there is a specific psychic state which is, or can be, accompanied by certainty as to the reality of intellectual conceptions, relig- ious or other (a certainty not secured by the ordinary pro- cesses of the mind when seeking to arrive at scientific truth), we shall designate this negatively defined unknown by ' Faith," to distinguish it from opinion, belief and knowl- edge. These three words - opinion, belief, knowledge - we regard as denoting various degrees of conviction resting on grounds of the same nature, i. e., on rational cognition. Thus we may escape confusion and ambiguity. Furthermore, for the sake of simplification, we shall designate by the word "belief " the class containing these three subdivisions. We are not concerned here with the psychology of faith and of belief in general, but only in as far as they are found in conversion. The great Jonathan Edwards furnishes an interesting con- tribution to this part of our study. "From my childhood up, my mind has been full of objections against the doctrine of God's Sovereignty, in choosing whom He would to eternal life, and rejecting whom He pleased; leaving them eternally to perish and be everlastingly tormented in hell. It used to appear like a horrible doctrine to me. But I remember the time very well when I seemed to be convinced and fully satis- fied as to this Sovereignty of God,and His justice in thus eter- nally disposing of men, according to His Sovereign pleasure. 338</page><page sequence="31">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS rHENOMENA. But never could give an account how, or by what means, I was thus convinced, not in the least imagining at the time, nor a long time after, that there was any extraordinary influ- ence of God's Spirit in it; but only that now I saw further, and my reason apprehended the justice and reasonableness of it."1 Reason convinced without any intellectual argument by the extraordinary influence of God: this is the work of Faith. We note in this experience the complete absence of the intel- lectual process by which scientific conviction is produced. The following2 (case of B. in appendix) describes the expe- rience of a clergyman now in the prime of life: . . . For three days the wild tide swept and surged past and around me. I felt I must give up the Gos- pel of John and, if so, my Christian faith also; and with this the universe would go. I yielded myself to what I conceived to be Higher Guidance. . .. At the close of the period I found myself at one with all things. Peace, that was all. When I looked at my- self, I found that I was standing on the old ground, but cher- ishing a toleration of doubt and a sincere sympathy with doubters such as I had never known before. I could take the logical standpoint, and could see that they were quite convincing [the arguments], and yet my inward peace of belief was in no way disturbed." . . In this case, arguments bring to the ground a system of beliefs. After an emotional crisis, in which criticism plays no part, the old in- tellectual construction is found standing firmly, in spite of blows and buffets more than reasonably able to throw it down. The ground of belief has undergone a specific change; arguments no more affect the new structure than blows affect a shadow. It is no longer belief, it has become an object of Faith. Few religious experiences are as perplexing to a class of earnest Christians as that of John Wesley. At the age of thirty-five, after having served zealously and successfully in the ministry of the English church for ten years, and attain- ing, by constancy of purpose in the pursuit of holiness, the moral worthiness which he himself avows in the searching of heart made soon after his return from Georgia to England, he repeatedly declares that he is not a Christian. Not that he experienced doubts as to the Christian beliefs (he had doubts, it is true, on the ship when returning to America, but only such doubts as are unavoidable in simple belief. From the conversion of President Edwards. 2 Communicated to us by Dr. Burnham. 339</page><page sequence="32">LEUBA: They soon vanished and left him at complete rest as to the truth of the doctrines), but that his religious state, his inner unsatisfied needs, a duality, compelled him to recognize that to be a Christian was to be more than what he was. " But does all this [his devoted and self-sacrificing labors] make one acceptable to God ? Does all I ever did or can know, say, give, do, suffer, justify me in His sight ? or . that I am as touching outward, moral righteousness, blame- less ? or (to come closer yet) the having a rational conviction of all the truths of Christianity ? Does all this give a claim to the holy, heavenly, divine character of a Christian ? By no means. .All these things, though when en- nobled by faith in Christ, they are holy and just and good, yet without it are ' dung and dross.' " He concludes that he has " fallen short of the glory of God," and sets to work to find the Faith which he lacks. A long period of increasing self-abasement follows, " which must ever precede true, liv- ing faith in the Son of God," says his biographer. The sense of self-righteousness slowly dies, and he is brought to the point where complete self-surrender becomes possible. Then, suddenly, at a meeting, while some one was reading the famous Luther's preface to the Epistle to the Romans, " about a quarter before nine, while he was describing the change which God works in the heart,through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed, I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for Salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and had saved me from the law of sin and death.'Il Notice the use of the wordfeel:-a psycho-physiological transformation no more dependent upon intellectual information and belief than a sudden turn in the general condition of a patient depends upon the medical theories he holds. An interesting remark can be made here concerning the influence of suggestion: it is as the change which God works in the heart is being de- scribed that the very same transformation takes place in Wesley. Doubts vanished from the mind of St. Augustine at the moment he gave up the last impediment to a holy life :2 his unrighteous loves. Indeed, intellectual doubts played no part in the conversion to Christianity of this subtle dialecti- cian. This inconsistent professor of intellectual conviction forgets his art when most needed, it seems, and receives 1From Wesley's journal as quoted in Moore's "Biography of Wesley." 2 It would be in closer agreement with the facts to use the pas- sive form and say: when the last impediment to a holy life gave way. 340</page><page sequence="33">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. bodily the Christian doctrines on the strength of a change of heart! The victory over his passion becomes the ground of faith in doctrine. Who would wonder at his abandoning his profession after such a shaming experience of its uselessness! After the long struggles so acutely described in his " Confes- sions,"- a contest exclusively moral, as the reader may con- vince himself by refering to the account of his conversion, pp. 328 and 329, he finally reaches the point of complete self- surrender. Even those "very toys of toys and vanities of vanities, " which were the obstacle to the unification of his life- motive, he is now able to renounce; thereupon, " by a light, as it were, of serenity, infused into my heart, all the darkness of doubt vanished away." The son of Monica has exchanged his vacillating belief for Faith; henceforth he is to devote himself to the triumph of the Gospel of Christ and the estab- lishment of right religious beliefs. The neuropathic Mrs. Eleanor Emerson thus glowingly describes her ecstatic feelings at the time of her conversion: " At this most cordial disposal of myself into the hand of a glorious Redeemer, the thick clouds seemed to disperse, and give place to such a transporting view of the glorious Saviour as no words can express. With an eye of faith I beheld the transcendent glory more conspicuous than that of the natural sun in meridian splendor, when bursting from behind the thickest clouds. I could no more doubt of the being and divinity of Christ than of my own existence. He was presented to my spiritual view in such substantial glory as caused me to adopt the exclamation of the astonished Thomas,: 'My Lord and my God!' . . . The great- ness of God's character and the glorious scheme of redemp- tion filled me with wonder, admiration and joy." The belief in the divinity of Christ and the doctrines involved in the scheme of redemption, is made to pass, by that ecstatic irradiation supervening upon the removal of the last inhibi- tion, into the domain of Faith. Finney was convinced that " the Bible was the true word of God 7 and of the truth of the Christian doctrines respect- ing salvation before he thought himself a Christian; and yet he tells us that " in this state [the state he describes as the baptism of the Holy Ghost], I was taught the doctrine of justification by faith as a present experience. . . In- deed, I did not know at all what it meant by the passage, ' Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.' " Neither did Luther understand justification by faith; tortured by his conscience and by an unsatisfied thirst for union with God, he writhed in agony until peace came and with it the understanding of salvation 3 341</page><page sequence="34">by Faith. This living experience became the power of the Reformation and his chief stay against Rome's " salvation by works." It was also the centre of Finney's preaching as of all the great Revivals this country has known. Frequently, especially in persons of little intellectual devel- opment, conversion and Faith are not preceded by intellectual conviction of the truth of the Bible, of the divinity of Christ, of the atonement, etc.; there may be either absolute uncer- tainty about these doctrines, or even complete ignorance of their existence. Jonathan Edwards, whom this fact had not escaped, was a good deal perplexed and puzzled by this lack of deference on the part of the facts to theology. "It must needs be confessed that Christ is not always distinctly and explicitly thought of in the first sensible act of grace (though most commonly He is); but sometimes He is the object of the mind only implicitly. Thus sometimes when persons have seemed evidently to be stripped of all their own righteousness and to have stood self-condemned as guilty of death, they have been comforted with a joyful and satisfactory view that the mercy and grace of God are sufficient for them; that their sins, though never so great, shall be no hindrance to their being accepted; that there is mercy enough in God for the whole world, and the like, when they give no particular or dis- tinct thought of Christ." (From a " Narrative of Surprising Conversions in Northampton.") But Edwards adds: when questioned " it appears that the revelation of the mercy of God in the Gospel, is the ground of their encouragement and hope," i. e., they had not forgotten their catechism. From our observations we conclude that, in the city missions of to-day, belief in the divinity of Christ and in the atonement- not to speak of other doctrines-wield a very scanty influence, and is generally absent until after conversion, at which time the new Christian is generally instructed in the popular theology. I pressed G. with questions touching the religious beliefs that occupied his attention in any degree whatsoever during the night of his conversion and the preceding days, but could obtain nothing more than what is recorded. Although at the time of our interview he was well informed as to "Salvation by the blood of Christ," "Salvation by faith," and the atonement doctrine, the name of Christ 1 " As regards the means used in this Revival (in Rochester), I would say that the doctrines preached were those that I always preached everywhere. The moral government of God was made prominent; and the necessity of an unqualified and universal ac- ceptance of God's will as a rule of life; the acceptance by faith of the Lord Jesus Christ as the Saviour of the world, and in all His official relations and work; and the sanctification of the soul through or by truth."-From " Finney's Memoir." 342 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="35">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. appeared neither in the history of his life freely given, nor in answer to my questions. At the time the only things real to him were his misery, his complete helplessness,and a dubious hope that some mighty power called God might be willing and able to save him. The story of S. H. Hadley presents a similar mental state, as also the case of 0., who did not so much as mention Christ when relating his experience, and who stated that doctrines played no part in it, with the ex- ception of the concept of God as a power, able and willing, perhaps, to succor him. Similar remarks can be made with reference to the great majority of that class of converts. The following quotation from Col. H. H. Hadley, well known in home-mission circles, the instrument of the reform of hundreds of drunkards, may interest the reader, if only by its pictur- esqueness: "Men have been converted in the delirium tremens. It knocks all the theology higher than a kite! I don't under- stand it, but it is so. Take my own case,-a big, bloated drunkard, had fifty-three drinks the day before I was con- verted, most of them brandy cocktails, and before me I saw my Lord crucified; I was converted."1 I heard myself in a New York City Mission men tell that they had been con- verted while intoxicated, even to a considerable degree. I found satisfactory evidence that their story was correct, and that their conversion, judged by the newness of their life, was genuine. Subsequently similar facts came repeatedly to my knowledge. As a last illustration of the role of intellectual beliefs in con- version, we report the harrowing experience of the famous tem- perance orator, John B. Gough, who, for twenty-six years, gave continuous proof of his moral regeneration (see appendix). Not the slightest comfort or help did he derive from the idea of God's goodness and readiness to help him. It is prac- tically the conversion of an atheist: neither God nor Jesus Christ is mentioned. The sense of his degradation and worth- lessness does not involve in his mind responsibility for sin to others; he is absorbed in his own self. He battles against himself, poor slave and outlaw, to conquer, if possible, the place he has lost in society. When the stranger spoke to him on a public street in Worcester, kindness, sympathy, the proof that all bonds between him and mankind were not cut off, and that men still had confidence in his manhood, lighted up the redeeming flame of Faith. " It was the first touch of kindness which I had known for months; and simple and trifling as the circumstances may appear to many, it went From a talk in Boston, reported by the Boston Herald, Feb. 6, 1896. 343</page><page sequence="36">LEUBA: right to my heart, and like the wing of the angel, troubled the waters in that stagnant pool of affection." On the urgent request of the stranger, he resolves to sign again the absti- nence pledge. " I said to myself: If it should be the last act of my life, I will perform my promise, and sign it, even though I die in the attempt, for that man has placed confi- dence in me, and on that account I love him." This time the Saviour was not Jesus Christ, but an humble restaurant- waiter. Names, persons and representations; a sympathetic fellow-man, Jesus Christ, or God, are practically one, in so far as they are able to determine the birth of the same life of love, of which the name, viewed from a slightly different po- sition, reads "Faith." What imports is that the regener- ating psychic process takes place; through what instrument, it matters little. As I remarked to a gentleman who was collecting data for me that the cases of conversion he had sent me showed a startling lack of discrimination between Christ and God, he answered, " To them God and Christ are one." Yes, indeed, and both owe their reality to our love and our need of love. They might be compared in this respect, with- out irreverence, to Dante's Beatrice, whose reality sprung from the poet's heart. The case of G. falls in with that of Gough. The loving sympathy of a woman became in him the leaven of the new life. We add some quotations picturing the affective condition of the "faithful."' They come from individuals who had wandered far away from conventional righteousness. R. ex- perienced a great peace of soul, a great quietude. Care for the future and remorse for the past disappeared. Love and thankfulness took their place. S. felt that "God guided him in all things; that He cared for everything which concerned him and relied confidently on Him, although during that period he was very poor, miserable, without proper cloth- ing, and suffering from hunger." H.: " Since that moment joy has not failed him. He felt God in his heart, had the assurance that he was renewed by the Spirit of God. He was happy, even though at the time he had no shelter in which to spend the night. He had confidence that God would never forsake him." T.: "At the time of his conversion he felt that God was a Father, that He would care for him as for one of His children." The indi- vidual, until then isolated, separated from the world, finds himself at one with God. Adam, banished on account of sin, is readmitted to the presence of the Lord in the garden of Eden; a bond of love and confidence unites him to all crea- tion. A. Fassler's autobiography, "Un Relevement," is an 344</page><page sequence="37">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. interesting illustration of the passage from the isolation of " selfness " and the accompanying practical and theoretical immorality to the sympathetic attitude and the new life it in- volves. How beautifully the life of St. Francis of Assisi ex- presses this oneness with nature, which none but the soul undivided by sin can enjoy. Meek Francis found in life the peace and unity which Christian and Buddhist ascetics sought in death. The deluded disciple of Buddha grows stolid and inane in the pursuit of Nirvana, while St. Francis' heart thrills at the sight of the very earth-worms ; the trees of the forest, the star in distant heavens, the bird on the bough, every creature, dumb or speaking, moving or inanimate, is his brother or sister: "Praised be my Lord for Sister Moon and for the stars, which thou hast created in the heavens, clear and beautiful. Praised be my Lord for Brother Wind, for the air and the clouds, for the pure sky and for all time, which give life and sustenance to Thy creatures. Happy they who shall be found conformed to Thy holy will, for the second death can do them no hurt." What most dis- tinguishes Jesus Christ from other men is a more perfect sense of moral unity. He revealed the Fatherhood of God because he felt himself indeed the Beloved Son from whom the Father has no secret. When the sense of estrangement, fencing man about in a narrowly limited ego, breaks down, the individual finds him- self " at one with all creation." This extension of the ego is worth more careful attention than we can give it here. When the egoistic will yields, personality does not become more sharply defined, but less so; more diffuse, it tends to lose itself in the general life, or general will. It is that which is strictly personal which gives to self its roughest sensations; the saint is hardly conscious that he is a distinct being, iso- lated from the world; he lives in the universal life; he and man, he and nature, he and God, are one. We find here again the raison d'Otre of this universal craving to yield one's self, to give up, to re-enter Nature's womb and live of its life. That state of confidence, trust, union with all things, following upon the achievement of moral unity, which we have found, more or less tersely expressed, in every conver- sion considered is the Faith-state. The preceding pages have made apparent, we hope, the ac- cessoriness of doctrinal beliefs in regeneration. The first part of the conversion-process ending in absolute self-surrender, needs have no dogmatic forerunners or accompaniments; the sense of sin and its natural feeling-consequences are all that must exist. From it flows out every experience of the " way down :" wretchedness, feeling of isolation, conviction of ina- 345</page><page sequence="38">bility to realize the unity of purpose longed for and finally even despair. With the disappearance of every known sinful desire, a psychic revolution, harmonizing the motor tendencies, takes place and brings peace and joy. Neither is there any place for the necessity of doctrinal beliefs in this "positive phase." The only point at which doctrinal be- liefs might condition the process is, then, the turning point; before and after the conversion-process all is determined by physiological laws, just as the round of feelings through which we pass during a bodily disturbance. We shall come back later on to this turning point. We have seen also that various dogmatic beliefs supposed by Christian theology to be necessary to Salvation, suddenly, on the advent of the faith-state, acquire a character of certainty specifically distinct from the one they enjoyed previously. These dogmas, we have noticed, were in some cases believed in before conversion; in others, they were disbelieved or ignored. Whichever of them happened to be held on satis- factory rational grounds, or suggested to the mind by the experience undergone at conversion, as, for instance, in Mrs. Emerson's case, or yet any religious belief accepted on the authority of tradition as essential to conversion, assumed dur- ing the regenerating crisis a new reality, and became an object of Faith. In this new state, discussion is no more possible, because, inasmuch as the ground of assurance is not rational, argumentation is irrelevant. The seminary student expresses this with pleasing ingenuousness: "Strange to say, the arguments seemed not to enter into my thinking. There were no appropriate faculty and capacity for them in me. They stood apart from me. I could take the logical standpoint and could see that they were quite convinc- ing, and yet my inward peace of belief was in no way disturbed." "Conviction " is, we see, a derived product, a mere casual off-shoot of the faith-state, having in itself no necessary worth. It is consequently a gross error to imagine that the chief practical value of the faith-state is its power to stamp with the seal of reality certain theological concep- tions. On the contrary, its value lies solely in the fact that it is the psychic correlate of a biological growth reducing contending desires to one direction; a growth which ex- presses itself in new affective states and new reactions; in larger, nobler, more Christ-like activities. The str6ngest pillar of Christian " orthodoxy " rests not on rational argu- ments, but on such experiences as those we have quoted. The men who have contributed most during the last cen- turies to keep together the Christian system have derived their assurance and the ardor with which they forced it upon 346 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="39">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. the world from a conversion-experience. When biblical criti- cism, when historical and natural science, when psychology threatens the antique structure, it is in the regenerating power wielded by Christianity that the shaken believer finds shelter and rest. The ground of this specific assurance in religious dogmas is, then, an afective experience. Finney, for instance, feels a peculiar emotional disturbance, that he likens to a wave of electricity going through and through him; im- mediately this sensation, seeking for an adequate cause, con- nects itself with the idea of the Holy Spirit and the related doctrines. His phraseology is worth quoting: " I instantly seized hold of this with my heart. I had in- tellectually believed the Bible before, but never had the truth been in my mind that faith was a voluntary trust instead of an intellectual state. I was as conscious as I was of my exist- ence of trusting at that moment in God's veracity." Speak- ing of Bible promises he says: " They did not seem to fall so much into my intellect as into my heart." St. Paul's con- version did not rest on speculations, but on affective experi- ences. Luther suddenly finds himself at peace, relieved from the load of sin,which no amount of good works had been able to purge away, and then the scheme of salvation by faith, to- gether with the related doctrines, becomes for him an unshak- able reality. Z. did not believe in the divinity of Christ; but when the wonderful transformation came to pass, the di- vinity of Jesus appeared to him as sure and evident as conver- sion itself. L., after having under pressure of the voice of conscience confessed to a man the wrong he had done him, de- clares, " I found a deeper peace and a greater gladness than I ever had before. It confirmed my faith in the reality of God's Word, Christ's Work, and my own conversion." Every conversion could furnish illustrations similar to these. In these cases certain conceptions are associated with an actual affective experience in the relation of cause to effect. The objects of Faith may even be preposterous; the affective stream will float them along and invest them with its unshakable certitude. The more startling the affective experience, the less explicable it seems, the easier it is to make it the carrier of unsubstantiated notions. The unwar- ranted support given to theological conceptions by the affective life is due to nothing else than to the universal and unavoidable proneness to connecting things as cause and effect for the only reason that they are together, or follow upon each other, in the mind. I fell once into a controversy with a very earnest and good man concerning the atonement as un- derstood by a narrow church. As he was cornered by argu- ments pointing to the irrationality and immorality of the 347</page><page sequence="40">doctrine, he suddenly ceased arguing and exclaimed: " It may appear so, but I cannot doubt it; I have experienced it." He had experienced not only a change of heart, but also the transcendent doctrine of the atonement! Many of the most deeply rooted superstitions arise from similar accidental associations between sensations or emotions and ideas. It is not in the province of this essay to consider in its gen- eral aspects the great question of the relation of feeling and sensation to intellect. But since our subject leads us to it, we shall subjoin some facts taken from a different sphere, showing in a striking manner how the feeling of reality be- longing to a sensation or to an emotion is transferred to an intellectual concept. In certain forms of insanity characterized by perturbations in the somatic or specific sensations, explanations of a most irrational sort are entertained and partake in the reality-timbre of the unfamiliar feelings they are meant to account for. A general pareticl suffering from heart trouble imagined that some invisible being was pumping wind into him. The loud- ness of the heart beats and murmurs had given rise to the delusion. More striking is the case of a young girl suffering from mysophobia.' She was troubled by an imaginary in- ability to keep her hands clean; she would be washing them every minute. When questioned about her general condi- tion,she would complain of the uneasiness that her dirty hands gave her. One day some gentlemen attempted to prove to her that she was mistaken. "When did you wash your hands last?" -About two minutes ago.-What have you been doing since then ?-Reading the newspaper. (She was hold- ing it in her hands.)-Is your newspaper dirty?-After exam- ination, the answer was, "No.--You have done nothing else since you washed t -No.-Then your hands cannot be dirty! Her hands were examined by the persons present' and de- clared perfectly clean. She gazed at them evidently per- plexed, endeavoring in vain to find dirt-spots, and after a short silence, exclaimed impulsively: " But Ifeel they are dirty." She also, as the seminary student, could take the logical standpoint, and see that the arguments were quite con- vincing. Against such a ground of belief as hers, intellectual considerations cannot avail. Who does not know by personal experience to what nonsensical ideas a mastering fear will give reality! When the danger is past, we laugh at our ab- surdity; but if the affective state continues, the belief, how- ever irrational and groundless it may be, remains as an object of faith, i. e., it participates in the sense of reality possessed ,Seen at the Worcester State Lunatic Asylum. 348 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="41">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. by the affective experience itself. The cold philosopher who ignores the mighty religious affective states, sneers at the super- stitious Christian. He cannot understand how men of broad culture and good common sense can give assent to doctrines to him so preposterous. The mystery vanishes when the slavery of the intellect to the affections and sensations is fully realized. Our theological systems and articles of faith are the body of justifications given to the various affective experiences of religious life, arranged and systematized, more or less con- formably to the science and philosophy of the time, according to the degree of scientific spirit and knowledge of those who assumed the labor of codification. If the religious experi- ences of our day are essentially the same as those of the be- ginning of our era, the conceptual world has changed won- drously. Nevertheless we still keep the precious stone in the old unbecoming setting, for fear, they say, that the stone will crumble to pieces if transferred to a newer mounting, and we continue to assert that the old one is genuine gold,be- cause the genuineness of the stone has been, and is being, re- peatedly tested. Meanwhile, very many, and these among the best, are made to care little for the jewel on account of its repulsive setting. 4. JUSTIFICATION. The sudden revulsion of the affective state experienced in conversion is usually interpreted as due to the disappearance of the load of sin; it is taken by the sub- ject as the warrant of his justification and of his salvation. If the pre-conversion struggle is caused by the strife between desires, some of which are identified with the individual will to live, and some looked upon as not belonging to the ego (the promptings of the Holy Spirit), it is but natural that when the last resistance of the selfish will gives way, when the will to sin (not the impulse) has surrendered, the sense of condemnation should forthwith disappear and make room for a consciousness of pardon, a sense of release. Narrower daily experiences make this phenomenon one of the best known to every one: it is tension followed by re- laxation; indecision culminating in resolution. In the Christian consciousness this phenomenon becomes especially interesting, first on account of its scope-it involves the whole reaction apparatus, the direction of the whole moral life, and affects every future action having a conscious moral bearing; and secondly, on account of the complication, the particular hues it receives from religious beliefs. If the sub- jective duality is conceived of as due to sin against an exter- nal Being, the cessation of the conflict is looked upon as the 349</page><page sequence="42">LEUBA: result of God's pardon. In a great many cases of conversion we find this subjective experience expressed as God's for- giveness, as the application to the soul of Christ's atoning sacrifice, and then it becomes the ground of faith in the re- lated doctrines. But in other, no less numerous, cases the experience, in spite of Christian education, does not assume- the aspect of a relation between man and God. Many con- verts, as we have seen in the chapter on the sense of sin, do not use " pardon," " justification, or similar words; they only make mention of the sense of relief and of the joy which they experienced. Let us see what information our material gives on this point. Sometimes the obtained unification of consciousness is not immediately recognized as the goal striven for. 1i., for in- stance, wrote: " It seemed as if Jesus himself had come into my body, and taken full possession of me. I did not know, though, that I was saved, as we call it now; but I knew God had had mercy upon me." The famous revivalist, Nettleton, relates that "not long after this an unusual calmness pervaded my soul, which I thought little of at first, except that I was freed from my awful convictions, and this sometimes grieved me, fearing that I had lost all conviction [of sinfulness]." But on hearing other Christians relate their experiences, he realized his conversion. Finney: " . . . I found that my mind had become most wonderfully quiet and peaceful. I said to myself, 'What is this t I must have grieved the Holy Ghost entirely away. I have lost all my conviction. . . . Why! ' thought I, 'I was never so far from being concerned about my own salvation in my life. . ." In his perplexity he goes as far as to question whether or not he has committed the unpardonable sin, and he endeavors to bring back the load of sin. " But take any view of it I would, I could not be anxious at all about my soul and about my spiritual state. The repose of my mind was unspeakably great. I never can describe it in words." The affective state prevented the re- viving of the sense of sin. Likewise Hallock, although he had passed through the whole process of regeneration, re- mained for a while in ignorance of the fact that he had been ' born again." He relates in his "Memoirs" more than one case similar to his own. Edwards wrote of the converts of the Northampton Revival: " There is wrought in them a holy repose of soul in God through Christ, and a sweet dis- position to fear and love Him, . and yet they have no imagination that they are now converted; it does not so much as come into their minds."' That the actual experience of "salvation" should not be immediately identified with the 350</page><page sequence="43">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. preconceived representation of it, is not surprising. The after-conversion state cannot be known in the pre-regeneration stage; the fancies nourished by the imagination concerning the condition of the " saved one," may help to mystify the subject when the experience is actually upon him. But the greater number of converts realize immediately that the gates of the kingdom of heaven at which they have been knocking, have opened, and that now God pardons and receives them. Livingstone testifies that he had joy and peace in believing: " I was conscious that I had received the divine Redeemer in all Hisoffices,as offered to sinners in His Word; that I had devoted myself, for time and eternity, to Him, and was no longer my own; and that I had actually become united to Him. I have never doubted of this trans- action, through all the trials of faith, to this day." We might have quoted these lines as illustration of the carrying power of the faith-state. John Wesley takes the warming of his heart, and his new affective state generally, as a proof of God's pardon, ". . . and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death." K., an ex-saloon and gambling den keeper, expresses himself as follows: " I made a full surrender of everything, and God for Christ's sake set my captive soul free. The chains of hell were snapped and I was a free man in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah! . .. My pen fails to describe the joy that thrilled my soul as I re- ceived the witness of my sins forgiven. . . 5. JoY. If the affliction of the person under "conviction" is often painted in the blackest hue, the joy that accompanies the advent of the faith-state frequently appears to be beyond description. Mrs. Emerson says, ". . . my heart seemed to overflow with sweet, adoring ecstasy." It is never alto- gether wanting and is almost always violent during the first hours or days that follow; afterwards it subsides gradually, and becomes a steady peace and satisfaction. . . . "Noth- ing but perfect love filled my heart to overflowing.'--K. II I wept aloud with joy and love. ... I was so filled with love that I could not sleep.' -Finney. "At the close of this awful scene which struck horror through the whole fam- ily, she suddenly burst out in raptures of joy and praise."-- From Nettleton. "For two or three weeks it seemed to me that I would never know again that sin was in the world. I was filled with joy; everything was bright and good."-P. "And in an instant there rose up in me such a sense of God's taking care of those who put their trust in him that for an hour all the world was crystalline, the heavens were lucid, and I 351</page><page sequence="44">352 LEUBA: sprang to my feet and began to cry and laugh. . . -Henry Ward Beecher. "But oh! with what joy, joy un- speakable, even joy that was full of and big with glory, was my soul filled, when the weight of sin went of, . . . an abiding sense of the pardoning love of God and a full assurance of faith broke in upon my disconsolate soul!"-- Whitefield. "Thereupon I felt as if born again, and it seemed to me as though heavens' gates stood full open before me, and that I was joyfully entering therein.' '-Life of Luther, by Michelet. "In my anguish I cried with an helpless despairing heart to Christ, and as quick as a flash of lightning, a joy so great rushed upon me into my heart that I knew the witness to pardon had come. My tears of sorrow changed to joy, and I lay there praising God in such ecstasy of joy as only the soul who experiences it can realize."--U. " Indeed I cannot tell you whether I was ' in the body or out of the body,' but, O! the light came; it was too much for me. I cannot express how I felt. It was as if I had been in a dark dungeon and lifted into the light of the sun. I shouted and I sang praise unto Him who loved me and washed me from my sins. I was forced to retire into a secret place, for the tears did flow, and I did not wish my shopmates to see me, and yet I could not keep it a secret."--A. " I felt very unhappy for a day or two, then light was given me. I saw what Jesus had done and could do, and all at once I became so unreasonably happy, though I could not then tell why."-V. Note how the physiological state of E. gave him happiness, in spite of the belief that he was lost. He was supremely happy, and yet he knew that he was undone and that God could not help him, although He loved him. " All the time I was supremely happy; I felt like a little child before his father: I had done wrong, but my Father did not scold me, but loved me most wondrously. Still my doom was sealed. I was lost to a certainty. . . ." We have here thought in contradiction with a feeling-reality. Theology did not square with ex- perience, yet its traditional power was enough to keep it standing. A similar contradiction is found in Finney's conversion. This ecstatic condition gives to the convert the illusion that he perceives unutterable, divine truths; that the mysteries of life have become lucid. Contradictions are swallowed in the emotional flood, and the most preposterous theories may as- sume the value of absolute truth. Sleep and hypnotism give us abundant illustrations of the glory and perfection which we can see in ideas that are ludicrously silly when waking life puts them in connection with related association systems. The astounding credulity of the illuminated, of the</page><page sequence="45">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. mystic, of the convert, finds a satisfactory explanation in the simplification of intellectual life, in the reduction of associa- tions to certain lines, as it happens when emotion concen- trates attention, or in peculiar physiological states, in normal and hypnotic sleep, for instance. In these particular circum- stances the ideas present in the mind are put into relation, but with few others; analysis, discrimination, comparison, are roughly performed, and thus few or no contradicting ideas are called up. Hence, whatever is in the mind has a good chance of not being negated. The weakening of the sense of the ludicrous and of the critical power in sleep is due to a similar limitation of our mental activity. These considera- tions apply to every emotion, and account for their accidental antagonism to reason. 6. APPEARANCE OF NEWNESS. A curious phenomenon is frequently met with at this stage of the conversion-crisis. An appearance of newness beautifies every object; it is as if the state of internal harmony was projected outwardly. Jona- than Edwards describes as follows his own experience: " The appearance of all things was altered; there seemed to be, as it were, a calm,beautiful appearance of divine glory in almost everything: God's excellency, His wisdom, His purity and love seemed to appear in everything: in the sun, moon and stars; in the clouds and blue sky; in the grass, flowers and trees; in the water and all nature, which used greatly to fix my mind." Mrs. Emerson had already been struck with the joyful appearance of the faces in the meeting in which she was converted. The following day she repaired to school: " Here the alteration appeared more evident than in my own heart. Every countenance appeared inexpressibly beautiful. .' . . I inquired with myself whether this happy, delight- ful place could be the same in which I had lately passed so many dark, dreary hours of despair and horror." A few more illustrations will not be useless: " When I arose the storm had ceased and the sun was shining. I was in a new world! Such beauty and glory in nature I never saw before! . . ".-The Rev. Mr. Peck. " But I have a fresh recollec- tion that when I went in the morning . . into the field to work, the glory of God appeared in all His visible creation. I well remember we reaped oats, and how every straw and head of the oats seemed, as it were, arrayed in a kind of rainbow glory, or to glow, if I may so express it, in the glory of God.' '-The Rev. Mr. Hallock. " Immediately after conversion I felt somewhat like a stranger in a strange country; everything seemed new to me."--F. ("I felt and knew I was a different man. It seemed as if the birds sang 353</page><page sequence="46">LEUBA: sweeter, the sky bluer. Everything about me praised God, and a sweet sense of His presence was with me." Some speak of " a divine countenance," of " the glory of God."- N. This sense of freshness and of beauty is frequently observed after strong emotional disturbances, and also in certain diseases which come to a sudden turning-point. The youth who has sung for the first time his love-tale to his lady and receives the assurance of requited love, the afflicted one who has walked through a dark passage and suddenly comes to the light, may be filled with a sense of newness which he cannot help " seeing " and " hearing." We might rest content with the explanation that we have to do with an emotional delusion in which the affective state colors external sense-impressions. Beecher was but partly carried away by his subjective state; and consequently the perception of external reality jarred upon his inner felicity: "I shall never forget the feelings with which I walked forth that May morning. The singing of the birds in the woods-for I roamed in the woods-was caco- phonious to the sweet music of my thoughts; and there were no forms in the universe which seemed to me graceful enough to represent the Being, a conception of whose char- acter had just dawned upon my mind. . . ." But we can perhaps make another suggestion, in this wise: The conversion crisis may be supposed to have for physiological counterpart a redistribution of energy involving general mod- ification of the association paths; or an alteration of rhythms, changing the nervous regimen. It is natural enough to ad- mit that to a psychic turmoil so intense as that of conversion corresponds a no less considerable physiological commotion settling in a new arrangement of the motor mechanism. The sense of newness often continues for a considerable time after the recovery of peace. 7. THE ROLE OF THE WILL. Instead of gathering now the information to be found in the records of conversion on the r6le of the will in regeneration, we shall pass to the second part of our essay and introduce in the section on " The Doctrine of the Grace of God, Will and Determin- ism," what should be properly placed here. This arrange- ment has the advantage of bringing the statement of the facts nearer to their discussion. 354</page><page sequence="47">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. PART II. How do Christian doctrines agree with the facts brought out in the preceding psychological analysis of conversion? Are the church dogmas concerning salvation, faith, justifica- tion, grace, predestination, in agreement with them? It will not be without psychological interest, still less without practical value, to place face to face theories and realities. The colossal influence which Christian theology has wield- ed during nineteen centuries, taken together with the actual crumbling down of the doctrinal pillars of Christian Orthodoxy, pointing to a great and not far distant reforma- tion, invest with momentous interest any serious endeavor to restate religious truths on an empirical basis. We have seen in a preliminary chapter on the Religious Motive that the clearer the religious consciousness, the more exclusively is theology a scheme of salvation; all other matters tend to fall out into the domain of general philosophy. Pro- vided the word " salvation is properly understood, it is cor- rect to say that Christ concerned himself with nothing else than the salvation of man; and that Christian creeds are but a metaphysics of the ways and means of regeneration. One of the mysteries of the world to the looker-on who ignores, either from lack of personal experience or from lack of observation, the specific renovating power of Religion-and these blind lookers-on constitute a large part of civilized society-is the inconceivable amount of energy apparently wasted by humanity in theological discussions. But the meanest religious wrangle assumes an august aspect to the eyes of him who sees in the dispute bearings on man's eternal salvation. Much rather is there a mystery in the deadly earn- estness of mankind in search of a new-birth: it is the mystery of evolutionary forces driving humanity to goals it understands not. The lucubration of man's brains may be fantastic-the mind is a wind-mill that may grind trash, but it never turns without wind. Salvation (new-birth) is known as a need, and it is known as an experience. Its reality, looked upon from the point of view of evolution, is a redistribution of energies made necessary by the introduction of new functions; it is a specific transformation similar perhaps to the varia- tions constituting a new species in the animal world. Since the facts of salvation are the only objects of a practi- cal theology (the etymological meaning of the word matters little), let us, at least cursorily, pass in review and compare with the results of our analysis some of the core-doctrines of the Christian church. 355</page><page sequence="48">1. THE DOCTTRNE OF JUSTIFICATION. The Protestant creeds agree in defining justification as the judicial act of God by which He pardons all the sins of the sinner in virtue of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Justification does not make man inherently righteous, it is a simple imputation of the righteousness of Christ, by which man is accounted righteous. The penalty incurred has been paid by Christ, therefore man is justified. It is an external judicial act absolutely inde- pendent of man's merits. The Gallican profession of faith says for instance: "Car les uns ne sont point meilleurs que les autres jusqu' a ce que Dieu les discerne, selon son conseil im- muable qu'il a determine en Jesus Christ devant la creation du mnode." And the Thirty-nine Articles of the church of England declare that, "We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by faith, and not for our own works and deservings.' The other Protestant creeds are on this point in perfect agreement with each other and stand in opposition to the Roman church, which holds that justification is not a mere forensic act, that it is not only imputed, but also communicated through grace. Justification, according to that church, is at the same time remission of sin and the infusion of righteousness. The consequences attributed to justification by Protestant theolo- gians are peace, reconciliation with God, the restoration of intercourse between Him and the sinner, and a title to eternal life. Thereupon we remark that converts feel justified or par- doned-for, although theologically these two terms have a different connotation, experientially they are one,-as the doc- trine affirms, not after the performance of good works, but after a crisis in which they appear to themselves to be pas- sive. St. Augustine cries out: "And thou, O Lord, how long? how long '" Not that they desire not, but that their will is not effective. They have the consciousness that not they, but God's grace performed the transformation. Hence that which brings the sense of justification is neither their merit, since it is when they see themselves in the darkest colors, without any goodness or any hope in their own strength, that the sense of pardon comes; neither their good works, since the crisis is completely independent of any outward activity. Thus far the Protestant doctrine corresponds to experience. The statement that the sinner is "accepted as just, though not just," expresses perfectly the state of consciousness of the convert. He cannot feel condemned now that the will to sin is destroyed, and yet he is conscious of not having attained to perfect holy living. In considering peace and the feeling of reconciliation with God as consequences of the act of jus- 356 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="49">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. tification, theology reverses the psychological process: for, as we have seen, man believes himself pardoned and justified, be- cause he finds himself released from the oppression of sin. It will be objected by some that because the convert knows that he is pardoned upon the recovery of peace only, just as the prisoner infers his acquittal from being set at liberty, it does not follow that the judicial act of justification has not pre- ceded the discharge of the prisoner. It is clearly out of such an anthropomorphic conception that the Christian doctrines have evolved. Until the conception changes, this part of the doctrine will remain in its present form. The Roman doctrine looking upon justification as the covering of sin through an infusion of divine grace, is nearer to the facts. It identifies in some measure justification with regeneration. The Reformers, and particularly Luther, laid great stress on the assurance of salvation. Similarly a large part of the Christian church of to-day expects and requires of every one an experience of salvation. In the primitive church the reception of the Holy Ghost seemed to have been a necessary accompaniment of con- version; what that meant exactly may not be clear, but it was very likely affective manifestations of the faith-state, of like nature with those we have met in the preceding analysis. (See Finney's Conversion, Appendix and pp. 324 and 330.) The particular forms in which affective states dress them- selves, are functions of the intellectual atmosphere of the time.1 The custom of Spiritualist mediums of speaking in a par- ticular jargon, the same in the same country and at the same period, is also in point here. 2. THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH. Justification is conditioned on the side of man by faith. That "we are justified by faith alone, without any manner of virtue or goodness of our own," is the common statement of all the Protestant creeds. The Pauline doctrine partially lost sight of after the first 1 The influence of the "milieu" on our mental forms is strikingly illustrated in insanity. The ordinary correspondent in mental dis- orders, is some one of the personages, or powers, which occupy popular attention. Up to the modern era it was the devil, incubus, angels. Epileptics were demoniacs; hysteric women held converse with evil spirits or entered into mystical union with Christ. All that is past in our advanced communities: electricity and magnetism, oddly enough. have dispossessed the satanic family of a field so well suited to their mischief-making propensities. Go to certain insane asylums to-day and you will hear women and men tell you of "electrical" possession and impregnation, of being troubled by magnetic currents constantly passing through the room, etc.; but you may not hear a single word about the doings of the devil. 4 357</page><page sequence="50">LEUBA: centuries of our era, was reaffirmed by the Reformers as the cardinal principle of Christian life, and since then the numberless Protestant denominations rally around the motto, "Salvation by Faith." Even the Unitarians subscribe to this affirmation (see pp. 319-320). It is the central doctrine of modern Christianity, the only one which continues to pros- per while the others decline. If there is agreement concerning the necessity of an experi- ence or state called faith, there is a remarkable diversity of opinion as to the meaning of the word faith. Psychological analysis is sorely needed here. Some definitions of faith do not cover at all the same ground, some overlap partially, very few coincide. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews wrote: "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Anselm includes the will: "The mere idea does not make faith, although this cannot exist without an object; in order to true faith the right tendency of the will must be added, which grace imparts." Some make it synonymous with intellectual assent, as Thomas Aquinas, who said: "Faith is an act of the intellect assenting to divine truth, in virtue of the operation of the Spirit of God upon the will. Hodge in his "Systematic Theology," Vol. III, page 60, defines faith as "a conviction of truth founded on testimony," and quotes Hase: "Unmittelbar Faihrwahrnehmen, ohne Vermitteluna eines Schlussbeweises durch Neigung und Bediirfniss."' J. E. Edman neglects the mental assent and makes it an affective fact, "Bewusstsein der Versohnung miit Gott." These two elements are fre- quently united, for instance in the Heidelberg catechism. Its answer to the question, "What is faith!" is: "It is not merely a certain knowledge whereby I receive as true all that God has revealed to us in His Word, but also a cordial trust which the Holy Ghost works in me by the gospel."' The creed of the Reformed Episcopal Church of America declares that "the faith which brings justification is simply the reliance or dependence on Christ which accepts him as the sacrifice for his sins, and as our righteousness." The Roman Catholic church distinguished at the Council of Trent between a dead faith, which is simply acceptance of what God has revealed, or the church commanded to be be- lieved, and which can exist even in sinners, and a living faith, which expresses itself in works of charity. Faith, ac- cording to the Roman church, is only the beginning of salva- tion, the root of all justification. McClintock and Strong's Cyclopaedia sums up this dogmatic medley as follows: "Faith, as used in the New Testament, includes three elements, each and all necessary to the full meaning of the word, while one 358</page><page sequence="51">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. or another of them may become prominent according to the connection, viz., (1) full intellectual acceptance of the revela- tion of salvation; (2) adherence to the truth and to the per- son of Chlrist thus accepted; (3) absolute and exclusive trust in the redeeming work of Christ for salvation. In no one of the writers of the New Testament is any of these three elements wanting." These definitions of Faith include two disparate elements: (1) a specific affective state; (2) certain intellectual beliefs. We have given reasons for refusing to designate these two elements by one name and have denominated the first only as Faith; the other we have found to be a non-essential and accidental accompaniment of the faith-state. We have seen in Part I, pp. 337 ff, that deliverance from sin and the joy of salvation invariably followed upon the advent of the faith-state and were independent of the doctrinal beliefs supposed necessary to salvation; and furthermore that the characteristic affective state marking the passage from the "way-down" to the "way-up" need not even have a specific object in the person of Christ. Faith is a state of internal harmony. The disposition to trust and confidence is a natural consequence of it. We saw how the convert projects out- wardly his feeling of happiness and newness ?6. Appearance of Newness). The persons whom he connects with his blessed transformation will, in like manner, be the especial subjects of- the objectivation of his inner felicity and love- liness. Saving faith generates trust in this doctrine or in that person; it is not trust. Now concerning the role of faith in the Christian system. The Augsburg Confession, Article IV, says: "Men are justified freely for Christ's sake through faith when they be- lieve that they are received into favor, and their sins are re- mitted for Christ's sake; this faith doth God impute for righteousness upon Him." We give elsewhere the statement of the Thirty-nine Articles on this point. The Westminster Confession declares that "faith, .. resting on Christ and His righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification." The Methodist Articles embody the ex- perience of John Wesley. In his sermon on justification are these words: " We mean this much, that it [faith] is the only thing without which no one is justified; the only thing that is immediately, indispensably, absolutely requisite in order to pardon. As, on the one hand, though a man should have everything else, without faith yet he cannot be justi- fied; so, on the other, though he be supposed to want every- thing else, yet if he hath faith he cannot but be justified." Every one of the other Protestant creeds expresses the 359</page><page sequence="52">LEUBA: same idea in nearly the same words. There is, then, general agreement on this point. But if faith is looked upon as a pre-requisite of justification and salvation, it is not represented as a procuring cause of salvation; it is but the instrument, or the means of apprehending grace and re- mission of sins, as the Augsburg Confession has it. Not only are good works not a ground of justification, faith itself is not; for it is not of man's production, but an effect of God's grace. Man is saved by the " object of faith," i. e., by the merits of Christ, the Redeemer. Orthodox Protestant theology is throughout consistent in its three fundamental declarations: (1) that nothing is able to save man except the death of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, (2) that without faith there is no salvation, (3) that faith is nevertheless only the instrument of salvation, or according to others, merely the means of apprehending it. Furthermore, as there is no true faith possible without salvation, it follows that "faith" is the work of God in man, performed when the merits of Christ are imputed to the sinner. It can exist but as a consequence of the work of Christ, a work in itself com- pletely external to man. In order to retain the doctrine of the Atonement, the church must see in faith a gift of God; for otherwise man attains faith of himself, and consequently saves himself, since it is admitted that faith involves union with God. Logically, then, to maintain the Christian scheme it is necessary to affirm that the sovereign will of God, determined by man's will, according to the Pelagians, or by His own lordly pleasure without regard to merits, according to orthodoxy, imputes to man Christ's righteousness; and that faith is granted thereupon, or therewith. In that way a necessary concession is made to reality without prejudice to the Atonement: experience and metaphysical speculations are made to walk hand in hand. It is sufficient for its condemnation that the doctrine be stated. Here again theology has been led astray by a crass anthropomorphism, assimilating God to a Judge. The analysis of conversion shows that the faith-state, like any other psychic state, follows upon other processes of a like nature. Unless we give up continuity and with it all possi- bility of the world being a rational moral order, we must con- ceive of faith as supervening upon specific and always identi- cal psychic phenomena. The supposition that a particular portion - if we may use that term - of our psychic life is severed from subjective causal antecedents of a like nature with itself, and is brought about by an act of God following upon a decision determined by Christ's sacrifice - the sub- ject's knowledge or ignorance of it does not affect the ques- 360</page><page sequence="53">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. tion, - belongs to the mythology of a by-gone age. We have seen in previous chapters what are the forerunning links of the process; the facts make plain that salvation (deliverance from moral duality and sin) is a concomitant of faith, and that faith necessarily follows upon the sin-pain and self-surrender, according to a law of continuity of the same nature as the one determining the succession of our thoughts and feelings. There is no more reason for positing a superhuman inter- position in the succession of the phenomena of conversion (sin-pain, self-surrender, unity, joy, disappearance or weak- ening of certain impulses and desires) than in the more ordi- nary changes - be they sudden or gradual - of our affective life, as in the cessation of "moral," "mental," or "physical" pain. The alterations of personality, recently investigated, are no less wonderful than the conversion-experiences. The compelling power of experience tends to let the mythi- cal side of the doctrine fall into oblivion. Even men con- sidered as firmly orthodox drift unconsciously into the new view. On every side we hear that neither intel- lectual reception of the truths of Christianity, nor bap- tism, nor church membership, nor participation in the Lord's supper, nor good works will secure salvation, but only faith in Jesus Christ. In a prospectus of the four Bible schools founded by the evangelist, D. L. Moody, we find the following passage; it would most probably re- ceive the endorsement of the Protestant churches in gen- eral: Some may query what in the view of these schools constitutes a Christian. And this is easily answered without the use of a single theological term. Becoming a Christian is on our part simply a transfer of personal allegiance. When, for instance, a girl in Northfield Seminary issaid to become a Christian, it is not meant that ..... she has been brought to subscribe her assent to the articles of the creed, however true the creed may be. But it is meant that she has freely given her personal confidence to the most trustworthy Being who ever appeared among men. His Spirit makes upon her spirit a wholly new impression of the divine character, and this begins a radical change in her own, a change that grows marked directly in proportion to the intimacy of the relation maintained by the disciple with the Master. It would be easy to cite pages upon pages from the litera- ture of aggressive Christian denominations showing that, in spite of orthodoxy, a large part of the church is practically unmindful of the atonement transaction, and considers faith as the natural and necessary consequence of well-known subjec- tive antecedents. On the vital point of the doctrine the church and the facts are in full agreement: both declare that without faith 361</page><page sequence="54">there is no possible regeneration. We should like to draw the attention of the reader to a weighty conse- quence of this principle. The conviction that between the morally righteous man and the true disciple of Christ there is a specific difference, is to-day deeper than ever. Many will remember the sense of wounded pride, of irritated mor- tification at being made to understand by some plain, empty- headed fellow that, despite their good desires and worthy conduct, they needed conversion; that the kingdom of heaven did not belong to such as they; that between him and them there was the gulf separating the saved from the lost. Such talk smacks of arrogance and conceit. Yet the man may have been right; at any rate he was making a distinction which psychology as well as theology recognizes, i. e., that faith (the particular affective state we have met with in con- version) creates a specific difference between men. Jesus Christ was fully conscious of this differentia when He told good Nicodemus that he must be born again. St. Paul af- firmed the same truth when he wrote, " Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."--IICor.v: 17. We discern the same consciousness in Gautama,and in the saintly figures which stand out luminously in the history of the Christian church. We may scorn the Salvation Army girl who testifies to the same internal life, and asks us whether we are saved; but we cannot make light, in a matter of ex- perience of this sort, of the unanimous declaration of men to whom we are compelled to ascribe exquisite delicacy of moral and religious feeling. Roman Catholics, Calvinists, Uni- tarians,-all proclaim the same doctrine. As specimens of Christian opinion, we quote the following from two sources very different, if the intellectual status of the authors be con- sidered : The sum of our doctrine, then, on this vitally important subject is this: Regeneration, in its internal nature and process, includes three things: First, the receiving the divine life into our inmost being through those capacities that open inward towards God and the spirit-world,-the divine life imparted by the Holy Spirit that ever breathes through the heart of humanity. Secondly, moved by this divine and attractive force, our natural powers, intellectual, affectional and active, incline towards God, and are drawn into His service. Thirdly, all corrupt instincts, whether we acquired them ourselves or received them as the foul inheritance of the past, con- stituting the Adam of consciousness, are expelled. This is the old man, which is put off as the new man is unfolded from within.1 1 Regeneration," by Edmund H. Sears, p. 140. Published by American Unitarian Association, 1893. 362 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="55">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. It [faith] consists in a real change from nature to grace as well as by grace. The term of creation is real: the form introduced in the new creature is as real as the form introduced by creation into any being. . . . The first principle of the new creature is faith. . It is not if any man change his opinion from gentilism to Christianity, he is a new creature; but if any man be in Christ by a vital participation from union with Him. . . . . It [morality] removes not the body of death. It is a cutting away the outward luxuriances, not the inward root. It removes the stench and putre- faction, not the death; an embalmed carcass is as much dead as a putrefied one, though not so loathsome. . . .' Christian life differs from moral life in some such way as love differs from affection and friendship. The inner condition of the " New Man "' is thoroughly dif- ferent from that of the self-righteous man: the tendency mak- ing for ordinary morality, i. e., the affirmation of the indi- vidual will in an effort to live righteously, is in direct oppo- sition to the faith-state. It is, as we have seen, when self- surrender is complete, when the will to satisfy the law has seen its impotency and laid down its arms, that the new creature comes to birth. No better illustration of this specific differ- ence exists, to our knowledge, than the case of John Wesley, recorded above, pp. 339 and 340. He acknowledged between his state of moral righteousness, in which he exclaims: "If it be said that I have faith (for many such things have I heard, from many miserable comforters), I answer, so have the devils-a sort of faith; but still they are strangers to the covenant of promise. . . I want that faith which St. Paul recommends to all the world, especially in his epistle to the Romans: that faith which enables everyone that hath it to cry out, ' I live not, but Christ liveth in me' " (Wes- ley's Journal)-and his after-conversion condition, a radical difference, faith, the Christian differentia. A. expresses a similar experience: "I attended Sunday school from a child up until I was twenty years of age. At twenty-one I became a member of the R. P. Church. I might say with Paul, I was ' a Pharisee of the Pharisees.' Hitherto I had lived a consistent and, to all appearances, an unblamable life, nevertheless I was conscious of wrong within. .. . .I felt the need of the 'one thing needful,'" etc. (Appendix). The facts justify the church in its claim that the true Christian possesses a life in which the merely moral man has no share. There is a biological reality behind the belief that a special relation binds him to the Creator; when he calls himself "saved," "elect," "partaker in 1 From the writings of the Rev. Stephen Charnock, D. D. (a non- Conformist divine of the middle of the 18th century). Published by the Presbyterian Board of Publication, 1840. 363</page><page sequence="56">the divine promises," "beneficiary of the covenant of grace," "a new creature," etc., he expresses in various symbolic forms his specific subjective state. We cannot suppose that church members are all Christians in this specific sense; a large proportion of them, it seems, never rise to the faith- state. Their meaningless assent to the creed and their love of virtue are their only title to church membership. They belong to the great mass of outsiders; for, just as many men live affectionately and respectably with a wife without loving her, so most men live useful and correct lives outside the realm of faith. All this said, and possibly agreed upon, what is the prac- tical value of faith? There are those who look upon love as a morbid phenomenon, and want to see it replaced by simple affection. Is faith worthy of the panegyrics lavished upon it 1 Is it indeed a higher life, a divine life; or is it but a freak of nature, a phenomenon bordering on insanity,which, instead of being sought after, should be suppressed ? The facts of regeneration give, it seems to us, an imperative answer to this query. 3. WILL, DETERMINISM AND THE DOCTRINE OF THE GRACE OF GOD. What is the role played by the will in conversion ? We shall conform in this section to the prevalent opinion and use the word " Will " to designate a supposed or real self-determined power of choice, independent of, and of a different nature from, desires; having in itself the ability, by some not understood means, to cause a stronger desire to be overcome by a weaker one, and thus to save our actions from mechanical necessity. However paradoxical it may appear to one familiar with the indignant outcry raised by the church against scientific determinism, modern empirical science cannot claim for itself the discovery of the illusory nature of free-will; that honor-if it is one-must be left to the Christian church, un- less Buddhism should claim it. Long before science had reached determinism, experience had led the church to formu- late as a fundamental principle of the psychology of the scheme of salvation the utter impotency of the will. To the question, what can men do to obtain salvation? the Christian church has but one consistent answer: Nothing; it is the fruit of the Grace of God, which worketh according to its own good pleasure. Although the doctrine affirms that of our own will we cannot believe, that faith is a gift of God, not given according to merit or desire, in practice - and this is but one of the many inconsistencies into which we are forced 364 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="57">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. when we pass from theory to life-the ministers of the church repeat the words, "Whosoever will may come," and urge men to " believe." Calvin, following St. Augustine, declares in the Gallican Profession of Faith: "Et bien qu'il y ait une volontepar laquelle il est incite d faire ceci ou cela, toutefois elle est du tout captive sous peche, en sorte qu'il n'a nulle liberte c bien, que celle que Dieu lui donne." Furthermore the divine grace is given irrespective of merit: "Car les uns ne sont point meilleurs que les autres, jusqu'd ce que Dieu les discerne selon son conseil immuable qu'il a determine en Jesus Christ devant la creation du monde." The Augsburg and the Hel- vetic confessions affirm the same two points : Inability of the will to acquire faith and the good pleasure of God as the only determining cause of the application of His Grace. The Con- fession de Foi des Eglises Reformees wallonnes et fiamandes, and the Scotch confession do but repeat the Gallican Articles on Free-will and Election with less emphasis. The former says, "Par quoi nous rejetons tout ce qu on enseigne du franc arbitre de l'homme, parcequ'il n:est que serf de pechU et ne peut aucune chose, s'il ne lui est donne du ciel. . The Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England do not substantially differ from the preceding: " The con- dition of man after the fall of Adam is such that he can- not turn and prepare himself by his own natural strength and good works, to faith, and calling upon God." " We are ac- counted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by faith and not for our own de- servings." "Predestination to life is the everlasting pur- pose of God, whereby (before the foundation of the world was laid) He hath constantly decreed by His counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom He hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honor." The Westminster Confession is thoroughly Calvinistic. The Methodist Articles and the creed of the Reformed Episcopal Church of America, are identical with the Thirty-nine Arti- cles on the subjects of Free-will and Justification. The great creeds of the Protestant churches deny to man not only the natural possession of the instruments of salvation, but even the power to appropriate them to himself when they are offered. ' The determinism they proclaim is one-sided, inasmuch as 1 It is worthy of note that the greatest thinkers of the church, St. Augustine, Calvin, Edwards, and others, have found these con- clusions logically necessary. 365</page><page sequence="58">LEUBA: man is granted the power to do evil of himself, but not that of efficaciously willing good. A theory so persistently put forth for so many centuries, and still holding the field, must have a deep experiential root. That this doctrine is rarely heard of in modern pulpits does not warrant the inference that a systematically elaborated free-will doctrine has been put in its place; on the contrary, the weight of modern psychology goes to make determinism universal; if it is left in the background, it is because our intensely prac- tical age ignores theories. The experience on which the one-sided determinism of the church rests is what we have called "self-surrender.'7 We have seen that before the advent of peace and the assurance of salvation, the convert experiences the futility of his own efforts: "self-righteousness" is found to work but greater anxiety and deeper dissatisfaction. Luther in his cell, endangering his life by mortifications in order to conquer the evil that was in him, with no other effect than increased moral wretched- ness, is a classical example of the impotency of the will in the work of salvation. It is here, in the sense of sin, in the dis- satisfaction caused by moral dualism, that we must seek for the psychological root of penance, maceration and asceticism in general. When the body is looked upon as the cause of the pain of sin, any violence to the flesh that may be sup- posed to subdue its appetites is counted a step towards heaven. One of the deepest impressions left by the perusal of the conversions we have seen, is the passivity of the subjects. They are lookers-on; they attend as spectators the drama that is being played in their consciousness, just as a patient observes and watches for the development of his disease. But before assuming a quiescent attitude, they pass through a period of self-affirmation, of desperate efforts to bring about the desired salvation, - efforts which are but muscular ten- sions. When their ineffectiveness is recognized, the failure of the will is acknowledged, and resignation to God's good pleasure takes the place of confidence in self. This quiescent attitude is striking in many of the cases we have dissected. Hadley wrote, " How I wondered if I would be saved!" L: "For about three years I maintained a fairly moral condition by constant struggles and self-efforts. -. ..... There was not then, and I knew it, any real inner life, no spiritual joy, no love to the Master. It was a painful forcing to religious duty, and not a spontaneous following of the Divine Voice." Of a later period he says, "I did try at intervals to stop drink by self-resolutions, promises, pledges, only to fall back weaker and deeper down 366</page><page sequence="59">PSYCEOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. than before. . . . At last I abandoned all efforts and let the tide rush as it would, indifferent to everything human or divine. When I got utterly hopeless, help- less, in the darkest despair. . then salvation came. He concludes his narration with these words: ' He [Jesus] delivers me from self-effort, struggles, unrest and self-condemnation; it is simply a life of growth by constant trust. ' G. and 0. had repeatedly signed abstinence pledges, and had made desperate, but vain, efforts to keep them. It was only when all hope of succeeding by their own strength had gone that redemption came. J. found that a series of refor- mations and relapses " had a very hardening effect." " I saw clearly that I had placed myself where human help could do me no good. I had lost my will-power. . . 7 St. Augustine, soul-sick, rolled and turned in his chains " till they were wholly broken ;" he cried within himself, " Be it done now, be it done now." Deliverance, having refused to obey the summons of the will, falls upon the grieved soul at the time of the intensest realization of helplessness, when relaxation has superseded tension; often the unexpectedness of relief causes the convert to doubt his salvation, although he has already obtained it (see p. 350). Sometimes there is a period of revolt, as in the case of Nettleton, who felt he had done all he could, and thought it unjust of God not to " receive " him. He learned later during his mis- sionary career that 'the Spirit of God moves when and where It wills, and does not come at the call of man.' He relates the following incident, which took place at a revival meeting in a private house: "Very soon Emily returned exclaim- ing, '0, I cannot go home, I dare not go. I shall lose my concern. What shall I do?' and threw herself down in a chair, her head on the table in the deepest agony. All at once she became silent, and gently raised her head with a placid countenance, and was heard to say in a mild tone of voice, '0 , I can submit, I can love Christ. How easy it is; 1 The process of conversion offers to pedagogy incomparable il- lustrations of the power of sympathy, of trust, in the relation be- tween teachers and pupils, and, generally, between men. If the cardinal principle of religious life is " Salvation by Faith," the fundamental principle of the ministers of education should be " Growth by Sympathy." Receptivity and suggestibility are propor- tional to the degree of trust, of self-surrender, of unconsciousness, to which the pupil is brought. Sympathy does not only make com- munication from teacher to scholar easier, but, better than that, it draws out, unfolds, liberates, potential life. The teacher who pro- vokes resistance, criticism, disdain or indifference, should be ban- ished from the school room; he can neither teach nor educate. 367</page><page sequence="60">why did I not do it before!'" Colonel Gardiner and M. were converted in what appears to be a semi-sleep. How could theology have affirmed the freedom of the will when it is found to be useless in this all-important matter of salvation ? St. Augustine needed no other instruction than a conversion-experience to become the apostle of the " total depravity" and "predestination" doctrines. Now, in spite of the impotency of his will, man is never- theless rescued and made to enjoy the peace of pardon and the assurance of having been received into the Fatherly arms of God, and that suddenly, as by a miracle. A second before, a miserable convict dragging his chains after him; now free and filled with unutterable love! How is such a wonderful transformation to be explained ? The doctrine of the "Grace of God " given freely without consideration of merits, is the answer of the church to that query; no better answer could have been given at the time of the formulation of the dogma. We may remark, by the way, that the same argument for the intervention of God's power can be made for any one of the bodily disorders, such as neuralgia, etc., in which sudden cessation of pain is of common occurrence. Christianity is not the only religion preaching the blessed- ness of a surrendered life. The Stoics (some of them at least) sought salvation in the detachment from the changing fortunes of the outer world; they saw that inner unity was not to be attained by proud self-assertiveness, but by humble submis- sion to the Ruling Powers. The Buddhist philosopher teaches at-one-ment with the world-spirit through the destruc- tion of all carnal desires; he gives up desiring and lapses into passive contemplation. His efforts to fall in with the cosmos and be absorbed in it, correspond to the Christian struggle to let God's will rule in himself. In Schopen- hauer's denial of the will to live, we find this self-surrender motive systematized. Buddhists, Christians, Stoics, how- ever they may differ on other points, unite to affirm the necessity for man, in order to obtain his desire,-be it called Nirvana, salvation, happiness or otherwise, - to surrender, give up, renounce. They proclaim unanimously, from ex- perience, the deceptive nature of the will to live. The cause of this universal renunciation-one of the most deeply signifi- cant phenomena of moral life-is, it seems to us, not so much the disappointments in the achieved as the dishearten- ing experience of the failures of the will. There comes a time in the evolution of the moral life of every people at which the barrenness of the will-effort (or will-tension) is realized; then self-renunciation is introduced in the national religion as a cardinal principle. The essential difference between the 368 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="61">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. Buddhist and the Christian is that the latter does not only believe that the carnal man must die, but also that he dies to make room for a new individuality. The first suppresses the stream of life, the other changes its direction. But why is it that man looks upon the descending current of the stream of life as his, while he considers the ascend- ing one as not his? Why does he identify himself with the desires to be denied, the evil tendencies; while he ascribes to God the desires to be affirmed I The moral religions and philosophies are expressed from that standpoint. Hence they call for self-surrender, self-renunciation, self-annihila- tion. Why have they not included in the conception of the " self " both terms of the dualism and given man credit for the good as well as for the bad that is in him? Had they done this, they would have exhorted man, as the Concord Sage, to self-affirmation and self-reliance. Or, then, adopt the other alternative: deny him the good and the bad and look upon him as the stage on which life's drama is being played, as some of our ego-dissolving psychological schemes do? The explanation of this alienation of the higher motives from the self need not be sought for very far. Long before being acquainted with what we called later altruistic im- pulses, our consciousness was occupied with selfish motives. Primitive man and the child of civilized races are selfish in- dividuals. To them life is but a pursuit after the satisfac- tion of egoistic desires, and consequently is known by the affirmation of the selfish will only. Later on altruistic instincts come to birth and introduce tendencies opposed to the feelings and desires which up to that time had made up the whole of our ego. Is it to be wondered at if we do not recognize these new comers as " ours," in the same sense as the primitive egoistic desires are felt to be ours 1 They come to us we know not whence, unexpected, uncalled for, and stand in antagonism to that which we have always called our ego; furthermore, at first they are hardly felt in themselves, but rather only as inhibitions of customary desires,-they do not show themselves openly, they betray their presence by the suppression of the satisfaction formerly derived from the affirmation of the selfish will to live. That man should have denied naturalization to such an evanescent alien was un- avoidable. He cannot help considering himself as passive in the conversion crisis: he receives Jesus Christ; he lets God take possession of his being, he yields, he surrenders. Yet the very words "receive," " accept," " surrender," have a pos- itive side; they can just as well be accompanied with that which constitutes effort. As a matter of fact, although, for the reason we have given and in accordance with the prev- 369</page><page sequence="62">alent theology, the subject looks upon the sinful tendencies as belonging to his ego, he cannot avoid at times calling the upward impulses his, and then he expresses himself as I.: ' By every conscious effort of my mind and will, I surren- dered myself to the power of Jesus. . Impulses in two directions, both equally ours, because we feel them both, and equally independent of will-effort, is what analysis brings to light concerning the role of the will in con- version. When regeneration is obtained, the desires of the egoistic will fade or disappear more or less completely, and a set of new impulses, bringing with them new emotions and feelings, occupy the foreground of consciousness. Gradually these new-comers acquire a familiar aspect, a home-tinge that makes the convert speak of them as his new, in opposition to his old ego. The church denial of the ability of man to do good of him- self means nothing more than the recognition of the ineffica- ciousness of the will-effort. It is here in agreement with the modern psychologists who see in the sense of effort merely the return sensations of muscle contractions. The third and concluding part of the essay is to be pub- lished later. It is chiefly theoretical and speculative, being an attempt to point to the possible physiological correlates of the psychic facts analyzed in Part I. It includes a genetic theory of sin, of moral resistance, of consent, of self-surrender and of the faith-state, and ends with general considerations touch- ing the physiological forces at play in religious life, and es- pecially in conversion, and their bearing on some ethical and philosophical problems. I take with pleasure this opportunity of acknowledging the indebtedness under which I stand to President G. Stanley Hall for the continued help, stimulation and inspiration re- ceived from him during the three years I have spent as stu- dent at Clark University. I also tender my hearty thanks to Dr. E. C. Sanford forthe assistance he always readily granted me and for suggestions concerning this essay, and also to a friend who patiently as- sisted me in the tedious work of revising my manuscript. 370 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="63">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. APPENDIX. The concrete cases of conversion, which constitute the clearest portion of our observation material, were in part gathered from literature, biographies, memoirs of great revivalists and religious periodicals, and, in part received in answer to the questionnaire printed below,' or taken directly, in private interviews, from the mouth of the converts. In the following pages the reader will find a selection of typical and striking cases of sudden regenera- tion. During our early adolescence, circumstances, and later philo- sophical interest, have brought us in contact with the phase of life herein examined. We have frequented " revivals," mission meet- ings, Salvation Army exercises, etc., and thus have gained, in the atmosphere of such assemblies, a practical knowledge of the sub- ject of our thesis, which has been to us an invaluable guiding light. The questionnaire was sent to persons who were thought to have "experienced religion," to mission leaders and pastors, and through them to a large class which we could not have reached directly. It was moreover published in The Presbyterian of Phila- delphia, in The Christian of London, and in The Outlook. It was to be expected that conversion tales would be cut more or less after the classical pattern furnished by such famous conversions as those of St. Augustine, Bunyan, and Wesley. As a matter of fact a small percentage of the answers received were made up of the phraseology current in revivals and mission rooms, and smacked so strongly of religious cant, and so little of personal ex- perience, that they had to be rejected; most of them gave in- ternal evidence of earnest effort to describe accurately an ex- perience to which a momentous significance was assigned. One is at first astonished at the uniformity of the process de- scribed by the subjects of conversion. At a distance of more than a thousand years, among circumstances varying widely as to nationality, temperament, mental endowment, education and age, the main features of the phenomenon remain the same. That such should be the fact is but natural, if conversion is what we believe it to be. The fruitfulness of our questionnaire was considerably limited by 1QUESTIONNAIRE FOR A STUDY OF CONVERSION. 1. How long ago were you converted? At what age? 2. Were you brought up by Christian parents ? What religious education did you receive? (Did you go to Sunday school? How long?) 3. Describe your life, your religious condition and your moral struggles for the period preceding conversion. Were you at peace with yourself? Did you endeavor to reform? What did you do to that end? What measure of success attended your efforts? 4. Where, on what occasion and under what circumstances, were you converted? Had you, before that moment, made up your mind that you would be converted if possible? Tell, in detail, what you meant then by conversion: why did you desire it; what did you expect of it? In what mental and in what moral disposition were you at the time? What was the state of your health? 5. Relate your conversion. What were the various thoughts in your mind and the various feelings in your heart at the moment of conversion? What affected you most deeply? Were you very much moved? By what, or by whom were you moved? 6. Describe your feelings and your thoughts immediately after conversion. Were you aware that you had experienced conversion? In what particulars had you be- come changed? What was temporary and what permanent in the results of your conversion 7. If you have passed through more than one similar experience, or through other less momentous moral crises, describe each one separately, giving date of each. 8. Do you know of conversions, or of simple reformations, as of drunkards, having happened, without the influence of the Christian religion ? 371</page><page sequence="64">LEUBA: the lack of confidence on the part of certain people in the usefulness of psychology applied to religious phenomena, by the difficulties which a person of average culture and ordinary in- trospective power would naturally encounter when trying to record his own experience, and also by the antagonism of some church officials, a hostility arising from the belief, still alive in some quar- ters, that science and religion are enemies, and also from a fas- tidious delicacy, offended at an invitation to pry into sacred ex- periences. This seemed to one of our correspondents " worse than vivisection." If we felt the need of defending ourselves against this accusation, we should point to the wonderfully acute search- ings of heart of so many devout Christians-St. Augustine for in- stance-made public for the edification and instruction of the peo- ple. We desire to acknowledge here our indebtedness to Mr. Chas. Cut- ter, leader of the Fulton Street Noonday Prayer Meeting, New York, for the help given us in the collection of material. It is through him that the questionnaire prepared by us was published in The Pres- byterian and in The Christian. He has communicated to us a great many of the most interesting answers, from which we quote in this essay. Lack of space prevents us from publishing all the conversion- records we should like. Several of those which follow have been abridged. The name of the person and the place of residence were given in almost every case. A. [Age fifty, converted at twenty-two, in :Glasgow, Scotland.] My condition was morally miserable for about a month previous to conversion. I had always been a young man of prayer. I was con- verted at my work. At that time I was working every alternative week at night (papermaking), and, between 12 and 1 o'clock at night I was praying earnestly to God to save me for the sake of Jesus. Indeed I cannot tell you whether I was " in the body or out of the body," but O! the light came,-it was almost too much for me. I cannot express how I felt. It was as if I had been in a dark dungeon and lifted into the light of the sun. I shouted and I sang praise unto Him who loved me and washed me from my sins. I was forced to retire into a secret place, for the tears did flow, and I did not wish my shopmates to see me, and yet I could not keep it a secret. I was constrained to tell to all around what a gracious Saviour I had found. At the moment of my conversion I was in the best of health. The only thing that troubled me was my soul. The joy and the peace that filled my soul at conversion was greater than I have felt since that period, but, thank God, there is a peace and a joy within my soul now that the friends of this world know nothing of. B. [Converted at twenty. A clergyman.] At the age of twenty I entered a theological seminary and re- mained there four years. The third year I became a member of a conversational club, whose motto was the Hebrew for " We stand united for investigation." During the course of our studies in rationalistic Biblical criticism, a night was devoted to the discus- sion on the Fourth Gospel the author of the essay taking ground against the historical validity of this gospel, regarding it as a sort of philosophical writing on certain phases of Christian teaching. I remember the reader's last sentence: "The Fourth Gospel is a 372</page><page sequence="65">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. 373 great epic." By this essay the flood-gates of doubt were open me. (See conclusion, p. 339.) (From a letter communicated to us by Dr. Burnham.) C. [The Rev. Mr. Ch. G. Finney.] Up to his conversion he was a young man of very good charac- ter. See pp. 324 and 330. In the evening of the day in which his conversion took place," his heart seemed to be liquid within him." He wanted to pour his whole soul out to God's and rushed into a back room to pray. "There was no fire and no light in the room; nevertheless it appeared to me as if it were perfectly light. As I went in and shut the door after me, it seemed as if I met the Lord Jesus Christ face to face. It did not occur to me then nor did it for some time afterwards, that it was wholly a mental state. On the contrary it seemed to me that I saw Him as I would see any other man. He said nothing, but looked at me in such a manner as to break me right down at His feet. . . I wept aloud like a child, and made such confessions as I could with my choked utterances." When he re- turned in the front office: " As I turned and was about to take a seat by the fire, I received a mighty baptism of the Holy Ghost. Without any expectation of it. . . . without any recollection that I had ever heard the thing mentioned by any person . . the Holy Spirit descended upon me in a manner that seemed to go through my body and soul. I could feel the impression, like a wave of electricity, going through and through me. Indeed it seemed to come in waves and waves of liquid love. ... I can recollect distinctly that it seemed to fan me like immense wings." During the night he awoke many times "on account of the great flow of the love of God that was in my heart. I was so filled with love that I could not sleep." (From Finney's "Memoirs," New York, Barnes &amp; Co., 1876.) E. [Age forty-two, converted at thirty-three. An Oxford graduate.] My father was a Church of England clergyman. My mother, still alive, never had, and has not now, a knowledge of salvation. I was intended from babyhood for the ministry, and had a grammar school and university career, graduating in arts at Oxford in 1880. At fifteen years of age I was a confirmed smoker, and used to get drunk often without the master being aware of it. At eighteen years of age I was sent to another school .... My second school was a change for the worse. Here, all the older boys with one or two exceptions, were habitual drinkers, if not drunkards. Out all night by means of duplicate keys to the school doors, was a regular thing for weeks together, and drink, smoking, and sins of all kinds (except the more horribly gross ones) were the order of the day. We were all manly fellows, and I thank God now that I am spared the humiliation of looking back upon a life tainted by the abominations which prevailed in some of our larger public schools. About two and a half years of this brought me up to the age at which I should enter upon my university career. I went to Oxford and gained my scholarship or exhibition in the usual way. A reckless, drunken and otherwise impure life passed by quickly enough, and I found myself a graduate, ready, as my poor father thought, to take orders at once. Alas, alas! nothing was further from my mind than the ministry. I knew absolutely nothing of God. Up to thirty-three years of age my whole life was one of routine religion. Between the period of leaving Oxford and my conver- 5</page><page sequence="66">sion, I never darkened the door of my father's church, although I lived with him for eight years, making what money I wanted by jour- nalism, and spending it in high carousal with any one who would Bit with me and drink it away. This was a source of much trouble to my parents, who saw my talent and education thrown away, owing to my inability to settle down to steady work. But I had grown weary of religion as I had seen it. Eight years, between my degree at Ox- ford and my conversion in 1886, seems a long time now to have wasted in a small village with two inns only. But it went by very quickly, in the way I lived. I was young and handsome, of tre- mendously powerful physique, and was a general favorite with the girls. This, I suppose, was a great factor in enabling me to live a life so different from the one I might have lived, had I turned to and gone earnestly to work. Anyway, so I lived, and would prob- ably have gone on living had not God turned me around and com- pelled me to go another road. Sometimes drunk for a week to- gether, and then a terrible repentance, and not touch a drop for a whole month. I never got beyond that period, except once, when I joined the Good Templars, in the hope that the restraints of this body would keep me in check. I did very well for nearly three months but a Good Templar at last broke me, and we both ceased to attend the meetings, and were knocked off the roll. In all this period, that is, up to thirty-three years of age, I never had a desire to re- form on religious grounds, but all my pangs were due to some ter- rible remorse I used to feel after a heavy carousal; the remorse taking the shape of regret after my folly in wasting my life in such a way-a man of superior talents and education. I was not much alarmed about the future world; I did not believe it to exist, at any rate. This " terrible remorse" turned me gray in one night, and whenever it came upon me I was perceptibly grayer the next morning. What I suffered in this way is beyond the expression of words. It was hell-fire in all its most dreadful tortures. Often did I vow that if I got over "this time" I would reform. Alas, in about three days I fully recovered, and was as happy as ever. So it went on for years, but, with a physique like a rhinoceros, I always recovered; as long as I let drink alone, no man was as capa- ble of enjoying life as I was. I was converted in my own bedroom in my father's rectory house at precisely 3 o'clock in the afternoon of a hot July day (July 13th, 1886). I was in perfect health, having been off from the drink for nearly a month. I was in no way troubled about my soul. In fact, God was not in my thoughts that day. A young lady friend sent me a copy of Professor Drummond's "Natural Law in the Spiritual World," asking me my opinion of it as a literary work only. Being proud of my critical talents, and wishing to enhance myself in my new friend's esteem, I took the book to my bedroom, for quiet, intending to give it a thorough study, and then write her what I thought of it. It was here that God met me face to face, and I shall never forget the meeting. " He that hath the Son hath Life Eternal;" "' He that hath not the Son hath not Life." I had read this scores of times before. But this made all the difference: I was now in God's presence, and my attention was absolutely " soldered " on to this verse, and I was not allowed to proceed with the book till I had fairly considered what these words really meant and what they involved. Only then was I allowed to proceed, feel- ing all the while that there was another being in my bedroom, though not seen by me. The stillness was very marvelous, and I felt supremely happy. It was most unquestionably shown me, in one second of time, that I had never touched the Eternal, that is, 374 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="67">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. 375 God; and that if I died then, I must inevitably be lost. I was un- done. I knew it as well as I now know I am saved. The Holy Spirit of God showed it me in most ineffable love; there was posi- tively no terror in it; I felt God's love so powerfully upon me that only a mighty sorrow crept over me that I had lost all through my own folly, and what was I to do ? What could I do ? I did not repent even; God never asked me to repent. All I felt was, " I am undone," and God cannot help it, although He loves me. No fault on the part of the Almighty. All the time I was supremely happy; I felt like a little child before his father. I had done wrong, but my Father did not scold me, but loved me most wondrously. Still, my doom was sealed. I was lost to a certainty, and being naturally of a brave disposition I did not quail under it, but deep sorrow for the past, mixed with regret for what I had lost, took hold upon me, and my soul thrilled within me to think it was all over. Then there crept in upon me so gently, so lovingly, so unmistakably, a way of escape, and what was it after all? The old, old story over again, told in the simplest way, "There is no name under heaven whereby ye can be saved except that of the Lord Jesus Christ." No words were spoken to me; my soul seemed to see my Saviour in the spirit, and from that hour to this, nearly nine years now, there has never been in my life one doubt that the Lord Jesus Christ and God the Father both worked upon me that afternoon in July, both differ- ently and both in the most perfect love conceivable, and I rejoiced there and then in a conversion so astounding that the whole vil- lage heard of it in less than twenty-four hours. After passing through the scene with God in my bedroom, I went to the rooms downstairs to relate what I had experienced to any- one who would listen. All saw I was a wonderfully changed man, very subdued and quiet, but out of a family of six grown-up sis- ters,a brother, a father, and a mother,-only one, a widowed sister, two years older than myself, really understood what had taken place, and she was rejoiced beyond measure, and said that I had received a glorious conversion, and that she always knew that I would be saved at last, although it looked so bad against me. But a time of trouble was yet to come. The day after my conversion I went into the hay field to lend a hand with the harvest, and not having made any promise to God to abstain from drink in modera- tion only, I took too much and came home drunk. My poor sister was heart-broken; and I felt ashamed of myself and got to my bedroom at once,where she followed me, weeping copiously. She said I had been converted and fallen away instantly. But although I was quite full of drink (not muddled, however), I knew that God's work begun in me was not going to be wasted. It was no good to pray in that state,-I had not prayed for twenty years,-and, wishing my sister good night, I said with the utmost simplicity, "You don't know all that has occurred to me; it is all right, and although I am drunk now, I love my Saviour with a love I cannot express to you." And so she left me for the night, somewhat more reconciled. Next morning I was very low indeed; still I felt that God was not going to lift me up like that and then let me fall into lower depths at once. About mid-day I made on my knees the first prayer before God for twenty years. I did not ask to be forgiven; I felt that was no good, for I would be sure to fall again. Well, what did I do? I committed myself to Him in the profoundest belief that my indi- viduality was going to be destroyed, that He would take all from me, and I was willing. In such a surrender lies the secret of a holy life. From that hour drink has had no terrors for me; I never touch it, never want it. The same thing occurred with my pipe:</page><page sequence="68">after being a regular smoker from my twelfth year the desire for it went at once, and has never returned. So with every known sin, the deliverance in each case being permanent and complete. I have had no temptations since conversion God seemingly having shut out Satan from that course with me, but he gets a free hand in another way, but never on sins of the flesh. Since I gave up to God all ownership in my own life, He has guided me in a thousand ways, and has opened my path for me in a way almost incredible to those who do not enjoy the blessing of a truly surrendered life. P. S.-Written at one sitting, and not meant for publication as it stands. [The writer of this letter is now married and has four chil- dren. ] F. [Age twenty-one, converted at sixteen. Brought up in a Christian home. Attended the Wesleyan Sunday school from the age of four tofourteen.] At the age of fourteen I thought that if I went to a place of wor- ship once every Sunday, that would be all the religion I required. "Was I at peace with myself?" Far from it. There were times when I felt most miserable. I felt my moral nature sinking while I was trying hard to find something higher. I endeavored to re- form, but my moral surroundings were too strong for me; so my efforts were all unsuccessful. On the night of February 23d something tempted me to go to the Wesleyan Chapel of my childhood days. Rev. A. Wood was preaching from Luke x: 5-42. The words came home to me. I felt that there was something else needed in my life; the sermon had made me feel miserable. In this state I remained for fifteen hours. For five months previous to this I had felt that I would like to be converted; but the moral forces of my workshop (which was in a piano forte factory) seemed too strong for me. My moral dis- position was somewhat crushed by the sense of my sins. My men- tal condition, like my health, was good. On February 24th between 11 and 12 A. M., I could bear the weight of my sins no longer. I thought if ever I am to be converted, why not now? So locking the door of my workshop I fell on my knees and prayed in the language of hymn 327 in "Sacred Songs and Solos." And im- mediately a voice seemed to say to me, " Thy sins which are many, are all forgiven thee." At this moment I was filled with wonder. Arising from my knees I knew that I was converted. I was affected most by my sins and my Saviour's greatlove, but I do not remember that I shed a tear. Immediately after conversion I felt somewhat like a stran- ger in a strange country; everything seemed new to me. Yes, I knew for a certainty that I was born again. My whole life was altered. And I saw everything under a different aspect from what I had done before. As far as I know, everything that was good and true became permanent ... G. [Age forty, converted twenty months ago. Superintendent of a mission. ] Until the age of twenty-one he lived in a Christian home. He took his first glass of whiskey at that age, and gradually became a drunkard. Three years ago, after the ruin, through dissipation, of his business establishment, he went to Canada, where no one knew his antecedents, with the intention of beginning life anew. But soon he fell a prey to his old enemy. He had signed enough absti- nence pledges to "cover the wall of a room;" they were never 376 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="69">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. kept more than a month, generally only a few days, and sometimes but a few hours, in spite of hard struggles to be true to his promise. In Montreal he lost a very good position ($70 a fortnight), and was thrown into prison for disorderly conduct. Disgusted and tired of life, he left Canada to go to W. Here he arrived intoxicated. He secured a position, but was soon dismissed for drunkenness, and then found himself once more without money, without friend and without home. Gladly would he have welcomed death. As he was in this wretched situation,a lady showed him sympathy and invited him to a mission. Her kindness made him look within. For years no one had ever cared about him; this unwonted kindly interest went to his heart. At the meeting a pressing invitation was given to all persons present to give themselves to the Lord Jesus Christ with the assurance that He would save them. A bed was given him in the mission house. While his room-mate lay drunk, he sat up, or paced the room all night long in a sullen, despairing mood. Some one had lent him a Bible; he tried to read it, but his thoughts were too disturbing. That which he had heard in the meeting had brought to his mind recollections of youth, the thought of the young wife he had left in England, of his family, etc. He realized that there was no hope, that if he died then he would go to hell. He prayed asking God to take him as he was; saying that if He was willing to save him, he would let Him. "I said, here I am." At about 6 A. M. he felt that God had pardoned him. The anguish of the night had passed, and he found himself calm and peaceful. That very morning he told a companion that he was converted, that he had given his heart to God. Terrible were the temptations that day as he passed before the saloon doors; but he was kept. They,recurred day after day for more than a week. The lady's continued sympathy was a great comfort to him. Three months after his conversion he opened a mission, which progressed rapidly, and is now doing very good work among drunkards and other outcasts. (Written from detailed notes taken while he was relating his con- version to me.) H. [Age thirty-five, converted five years ago. Hotel waiter. Pub- lic school education.] Until the age of fifteen he lived among religious people. Subse- quently he left home, fell into bad company and became a drunkard. He abandons his wife, sleeps in the open air and becomes a tramp. In that condition he feels very unhappy and lonely. He is without friends. He has remorse at the thought of his mother, who grieves for him. On the 28th of November, 1889, while he was seated in Central Park, N. Y., a young man entered into conversation with him, and invited him to go in his company to a religious meeting. The kind- ness of the stranger moved him deeply; he did not understand why a well-dressed stranger should care for him and be willing to walk with a raggedly clad fellow like himself. At the meeting he heard the testimonies of those who had also been wretched castaways, and who were now happy disciples of Christ. But the beautiful things he heard could hardly be for him; he was surely lost. After the meeting the stranger knelt with him, and they prayed together and wept like children. He promised God that he would serve Him; and gave himself to Him body and soul. Peace came to his soul as he was praying in that spirit, and he felt himself pardoned of all his sins. He declared then publicly that from that moment he would begin a new life. He felt God in his heart; he knew that 377</page><page sequence="70">he was regenerated, and although he did not know where to find shelter for the night, he felt assured that God would always help him. He went to his wife and told her of his conversion. The new light on his face convinced her that a great change had taken place in him, and they began life anew together. (Communicated by a friend who obtained this story from the person himself.) I. [Age fifty-four, converted at forty-five.] My Christian mother died when I was seven. My father was a drinking man, and nominally a Methodist. Up to the age of twelve I had but very little religious or any other kind of education. It was a life of neglect and often hunger and misery. At the age of twelve I was adopted by my godfather, . and had the blessing of a Christian home. I became a member of the Sunday school of Saint Paul's Church, N. Y ... In course of time I was confirmed and became a member of the church. I was active in all the externals of church life and work, became Sabbath school teacher, member of the Young Men's Association, etc. From 1853 to 1860 I was clerk in my uncle's office. He was a magistrate and had a legal practice. I got into society at nineteen and was fascinated with dancing, parties, billiards, etc. I commenced smoking at nineteen, and drinking at twenty-one; then followed theatre, gambling, licen- tiousness and deeper forms of sin. I was leading a dual life, de- ceiving my uncle and aunt, maintaining an outside semblance of morality, attending church, etc., but living a lie before God. For I had no religion. I had been a respectable and moral church mem- ber, but there had been no new birth. . . I plunged deeper into drink and dissipation of all forms, until the risk of dis- covery by my friends in my home became so imminent and I was so utterly reckless that I ran away from home in 1863 to enter the army. I served to the end of the war and came out of it hardened, callous and indifferent. Drink, profanity, cards and sinful amuse- ments of the viler kind occupied my life until 1869. There was no peace. There was a reckless defiance of any religious suggestion, a willful pleasure in sinful enjoyments, resistance to the voice of the Spirit, a mental and physical effort to shut God out of my life. In 1869 I tried to reform and joined the " Church of the Stranger." For about three years I maintained a fairly moral condition by con- stant struggles and self-efforts. I was regular in the perfunctory duties of church membership, and active in various forms of be- nevolent work in that church and in the Y. M. C. A., as Sunday school teacher, etc. There was not then, and I knew it, any real inner life, no spiritual joy, no love to the Master: it was a painful forcing to religious duty, and not a spontaneous following of the divine Voice and impulse. The end was a failure. . . . The house had been swept and garnished and made ready for the seventy devils that took possession. From 1872 until 1886, with some intermission, I continued the life of slavery to drink and all the grosser sins that go with it. For a short period before and after my marriage in 1878, I reformed from drinking, but there was no religious experience attending it. I did try at intervals to stop drink by self-resolutions, promises, pledges, only to fall back weaker and deeper down than before .. I at last abandoned all efforts and let the tide rush as it would, in- different to everything human or divine, and often tempted to suicide. How I bless God for saving me! Ob, what love, what wondrous love that saved such a sinner as I was! 378 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="71">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. When I got utterly hopeless, helpless, in the darkest despair, when I felt the slavery of sin, . . . its physical and spiritual consequences, when I knew and realized that I was utterly and forever lost, so that I dared not even pray, and yet there was just the shadow of a wish, the faintest suggestion of a desire to be free, then God raised up a human instrument. My employer put me in the "Christian Home for Intemperate Men." I went there will- ingly, gladly; I would have gone anywhere to get away from the hell that was eating away my body and soul. I had not had any special thought of seeking help by the gospel until I went there. I first realized something of hope when I was told that the grace of God alone could save me. I had of course a theoretical knowledge of the plan of salvation, but my heart was dead to any special de- sire for righteousness for Christ's sake. I wanted to escape from the evil effects of my sins in my physical life, but I do not specially recollect any desire to seek deliverance from all my sinful nature. Conversion had no special meaning to me. I entered the home hoping that I would escape from drink, recover good health and get back to my family. I spent two weeks in the home, from the 24th of May to the 7th of June, under the quieting influences of religious meetings and bodily and mental rest. . . I did not make any special effort towards conversion; I could not understand just what faith meant. Yet I enjoyed the prayer meetings, read the Bible, sung the hymns, prayed morning and night; but there was no special sense of relief, or joy or peace. Conscience was blunt in a great measure. In the hour spent with Manager C. A. Bunt- ing, in his study, with the Bible before him, in the afternoon of June 7th, 1886, I realized that I needed a power from outside of myself, a power that could save. He offered me Christ's, and read John iii: 16, " Come unto me all ye that labor, etc.," and other passages. He prayed, and I also. By every conscious effort of my mind and will, I surrendered myself to the power of Jesus, taking Him as my Saviour, trusting His word, and committing myself as fully as it was possible by my volition, to Him. I fully realized that I had no other source of hope for salvation except Him. Yet I be- lieve that the thought was more to escape from the bondage of the appetite for drink than from the whole sinful man. I know that my heart was at rest, and I experienced a feeling of safety and relief when I voluntarily made what I called " a full plunge," and com- pletely surrendered to God's Grace. I think, however, that I thought more about myself and my deliverance than about God or His love. There was no convulsion of feeling, no tears, no bitter agony. It was a simple quiet act of surrender, followed by a con- sciousness of rest and peace, and a willingness to do and to be just what God would have me. Mr. Bunting questioned me as to my belief, and my answer was that I trusted all God's Word said. He claimed salvation for me and told me that I had received it. I sim- ply believed it. The thing I do know is, that so far as the appetite for liquor, tobacco and other forms of vicious indulgence is con- cerned, it was taken completely away, and has never returned to this moment, not even a suggestion or longing in the slightest de- gree. " Old things passed away, and all things became new." There was a gladness at the sense of release from bondage, and a knowledge of a forgiveness of sin and of salvation. The condition of mind, thought, body and soul may be described in one word- peace . .... I know also that there came into my heart an intense desire for righteousness. I gradually became conscious of the inward Voice, warning, teaching, guiding, making conscience quick and tender. 379</page><page sequence="72">One of the first experiences I had was within a year of my ac- ceptance of Jesus as my Saviour. At a meeting I offered myself voluntarily for service to God. Quicker than thought the spirit admonished me that I had wronged a man, and I must confess and right that wrong. I had an awful struggle with myself for a year. Every time I prayed this thing would come up. I debated with myself and with the Lord and tried to convince myself that I need not do this. I saw no way out of it, nor how to make right the wrong, as I was strapped with debts, and prospects were very gloomy. God at last gave me the grace and courage to overcome my pride and write to this man, one who had greatly helped me in former years. I found a deeper peace and a greater gladness than I ever had before. It confirmed my faith in the reality of God's Word, Christ's work and my own conversion. Moreover the Lord has abundantly fulfilled His promises in giv- ing me wondrous prosperity and success, and enabling me to re- store what I had wronged. I have learned to look to Jesus as my righteousness and sancti- fication. He delivers me from self-effort, struggle, unrest and self-condemnation; it is simply a life of growth by constant trust. K. (Age seventy-three, converted at sixty-four. ] I attended Sunday school irregularly. My heart went out to the pleasures of this world, as far back as I can remember. The deeper I drank of the sinful pleasures the more I loved them. I com- menced drinking and smoking at about sixteen years of age. Later, when my appetite got such a strong hold upon me, I endeavored to reform in my own strength, but I always found it a miserable failure, and then, how I would regret that I had fallen into those sinful habits. Then I would sink back into despair, deeper and deeper. I often wished I had never been born. I got under conviction the first time I saw the Salvation Army on a march. I was playing pool. I went to the door with the rest of the men to see the Salvation Army. God sent an arrow of con- viction to my soul, and for the first time I saw it as God sees it; O, how vile and black my heart looked ! I thought that I would give the whole world to become as good as those Salvation Army people. I began attending their meetings in the opera house. The oftener I went the more miserable I became; but I could not stay away- there seemed to be some unseen power that forced me to go, and so I went until I could endure it no longer. The night I went to the altar it seemed to me that it was a last chance for me. I went to the altar to give my heart to God, not a part, but every idol, my time, my talents and all. I made a full surrender of everything, and God/for Christ's sake set my captive soul free. The chains of hell were snapped, and I was a free man in Christ Jesus. My pen fails me'to describe the joy that thrilled my soul as I received the witness of the pardon of my sins. The world and all its charms, which I loved so dearly a few moments before, had vanished, and nothing but perfect love filled my soul to overflowing. I looked at myself in astonishment and wonder; my heart a little while before I gave it to God was full of wicked thoughts,--murder, hatred, de- ceitfulness and pride,-and now all these things were cast out and nothing but profound love had taken their place ;how can a child of God describe these feelings! I can truly say "the love of God passes all understanding." Praise God! At the time of my conversion my health was not first class. I had lived in dissipation for over forty years. 380 LEUBA:</page><page sequence="73">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. L. [Age fifty-four, converted at forty-four. Superintendent of a Rescue Mission. ] My parents were not professing Christians. I went to Sunday school only as I took the notion, and that was very little. When I was nearly eighteen years of age I went into the army. There learned not only to drink, but all the mean and sinful things that follow in its train. When I came out of the service I followed the life of a sailor, and later that of a bar-tender. My life was one continual round of dissipation. I had no desire for anything good, only, at times, there would come a longing in my heart for some- thing better. But it was soon over, and I would if possible go deeper into sin. This continued for about twenty-six years, or until I was forty-four years of age, when one day a lady came into the place where I was selling liquor and asked for the privilege of distributing tracts. I entered into conversation with her and be- came interested to such an extent that I called on her. The result was that I became sick of the business I was in, and gave it up. But I did not have any desire to become a Christian at that time. I still continued in sin until I felt that I would die if I kept on in the same way. I did not realize that I was a sinner, only that I was a drunkard. And I think my prayer was, " Oh Lord, take away this appetite, I cannot do it myself." It had been a long time since I had had a good night's sleep; but that night I slept well without any stimulant. And I praise the dear Father that I have had no desire to use them since. Ten days later I gave myself wholly to God as far as I knew. But with me it has been a growth in grace. I was very ignorant, knew nothing of God's Word, but He has led me on, and to-day I have an assurance in my heart that I am saved by the blood and kept by the dear Saviour. I do not know whether I have made myself explicit, but one thing I want to say: I believe that God took away the appetite for drink that night when I asked Him; but I also believe that I was not converted until some days after. I never have had that ecstasy which some profess, but I have always had an assurance that I was saved since I gave myself wholly to Him. M. [Age thirty-three, converted at twenty-seven. A professional base ball player.] Parents were not Christians. I received very little Christian education. I was an only child of parents in nice circumstances and received a very good education. I was petted by my parents. At the age of fifteen a religious wave swept over the land. I rose for prayer at a meeting and soon began to lead a different life, but did not continue over one year. At the age of eighteen I left my home and soon began to rink hard. Some years after, I married, but continued to drink and blaspheme, and go to houses of ill-fame as before. I sought for peace and satisfaction in almost every kind of worldly pleasure, but could not find it. I traveled as a professional base ball player made a great deal of money, spent it, and deprived my wife and two boys God had given me. Soon after my marriage I became an infidel; many of my relatives are such. As I saw myself drifting down, and friends who at one time would have gladly recog- nized and courted my company shunned me, I sometimes was al- most at the point of asking God to forgive me and make me a bet- ter man. I often tried to reform in my own strength; but at each attempt I found I had less and less strength. I signed pledges, made promises, and broke them as fast as I made them, until my health was impaired, my intellect affected. I became a wreck, 381</page><page sequence="74">382 LEUBA: separated from wife and children. Poverty stared me in the face almost,always; sometimes I would sell a chair or a bit of jewelry to keep the wolf from the door. For some time I was in the drink business with my father. On an average I drank forty drinks of whiskey a day and I cannot tell how much beer, but it would not make me drunk. I left that business and came to Passaic where my wife and children joined me. There I went in " good drinking society "-business and sporting men. My wife by this time had learned to take a glass, and my little children loved it. I sent them daily to the saloon to buy it. I grew more and more morose and gloomy at home; curses and kicks for the little ones were a daily oc- currence. Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the first week of October, 1888, I drank very hard and was very cross to my wife and chil- dren,but on the Sunday evening as I came home, I felt rather sorry I had been so bad, and told my wife: " If you would like to go home to Trenton on:a visit, you can go." She went on the following Monday morning. I slept at home. I had drunk nothing that morning. At night I thought I would not go out, and so remained in my house without drinking. Neither did I drink on Tuesday nor Wednesday. I spent the evening at home. My mind was quiet, and my health at the time very fair, having been without drink for three days and nights. Wednesday I went to bed early; I felt rather lonely on account of the absence of my wife and chil- dren. The house was very quiet. I had not been in bed twenty minutes before I became perfectly conscious of God on my right hand; and all at once I felt the bed dropping, or it seemed so to me; it was just the sensation a person experiences on going down stairs. It seemed as if each step took me farther and farther away from God, and nearer to hell. God spoke to me. (You must re- member that I was at this time in open infidelity; I had not been in church for ten years, and, for years, I had not had any Bible in the house. I could not quote a verse of the Bible, except, perhaps, "Jesus wept."') This night God spoke so distinctly that it seemed I heard His voice. He said to me, "Thus far shalt thou go and no further. You have despised Me and My Son. You have gone into the ways of sin and death. Now you are guilty and condemned." And as I lay on my back on the bed, it seemed as if every sin I had committed came before me. God spoke again as at first and added: "If you will turn to Me now, I will forgive you." I had not prayed since I was a boy, except to say sometimes, "God help me." I did not know what conversion meant, and never intended or expected to be a Christian. God said," Get out of your bed, kneel down and pray to Me"; but just at that moment it seemed as if the devil was present; I felt I could touch him. He said, "Don't you do it, you don't believe in God or His Son. Religion is only fit for a lot of weak-minded women and children, but not for a man like you; be- sides think of what every one will say." But God spoke again and said, "Now is the time; if you will come to Me, I will forgive and save you from going to hell." All the time the bed seemed to be on its way down to the pit. I thought, "Well, now it is just below;" I seemed almost to hear the devils shrieking; the very breath of the pit seemed to be around me, but my mind was perfectly clear. God said, "Get out of bed, kneel down and pray." I did not know how to pray, but wanted to. And the devil spoke so clearly that it seemed I could hear him a long way off: " Well, if you want to do right, go ahead, that is all right, but do it in a manly way; give up drinking and swearing, but don't asklGod to help and save you; you are so bad, He will not help you." 0, what a liar he is! But the good loving Father seemed to continue to wait at my bedside;</page><page sequence="75">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. and, I don't know at what time of night, I finally got out of bed and fell on my knees, feeling that God was angry with me. I just said, " O God, won't you have mercy on me?" Then I got up and went to bed and fell asleep. When I woke up the next morning I had forgotten all that had happened during the night. As I was cross- ingthe street to go and get my breakfast, a voice said to me, " Don't you remember what happened last night ? You had better ask Me to help you out to-day." So I said, " Lord, please keep me from drinking and swearing to-day, will You ?" and I went to my work. As I got out of bed the night before and knelt down, a vision came to me: a number of stairs looking somewhat like a pyramid, and be- tween each stair there was a passage of Scripture, such as "All have sinned and come short of the glory of God "-" Him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out," and many others,until it seemed as if the stairs,with Bible promises, reached from earth to heaven,and at the top I saw the blessed place, and God Himself sitting there. 0, how miserable I felt. This vision continued with me until the fol- lowing Monday night; during that time, day and night, I saw my- self a poor, wretched, hell-deserving sinner; for I had defied the loving God to His face. It seemed as if every sin I had ever com- mitted was constantly before me. That Monday night, as I was on my knees, all alone in the house, there seemed to flash instantly a light surpassing the light of the brightest sun. I was conscious of the presence of Him whom I had insulted, rejected and crucified. My whole being seemed to melt, and I heard Him speak words that at that time I did not know were in the Bible. He said," Son,thy sins which are many are all forgiven thee." It seemed as if I saw Him; I felt the joys of the ransomed in the beautiful City of God. It seemed as if Jesus Himself had come into my body and took full possession of me. I did not know, though, that I was saved, as we call it now; but I knew God had had mercy on me. I felt, and knew, I was a different man. It seemed as if the birds sang sweeter, the sky looked bluer. Everything about me praised God, and a sweet sense of His presence was with me. I had such a horror of the old life that it seemed I must obey God in everything. I have never gone back to old ways and habits; I have been kept by the power of God alone. To Him be all the glory. [ He began then to warn his associates, and to speak to them of the love of Jesus.] Some ten or twelve months after, my wife, a Roman Catholic,was converted, and our home changed from hell to heaven. In our work here we have some cases of drunkards converted without the influence of the Christian religion, directly awakened by the Spirit of God. 0. [Age forty-four, converted in 1883. A business man.] Born of Christian parents belonging to the Lutheran church. At the age of sixteen he passed through a "religious experience." At about eighteen became a commercial traveler and fell away from his former good conduct. He began to drink, and from time to time would get drunk. Many times he made pledges to abstain from alcoholic beverages, but broke them after a few days or, at most, two weeks of abstinence. For fourteen years he went on that way, though never falling to the rank of the habitual drunkard. He was not happy; his conscience reproached him with the slavery under which he had sunk. Often he formed resolutions to over- come this humiliating and degrading habit, and every time passion had the best of his determination. 383</page><page sequence="76">LEUBA: One Sunday, in Louisville, having company, he remained until 1 A. ., drinking and sngaing. When left alone he lay on his bed full of shame at the thought that he had once more degraded him- self. During the evening they had sung some hymns; now they came back with a crowd of memories of home. He was deeply stirred and promised God that he would never touch another glass of liquor. What distinguished this crisis from the former was the profound conviction of his powerlessness. Until then he had never lost confidence in his ability to overcome his passion; this time he felt that he " could not break it off." He had no thought of Christ, or of any Christian doctrine. He felt utterly defeated and threw himself on the mercy of God for deliverance, ready to do whatever He should command. On Monday he had no desire to drink, and since that night no liquor has ever entered his mouth. Since that day he has not had to surmount strong temptations. The following year he joined a temperance association, and later became president of a large " reform club." [Written from detailed notes taken while the person was giving me an account of his conversion. I have ~kept his own expres- sions as far as possible.] P. [ Converted at seventeen. A New York merchant.] He was from his youth surrounded by Christian influences and maintained a pure life. " When I was seventeen [in 1886] the evangelist, D. L. Moody, was holding a series of meetings in Brooklyn. A friend of mine, member of the Y. M.C. A.,told me of the work he was doing in con- nection with these meetings [visiting, distributing cards, and the like]. I became interested and wanted to go and see. During the week preceding the meeting in which I was converted, I had premonition that a great change was coming. I had a very clear and vivid idea of sin. Many times I tossed in bed and kept awake, afraid of the judgment. I knew I would be lost. The strongest in- fluence that drove me to give myself to God was the thought of the judgment itself, not the fear of punishment. I felt that I had no answer ready; my mind did not go further. For about a year before conversion I had been disturbed in mind and desired to be converted. During the week I speak of, I felt hopeful,while before I thought there was no hope of my being converted. I could not account for that hope. I began to feel more at peace. I think that this was due to somebody who, as I learned afterwards, was at the time praying for me. At the meeting the text was, 'Is the young man Absalom safe?' It seemed to fit my case. It became clear to me during the tneeting that all hope was gone; the thought uppermost in my mind then was that I could never get salvation.'" [ See continuation, pp. 334 and 335. ] "Since that day I never let a night pass without squaring ac- counts with the Lord." [ Taken down as near as possible as verbally given me by the person himself.] Q. [ S. H. Hadley, superintendent of the old Jerry McAuley Water Street Mission, New York.] . . . . . . I gave up my studies, took a traveling posi- tion, became a professional gambler, and for fifteen years rarely went to bed sober." He finally lost his position. "One Tuesday evening, on the 18th of April, 1882, I sat in a saloon in Harlem, a homeless, friendless, dying drunkard. I had pawned or sold every- 384</page><page sequence="77">PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS PHENOMENA. 385 thing that would bring a drink. . . I had not eaten for days, and for four nights preceding I had suffered with delirium tremens. As I sat there thinking, I seemed to feel some great and mighty presence. I did not know then what it was. I did learn afterwards that it was Jesus, the sinner's Friend. I walked up to the bar and pounded it with my fist until I made the glasses rattle. I said I would never take another drink if I died in the street. . .. Some- thing said, If you want to keep that promise go and have yourself locked up.' I went to the nearest station house and had myself locked up." In his cellhe felt the impulse to pray and prayed. The fol- lowing day he went to the home of his brother, and in the evening attended a meeting at the Jerry McAuley Mission.
