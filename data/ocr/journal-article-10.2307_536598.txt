Finally, the reader is provided with a synopsis and commentary (Wassen) which helps greatly to understand the main threads of the text. As for the song itself, it is a Cuna chant used for difficult childbirths and as such is an important document, for this is the first example known to be recorded from this tribe. Mu is, in Cuna belief, a female power or spirit concerned with the formation of the fetus and endowing it with all its functions. The song chronicles the birth proc- ess and contains, in essence, the medicine man's preparations, his instructions to spirit helpers that dwell in anthropomorphic wooden figures, their encounter with Mu in the underworld and their besting of her in word-fights and with cacao-bean smoke, the birth itself, and a follow-up treatment with plant medicines. All is cloaked in euphemistic and symbolic language in which the colorful conceptions and imagery of the Cuna are very evident, though not always too clearly explained by the authors. Wassen provides a number of detailed comparisons with similar concepts among other South American tribes and in four concluding pages suggests North American and possible Asiatic parallels. The whole is much more adequately presented than earlier medicine songs from the Cuna as published by Nordenskiild and Wassen.' The linguists may justifiably ask for accent marks in the native text as given by Holmer; the ethnologist concerned with Central and South America will find this an important, useful document. There are a number of typographical errors, probably unavoidable when type- setting and proofreading are done by printers to whom English is a foreign language. Few of them, however, destroy the meaning. D. B. STOUT Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York Gods &amp; Heroes. Myths &amp; Epics of Ancient Greece. By Gustav Schwab. Translated by Olga Marx and Ernst Morwitz; Introduction by Werner Jaeger. (New York: Pantheon Books Inc., I946. Pp. 764. Illustrated; index. $6.oo.) An English translation of Gustav Schwab's-to use the poet-critic's own title and spelling-Die schonsten Sagen des classischen Alterthums, which first appeared in I838, has been long needed. Pantheon's opus supplies that need and supplies it very well. Schwab's classic-for such it is-is tremendous in scope and difficult to describe. Its first half is given over to a retelling, rather than an exact translation, of the Greek myths and legends. The second half retells the two Homeric epics and a few related stories, in particular those of Agamemnon and his family. In other words, here is in digest all the traditional narrative material that formed the subject matter of an- cient Greek literature. More than any one other book, Gods &amp; Heroes demonstrates the great debt of all literatures to Greek legend and myth. Reading it will give any- one-except the classicist-a new light on the poetry, drama, and figurative refer- ences of his own and other literatures. It's a big book-and one that should be useful and enjoyable to everyone who pretends to culture without a truly intimate acquaint- ance with all the Greek classics. The translation, as the original, is in a language in- telligible to the mature high school student but by no means beneath the dignity of the highly educated adult. Schwab's work, as I have said, is not a translation. It is rather a summary and a 1 Cf. E.

A single myth as he presents it may combine elements from several Greek treatments of that myth. In his interesting introduction, Pro- fessor Jaeger describes Schwab's procedure-far better than I could-and attempts to justify it. In the light of Schwab's purpose, justification is possible, of course, but certainly no one would be bored and many would be helped by an inconspicuous ap- pendix giving a chart of the various sources drawn upon for the retelling of each myth or legend. And thus perhaps the specialist would be less jarred by the combination into one narrative-apparent even to this layman-of elements reflecting the opposite poles of sophistication (as in the Heracles story and in the Medea story). Though Schwab is not precisely a translator, his work has some amazing qualities. A reader who knows the Homeric poems even through translation will see that Schwab has caught many of their beauties and distinguishing traits. He has condensed the famous similes and catalogs (has even omitted some of my favorites), but some- how he has preserved their effects. The aphoristic elements are still present. Even that essential quality which separates the two epics and makes the Odyssey-for me, at least-a far greater work is here: a kind of tall-tale gusto, if you will. The Greek literary conceptions of tragedy, of narrative coherence, of unity, and of psychology are all discernible to the learned reader. But the greatest value of the book-for the sophisticated or otherwise-is that here is presented in one beautifully integrated unit the combined folk and literary narra- tive heritage of one people-a heritage given even a greater uniformity by the fact that no barriers divided Greek literature, religion, and legend (or history) from each other. From reading such a work, one will acquire not only a knowledge of influential myths, legends, and narratives but also a picture of a people that cherished them. One will learn many of the traits of the Greeks; but unfortunately, because of the pres- entation, he will not know which are traits of an earlier time and which of a later period. The aspects of Greek civilization that the reader will see will include: pessi- mism, fatalism, and a belief in a somber, dreary afterlife that explains some of the hedonism also limned; an appreciation of complex symbols, poetic images, and beau- tiful ideas and ideals; a life clouded by omens in dreams, bird flights, rainbows, sneezes, and every imaginable phenomenon; ever-present rituals, lot-casting, liba- tions, sacrifices; an interest in government and a confidence in aristocracy, in geneal- ogy, in family; a tolerance of extreme cruelty; a very low evaluation of women, who are treated as booty and are expected to change their affections at command; a clear understanding of the psychology of certain emotions; a complex of sex attitudes and patterns quite different from what ours is supposed to be; and many, many more. The folklorist will find much of interest here-though he too might like to have the sources identified. There are various motifs that recur in Schwab's narratives: dragon's teeth, strength derived from contact with the earth, the vulnerable heel, Aeolus' bag, to mention a few. Too, the folklorist will be reminded of other lores: there are parallels to Solomon's judgement, the desert graveyard of ships, the immortal's ascent to heaven in a cloud, Joseph and Potiphar's wife, severing death's bonds after three days, Abraham's sacrifice of his child, King Arthur's boyhood trials, and so on. Inter- esting to the folklorist also will be the explanations of the origins of snakes, place names, and races. He will even find a folk dance and many folk ceremonials described. And incidentally, he will find Professor Jaeger's introductory theorizing about the changing attitudes of one people towards its mythology very stimulating. Many other things in the book deserve mention, but space prohibits. A little must be said about the English translation. In general it is very graceful. There are a few shibboleths, a couple of instances of unintentional humor, one sentence which shows an ignorance of sports (a boxer swings his hands about to make sure that they are Reviews 447</page><page sequence="3">Journal of American Folklore still supple!), and several examp es of faulty style, but in a book of this length such are pardonable. The book is truly beautifully illustrated. One could wish for no errors in proof-reading (Pluto becomes Plato on page i8I) and for clean type. Once the Bacchantes become Maenads without explanation for the non-classicist, but there is a handy index based upon proper names with identifications of those names to extri- cate the reader from the few problems of this sort and from those arising out of the Greek fondness for patronymic epithets. At the risk of sounding enthusiastic, I sincerely recommend Gods &amp; Heroes to any young intellectual on his way to college without a classics background, to any folk- lorist with "less Greek," and to any reader who does not know Schwab's own delight- ful classic. WM. HUGH JANSEN The University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky White Magic. An Introduction to the Folklore of Christian Legend. By C. Grant Loomis. (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Mediaeval Academy of America, I948. Pp. vii +250. $5.00.) It is doubtful whether the miracles and wonders described and referred to in this book should really be grouped together under the heading of "white magic." It is now pretty well agreed upon by students of comparative religion that the term magic should be generally reserved for wonderful results achieved by the manipulation of a formula of some kind which is independent of deities and a related system of beliefs, while the term religion is being reserved for those matters and systems which involve supernaturals and the attempts to relate them to human affairs. The miracles or instances of "white magic" of which Professor Loomis writes definitely rest on a wider system of belief, are seldom produced by formulae, and certainly pertain to super- naturals. Strictly speaking, then, they are more properly to be considered religious phenomena. This semantic dissent in no way prevents a recognition of the merit of a task of great labor and scholarship. The author was sensitive to the fact that "the folklore of the operations of magic within Christianity has, been studied more widely from the aspect of maleficium than from the view of beneficium" and sought to balance this disproportionate emphasis. He therefore surveys the realm "of the willer to good, of the saints and of the good men of the Christian world." His sources derive from Christian biographies of the first fifteen centuries of this religion. He examines the legends of the saints, "not as histories or as propagations of the theological dogma, but as bearers of miracles." He is aware that the marvels performed by and through the Christian saints are not props peculiar to Christianity. He shows, for instance, how many of the same kinds of miracles are attributed to the Buddha, who lived 600o years before Christ. Consequently, he comes to the conclusion that Christianity simply made use of a continuous tradition which it could not hope to stamp out. "Old beliefs were reinterpreted, and the cult of wonder served to capture the popular imag- ination. Christian dogma could not reach the mass of men, but marvelous incidents were convincing manifestations in a thousand localities at once." Actually the immense number of individual miracles and wondrous signs reduce to an astonishing small number of categories, about ten in all. Signs of precocious in- fancy and youth, miracles involving one or another of the four elements, extraordi- nary keenness of the senses, unusual control over animals, divine foresight and knowl- edge, power over matter (the changing of food to other substances and other sub- 448</page></plain_text>
