<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE QUMRAN SABBATH SHIROT AND RABBINIC MERKABAH TRADITIONS The potential importance of the Angelic Liturgy from Qumran for the history of Jewish mysticism was recognised even before the publication of the first excerpts. An initial report described this text as a «type de liturgie angélique (peut-être associé à une forme ancienne de la vision de la Merkabah.»( 1) This was confirmed when John Strugnell disclosed a fragment containing the phrase tbnyt ks' mrkbh as part on an elaborate description of the angels surrounding the throne. (2) The strangely diffuse and solemn language was characterized by Gershom Scho lem as already containing many ingrédients of the particular style of the Hekhalot hymns. He was also quick to déclaré that "these fragments leave no doubt that there is a connection between the oldest Hebrew Merkabah texts preserved in Qumran and the subséquent development of the Merkabah mysticism as preserved in the Hekhalot texts." (3) Scholem's observation was contained in the addenda to a séminal study, one of whose major themes was the effort to demonstrate continuity between the Merkabah traditions found in tannaitic sources and those emerging in early Jewish mysticism. Since Scholem's passing, however, his intuitive judgment has been subjected to the scrutiny of critics who question the legitimacy of making comparisons between sources stemming from différent historical contexts. No vertical parallels between Qum ran, rabbinic, and Hekhalot texts should be pursued, they argue, (1) J.

(4) While we recognise the importance of establishing the chronological provenience of ail sources and the historical context in which they are found, this paper proceeds from the premise that the task of the historian of ideas involves not only the differentia tion of chronological strata, but the récognition of elements of continuity and permanence. In the area of biblical exegesis, the remarkable endurance of certain themes of interprétation is a phenomenon which the literary historian can hardly overlook.(5) Here we shall seek to demonstrate that certain aspects of Merkabah exegesis preserved in rabbinic sources serve as indispensable guidelines for the proper understanding of the Qumran Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice. The known fragments of this work from Qumran Caves 4 and 11, as well as those found at Masada, have now been collected and edited in the preliminary critical édition of Carol Newsom.(6) On the basis of her painstaking work, which involves not only the first présentation of new portions of the text but an effort to arrange them according to the sequence of Sabbaths, it is now appropriate to reassess Scholem's initial jugdment as well as to point out certain affinities with rabbinic Merkabah exegesis which now emerge. With regard to vocabulary and style, the more extensive text and convenient concordance which Newsom provides will make possible literary studies both within the context of other Qumran writings as well as in comparison with later Jewish mystical works. For example, the salient frequency of such words as rwm, qd§, pl', kbwd, hdr, hwd may be reminiscent of some of the Hodayot,Hodayot, but the numinous unarticulated syntax is unique to the Songs Songs of the Sabbath and supports the editor's impression that they were designed to evoke the feeling of being in the heavenly (4) David J.

Yet there is no reference to any individual's ecstatic trance or ascent to heaven, nor to the périls which esoteric tradition associated with such experiences. The description of the celestial realm, though apparently perceived as one of the mysteries (rzym), is phrased from the perspective of a plurality of human observers. Newsom terms the text «quasi-mystical»."(7) We would prefer to suggest that it represents an early form of congregational mysticism. The description of the hymns of the angels attending the divine throne still is a prominent element of the Y oser compositions which précédé the Qedushah in the traditional liturgy.(8) As we note below, through the numinous portrayal of the heavenly sanctuary in the Songs of the Sabbath, the human worshippers were transported progressively from the vestibules of the Hekhal, through the wondrously embroidered veil of the sanctuary, to the base of the divine throne, and finally to the vision of the Merkabah.Merkabah. The Sabbath sacrifice served as the climax of this progression. In her commentary to the Songs of the Sabbath and in a subséquent study,(9) Newsom has made a strenuous effort to dérivé the Qumran characterization of the angelic songs from hypothetical exegesis of Ezekiel 1 and 10. Since the original basis of Merkabah spéculation was primarily the vision of Ezekiel, this effort is certainly legitimate as a tentative step. Yet, it raises the methodological question whether it is feasible to attempt to limit a developed complex of visionary ideas exclusively to the médium of textual exegesis. Few would, for example, venture to try to contain ail facets of the elaborate Hekhalot mysticism of the post talmudic period within a purely textual-exegetical mold. In his initial commente on the Angelic Liturgy, Strugnell already spoke of the possibility that the increase in descriptive détail of the angelic realm may be due more to independently developed beliefs than a very tenuous biblical exegesis. (10) Thus, the interprétation of the Sabbath Songs is not likely to be reducible to a one dimensional search for biblical antecedants. The elaborations found in later apocalyptic or rabbinic sources may be of equal value in identifying motifs which may be found to have already emerged (7) Songs, p. 59; compare Gruenwald, Apocalyptic, pp. 155-156.

BAUMGARTEN 202 earlier. We shall now turn to spécifié illustrations of the value of rabbinie sources for the clarification of a number of obscurities in the Songs of the Sabbalh. 4Q4054Q405 15ii-16 describes the veil (prwkt) in the celestial debir as having "figures of hea[venly beings...] of glory from both of their sides" (m§ny 'bryhm). (11) The expression dérivés from Exo dus dus 32, 15 where the tablets of the Law are said to have been inscribed on both their sides. However, nothing similar is said of the veil. It is only described as made with artistic work with kerubim (Exodus 26,1, 31). It is in the Babylonian Talmud (Yoma(Yoma 72b) that this is elaborated to mean that the threads were interwoven in such a way that différent figures (§ny prswpwt), were seen from each side.(12) The expression m'sy rwqmwt pl' "wondrous embroidery work" in 4Q405 may indeed, as Newsom suggests, refer to this visual feature of the veil. Another wonder described in 4Q405 14-15 i was auditory in nature. The figures embroidered in the vestibules of the royal chambers were capable of joining in hymns of praise: rwqmwtm yrnnw.(13) Newsom has identified 1 Kings 6, 29 and Ezekiel 41, 15-26 as the biblical sources for the image of angelic figures carved on the walls and doors of the Temple. However, in biblical Hebrew the verb rqm is used for embroidering cloth and garments. In 1QM the word rwqmh is extended to ornemental designs carved on shields or spears. Yet the idea that such designs were capable of singing hymns seems quite strange.(14) In his study of Merkabah mysticism Scholem referred to the song of the kine who drew the ark of the covenant. (15) According to the Talmud the song depicted the ark as "girdled in golden embroidery" HMHwëQT brqmy zhb.(16) Scholem compared this with the hymn in Hekhalot Rabbati where God is described as hmhwdrhmhwdr brqmy §yr, "He who is glorified with embroideries of song." He also speculated on a possible Greek source, hymnos as (11) Newsom, Songs, p. 286. (12) Compare Yerushalmi Sheqalim 8b and Rashi on Exodus 26,1. (13) Syntactically it seems preferable to read yrnnw as an imperfect with the preceding rwqmwtm as the subject. However, the idea of the angelic images uttering song does not depend solely on this reading. It is explicitly indicated in 4Q4054Q405 19A: wSbhhw bdny ,lwhym "And the figures of the divine beings praise Him." Among other places where we would suggest the yod of the imperfect rather than copulative waw followed by the perfect, as read by the editor, we may list: 4Q403 1 ii line 16: yhllwhw and line 20: yrwmmwhw; 4Q405 23 ii line 12: [y]brkw. (14) D. C. Allison, 4Q403 Fragm. 1, Col. 1,38-46 and the Révélation 10 John, Revue Revue de Qumrân 12 (1986), 409-414, takes note of the idea of Temple furnishings singing songs of praise.

We now recognise that the root rqm was already used at Qumran for the embroideries of angelic figures which uttered songs of adoration. The veil was not the only object in the heavenly sanctuary which bore images of divine creatures. The Qumran Angelic LiturgyLiturgy frequently uses the word bdnym, previously known only from the War Scroll, (17) to describe figures engraved on various furnishings of the debir. In one key passage in text 4Q405 19ABCD, the figures are said to be inscribed on brickwork: [b]dny swrwt 'lwhym mhwqqy sbyb llbny [k]bwdm Figures of the shapes of divine beings engraved round about their glorious bricks. The editor notes that it is clear from the context that the subject of these descriptions is either the debir or the chariot throne. She further observes that the mention of bricks brings to mind the platform on which the divine throne rests, as in ExodusExodus 24, 10: WTHTWTHT RGLYW KM*SH LBNT HSPYR And under his feet a kind of brickwork of sapphire. However, Newsom rejects this interprétation because of one difficulty. In her words: Lines 5-6 speak of the "figures of divine beings engraved round about the glorious brickwork." There is no such tradi tion that I know of associated with the pavement under the throne; but the existence of images carved on the walls and doors of the temple, even in the debir, is attested in 1 Kgs 6, 2 Chr 3, and Ez 40 (though in these instances it is the wooden panelling rather than the brickwork which is engraved). My assumption, then, is that it is the wooden panelling rather than the brickwork which is engraved.(18) This assumption is, however, impossible to accept since it runs counter to the plain sense of the text. In fact the connection with the brick pedestal of Exodus 24, 10 is confirmed in the same context where we read: wswrwt bdnyhm ml'ky qwd§ mtht l ..., "and the images of their figures, holy angels underneath the..." It is also corroborated by the reference in llQShir to m'sy lb[n.]. There can thus be no doubt that the Qumran writer conceived of the angelic figures as engraved on the pedestal of the divine throne. The difficultiesdifficulties which the editor encountered turn out to be less formidable in the light of rabbinic sources. (17) See Newsom's concordance, Songs, pp. 396-7. (18) Songs, p. 296.</page><page sequence="6">JOSEPH M. BAUMGARTEN 204 We may first cite a very late source which, interestingly, still preserves in Aramaic some of the terminology which we have encountered. The Zohar depicts the four creatures of the Merka bah as engraved on the divine throne: דיוקנץ אלץ מחקקן גליפן בכורסייא ובורסייא גליפא מרקמא בהו חד לימינא וחד לשמאלא וחד לקמא וחד לאחורא רשימא בארבע סטרץ דעלמא "These images (of the creatures) are chiseled and engraved on the throne, and the throne is engraved and embroidered with them, one on the right, one on the left, one in front, and one behind, marked in the four directions of the world."(19) We note the use of hqq to describe the engravings on ail sides as in the Angelic Liturgy: mhwqqy sbyb llbny kbwdm. We have already referred to the description of the angelic figures as embroidered mrqm'. Although the Zohar refers to the throne, while the Qumran text describes the brickwork under it, both emphasize the presence of the angelic figures round about the throne. Interestingly, this is likewise stressed in the Apocalypse 4, 6: και έν μέσω τοϋ θρόνου και κύκλω του θρόνου τέσσερα ζωα "In the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four living creatures." It does not seem that the three-dimensional creatures in Ezekiel, who were underneath the throne, could be described as being in its midst. It is, however, possible that the writer had in mind the engraved images of the living creatures. (20) As far as rabbijiic sources are concerned, the conception of images engraved on the divine throne can be documented much earlier than the Zohar, though these turn out to be images of patriarchs, rather than kerubim or angels. A midrashic theme, attributed to Amoraim of the third century and already recorded in BereshitBereshit Babbah 8, 12, portrays the angels as taunting Jacob while he slept during his dream of the ladder: מעלים ומורידים בו אופזים בו קופזים בו סונטים בו שני ישראל אשר בך אתפאר את הוא שאיקונץ שלך חקוקה למעלה "They both exalted and deprecated him; they danced about him, jumped around him, and taunted him; for it is written, (19) Zohar Bereshil 19a; édition of Mosad ha-Rav Kook (Jerusalem 1984), p. 37. (20) A similar ambiguity may be found in I Enoch 14,18, where in the description of the throne one Greek manuscript reads "and there was the oros of kerubim." Charles took oros to be a corruption of horasis and rendered "and there was the vision of kerubim." If horasis is original, it could weli signify 'images' of kerubim.</page><page sequence="7">205 SHIRSHABBSHIRSHABB AND MERKABAH TRADITIONS You, Israël in whom I glory (Isaiah 49, 3), Are you the one whose image is engraved above?" The theme of Jacob's visage on the heavenly throne recurs in other Midrashim(21) and is also found in Hekhalot Rabbati:(22) קלסתר פניו של יעקב אביכם שהיא חקוקה לי על כסא כבודי The Hekhalot text goes on to describe God in a strikingly anthropomorphic image as fondling, kissing, and embracing the likeness of Jacob whenever Israël recites the Qedushah: אני כורע עליה ומגפף ומנשק ומחבק אותה דדי על זרועותי שלש פעמים The three expressions of affection correspond to the irishagion and form an apparent contrast to the three expressions of disdain by the angels cited above. In his Rivalitàt zwischen Engeln und Menschen Peter Schâfer took notice of this motif. (23) Yet, he cites Tanna d'Be Eliyahu, where the angels who object to the création of man are rebuked and told to turn their eyes to the Merkabah.(24) Schàfer construes this to mean: «Richtet eure Augen auf die Merkabah; mit anderen Worten : Kùmmert euch um eure Angelegenheiten und nicht um die des Menschen. »(25) Actually, the point is that the Merkabah itself bears testimony to the primacy of righteous man since it has the visage of man portrayed as one of the four creatures. Elsewhere in Bereshit Rabbah the theme is extended by Simeon b. Laqish in the assertion: h'bwt ην hn hmrkbh "The patriarchs, themselves, constitute the Merkabah." Consequently, the divine throne is depicted as trwnws sl §ls rglym.(26) The foregoing is a classic illustration of the anthropocentric tendency in rabbinic sources to downgrade the angels and even usurp their preeminence in the celestial sphere. We have elsewhe re discussed this tendency in connection with the image of the heavenly tribunal. (27) Basing themselves on Isaiah 24, 23 ("befo re his elders will He manifest his glory"), rabbinic homiletes (21) The parallèle in Babylonian Talmud Hullin 91b and other midrashim are listed by J. Theodor and Ch. Albeck, Midrash Bereshit Babba (Jerusalem, 1965), 788. (22) A. Jellinek, Bel ha-Midrasch III 90; P. Schâfer, Synopse zur Hekhalol-Hekhalol LileralurLileralur (Tubingen, 1981), Jt 164.

BAUMGARTEN 206 stressed that the righteous, rather than the patron angels, will serve as the judges of the eschatological Sanhédrin. In the Qumran SongsSongs of the Sabbath, on the other hand, the patron angels of the nations are, as recently noted by Qimron, described as standing bgbwlmbgbwlmbgbwlm wbnhltm, "in their boundaries and theirinheritance."(28) This in an allusion to Deuleronomy 32, 8-9, where, as we pointed out in an earlier study, the Qumran and LXX readings imply a correspondence between the quorum of the heavenly tribunal and the number of nations. Melchizedek is also mentioned in the Songs Songs as the priest of the divine assembly, presumably as its presiding angel.(29) The humanizing ouranology of rabbinic Aggada is not at ail in evidence in the Songs of the Sabbath. On the contrary, the angels are described as awe-inspiring to "mortal councils." In a tone of self-effacement the human worshippers are made to say: "How shall we be considered among them and how shall our priesthood (be considered) in their habitations? ... [What] is the offering of our mortal tongue (compared) with the knowledge of the angels?" (30) It is for this reason that I am hésitant to accept the editor's thesis that one of the primary functions of the Angelic Liturgy at Qumran was to lend legitimacy to the sect's priesthood.(31) It is the heavenly priesthood which is glorified in the Angelic Liturgy. As far as human worshipers are concerned—and this includes both priestly and lay adherents of the sect—their aspirations are fulfilled by merely being permitted to descriptively approach the splendors of the angelic realm. One of the valuable aspects of Newsom's work is her effort to identify the order of the fragments according to the sequence of thirteen Sabbath offerings mentioned in the headings. She has arranged the thirteen songs in a triangular pattern with the seventh Sabbath at the climax. Her reason for doing so is the apparent emphasis on the number seven in the 6th, 7th, and 8th songs. (32) However, she appears to attach insufficient importance to the progression toward a climax indicated by the contents of the subséquent songs. The song for the 9th Sabbath brings the worshiper into the "royal vestibules"; in the lOth he approaches the marvelous veil; in the llth he views the figures on the brick (28) Ε.

Although Newsom noted this progression, it would appear that her misapprehension of the brickwork as belonging to the walls of the debir rather than the base of the divine throne may have contributed to the neglect of the climactic sequence. The foregoing discussion may serve to illustrate how rabbinic traditions, despite the late date of the edited collections in which they appear, can be helpful, either by comparison or contrast, in gaining a better perspective on themes found in the Qumran writings. We should now like to cite an example of the converse, two Cave 4 fragments which may throw valuable light on a rabbinic Aggada, of central significance in the ongoing debate concerning Hekhalot mysticism in the talmudic period. 4Q4004Q400 1 ii preserves only the beginning words of the twenty one lines of the text describing the heavenly sanctuary. Newsom observes that the context involves direct address to God, as exemplified by the phrase "the beauty of Your kingdom." She also notes that the §b' ntybwt "seven paths" must refer to some feature of the sanctuary and points out that the term ntybwt is found in the Hekhaloi literature as a désignation for six rivers of joy in heaven. The discrepancy in the number of paths is of little significance, as may be seen from the source in Hekhalot Rabbati 8, 4, which merely enumerates synonyms of joy: (33) נהרי שמחה נהרי ששון נהרי גילה נהרי רצון נהרי אהבה נהרי ריעות משתפחץ רוצאץ מלפני כסא הכבוד ומתגברץ והולכין בשערי נתיבות ערבות רקיע Streams of joy, mirth, rejoicing, good-will, love, and friendship pour forth from the throne of glory and flow mightily through the gâtes of the paths of the firmament Arabot. What is noteworthy is the unusual use of ntybwt for 'streams' and the image of rivers of joy issuing from the divine abode. The image, no doubt, dérivés from Psalm 46, 5: נהר פלגיו ישמחו עיר אלהיט קדש משכני עליון A river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holiest dwelling place of the Most High. Here the locale of the benificent streams is the Temple in Jerusalem, the divine dwelling place upon earth. There is another Qumran text which alludes to these streams and shows a close affinity with 4Q400 1 i. In a recent paper we (33) 111 Babli Ketubot 8a ten expressions 0( joy are enumerated, including five of those listed here.</page><page sequence="10">JOSEPH M. BAUMGARTEN 208 called attention to 4Q500, a small fragment of six lines, which as we sought to demonstrate, contains a significant interprétation of the Lord's vineyard in Isaiah 5. (34) The following is the text, as read and translated by M. Baillet: 2 בכ]איכה ינצו ו 3 ]יקב תירושכה ןבןנוי באבני [ 4 ] לשער מרום הקודש [ ρ 5 ]מטעכה ופלגי כבודכה 6 ] כפות שעשועיכה [ 7 ]מכה ...que tes [mûri]ers fleurissent et... ...ton pressoir à vin [b]âti en pierres... ...à la porte de la sainte hauteur... ...ta plantation et tes magnifiques canaux... ...les branchages (qui font) tes délices...(35) The words è'èw'YKH, mt'kh, yqb TYRwëKH are taken from the description of the vineyard in Isaiah 5, 1-7. In fact, the flrst word in line 7 we would restore as kr]mkh. Moreover, while the prophet, himself, identified the vineyard with the house of Israël (5, 7), 4Q500 already reflects the exegesis found in rabbinic sources, according to which the vineyard was the site of the Temple, which was at the same time associated with the Garden of Eden. The phrases §'r mrwm hqwdS and wplgy kbwdkh are allusions both to the Temple mount and the fructifying streams in its vicinity {Ezekiel{Ezekiel 47, 1-12 and Psalm 46, 5), as well as the branches of the river of Eden which watered the garden (Genesis 2, 10). When I wrote the aforementioned paper, I was not aware of the links which appear to connect 4Q500 with 4Q400 1 ii, the fragment from the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice which we cited above. Both texts are formulated in the second person and addressed to God. Both portray aspects of a divine sanctum. The è'R mrwm hqwd§ of 4Q500 corresponds to the §'ry mrwmy rwm of 4Q400. Since mrwmy rwm is regularly used in the Angelic LiturgyLiturgy for the heavens, and is juxtaposed in 4Q511 fr. 41 with krwbykrwby qwd§, the "holy kerubim", one may infer that §'r mrwm hqwdi-5, désignâtes not merely the gâte of the Temple in Jerusalem, but that of the celestial sanctuary. We have already noted that plgy kbwdkh is an allusion to the streams (plgym) which bring joy to God's dwelling place in (34) 4Q500 and the Ancienl Exegesis of Ihe Lord's Vineyard, a paper forthcoming in the Journal of Jewish Studies. (35) M. Baillet, DJD VII, Oxford 1982.</page><page sequence="11">209 SHIRSHABBSHIRSHABB AND MERKABAH TRADITIONS PsalmPsalmPsalm 46, 5. The corresponding element in 4Q400 1 ii is the reference to the "seven paths" (àB׳ ntybwt), which as Hekhalot tradition indicates, was also the désignation used for the rivers of joy issuing from the Throne of Glory and flowing through the s'ry ntybwt. The fact that 4Q500 is based on the description of the Lord's vineyard, points to the vineyard or garden as a key symbol in the visionary convergence of the heavenly and earthly sanctuaries. This is borne out by a sériés of rabbinic texts which allude to restrictions on human access to the garden. We may first cite a late source in which the vineyard of Isaiah is explicitly mentioned: כי כרם ה׳ צבאות בית ישראל, ר׳אליעזר הגדול אומר כרמו של הקב״ה בית ישראל, אל תציץ בו, ואם הצצת בו אל תרד לתוכו, ואם ירדת לתוכו אל תהנה ממנו, ואם נהנית ממנו אל תאכל מפירותיו. ואם הצצת ררדת ונהנית ואכלת ספירותיו, סופו של אותו האיש להטרד מן העולם. "For the House of Israël is the vineyard of the Lord of hosts" {Isaiah{Isaiah 5,7). R. Eliezer the Great says: The House of Israël is the vineyard of the Holy One Blessed Be He. Do not glance into it; if you have glanced into it, do not descend into it; if you have descended into it, do not take pleasure in it; if you have taken pleasure in it, eat not of its fruits. If you glance and descend and take pleasure and eat of its fruits, you are destined to be driven out of the world. {Sepher EliyahuEliyahu Rabbah ch. 8, p. 43). Scholars have been perplexed in their efforts to provide a rationale for these restrictions. Some have suggested that the homily was intended as a warning against the enemies of Israël. (36) However, the identification by R. Eliezer of the vineyard with Israël is missing in one of the parallel versions. (37) In Aboi d'Rabbi Natan (B text) ch. 33 the vineyard is merely described as belonging to a man: הוא היה אומר אל תציץ לכרמו של אדם, ואם הצצת אל תרד, ואם ירדת אל תביט, ואם הבטת אל תיגע, ואם הגעת אל תאכל, ואם אכל הרי אדם נמצא טורף נפשו מחיי העולם הזה ומחיי העולם הבא. (36) D. Halpebin, The Merkabah in Rabbinic Lileralure, p. 94; compare H. A. Fischel, Rabbinic Lileralure and Greco-Roman Philosophy (Leiden, 1973), pp. 74-75. (37) Yalqul, Va'era 182.</page><page sequence="12">JOSEPH M. BAUMGARTEN 210 He [Ben Zoma] used to say, Do not glance into a man's vineyard, and if you glance do not descend, and if you descend do not look, and if you look do not touch, and if you touch do not eat; for if a man eats, behold he tears himself away from the life of this world and that of the world to come. Lieberman observed that the text was obscure: "What prohibition is there to glance and to look? Why is his end more dire than that of other robbers?" (38) However, Lieberman also noted that the saying was attributed to Ben Zoma, who is well known as one of the four mystics "who entered the Pardes." We should further observe that the restrictions on the man entering the vineyard show an unmistakable resemblance to those placed upon Adam in Paradise. The forbidden fruit, we recall, was not only "good for food", but "desirable to the sight." Furthermore, the command not to eat from the tree was exaggerated by Eve into a ban on touching it. Adam was admonished that by eating of the tree he would forfeit his life. In fact, in view of the prevalence of the aggadic tradition which identified the forbidden fruit with the grape, there are good grounds for supposing that in Ben Zoma's saying, krmw §l 'dm was intended to mean, not "a man's vineyard," but "Adam's vineyard," that is Paradise. (39) The talmudic story of the four who entered Paradise is still the subject of on-going scholarly debate.(40) In the Babylonian Talmud the story runs as follows: Our Sages taught, Four entered the Pardes; they were Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, Aher, and B. Akiba. B. Akiba said to them, When you reach the stones of pure marble, do not say, Water, water, for it is said: He that tells lies shall not abide in my sight. Ben Azzai looked and died...Ben Zoma looked and was smitten...Aher eut the shoots; B. Akiba emerged safely. (Hagigah 14b). Scholem attempted to show that the motif of the périls facing those who would enter, including B. Akiba's enigmatic warning about mistaking the marble plates for water, were to be understood in the light of the Hekhalol literature.(41) There the mystic is warned of the dangers confronting him in his ascent through the (38) S.

(39) Note, however, that in the sequel, hry 'dm nms' twrp npîw, 'adam was apparently employed in the generalized sense of 'any man' common in rabbinic Hebrew. This ambiguity also obscures the Tosephta reading: mh 'lyw 'l 'dm, "What must a man do?" (See supplément below).

Scholem also pointed out that the word pardes was already used as a désignation for the heavenly Paradise, prds qw§j', in the Aramaic texl of Enoch.Enoch. Moreover, Paul referred to "a man who was caught up into Paradise" where "he heard things that cannot be told, that man may not utter" (2 Corinthians 12,2-4). Ail this led Scholem to view the talmudic Pardes account as an intégral link in a mystical tradition much older than the Hekhalot literature. The critics of Scholem's thesis have tried to isolate the Pardes motif from ail mystical connotation. Halperin has argued that originally the garden parable had nothing whatsoever to do with MerkabahMerkabah mysticism. Its intended meaning can no longer be determined.determined. (42) Schàfer suggests that it was a symbolic criti cism of différent methods of Torah teaching. (43) Urbach distin guishes between the mashal of the garden which was metaphorical and did not intend any actual entrance into Paradise, and its application to Merkabah exegesis. (44) However, it now emerges that the mashal, itself, was already laden with esoteric connotations which were part and parcel of the ancient exegetical tradition attached to the Lord's garden. Since the afore-mentioned scholars share in common a preference for the Tosephta rather than the Babylonian Talmud version of the Pardes story, we may note that in the former the story is immediately followed by the following parable: משל למה הדבר דומה, לפרדס של מלך ועלייה בנרה על גביו, מה עליו על אדם להציץ ובלבד שלא יזץ את עיניו ממנו A parable; to what may the matter be likened? To a king's garden with a balcony built over it. What must a man do? Glance; only let him not feast his eyes upon it. (T.(T. Hagigah 2,5). The terminology and substance of this parable is clearly parallel to that of the version in Sepher Eliyahu Rabbah cited above. There are, to be sure, some minor différences. Tosephta uses pardes rather than kerem. The garden has a balcony over it. This is a visual feature which can readily be traced to the tower (mgdl) built within the vineyard (Isaiah 5,2). In 4Q400 and 4Q5004Q500 it is represented by the "heights" mrwmy rwm and mrwm HQWDè. Rabbinic exegesis associated the tower with the Temple, and it is no accident that the same terminology is used with regard to the précautions taken to prevent Temple repair workers from "feasting their eyes upon the Holy of Holies" (Middot 4,5). Yet there is a tradition which relates that at the time of the pilgrimage (42) Halperin, The Merkabah, pp. 90-91. (43)(43) P. Schafer, New Testament and Hekhalol Lilerature, pp. 24-35.

BAUMGARTEN 212 festivals the curtain of the sanctuary was drawn to allow the public a glimpse of the Hekhal.(45) This ambiguity may be reflected in the Tosephta text which permits glancing, but not "feasting one's eyes." Sepher Eliyahu Rabbah prohibits even glancing, though it provides for the possible breach of this restriction. That the afore-mentioned restrictions, limiting access to the pardespardes as the Lord's garden, were associated with the mysterium of the Merkabah is confirmed by the opening of Hekhalot Zutarti: הוי זהיר בכבוד קונך ואל תרד לו, ואם ירדת לו אל תהנה ממנו, {ואם נהנית ממנו} סופך להטרד מן העולם "Pay heed to the glory of thy Maker and descend not to it (the Merkabah). And if you have descended to it, do not take pleasure in it; {and if you have taken pleasure in it}, you are destined to be driven out of the world." Here we have the same terminology as that of Sepher Eliyahu Rabbah Rabbah and its forerunners in Tosephta Hagigah and Aboi d'Rabbi Natan,Natan, but clearly in the context of Merkabah mysticism. Of course, one must reckon with the possibility that this may have been a later adaptation of an earlier non-mystical motif. This is the view espoused by the afore-mentioned source-critical scholars who question the existence of a continuous stratum of esoteric tradition in the Second Temple and rabbinic periods. However, in the light of the available fragments from Qumran, we must take account of what now emerges as a continuous development of the 'garden' motif centered around the Merkabah.Merkabah. 4Q500 shows that the vineyard of Isaiah 5 was portrayed as the Eden-like garden, the source of God's "giorious streams," and the site of the "sacred heights" upon which the Sanctuary was built. 4Q400 describes the gâtes of these "lofty heights" as well as the sèven "paths" or rivers which flowed from the royal seat of His glory. (46) Since 4Q400 places the "lofty (45) Babli Yoma 54a; compare Antiquilies 3,6,4. (46) Mrs. Jean Jenkins has kindly drawn my attention to the parallel in Apocalypse Apocalypse 22,1, where the "river of water 0Γ life" proceeds "out of the throne of God and of the Lamb." The setting here, too, is that of Paradise as indicated by the description of the tree of life (22,2). The implications of this paper for the much discussed problem of the meaning of mqdS 'dm in 4QFlorilegium require separate study. We shall merely list here summarily the considérations which, in our opinion, can now be tentatively offered in support of the hypothesis that this enigmatic phrase may indeed allude to Paradise as Adam's sanctuary: The conception of the Garden of Eden as a sanctuary is already set forth in JubileesJubilees 3. Also developed there is the identification of Paradise with the Holy of Holies on Mount Zion (3,19,27). However, it was only after the expulsion that Adam began to make offerings. As indicated in Jubilees as well as Life of Adam and Eve Eve 29,4-7, Adam took with him incense (qtwrt) from the Garden to be burnt upon the altar. We may infer that prior to the Fall Adam's worship consisted only of obedience. It is thus most appropriate for 4QFI0rilegium to portray the eschatologi</page><page sequence="15">213 SH1RSHABBSH1RSHABB AND MERKABAH TRADITIONS heights" clearly within the context of the portrayal of the heavenly hekhalol,hekhalol, there can no longer be any doubt about the 'mystic' connotation of the garden parable. While we do not yet have at Qumran the admonishments about entering or descending to the pardespardes nor the périls associated therewith, it seems difficult to escape the conclusion that the rabbinic texts which refer to these are using the terms 'vineyard' and 'orchard' in the sense of Paradise. They thus give testimony to the rabbinic belief, already identified by Haï Gaon and affirmed by Scholem, that it was possible for living men to somehow gain access to Paradise and to behold the splendor of its fruits. The critics of Scholem have consistently accompanied their critique with certain methodological pronouncements. They have drawn a sharp contrast between the 'integralistic-complementary', or synthetic approach of Scholem and his disciples, and the literary source-critical analysis which begins by breaking down transmitted sources into hypothetically independent units, stu diously avoiding any comparison with what went before or came after. They have sternly admonished us against even glancing at non-synchronous parallels lest we succumb to 'parallelomania'. We shall resist the temptation to generalize from the apparent vindication of Scholem's synthetic approach here into a général répudiation of the limits which the critical analysts seek to impose. Suffice it to say, that the tree of knowledge bears many varieties of exotic fruit and one can hardly expect mortals to refrain from comparing them and classifying them in accordance with their kind.

Unlike the "sanctuary of Israël" which was destroyed through sin, the sanctuary of the latter days would be a mqdS 'wlmym "an eternal sanctuary" in which purified mankind would be restored to the state of Adam in Paradise. 4QFlorilegium dwells on those features of the sanctuary which recall Paradise: 1. It will be wrought by God's hands (Exodus 15,17), just as the garden was planted by him (Genesis 2,8) 2. It will not be contaminated by the presence of aliens 3. Only "his holy ones", that is the angels, will be in the sanctuary together with purified men. The concept that righteous men and angels will constitute the eternal sanctuary of the future is now documented in 4Q511 35,2: במזוקקי שבעתים ובקדושים יקדיש אלוהים לו למקדש עולמים וטהרה בנבורים "Among the seven-fold purified God will sanctify unto himself a sanctuary of eternity and purity among those who are cleansed." This writer has previously expressed himself in favor of the view which takes MQDè 'dm to mean a sanctuary consisting of men, that is the community.
