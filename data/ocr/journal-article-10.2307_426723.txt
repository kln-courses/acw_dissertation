<plain_text><page sequence="1">METHOD IN AESTHETICS' RAYMOND BAYER Beauty is, first of all, the fruit of an operative realism; no mystic doctrine can belie this fact. There is in art a trajectory which is magical and instantaneous, the trajectory described in the works of the master designers, which moves as if by magic from the object to the eye and from the eye to the pencil. Thus a sort of reflex arc, on a higher level, brings the artist to the attention of the layman and to the respect of his equals. Beauty, set on this reflex arc, is born. We must dwell for a moment on the operative realism of beauty. In all art objects lies the immobilized path of an activity. From this rises, as the specific trait of each artist, a feeling for lines which is his alone, a certain personal rhythm, and a personal confession of his artist's hand. For the hand is there; there is always a hand. The beautiful object is the sign of an action. This operative realism, which the artists of the Renaissance imposed with authorita- tive clarity, confers its features upon the world of beauty, imparting its own aspects. Furthermore, it may even explain beauty and allow us to understand it.... Aesthetics has had its approaches, but never its method. For centuries people thought that Beauty formed a philosophy. Men sought out, as the scholastics might have said, the being and the essence of Beauty, which thereby became transcendental. That was the business of philosophers. The assimilation of aesthetics into a metaphysics was inevitable. Metaphysics considered, in a single method, all forms of the Ideal; the Ideal in turn is nothing more than a realized Idea, Idea become tangible, Idea incarnate. Dialectic, the instrument of ontology, became aesthetic method. Aesthetics aimed directly at a certain appearance of being, which was, from a metaphysical point of view, Being itself. It was Being demonstrated, a display of the Idea, and a resplendence of truth. Beauty thus joined with all the forms of Goodness; the very substance of Divin- ity. In aesthetics, as in every other speculation of the Greeks, the axiological was absorbed into the ontological, and Value was absorbed into Reality. Aesthetic speculation began there. As in Plato and the Post-Kantians, this speculation considered Beauty as an essence, an Idea in the Platonic sense, and a transparency from the heaven of Ideas. It is thus that Platonism dominated all metaphysical method, down even to Schopenhauer and Vischer. Schiller made of beauty a liberty in appearances. Schelling made of it the harmonious synthesis of the Non-Ego and the Ego, of Nature and of Thought. Hegel made of it the perceptible birth of the absolute Mind. This method consists metaphysically of two movements. Its first is intellec- tual intuition; the philosopher finds the revelation of the Idea in a position of the mind characterized by spontaneity and irrestibility of feeling, but saturated with intelligence and even with rationalism. To some, such a position may seem contradictory. Kant, bringing beauty back from the transcendent to the 1 A public lecture given at the Sorbonne. Translated by Francis J.

M. 308</page><page sequence="2">METHOD IN AESTHETICS 309 transcendental, toward a play of imagination and understanding, measures the abyss which lies between the terms. This perceptive intuition, at least, permits one to give beauty a definition and to find its essence. The second phase of this method is deduction, which is an attempt to draw from an intuitional definition all that it contains or implies. This double step has given rise, in aesthetics, to the great metaphysical systems. One develops the implications of the concrete Universal, which is the object, by supposing that the essences are in the indi- vidual objects. Aesthetics began the day that Plato asked Hippias the question: "What is Beauty?" while Hippias still answered: "What is beautiful?" and gave examples: "Beauty is gold, a beautiful steed, a beautiful virgin." "See here, Hippias," answered Socrates, "I do not ask you what is beautiful, but what is Beauty." The problem then was to find the Essence, an aesthetics in types and models. It was necessary to see by remembering, to see the creative idea under the imperfect realizations, through the perceptible copies of the creative potter- demiurge. That is why reminiscence became an aesthetic discipline: one found by flashes, in one's metaphysical memory, the heaven from which we had fallen, and it was given to us to contemplate the Idea itself. That is why aesthetics was a kind of metaphysics of enthusiasm and a kind of dialectic of love. That is why Plotinus, as a faithful disciple of Plato, after having com- posed his treatise On Beauty, felt the need of writing a second treatise, which appears in the Fifth Ennead, on Intelligible Beauties: in which a philosopher's eye, by a twist upon itself, might suddenly contemplate the beauty of Ideas while dispensing with the objects of this world. That, also, is why the whole metaphysics of beauty was, afterward, only a corollary of the theory of types. In truth, the sensible appearance of the Idea, of the Idea incarnate, this metaphysical aesthetics, was then, despite appearances, a homogeneous aesthetics, seeking the Ideal under its incarnations. It advanced from the symbolism of liberty, according to Schiller, to static idealism in Schel- ling; it went from Hegel's dialectic of the Idea (a progressive disengagement of the mind from a sensible exterior) to the metaphysical basis of Schopenhauer's Being (an attitude of Representation which delivers us from the world as Will). In short, philosophical aesthetics, from whatever horizon it may come, always interprets Beauty according to the traits of a metaphysic and in a Platonic climate .... The establishment of aesthetic method dates only from the nineteenth century. This is not surprising: aesthetics is, of all the positive disciplines, the most paradoxical. It seems to combine all obstacles to the formulation of proof. As a science, it is a refractory one. Aesthetic method has long wandered without becoming fixed; or rather, it has had stages of development. As a servant and without its own doctrine, it has followed the pace of the surrounding sciences. Gustave Lanson once showed that it was the destiny of the history of literature to follow one by one, before achieving autonomy of methods, the doctrines and the vast syntheses of the moment. So it has been with the changing philosophies of nature, from the</page><page sequence="3">310 RAYMOND BAYER method of classification down to the theories of environment, dear to Taine, and down to the inspirational transformism of Brunetiere. These were stages in the development of aesthetic method. The first established aesthetics was a kind of psycho-physics, a physical aesthetics. Conceiving its object by analogy with physical bodies, aesthetics was considered, in contrast to the aesthetics of the philosophers, and to the aesthetics "from above" as aesthetics "from below." This was notably the step taken by Fechner, who was the first to dare to apply experimental method to the science of beauty. Fundamentally, his method was threefold: choice, production, and statistics of usual objects. He proposed for numerous subjects a number of similar forms among which one might choose; it is thus that in the problem of the proportions of the rectangle, the section of "golden cross-sec- tion" had the preference. He required after this that one reproduce, or better construct, those simple figures which were considered the most beautiful, begin- ning with the simplest (a rectangle, a square), in which affectivity and relation- ship alone are in play, and are not pretexts for parasitical associations. He carried his investigation, finally, to the most usual forms and proportions of the objects of common life (calling cards, picture frames), proceeding from these general usages to the formulation of laws of taste. The first trials, very rudimentary, of the three methods of Fechner, could not give satisfactory results. But at Leipzig, in the laboratory of Wundt, were pursued works inspired in the same spirit; and there was elaborated, bit by bit, a methodology whose theory was most recently fixed by Kiilpe and Ziehen. To the method of simple choice, as recommended by Fechner, were added at least six other methods: the method of multiple choice, the method of series presented in decreasing and increasing order, the method of couples of which one term was each time to be preferred, the method of continuous change, wherein, under one's eyes, were modified the dimensions, intensity and form of the object; the method of temporal variations, wherein the novelty consists in introducing, into apprecia- tion, the time and the duration of the experiment; finally and especially, the method of simple description. This last increases our knowledge of the subject which values, rather than that of the object valued. The sum total of the steps taken by aesthetics "from below" includes informa- tion on the mechanics of the operation, on the aesthetic typology of the subjects, on tests of beauty compared to statistics of tastes. But to what does this sum total lead us? Of what are we studying the beauty? Let us consider clearly the method of Zeising and his attempts-the attempts of all those who, after him, tried to elucidate the magic of the golden cross-section. One anxiously ex- amined simple and geometric figures in order to find the mysterious number. Under the pretext of a logic of forms, this meant substantialization of dimensions, making a thing out of them, an aesthetic thing. This meant, through beauty of form, bringing to life again a certain Platonism, minus the Idea, and a Pythagoreanism without its monasteries and its cosmology. Just as Weber's law had given rise to laboratory aesthetics, believing in the force of figures, measuring stimuli and sensations logarithmically, here appeared a preliminary sketch of a geometric science of art, based on an elementary consideration of</page><page sequence="4">METHOD IN AESTHETICS 311 objects, their measurement, the relationship of their axes and their diagonals expressed in numbers. But the objects of aesthetics are not simple, and this aesthetics was one of elementary things, rising with difficulty to works of art. Especially, by mere measurement, one never obtains with respect to the work of art anything more than an approximate and deceptive aesthetic knowledge, a beauty as it were merely approximative. Strange to say, in the most authentic masterpieces of art the magic relationship was exact only about to one decimal. After hours of measurement and long series of checks, one remained in a state of dismay, and the masterpiece retained its secret. At last it became necessary to compromise with the devil, set up results with an error of one ten-thousandth, and calm down the refractory ciphers. What aestheticians of this school forgot was that in art it is exactly the ten-thousandths that count. They realized more clearly, at each set-back, that the aesthetic object is not a physical object; it is not the one measured by Fechner. The old occult magic of numbers came back from afar to haunt this oversimplified dream of positivism. The development of the sciences of the soul soon imposed another method, and the third stage appeared: some persons thought they could found an aes- thetics which would be a province of psychology. Having failed as a paradig- matic reflection of the invisible world, all the more in that it was a creature of the physical world, beauty became a psychic object. Denying to aesthetics any element of specificity, they claimed to find in it merely the description of an attitude between several things, a province or sphere of behavior. This was an intimate attitude whose traits they did their best to distinguish. The truly aesthetic fact, they claimed, is a special activity of the mind in the face of things. It takes its place therefore, as a psychic prop, between other activities, and stands in contrast to them. We must describe behavior toward beauty in relation to practical and affective behavior, ethical behavior, cognitive behavior, and the religious attitude. They described its characteristics minutely: 1) The halt: the first aesthetic reflex, the first response of the individual being to suspend the stream of thought, not to pass beyond it, and to find oneself in the act of contemplation. 2) Isolation: according to the penetrating description of the German aes- thetician Hamann, aesthetic behavior seemed to be composed of abstractive force. Removing from our field of perception all that is not the contemplated object, with it we shut ourselves in and, becoining as it were aesthetic monads, we live an instant outside the world, like islands. 3) The meaning of appearance: our feelings, in the aesthetic sphere, lack reality; and the aesthetic object also, pure appearance, requires, by a deceptive formalism, that we preoccupy ourselves no longer with the contents of things, but solely with their aspect. 4) The intuitive attitude: no more discursion as in science, for now we proceed by soundings and thunderbolts; we are seized or repelled by an immediate impression. 5) The relationship to sentiment: for it is not merely true that the aesthetic attitude is subjective, revealing a basic reaction of the ego. One must add that we relate the object not to a concept but to a way of feeling. We must even</page><page sequence="5">312 RAYMOND BAYER advance further, claiming that this behavior is distinct from all others, because it restores, calming cognitive tyranny, the continuous bass of an affectivity which, under practical action itself, has not given up. Everywhere else-in perception, intellect, or practical action-the learned root of the psychic phenomenon is visible. In the contemplation of beauty, on the contrary, the affective root, offended and compressed, begins to rise again, and a more primitive event of consciousness appears. 6) These various traits of aesthetic behavior led us to the last of all, which seemed crucial. For thirty years, toward the end of the last century and at the beginning of the present one, the theory of empathy was spread through all Western Europe. This phenomenon of beauty gave rise to a whole aesthetic philosophy. In the beautiful object, and from us to it, is established a tacit accord and a completely affective mutual complicity. The object, in one sense, seems to penetrate us, flow into us more easily than others do, and fuse with us, as would a delectable drink. Might it not be possible then to conceive an aesthetic attitude as a strange phenomenon, like the resurgence of an ancient sympathy between us and the universe, so that we might be able to feel again in the thing, and symbolically like the thing; and to have feelings in objects. As if they were branches, I feel in my arms the sap of the oak, and the oak suddenly becomes beautiful for me. This is a psychic attitude of symbolization and an act of fervent synthesis, the effective living together of myself and of the universe. Beauty is a symbolic sympathy. Thus Theodor Lipps, inaugurating his sym- bolism of forms, sought with penetration and at times with good fortune the "sympathetic" contents of several hundred profiles of vases, between their strangulations and their bellies, between the tightening of anguish and all the psychic figures of expansion. Thus an interior mechanism explained the beauty of lines, psychic mechanism which commented on each of the forms of the world, giving it beauty as its double or as its shadow. For each body, an individualized fusion awoke the specific and mysterious activity which, forming a double to the object, raised it to the magic of beauty. But difficulties and obscurities appeared at once. Is it my sentiments that I infuse into the object, my anxiety and then my joy; and how, at that point, and by what path, do they pass to things? Or do these feelings rise from the thing, enveloping us in its power with a suggestion, and how, from this point on, having taken the form of the thing, can one find the mind, especially find it univocally? The aesthetician, reworking these analyses, wore himself out for thirty years; but at each detail, he arrived closer to a mysticism of fusion which threw over art an aesthetics of confusion, not an articulate doctrine. The theorists of symbolic thought had no doubt always seen that nothing is indifferent to what surrounds us, everything is articulate; and "we are always actors or spectators in the theater of the universe". No doubt also, under the sway of emotion, of sym- pathy and its contrary, expressive signs appeared in phenomena and symbolic signs in things. In this, descending toward a greater light, we are at the double root of expression and of analogy. Yet aesthetics became the last refuge of anthropomorphism.</page><page sequence="6">METHOD IN AESTHETICS 313 In the first place, art was being swallowed up without distinction in another type of knowledge. Far from being specific, and remaining as an experience of the Other, this ecstasy was merely a new name given to mystic knowledge, living together again. If they abandoned mystic union in its strongest sense, Einfiihlung, coming down again from the divine to things, did not become any the more determinate or autonomous. They were reduced to explaining at most, in the fashion of Max Scheler, one of the forms, full and privileged, of sympathy. Everything amounted to saying, in last analysis, that to feel the inspiration of art in any degree and bear witness to it, one had to become in- spired. Thus, plunging aesthetics all at once into the behavior of participation, making it henceforth incapable of discriminating the lower and the higher, one descended, in order to explain beauty, to an indeterminate Ursprung, inarticulate and primitive. This meant replacing discussion by symptoms, as if art, which comes afterwards, could be assimilated to prelogical and participative activity, which comes before. The unbinding of a phenomenon of civilization escaped the aesthetician-psychologist, precisely because he tried to interpret it by its root. Mystical union with the object ignored above all the object to be made: the artist became immobile in mere contemplation. The most authoritative and brilliant representative of this stage in aesthetic method was, without doubt, in France, Victor Basch. Charles Lalo, in our country, marked the other stage, the last of the avatars of aesthetics: beauty became a social object. Throughout the doctrine of Einfilhlung was an ambiguity and a failure. This was soon recognized, all the more that the doctrine of the sociologists rose as the last state of an externally imposed aesthetic method, surviving the other. The undertow came from afar. This dream of a sociological science of art, begun by Herder, had taken body in Taine; it built up and constituted, with the three factors of race, milieu and moment, a natural history of beauty. Beauty also served therein for the founda- tions of a human history, in group determinism and in that of peoples, and states. Taine, the ancestor, found in each society the work of art in which it expressed itself, with the inevitability and obviousness of the properties of sugar and vitriol. According to Taine, in each generation, beauty lived in representa- tive types, just as I showed once in the Saint John the Baptist of da Vinci. Civi- lizations came, in his works, to spin their art "as the silkworm its cocoon.)) This dream of an anthropological and sociological science was recently inte- grated into a more vast and strictly contemporary movement of curiosity, thus founding, with Utitz and the German theoricians of the Kunstwissenschaft, the new General Science of Art. Socio-aesthetics sought out the primitive functions and motives of art itself, stating all the problems of the origin of art, mixed with an anxious search for the social vocation of the artist. Art, however was no longer a specific activity, but henceforth a factor in civilization and Kultur. Socio-aesthetics began to resolve the problems that the Encyclopedists had raised for the human sciences. This science, in Charles Lalo, became localized in a study of milieux, a philosophy of art criticism, an evolution of styles, and a history of changes of taste. Its first fruit was to introduce relativism into</page><page sequence="7">314 RAYMOND BAYER aesthetics; to discriminate became its whole methodology. Between impression- isms, which lack causes, and dogmatisms, which lack cases, Lalo's method was founded on a refusal of universalism, thus finally doing justice to the chimaera of all dogmatisms: "Truth within a group, error outside it." In the second place, eliminating absolutes, and built on the fundamental relativity of all values, this science had the merit of at least retaining the notion of aesthetic value: let us admit willingly that art is above all a human science and a science of man him- self. Finally, the benefit of this concrete aesthetics was to save us definitively from diagnostic ideas, from the delirium of inspiration, and finally, from that of the solipsist. The field was henceforth free for an aesthetics authentically based on critical analysis, attempting to understand phenomena through causes. But did they really go back to causes? This method has thrown a great deal of light on many problems, though in an indirect way. Let us note that the direct aesthetic phenomenon was less con- sidered and treated than was the endless nuancing of its frontiers, surroundings and milieux. Aesthetics, in short, was being less explored than the exterior disciplines that are reflected in it. This method saw the beginning, ripening and rich harvest of all the para-aesthetics; or rather this method is the very place of convergence of all peripheral approaches to aesthetics. Its sophistry and major confusion consists in substituting a science of evaluations for aesthetic value. We are no doubt told that there are no values without subjects and without an evaluation that rises from individuals or groups: what would value be without a human community? We answer merely that value would still exist, as does the art of the archer without a target. Even if one admitted sociological occurrence, we would still discover, in that so called aesthetic science of opinions, all the characteristics and also all the weaknesses of opinion. The collective subjec- tivity of tastes and the renaissance of social groups make themselves the "meas- ure of all things." A sort of statistics of opinions takes the place of the masterpiece: this is the art object, not in and for itself, but seen through the subjects in which it is refracted. For the understanding that we expected is suddenly substituted a patient listing of opinions: the work of art, but with its false meanings, its contradictions, the richness and the rebound of its contra- dictions; the whole loaded, among so much gold, with the ignorance of those who are infatuated with it. For, paradoxically, in this erudite study, the work of art, as an inconsistent event, is at times worth more and at times less. I am con- sidering the multiple opinions: this is no longer the work of art but our images of it, as if, petrified and sealed up on its very first appearance, in its obviousness as a thing, among the indisputable stigmata of an operative realism, it could, in a certain sense, ever be anything other than itself: a rock of successful achievement, a performance offered, definitively saved from the tides. Subtly but in vain the youngest sociologists point out that tradition is never fully formed, but becomes precise retrospectively. Giorgione is only Giorgione when Titian appears, and Mozart, "falling back before Beethoven, becomes as it were fixed." But that precisely is the setting of the true price of the work and of its real height in the curve of evolution, and the calculation of a balance-sheet of values. The auxiliaries of aesthetics were set up, with sociology, as new sciences: they</page><page sequence="8">METHOD IN AESTHETICS 315 appear to be aesthetics; but this meant forgetting that art, once the eyes of history are united, delivers itself at once to the intuition of the man who can see. Kunstwissenschaft, as a doctrine, swallows and absorbs beauty among the phenomena of civilization, which in turn absorb it and dissolve it. Socio- aesthetics, as a method, lacking aesthetic value (which it seemed to admit), substitutes for values a stock exchange of values. We must dementalize aesthetics. Operative realism, before it can establish any science of beauty, meets at first a dangerous reef which holds us back. In the presence of beauty, there has always risen a mental aesthetics. We used to say that the aesthetic object is itself alone, and can be nothing else; it especially cannot be, at any price, a "mental thing," a mere pretext for our cogitations. Well, this mental aesthetics, this erroneous aesthetics, has been practised by all of us, it is universal; we plunge into it again each time that the mind relaxes its vigilance.... The aesthetician who picks up a sea-shell, and who infers the cause from its effect, has no other method, intuitive no doubt but reconstructive, than the exact and learned consideration of the fossil. Otherwise, the conditions of the beautiful escape us; why this has been rendered and that is lacking. The work is what it is, and it is; we can do nothing about it. We can no longer control its existence. By realism, in aesthetics, I mean that commentary which, having left the thing, goes back to the thing. The aesthetician is the analogue of the artist; but he is not the artist, and, in a sense, his action is in inverse direction. He sets up estimates; he does not follow the course of the river or of the torrent, he is placed below the dam. It is the misdeeds of mental aesthetics that we denounce, those rising from a certain false idealism. Art is tireless realism; open, like the spirit, it has the unique privilege of closing up on the mind like a thing. In the presence of the work of art, of the aesthetic thing, nothing counts that has been conceived; everything is perceived. In the work of art there is nothing conceived except the perceived; in the spectator there must then be no more than this. The first duty then is to a purgation by realism, to place the work of art outside its parasitic proliferations, far from untimely associations; to save it. One must purify oneself of mental illusions, set aside the pure concepts of understanding as dreamings of uncultivated men. But instead men raise "the dust of words," set on the beautiful object the specter of ideas: this is an aesthetics of phantoms. Mental aesthetics is no longer a metaphysical method, but rather the aesthetics of the common herd, and, at times, the aesthetics of the critic, which is to perceive in the object not what the artist has set into it, but what the critic brings to it in addition by way of immediate or fortuitious associations, reactive impressions, or ephemeral comparisons. The critic adds to the object his own anthropo- morphism and vision of the world. He tells what he thinks the object teaches; what knowledge and even ethics it conveys. The dream becomes a look, and this is the method of analogy. Mental aesthetics conceals the work of art: I describe something other than the object, but around the object. related to it,</page><page sequence="9">316 RAYMOND BAYER and of which it is the pretext. For aesthetic reality, which is given to me, I substitute a state of mind or of thought, which I bring to life: this is not an object, it is my cogitation. Certainly I can, like Stendhal, dream of something else while listening to a symphony; but at once I prove that I am not hearing the music, I am mentalizing and I tell my fables; mental aesthetics is an aesthetics of fables. The method of analogy is often the sole method of the art critic; he is an artist in adjectives. He sets into words his impressions of the aesthetic thing, on a blank sheet. This deforming symbolism of the work of art remains tenaciously the specific method of the aesthetician. The different and system- atic manner in which aestheticians operate must not leave us in ignorance of this common postulate and this common error. I should like to dwell for a moment on an example taken from architecture, the cathedral and its critical commentary by Ruskin, the theorist of The Bible of Amiens, of The Seven Lamps of Architecture. Ruskin is a technician, a man who has absorbed the science of the monument, esteems its texture, knows its arche- ology, as well as or better than anyone at his time. His drawings prove this, and even today bear witness to it. Here then, transcribed by one of the masters of aesthetics, an inspired zealot of art, one recognizes mental and doctrinal transposition of works of art. Ruskinian aesthetics has been called mystic naturism; it is, in any case, the clearest outcome of a certain idealism. As a reaction and a prophecy, it preaches the resurrection of craftsmanship, the return of object and landscapes to a framework of beauty, unknown to modern industry. For the future, it an- nounces the beautifying of the dwellings of the humble and the participation in art of a whole people. Taken as a major phenomenon of civilization, that was to be the fate and the goal of architecture. But if the arts serve to show the state of a people, the art of a nation is thereby a reflection of its morals. To describe its monuments is merely to comment on its spiritual bearings. Whence the first point, which is an ethical conception of the artist: adore, be humble, and exclude nothing, these three terms of the Ruskinian breviary go back finally, not to two aesthetic values, but to two virtues, probity and respect. Aesthetics, like art, is first of all an apologetics. The second point that concerns us is a religious conception of aesthetics, beauty considered as a symbolism of divinity. In his Modern Painters, transposing the theory of Hooker, Ruskin describes the prop- erties of beauty as reflections in the universe and parables on earth of each of the attributes of God. Aesthetics, like art, is a theology; and their naturism is mystic. One is no longer surprised, in the light of such premises, to see the strange commentary on architecture according to the seven lamps, these lamps which, according to Ruskin, illuminate its beauty. I should like to show you the seven- fold mental mirage in which the cathedral is engulfed. The first beauty of the monument, the one that makes it resplendent in the first instance, comes to it from the lamp of sacrifice. This lamp requires, first, that in the monument appear a characteristic rising from an action of grace; this trace suffices if necessary. The artist, as a priest (this might be the whole aesthetic commentary</page><page sequence="10">METHOD IN AESTHETICS 317 of his work of art) does a loving service to God for man. "Neither will I offer unto the Lord my God holocausts which cost me nothing." Here then is the first mental mirage, the art of architecture is a prayer. The second lamp no doubt brings us closer to the aesthetics of the work of art and proposes a method for us; this lamp is called the lamp of truth, signifying, for the eye of an architect, the condemnation of lies. Also that exterior which suggests solutions through the infra-structure or a false mode of support; which suggest artifice, deceptive painting of surfaces to represent some other material than that of which they actually consist instead of a use of authentic stones; or expedients, molded ornaments, perhaps machine-made, in which remains no trace of the artisan. By such a process, as the master decisively said, we have of the monument no more than "the sickly phantoms and mockeries of things that were." In this look at the texture of the object, there are elements of realism which I must point out. The art of the architect is a morphology. Do you think that henceforth you may by this evasion enter into the cathedral itself, into contact with the aesthetic thing? Do not be deceived: of this lamp of truth, in which the avowal of functions retains its propriety as aesthetic frankness less than as a virtue of loyalty, you will have no recollection. The third aesthetic perspective on the cathedral is the cathedral described according to the lamp of power. A mirage in which this new beauty, whose topical conditions are not elucidated, requires of each part of the monument some anthropomorphic suggestions of integrity, a human healthy robustness and organic fullness, in a general and confused symbol- ism of forms. The art of the architect is a mysticism. In the fourth aesthetic perspective, the lamp of beauty insists still more on the excellence of Nature, which must preside in the choice of any form. Having described the art of the cathedral as the explosion of an organism or of a vegetation, this view proposes for the art, as model and example, the most usual figures of natural objects. Among the forms of the universe, architecture must reason mystically from fre- quency to beauty. The vault of heaven requires the arch, the stem of the tree calls for the column, the vegetable kingdom demands the capital, that Cor- inthian capital which is "beautiful, because it expands and because it looks as if the leaves had one root, though that root is unseen"; the vault of Westminster is revoked by the spider-web; and if the lozenge-shaped Lombard ornament prevails in beauty over the Greek fret, it is because it is the image of common salt crystals, more familiar than those of bismuth. The art of the architect is a cosmology. The lamp of life then takes the cathedral into its light and composes for it (to seize it therein) a new aesthetic mirage; it gives its metaphysical meaning to the monument. The aesthetician, bringing one last footnote to those of the pre- ceding lamps, comments definitively on this aesthetics of analogy and of partici- pation: every element becomes a reference to relationships of the soul. The uses of outward forms are noble or ignoble in proportion to the fullness of the life of the mind which is in them, and of which these forms are no more than the petrified testimony. The art of the architect is a metaphysics and a spirituality; the art of architecture, finally, is a sociology and a history. The book ends with the lamp of memory in which the beauty of the work of art is measured by the stamp of tradition, and with the lamp of obedience in which the monument</page><page sequence="11">318 RAYMOND BAYER becomes beautiful in the community of the social group, and in the measure of cohesion of communities. The spiritual life of the work of art has its collective coronation; the monument was a pretext for religion, now it has become a sociological motif. Thus you read successively the theology of the cathedral, its rapid and summary morphology, then its psychology, its natural cosmology, its metaphysics, its historic virtue and its sociology: you have seven versions of the monument. And thus, everything is a metaphor, in an aesthetics of mystic evidence and predestined signs. I do not have the object, but its metaphors, the cathedral retransmitted for the multiple eyes of those who cannot see it.... Only a morphology, technical and wise, could have restrained the pure aes- thetician. Overwhelmed by meanings, the thing is no longer the thing.... Watch the sequence of contradictions and miscalculations. A few judgments taken from Ruskin himself show the error forcefully. The first: "Architecture is the art which so arranges and adorns the edifices raised by man, for whatsoever uses, that sight of them may contribute to his mental health, power, and pleasure": this is a flowering of non-specific aims. The second: "It is absolutely impossible to understand one art without speaking about the others": so that, in this mystic solidarity of beauty, the topic of its problems and the articulation of its laws by provinces are submerged in a lack of distinctions between the arts. The third: "The greatest of arts is the one that suggests by no matter what means the greatest ideas.". Note that here, not only is art no longer specific, but it no longer exists. The choice of its means was its very essence; it is lost in something other, hence- forth indifferent to the quality of its victories. And the last: "Perfect art perceives and reflects the sum total of nature, while imperfect art scornfully rejects or prefers. The duty of artists is not to choose but to be humble. Let the young artist beware of the spirit of choosing, which is at best an insolence.". Here we see the universe of beauty deserted by aristocracy, hierarchy, the whole order of values and regimen of validity. The above judgments are the propositions of Ruskinian aesthetics; they are the mystic end and the natural corollary of an imaginative travesty of the monument, they are its refractions and delirium. In short, these are the heresies of the mental method. This example must suffice. For present purposes, it gathers together the misdeeds of idealism. There is nothing astonishing in the failure and confusion of the Ruskinian doctrine, fruits of that architecture of ideas which cover and even bury the monument. This is because the thing of art is not at all, except in da Vinci's sense, a cosa mentale. And by taking it as such, aesthetics is neither authentic nor possible. The work of art requires something other than correspondences; it cannot any more be explained by correspondences than by philosophemes; the method of mental analogies was inevitably destined to fail. I note that it was, first of all, not a method, but at most a transposition, an at- tempt to render the equivalent of the monument in literary art, or, at most, as a poem; it is an art of poetry and of lyricism, a translation into another art. Hence I no longer have the aesthetic thing but its translation into words and into the palette of a vocabulary; this aesthetics is not even a descriptive science. In the second place, this method in no way clarified the aesthetic fact in the object, but, under a symbolism of human gesture, substituted for it the confused</page><page sequence="12">METHOD IN AESTHETICS 319 complex of values which precisely are not it: that is, moralism, and a sense of truth or of God. This is a development of parables. Once and for all the method of analogy dissolves the aesthetic thing in its mental equivalents; the thing becomes indifferent to beauty, and to the successful tactics of art. The aesthetic object is not to be found here. "The sculptor thinks in marble", said Oscar Wilde. Faithful to the method of operative realism, we now require other criteria for the monument, the criteria of the architect himself, no others; those of the technician-historians of architecture, Semper, W6lfflin, or Focillon. We are tempted to adopt, from the point of view of the aesthetician and as a hypothesis for work, the three theses proposed for the historian of art by Henri Focillon: the monument as a definition of space, as an interpretation of weight, and as a receptacle for light; for it is all these, immediately as well as for the artist. And what is of primary significance, each moument is such in its own way. As a definition of space, the aesthetics of the monument rises from positive families of planes, from the Mediterranean regularity of areas, from the Gothic principle of greatest length, from contraction and concentration, juxtaposition and cellular extension, the rigorous principle of symmetric compensations or the caprice of associations. It rises from a spread of elevations, a plasticity of volumes and, to consider merely the cupola, it comments on the immensely distinct aesthetic effect of the dome of Florence, the inverted and suddenly rising egg-shape of St. Peter at Rome, the formidable dome of St. Sophia, with its multiple cupolas, balanced in equivalent moments in the Byzantine churches of Constantinus Porphyrogenetus. As an interpretation of weight, the aesthetics of monument has its "lamp of power" no doubt, but it analyzes functions positively: as a positive function, the wall that supports the roof; as a nervous and affective function the column, and its capital; as a problem of function the buttresses and the abutments; as a function the solution of the pendentive and of the truncated arch; as a function, under the weight of the vaults, each arch and its mouldings. Every element of the edifice is functional, it must be and be considered as a function, so that the plan of the edifice itself is ordered and circumscribed by this universal system of active forces. A positive lamp of force, which describes only what is, and from which may rise an aesthetics. An aesthetics recognized by the expert, yet evident to the layman, since to the functions now correspond the visible systems of equilibrium: summations or thrusts, oblique bearing or load distribution, the false bearing and corbelling, the dispersion of loads on the wall, their grouping on the column, the alternation of weak and of strong piers, and the magic effect, over-bold or prudent, which surges forth from all that under our very eyes: the calm perfections of Paris, the flagrant stiffnesses of Amiens, the double collapse of Beauvais; these are positive solutions set up in aesthetic families, which are merely families of equilibria at play as classes of perspectives. As a receptacle of light, a point on which the most recent theorists of Gothic art insist so strongly, the aesthetics of the monument involves the study of methodic progress in interior lighting, from the parts of the several schools of the Romanesque down to the major evolution of the Gothic: the disappearance of the tribunes, which had become triforia, the triforium reduced and absorbed in its turn, drawn little by little toward high windows, and making of a gallery a single</page><page sequence="13">320 RAYMOND BAYER opening. A topical aesthetics fixes its look on the relationships of empty spaces to full ones, the proportion of bare spots and decoration; it comments on the science of the surface angles and that of profiles, the antagonism of the pictorial sense and of the plastic effect, the prismic decompositions made by the window on the stone. It takes account of the aesthetic effects of the arrangement of surfaces opposite bays, of their number and disposition, and their degree of opening, of the effects of light or of grey, of the receptiveness of masses exposed to direct light. It points out the glyptics of masses in a play of surfaces that binds and colors. The laws of materials dominate this whole art of the aspects of blocks, forming its ultimate visage: monolithic architecture, the dismountable fabrication of Japanese art, the restless thinness of ironwork, wooden panels, extents of reinforced concrete, striking in empty spaces, the modern structure and its aspects, in storied sections, in superimposed glasswork, with the dis- appearance of walls; this is a kind of airplane structure, architecture bound to- gether by open volumes. All this constitutes a gamut of aesthetic evidence in which mystic naturism has no part. Our monument now merits its definition as a monument; and it realizes its problems. Thus realism sees the edifice; thus is it seen by every authentic aesthetics of architecture, as by every true historian of art. That is exactly what the cathe- dral is; it has the authenticity of a thing, it is this problem and this object; it is thus that from all times the architect and the man of the trade have seen it. You can easily see that its realism escapes Ruskinian definitions. Let us therefore avoid translations of the work of art. If it is true that the method of a science weds its object, we should imitate, in and through aesthetic method, the endless realism of beauty; where only that which leaves an imprint counts and bears weight. To say thus that we should dementalize aesthetics, is to maintain that no comment belongs in aesthetics which one cannot tangibly illustrate by an act of the artist. No idea exists which does not leave its trace: each skilled act is inscribed in a perceptible effect, and that which has no effect in the object is nothingness in art. Beauty has this nature and essence, that it incessantly demands to be realized. Beauty does not exist before its operations. It exists in the total of its actions; it is born only in them and through them. I can therefore say nothing about the work of art, nothing really specific, except as far as I am considering an operation. Beyond this strict observance begins for the aesthetician the indispensable rule of silence: everything, when it has become invisible, remains subject to suspicion as pure invention. Mental aesthetics proceeded at cross purposes: in it the imaginary was sub- stituted for explored fact; and, just as I complete my own lacunae and the insufficiency of my eye by variations of my mind, the object, as a rapid perception, is no longer as it were a theme given for my conceptions. Drop your plumb line, measure in every spot, if you will, the penetrating height of inspiration, the depth of the waters, a whole art of poetic creation; but in this art of creation there is a real depth, a solid work of art is actual and present. Mental aesthetics is navigation without an anchor or plumb line, the mirage of unsoundable depths. And since there is a bottom that we must touch, nothing authorizes you, not</page><page sequence="14">METHOD IN AESTHETICS 321 even for the flash of an instant, to raise your anchor again, anywhere. I shut myself into the work of art, with it and before it; and, face to face with the object, I forget the universe of my thoughts. It has been said of this method that it ended up by suppressing sentiment or emotion in aesthetics. Yes, in a sense, if understanding and exercising an intellectual lucidity means no longer feeling. I know the "grain of beauty," the scar, the particular proportions, the "wart on his nose," as Diderot more brutally said. But is that not art? and is not its commentary, aesthetics, a commentary on the object by a singleness of reasons? To protect oneself from mental aesthetics means, in short, exorcising all the phantoms of the work of art, and simply seeing it. A reconstructive induction presides henceforth over this faithful history of the event that is a work of art; it sustains that valid conjecture of another event, which is the future of the work of art. Henceforth, the aesthetician finds in each point and even in each act the manifestation of the object and its reality as thing: he has grasped the aesthetic order of its conditions. I hunt and I pursue the idea, but from mark to mark, I go from one to another: and these marks alone are the active element of beauty. In art, every element is inscribed and requires that it be inscribed. Thus marked, an intention remains, for the forewarned eye, indelible; the learned act of hand remains forever evident, it is always per- ceptible to a sagacious eye. You arrive at the mind in arriving at the hand; intuitively, an operative panorama grasps you, you need only read it. "The sea still shows the wake of the vessel of Pompey." Here are the three interrelated warnings of operative realism: First: Reject all kinds of mental aesthetics. Second: Ask yourself, in aesthetics, only about the problems that arise. The artist really poses his problems, his true problems, only at the moment of the object and in the object. Third: The art obeect is a visible thing; comment only on what is visible. Let us set aside the demon of ideas and consider the work of art instead; let us consider its specific traits. The source and leaven of all aspiration, art is the contrary of an aspiration; the work of art is an object in this world. It has a definition in space and takes its coordinates from time; it is a combination of aspects and a concretion, its reality is precisely in its appearance. Taking its place in the perceptible world, the work of art, an operative thing, imposes itself upon us; it is what it is, for eternity. You can make of it, before its birth, or after its birth, the object of contemplation; but, forever set, it is the fixed product of a creation. One can say of it, even more than of languages, that it is, forever, mind petrified. Its value lies in its uniqueness: the aesthetic object is singular; its originality is not its master trait but its very condition of existence. Every work of art is an appearance, according to the views of Von Hartmann; that is actually why it seems to rise solely from our contemplative life. That still life, orange or peach that we might contemplate is in its essence a square canvas, a surface without thickness; go behind the painting and there is nothing; which is as much as to say that the object is seen as in a mirror. Thus aesthetics is a science of aspects as well as of the individual. Of the object must be made an art of physiognomy; yet the object must be explained as a phenomenon. While</page><page sequence="15">322 RAYMOND BAYER at times we were groping toward pure perceptualism, at times toward pure con- ceptualism, in our method we were moving from contemplation to analogy or from analogy to metaphysics; but art is active, specific and phenomenal. Aesthetics is a science of aspects and a concrete science; it is also a discipline of confluences, of technical and tectonic results; an interpretative, quantitative analysis of complexes. Its object is above all the interpretation of an appearance; hence I have compared it to the sciences of images. This aesthetics I should like to name technical or even critical, did I not prefer the word operative. On these last pages I should like to outline to you a portrait and a definition. This will amount to raising no more than one or two corners of the veil, yet herein will be opened two perspectives on the requirements of our science and the nature of its object. The portrait is that of competency or excellence; the idea I hope to define is that of effects in art. First of all competency, the competent or excellent man according to Socrates and especially Aristotle. He is the man we consult in matters of morals, who knows how to prescribe and diagnose, who possesses a certain tact, a sure flair for ethical things, and a natural rectitude as a gift. He is the sampler of virtues and qualities, the qualifier, who is called a specialist. You realize, within Aristotle's method, the importance of competency for rectitude of morals and for determining just judgment; whence beauty, which lives on competencies. For the artist is a specialist in power to do, as art connoisseurs are specialists in knowing. Art occurs among experts; the opinion of experts is that of a particular experience. The artist, who knows cases, shuts himself into his world of sensa- tions, which is either color, or sound, or words, in a limited and specific universe that he has discovered. There he finds himself, as it were, in the strangeness of familiar things. Within this universe he proceeds by ever deeper soundings, within himself, but operated on this universe; the instantaneous movement of a long knowledge guides his hand. His movements have then an astonishing concision and know inexplicable short cuts to success, which show, in the unique translations he proposes, a unique brevity. He remains within the world of his own operations; he is a master of technical revolutions. The same in the case of the critic or the amateur; he also discovers and progresses by integration. The competent man corresponds by his knowledge to the power of the poet. Thus the aesthetician, who also knows cases, becomes the analogue of the artist, whom he accompanies in his penetrations. He knows the crop, the year; he sees the "value" and the "touch". Though new in its directions, his judgment is a sequence of preceding judgments. His judgment turns inward, it is a schedule of his assets, which resumes a whole experience, concentrates a past, totals in- telligence into a verdict. These are the prolegomena to his science of quality. Let us go directly to the greatest successes of integration; nothing can be more revealing for our study of competency than the notion of profundity in art. Consider the innovating subtlety, the penetration of eye and palette, in Watteau, Picasso, or Titian. In profound things, there is an element both very distant and very close, an element that comes back from very far, and was none the less very near. We did not know that we knew; the realization opens vistas on another world: the real one, yet the hidden one, a dissimulation, yet an evidence. It is</page><page sequence="16">METHOD IN AESTHETICS 323 this gift which led Clemenceau to say of his friend the painter Claude Monet: "He is a retina." In order to explain this depth, though it is evident, immediate, we should, in another domain, propose as a study in aesthetics the series of fifths used by Debussy, the indefinite superposition of thirds in Ravel, the brilliance of a six-four chord in Faur6; or again the building up of rhythmic perspectives in Stravinsky or the disintegration of rhythm in Bela Bartok. In art, technical depth thus lies in the hands of the competent and inspired man. Depth is, in a single successful act, the very new and the very learned; which means that, at the summit of art, competency resides at the very center of the problem. Also at the center of the problem is the effect. There is a disparaging meaning in the word effect: one it can take in baroque periods or in any romanticism. You might expect here to find a certain view of art in black and white, as was the case with the psuedo-mediaeval lithographs of the days of Viollet-le-Duc or of the false Gothic, as it happened for the Rhine sketches of Hugo. To quote a critic of 1830, effect, in this signification, is a deep curtsey to "Our Lady of St. Effect." Even this exaggerated meaning has the advantage of showing, by a caricature, that there is in every art object a certain realization of violent atten- tion, perhaps not spontaneous, but provoked. The harmony of balances, the placing of a hiatus, returns and absolute beginnings are expressed, thanks to the art object, in your sensitive mechanism, by hypnoses and in reawakenings. But there is a second meaning for the word, far more penetrating and authentic, as when one speaks of a pictorial effect, a theatrical effect, or an orchestral effect. Let us consider what this means. We are now in the very heart of operative realism. The effect enters that new kind of reflex arc, in which the object appears as the suddenly fixed path of an activity. From energy of all kinds to the work of art, the latter is built up, petrified. There remains of it a unique picture of effects, which sets to work when, once it has arrived in the art gallery, the amateur recognizes from afar, in a simple design, his beloved masters: "It is a Fragonard," he says. "It is a Pater." The work of art looms up in front of him, like a singular distribution of accents and economies, a scratching on paper, a certain expenditure of creative work and of meditative recapture, a spreading of mad fancies and of repentance, which constitute a signature and a unique record of inspired action. In the hypnosis or the rhythmical reawakening felt by the spectator exposed to beauty, here, in this schematic picture of effects, the magic of art operates. Thus, first of all, the effect is a certain technique of position, since every object is this reality and presents this rhythmic picture in space or time, as for a new type of astrological conjunction. Thus the work of art achieves its destiny; the object is the constellation of its effects. Furthermore, the effect is a certain emphasis, a certain accent, a second rising and a second feeling, a strategic occupation of key positions; not merely a certain position, but also the taking of that position. Finally, the effect is the consequence of a certain meaningful act, a fact that our painters of the eighteenth century, for instance, felt so well; the value of a strong touch of light, the sifted effect of a broken tone, the ways of shading, the transparency of a glazing, especially the touch, the flourish of the individual, the comma or impasto, the "lightness of the tool" mentioned by the</page><page sequence="17">324 RAYMOND BAYER Count of Caylus, the last thing delivered, the down of the plum or the peach- what Rubens, after having had his students execute his painting, does not leave for his students, that last final touch that saves the whole. All this is accounted for by the contrivance, the perceptible shortcuts of a mind given to schematiza- tion, and by a certain spontaneous and sacred stratagem, a very venerable one, a magical art. In this magical attitude, we are at the opposite pole from the mysticism we mentioned a while ago, the sorcerer's art; but even here, once more science would stumble, technical analysis should definitively bow, at least at the summits, just as discriminatory intelligence likewise bowed before the invasion of the mystic. The conjunction of certain aspects passing through the work of art is the aesthetic object of the work of art; this synthesis of appearances constitutes its reality. The work of art is there, with its effects, it is the thing reduced to its operations. The fine work of Revault d'Allonnes on schematization, interrupted long ago, taught us to consider, in representation, an intermediary psychic zone, which Kant almost alone, and after him Bergson, had perceived. Well, this phenomenon of schematization, which goes beyond the image, is loaded with a psychic condensation. It proceeds by sudden and striking syntheses and, pre- cisely, by a series of effects. The effect, which is spiritual, is the proper language of schematization. If all art is a transfiguration and not a mimesis, that is the reason: one sees precisely that art is the result of a schematization. If finally the aesthetic object is from a positivistic standpoint, only the product sum of all its "effects", the reason is that art itself is only the brightest province of schema- tistic thought. Such perceptive convergencies compose distinct worlds in art. Their typology presides at the establishment of categories of beauty, that ele- vated relationship of internal energies to an image, that is sublimity, grace, baroqueness, tragedy, the whole, real, aesthetic universe. Above singular things, there is a structured reality of the aesthetic world which is attained by schematic convergencies. Operative realism, whose methodological warnings I have proposed to you today, ends as an aesthetics regarded as the general physics of aspects, which might be a knowledge of the perceptible world of art. Yet even so, let us not forget about the interpretation of a landscape by a specialist, the operation of hidden underlying forces, the relationship of internal techniques to an image. All these investigations teach a lesson and have a principle, that of a motivated and causal interpretation of their object. Standing in radical contrast to a mental aesthetics, this physics of art, precise and specific, must be attempted. Aesthetics is a science of effects that rise from certain causes.</page></plain_text>
