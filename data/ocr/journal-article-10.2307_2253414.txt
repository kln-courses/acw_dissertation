<plain_text><page sequence="1">Oxford Books for Students Hegel's Logic Being Part One of the Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences (1830) Translated by William Wallace with a foreword by J. N. Findlay The Logic provides in its opening chapters the best introduction to Hegel's mature system, and Wallace's remains one of the most felicitous of Hegelian translations. It covers the Zusatze added by Leopold von Henning and based on lecture-notes by Hegel and his students, which include many memorable Hegelian utterances. Professor Findlay has corrected some minor errors in the translation, and in his foreword explains the logical pattern of the work and its place in Hegel's system. Third edition ?6 paper covers ?2 Hume's Enquiries Concerning Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals Edited by L. A. Selby-Bigge; revised text and notes by P. H. Nidditch For this new edition Professor Nidditch has corrected the wording of Selby-Bigge's text in a number of places where he found this to diverge from the 1777 edition or where the 1777 edition itself contains error. He has also added a section of notes explaining outmoded or ambiguous expressions, technical terms, allusions, and proper names. The new edition retains Selby-Bigge's introduction and analytic index. Third edition ?4 paper covers ?1.35 Causation and Conditionals Edited by Ernest Sosa The opening essays represent attempts to explain causation in terms of necessary or sufficient conditions or discuss attempts of this sort. The difficulties encountered have led others to try new directions, and these also are represented: some postpone the analysis of causation; others supplement conditionality with a further notion; others try not to rely at all on conditionality or lawfulness. Clarifying conditionality is a new problem but it, too, is the subject of a vast literature from which several selections are made. The volume closes with attempts to explain both conditionality and causation within a framework of modal semantics.

YATES Honorary Fellow of the Warburg Institute, University of London In the Sunday Times, George Steiner wrote that Astraea is 'a body of work which combines amazing erudition with a breadth of intuition and innovation as urgent as that of any of the great master-historians . . . The importance of Miss Yates's achievement is that she has seen and proved unity in the bewildering variety and complexity of expressive forms through which men of the late Middle Ages, of the Renaissance, and of the Baroque com- municated their view of the world'. 94 illustrations ?6.95 Knowledge and the Curriculum A Collection of Philosophical Papers PAUL H.

Essential features are successively isolated and their necessity demonstrated in the course of a single, extended argument. Topics to which the author pays particular attention are 'time', 'perception', 'private languages','space', and 'action'. ?4.25 Providence Lost A Critique of Darwinism Richard Spilsbury Is evolution yet intelligible? Is man one amongst the animals, distinguished only by the supremacy he has gained by cultural and genetic development? Or is he unique, a creature apart? This book challenges the scientific dogmas of the age. Mr Spilsbury believes that contemporary academic philosophy is too narrow, and he therefore takes up the major issues it leaves aside, concerning the ultimate randomness or purposiveness of human life. ?3.50 Hegel's Aesthetics Lectures on Fine Art Translated by T. M. Knox From ancient Indian epics and Homer to Camoens, from Ossian to Goethe and Schiller, from the pyramids to Gothic cathedrals, Hegel surveyed in these lectures the history of art, criticized major works, and probed their meaning and significance. The abiding strength of his survey consists in the plenitude of examples, which cannot fail to interest and arouse reflections in lovers and historians of art. Two volumes ?30 A Review of the Principal Questions in Morals Richard Price Edited by D. D. Raphael The Review of Morals (1758) is notable for its critique of the empiricist theory of knowledge and of naturalistic and utilitarian ethics. Price's arguments, like those of Hume and Reid, often clarify issues that are still a live subject of controversy. Professor Raphael's edition (1948) stimulated a renewed interest in Price's ethical thought, but has been unavailable since 1961. This reprint corrects a few errors and adds a new preface and bibliography. ?5.75 Oxford PRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS. ABERDEEN</page></plain_text>
