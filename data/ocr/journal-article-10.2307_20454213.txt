Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 2008. $99.95. xxvi+471 pp., hard cover. ISBN 978-1584-8841-7-0. The book under review represents an exten sive and detailed account of a vast scope of topics related to the material concepts that constitute an indispensable part of modern mechanics of deformable bodies. As seen in its title, the book treats materials as random formations, and the study of their perfor mance on different scales reveals a great va riety of significant effects. Altogether this has grown into a vast discipline, and the author's intent was not only to embrace its wide-ranging content, but also to create a text suitable for an advanced study. For this reason, each chapter is accompanied by a number of problems, some of them quite nontrivial. The exposition starts from afar with a chapter introducing some basic notions of geometric probability theory. In the same chapter, the reader learns about point fields, random fibers, and tessellations viewed as the base elements that eventually combine to work toward adequate probabilistic de scriptions of various material structures. Most of the language and terminology in troduced at this stage are used throughout the entire book. The second chapter refers to the analy sis of random processes and fields via the relevant probabilistic characteristics. Some fundamental notions, such as those of a ran dom tensor field, the mean field equations, and ergodicity, are discussed at some length and then applied later in the book. The following two chapters are about lat tices assembled from structural elements like strings or beams. Here we find the ma terial equations appearing as a result of "smearing out" the properties of elemen tary cells built from the original elements with the observance of various geometries of the structural networks. The base for such smearing is the requirement that the energy of a structural element and that of a representative volume element of a contin uous reference medium be equal. Attention is focused on some disagreement between the finite difference method and the struc tural network schemes due to the difference in interpretation of the node-node connec tions in both approaches. Generally, the presentation in these chapters is specifically computer-oriented. Special mention should be made of the Michell trusses and optimality discussed at the end of Chapter 3 and later in Chapter 8. This topic is related to so-called topology optimization, or, more generally, to opti mal material layout. The reviewer sticks to the opinion that an important conceptual argument is missing here. The reason why the Michell truss-like continuum provides a minimum of weight is never explained in the text. Even more importantly, the ap pearance of composites assembled from the original constituents in the optimal layout produced via elliptic systems also remains unexplained, though this appearance is cru cial. The key reason for it is rooted in the fundamental requirement of optimality. To put it in "anthropomorphic" language, an optimal heterogeneous body wants to see itself assembled (as a whole or at least in part) from its constituents necessarily dis tributed on a microscale. In many typical cases, zero is a lower bound for the size of the inclusions in an optimal assembly! Such a formation, rigorously speaking, may be perceived only as asymptotic. This fact has been known since the late 1960s, and arises from the necessity of creating an ap propriate anisotropy of a material medium in order to maintain a special orientation of the principal axes of stress and strain. Such anisotropy may not come from the original constituents, and the only means to implement it is to create it artificially, by building the relevant composite structures. The composites play the important role of devices that focus the vector (tensor) fields at each point toward the target defined by the optimality requirement. The next two chapters are devoted to the comparison between two- and three-dimen sional elasticity in the classical as well as the micropolar contexts. For planar problems, attention is drawn to the stress invariance with respect to a special transformation of the elastic moduli. This phenomenon, sim ilar to a classical theorem of Maurice Levy, has its roots in the existence (in a planar case) of the so-called null-Lagrangians. This</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 233 term is used to define a special quadratic function of the field components that ap pears to be an exact divergence. For this reason, null-Lagrangians may be added to the energy without affecting the Euler equations. An immediate consequence of this is the reduction of the number of the material constants that affect the strain. Null-Lagrangians carry important infor mation about the compatibility conditions along the interfaces separating the material constituents in a composite assembly, and for this reason they account for the pos sibility of relaxation of the optimal design problems; the appearance of composites makes such problems well-posed. The book contains an interesting discussion of null Lagrangians in micropolar elasticity, par ticularly related to the problem of effective material parameters. A special chapter is devoted to the prob lem of bounds for the effective moduli; how ever, this discussion does not go far beyond the bounds of Reuss-Voigt type. A vast literature on exact bounds written over the last few decades remains outside the scope of the book. The final chapters contain an extensive discussion of thermomechanics of random media as well as the wave propagation that occurs through them. The informa tion concentrated in these chapters is quite abundant; maybe because of this, the pre sentation sometimes becomes fragmentary, resembling a survey of a great number of publications. The book contains a vast bib liography: a list of cited papers occupies 23 final pages. The author has chosen index notation for tensors throughout the text. This no tation is habitual to many readers; at the same time, for some purposes, especially for problems related to the material param eters, a different type of tensor notation seems to be more adequate. For 4th rank material tensors, a representation that uses their eigenbases, which are themselves the sets of linearly independent 2nd rank ten sors, can be better. This technique was in troduced, to the best of my knowledge, by J. Rychlewski in his paper On Hooke 's Law (Prik. Mat. Mekh., 48 (1984), pp. 420-425). Its systematic use not only saves space, but also gives a proper understanding of a num ber of situations in which certain elements of an effective material tensor may remain unaffected by homogenization. The book of Ostoja-Starzewski is not easy reading: sometimes the text is over loaded by technicalities, and at some places it appears to be fragmentary. It embraces a great number of topics (too many, in my opinion), which may be due to the author's desire to range far and wide. The study of this book requires a solid mathematical background, and for this reason it may be recommended to a well-prepared reader. KONSTANTIN A.
