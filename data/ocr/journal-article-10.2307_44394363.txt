<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOD-CONCEPTS OF LUTHERAN DEAF ADULTS Rev. Robert G. Blakely Norwood, Massachusetts Introduction The purpose of this study and of this paper is to present findings regarding the God-concepts of deaf adults, and to compare if possible, the findings presented by Dr. Oliver E. Graebner, to the Ephphatha Conference in Estes Park, Colorado, in July 1964. His report was in the God-concepts of children who are deaf and who are enrolled in state institutions for the deaf. At that conference Dr. Graebner stated, that it is understood that those children tested have in general received religious instruction of a Protestant-Christian doctrinal emphasis which probably range from very liberal to conservative. He further stated that since there was no control of teachers and their training, or the kinds of teaching aids or curricula, that the range of aids, curricula, training and teaching used was probably still greater than the range of doctrinal emphasis ex- perienced by the children. It was also reported that it is perhaps a truism that many teachers of deaf children in state schools are concerned about the fact that their charges have received little or no religious instruction at home and before coming to school; that many older teachers in particular, go on the assuumption that if they are to receive some kind of religious instruction it is up to the local school and/or church group to provide this. Teachers also in public state schools for the deaf in many instances view this as their own personal responsibility, and therefore with little further attempt to justify such activity in a publicly supported insti- tution, go right ahead in their program of religious education. With the above in mind, it has long been felt that possibly those ideas that have been planted by the teacher have neither grown nor changed appreciably during their adult years. Thus this limited research into the God-concepts of deaf adults. Method of Study Using the Graebner Child Concepts of God (Revised Edition) which is a set of twenty-two pictures and questions, the test was ad- ministered to three separate congregations of deaf adults. Because of inclement weather and other problems beyond immediate control, the participation of group number 1 was cut to about one-half. Also a fourth group was not given the test. The congregations that were tested are : Location. of Church Number Tested Worcester, Mass. 8 Portland, Maine 13 Quincy, Mass. 11 TOTAL 32 The age of the adults tested ranged from early twenties, to early seventies, with almost as great a variation in their denominational back- ground. 945</page><page sequence="2">946 Inter faith Institute The various answers were recorded by the adults themselves. With- out yielding to severity not to laxity interpreting the results, each question was given a score from zero (0), to plus three (+3), to minus three ( - 3), depending upon the answer given, as compared with a scale supplied by Dr. Graebner. This scale may be illustrated as follows : Picture 1 : Old lady in a rocking chair. Question : "How old is the woman ? How old is God ? Is God the same as this woman?" Answers were categorized according to the following : + 3 Eternal -f- 2 Not human ; or as old as the world + 1 No 0 No answer; don't know - 1 Irrelevant; nobody knows - 2 Confusion of God and Jesus - 3 Anthropomorphism (God, old man with white beard) In order to be able to compare the concept of the deaf children with that of the deaf adults it is necessary that the format used by Dr. Graebner be followed as closely as possible, also using definitions or other descriptive material used by him. Thus, in the above conceptual frame-work and scale, a decision had to be made regarding a possible graduation or range of concepts regarding God and time, ranging from either denialism or a human point of view. In this case, "God, the Eternal." It is recognized that there might be intermediate steps in conceptual development, and there might be steps beyond the top concept given in the schema. For instance in dealing with the idea of God and time, while "Eternal" is the top concept here given and which earns the maximum score of +3, it would actually include the mere statement, "God is not like this old woman because He is eternal," or "God is outside our concept of time." By applying a rigorous comparison of scale and examples, supplied by Dr. Graebner, all items were scored individually and total scores were computed for each adult, as well as total scores for each con- gregation, as well as total scores for each congregation on any and all items. Total scores of all adults on each item were also worked out. The highest score possible on this instrument was 66 (+3 x 22). The highest score made by any deaf adult was +58; the lowest score was -18. Special attention was given those respondents who have a hearing spouse to determine if they receive any guidance from the hearing partner. Because of the few people in this category, nothing could be drawn from the finding, especially when the deaf partner has a greater understanding than the hearing partner. Attention was also given to see if there is any better understanding among oralists than among manualists. There is a possible indication that maybe the oralists have a lower degree of strength in the understanding of the concepts of God, but this may be primarily from their mental capacity. Reactions to the Study Some of the reactions were totally unexpected and also almost as unexplainable. They ranged over the entire continum from one of</page><page sequence="3">Interfaith Institute 947 whom I had always considered one of my most stable and best equipped communicant member, who became very disorganized just at the sight and thought of being tested, to "This is fun!" and "This is just exactly what I have been wanting." "How do I know these answers, you have never taught me." "I don't have to take this test because I am different than the deaf, I did not become deaf until I was eleven years old and I know all this stuff.' (The onset of deafness in that one person was about sixty years ago.) "I have a terrible headache so I can't take it." "This is foolishness." Reaction has been very favorable to the study since its completion and since I have concentrated on the concepts in sermons and Bible study. Implication of the Study 1. Wide variations exist in the strength of the God-concepts of deaf adults. Cause for this variation cannot be determined from this study along, not at this time. Much more time and effort will have to be devoted before a trend can be determined. 2. Even though the major God-concepts had been taught the adults while they were in school, they had been learned by some and not by others. 3. Because of so many low level positive concepts (+1 and +2) there is an indication that they have a slight grasp of the concept and with a little more help will be able to move to the +3 bracket. This is validated by the fact that some of the deaf are in the +3 bracket in many of the concepts. 4. The number of negative numbers received gives an indication of the immensity of the problem. 5. It is interesting to note in TABLE I that the four lowest cate- gories of the adults were also the four lowest among the children of Dr. Graebner's report, but that the standings were almost reversed. 6. The key to improvement in the religious concept-formation seems to be primarily in that we have been "talking over their heads," and they have not been grasping what we have been telling them. (If we have been telling them and not just assuming that they already know those basic concepts.) 7. Since there is strong evidence of poor conceptual frame-work, there is also reason to doubt their depth of understanding in the more abstract and abtruse religious concepts. 8. There is much further work to be done in this area. Intepretation of TABLE I Since this is a comparison between the adults and the children the same table (I) was used for the adults as was used by Dr. Graebner. However, in analyzing picture number two, the adults visualized it more under omnipresence than as omnipotence. Also another interesting de- velopment is that picture number one (Eternal) was less understood than any of the other pictures. Picture number 20 was understood second best. Seems as though they understand that God will never die, but don't know "when he was born." The children were very weak on "Promise-keeper" and Justice." The latter being 2 to 1, meaning that one third of the children made negative scores.</page><page sequence="4">948 Interfaith Institute Table I ORDER OF STRENGTH OR KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF BY TOTAL WEIGHTED SCORES Order of Strength Picture Number Concept Ratio (+ to - ) Adults Children Adults Children 1 1 7, 2, 21, 20 Omnipotence 11.3:1 12:1 2 4 2, 11 Omnipresence 8.8:1 4.5:1 3 3 3 Omniscience 8.8:1 5:1 4 2 13, 14, 21, 17, Mercy 7.9:1 7:1 19, 8 5 8 6 Angels 6.4:1 1:1.3 6 6 1, 20, 10 Eternity 6.2:1 1.5:1 7 7 8 Promise-keeper 5.7:1 1:1.5 8 5 4 Justice 3.7:1 2:1 Table II WEIGHT OF POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE SCORES BY PICTURE AND QUESTION 0) Oí O ai tj © © © S ai § © tj w S 2 P 2 P S &lt;x&gt; P P &lt;x&gt; &amp; P © ■ © © m © -2h P © P *2 P ^ _-M © •-J h y « Or«° P O »-J P h M y £ &gt; £ .2,52 Or«° P &lt;+H P P »-J £ Pi £ c e Ž-S, &gt; I "Sô c 5 c £ ö Attribute . , , , S S c sggi e I "Sô c 'S S c 5 2 ö Attribute . , , , H O O h? «2 ü U &lt;1 O fe O W O Picture 1 2 345 6789 10 11 Group 1(8) 1.2:1 13:1 9:1 1.6:1 3.1:1 11:1 15:1 2.8:1 13:1 4:1 1.2:1 Group 2 (13) 4:1 18:1 5.6:1 1.2:1 20:1 5:1 8.3:1 12:1 15:1 1.8:1 1.5:1 Group 3 (11) 2:1 12:1 18:1 9:1 13:1 3.2:1 7:1 3:1 1.6:1 5:1 6.5:1 Combined strength in understanding 22 1 11 16 5 13 7 14 4 21 18 «S 2 S S t, © «J ^ ÖPP?}© &gt;» © .©PO ©©&lt;D©r^ © P O © ^ - PU P 'S g ^ S © O w &gt; ^ &gt;&gt;'£ P P P œ . ^ § - P ^ g© 'p 'p 'p P © . £ ©© - ^0 2ëp^2S22^-2êbë Attribute O fe O O O yJ.
