<plain_text><page sequence="1">TENNYSON'S CLASSICAL DRAMATIC MONOLOGUES AND THE APPROXIMATION OF GREEK AND LATIN POETRY A. A. MARKLEY Penn State University, Delaware County Alfred, Lord Tennyson's exceptionally rich background in the study of the classical languages and literatures provided him with a rich source of thematic material for his poetry throughout his long career. From his earliest published poems in the late 1820s, to the title poems of his final two collections, "Demeter and Persephone" and "The Death of none," Tennyson consistently returned to the classical dramatic monologue ? a monologue with a speaker from classical antiquity or mythology. It is clear that Tennyson's unusually thorough knowledge of classical poetry strongly affected the development of his style as he trained himself as a poet in the 1820s and 30s. At times, Tennyson attempted to compose English poems in actual meters used by the ancient Greek and Roman poets; but more often, he experimented with the idea of approximating the aesthetic beauty of classical verse in his own poetry in an attempt not merely to imitate, but to produce English poetry of the same caliber as the Greek and Latin poetry he so admired. In composing his classical dramatic monologues, Tennyson continually returned to a particular experiment to approximate in English verse the experience of reading classical poetry in the original languages. Over the years, he perfected two methods of heightening the sense of familiarity that a classically educated reader would experience in reading his classical monologues. First, he attempted to provide the speaker of each monologue with an idiom appropriate to his or her context in the world of classical myth or history, chiefly by incorporating his own adaptations of classical phrasing and his own translations of actual passages of Greek and Latin poetry into the texture of his verses. Secondly, he learned to use mythological allusion in the manner that many ancient poets did ? weaving together a subtle but highly complex system of interrelated allusions to a variety of Greek Victorian Review 25.1 (Summer 1999)</page><page sequence="2">36 Victorian Review myths in order to underscore the experience of his speaker. This article will explore these two methods of approximating Greek and Latin poetry, with a particular focus on two of Tennyson's finest, yet infrequently discussed monologues, " none" and "Tiresias." In two of his earliest dramatic monologues, "Antony to Cleopatra" and "Mithridates Presenting Berenice with the Cup of Poison," both of which were published in the Poems By Two Brothers volume of 1827, Tennyson chose to work with highly dramatic moments in classical history. In these early experiments, the poet seems to have been concerned chiefly with the dramatic monologue's great potential for irony. Tennyson's Antony, for example, bids a sorrowful farewell to his lover Cleopatra at Actium, just after he realizes they are defeated. As he does so, however, he takes the opportunity to remind her of the sacrifices he has made for their relationship, and subtly demands Cleopatra's continued devotion to him. Similarly, at the brink of his defeat by Pompey, Mithridates insists that his lover Berenice follow him to the grave by drinking poison. Readers familiar with classical history, however, would recall that Mithridates managed to survive this defeat; and, according to legend, that he had made himself immune to poison by means of a homeopathic diet. These two poems illustrate Tennyson's first experiments with adapting a few familiar classical phrases into his own verse. Antony, for example, tells Cleopatra that "I sought, I saw, I heard but thee" (line 29), ironically echoing her former lover's famous "I came, I saw, I conquered."1 Similarly, Mithridates proclaims to Berenice, "Fill high the bowl! the draught is thine!" (33), echoing several of Horace's calls for wine in such of his carpe diem odes as Odes 1.9 and 1.11, poems with which Tennyson was intimately familiar from childhood. While they do indicate what were perhaps Tennyson's first attempts to develop a classical idiom for his speakers, these early poems do not represent a sustained effort in that regard. Tennyson's first great success in sustaining this project throughout a dramatic monologue came with the publication of "( none" in his 1832 Poems. Narrated by the nymph who had been abandoned by her lover Paris for the famously beautiful Helen, " none" opens with a vivid pictorial presentation of a valley alongside Mount Ida, near Troy. The poet's opening description of the "swimming vapor" sloping along the glen and the long brook falling through the ravine in cataract after cataract closely mirrors Ovid's description of a similar setting in his tale of Io in the first book of the Metamorphoses (lines 568-ff).2 The reason for Tennyson's careful attention to descriptive detail in this landscape will become more clear as the poem progresses and the reader begins to identify (Enone's fate and the fate of her natural landscape as one and the same. Moreover, the association of none with Io, a mortal woman</page><page sequence="3">A. A.MARKLEY 37 loved and abandoned by Zeus, likewise becomes more clear as the poem continues. The pastoral setting of " none" is significant in its association with the stance and complaints of the rejected lover in classical poetry. Examples can be found in such works as the Idylls of Theocritus and the Eclogues of Virgil. In the third Idyll of Theocritus, for example, a lovesick shepherd laments his rejection by his beloved Amaryllis. One also might recall the spurned Corydon's pining for the beautiful Alexis in the second of Virgil's Eclogues, or the laments of the rejected Gallus, of Virgil's tenth Eclogue. Tennyson's predecessor in characterizing a female figure from mythology and allowing her to express her laments, is Ovid, whose twenty-one Heroldes are composed as letters between mythological lovers which allow a variety of characters to voice their points of view. The fifth letter in this collection, a letter from none to Paris, is the most important classical source for Tennyson's poem. none begins her song at line twenty-two with a refrain which Tennyson himself called "Theocritean," and which is repeated incrementally throughout the rest of the poem.3 Her aspect of "leaning on a fragment twined with vine" (19) recalls Theocritus's speaker in Idyll IIL38: "Here will I lean me against this pine tree, and sing."4 none refers to the mountain with the epithet "many-fountained" ? an epithet used by Homer (Iliad XIV. 157,283,307, etc.; Mustard 4), which will be repeated three times in the subsequent stanzas. This reference is important both in establishing none's identity as the daughter of the River-God GEneus, as she tells us (37), and in establishing the watery images which will characterize both descriptions of none and her own speech. none begins to sing at high noon; her surroundings are hot, still, and deathlike. The sleeping lizard that she describes recalls more pastoral poetry ? Theocritus's seventh Idyll, as well as Virgil's second Eclogue (Mustard 36). As Ricks notes, the antithesis of "rests" (27) and "awake" (29) echoes the second Idyll of Theocritus, in which a rejected lover speaks of her turmoil as the only interruption in the still night (Ricks, 1,422), and more so Virgil's second Eclogue, which like " none" is set in the heat of high noon. Theocritus's speaker says that "the night is windless, the sea lies still; / Only my turmoil interrupts the calm."5 Virgil's Corydon tells his beloved Alexis that while all else sleeps in the shade, he alone casts about under the burning sun, retracing his beloved's footsteps (11.12-13). An even more familiar classical source to most readers is a passage in Book IV of the Aeneid, in which a sleepless Dido longs for Aeneas as the rest of the palace sleeps around her (lines 522-ff). none expresses her sorrow in a classical manner with a chiastic arrangement of subjects (eyes and heart) in lines 30-31: "My eyes are</page><page sequence="4">38 Victorian Review full of tears, my heart of love, / My heart is breaking, and my eyes are dim." In the next stanza, beginning at line thirty-three, none's cry to the earth, the hills, the caves and the mountain brooks to witness her despair echoes a passage in Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound, lines eighty-eight to ninety-one, in which Prometheus calls to the light, the winds, the rivers, the waves of the sea, the earth and the sun to witness his suffering. A second classical source for this passage may be found in Book III of the Iliad, in which Agamemnon makes a similar prayer to the sun, the earth, and the rivers of the world.6 When the three goddesses come to be judged by Paris, at their feet flowers "brake like fire" (94), recalling the lovemaking of Hera and Zeus in Iliad XIV, a passage also imitated by Milton for Adam and Eve's lovemaking in Paradise Lost, Book IV (Turner, 64). Overhead wandering ivy and vines run riot to shield the naked goddesses from exposure. The natural description here may remind the reader of the story of Diana and Actaeon in Ovid's Metamorphoses III (lines 138 252). As in " none," Ovid opens this tale with a description of the natural scene: "There was a vale in that region, thick grown with pine and cypress with their sharp needles," and the time of day, similarly, is noon (145). When Actaeon inadvertently intrudes on Diana's bath in this hidden vale, the angry goddess turns him into a stag, whereupon he is destroyed by his own pack of dogs. The allusion, therefore, as in the case of Io earlier, is a subtle reminder of what a mortal may expect in associating directly with the gods. none describes her attempt to warn Paris of the danger inherent in his choice of Aphrodite in this contest and laments that "he heard me not, / Or hearing would not hear me" (165-66), an example of polyptoton, a convention of word repetition that is common in classical poetry and rhetoric. Ricks points out that the antithesis between hearing and not hearing is reminiscent of Prometheus's words about the nature of mankind in Prometheus Bound, 448: "For men at first had eyes but saw no purpose; they had ears but did not hear."7 Upon Paris's rejection of her for the promise of a new lover, Helen, none's "am I not fair? / My love hath told me so a thousand times" (192-93) recalls a pastoral elegiac convention used, again, by Theocritus and Virgil.8 She then concludes her lament with an account of the destruction of her beloved landscape on Mt. Ida. As in Ovid's account of none's tragedy in Heroides V, none's "tallest pines" are cut and dragged away, ironically in order that a boat might be built for Paris's voyage to claim his new wife, Helen. The passage also recalls the opening of Ovid's Amores 11.11, a borrowing from Catullus 64, which describes the transfiguration of ancient trees into ships to build the legendary Argo. Ovid's speaker attributes to the destruction of these trees the advent of</page><page sequence="5">A. A. MARKLEY 39 sea travel, and thus the cause of all his problems, since his beloved Corinna insists on leaving him to travel. A dramatic shift occurs in the final stanzas of the poem from the sexually-charged watery images of none's past relationship with Paris ("fruitful kisses, thick as Autumn rains / Flash in the pool of whirling Simois" 201-02) to images of fire and heat. none speaks of "fiery thoughts" shaping themselves within her, almost as a child of her union with Paris (242-44). Of course the use of fire imagery here foreshadows the destruction of Troy, but in GEnone's association of fiery thoughts with images of childbirth, it is also reminiscent of the story of Paris's birth. Paris's mother Hecuba dreamed while pregnant that she would give birth to a firebrand, symbolizing that the unborn Paris would bring about the destruction of his homeland. The reference to childbirth in none's monologue is extended by her prophecy that "never child be born of me, / Unblest, to vex me with his father's eyes!" (250-51). This passage alludes to Dido's lamentation in the Aeneid that Aeneas is leaving her with nothing, not even a child to remind her of his father (IV, 327-30). Significantly, both none and Dido, abandoned by their lovers, meet their end on fiery pyres. These numerous references to and adaptations of actual classical passages indicate Tennyson's first success at sustaining an appropriately classical idiom for a speaker throughout a monologue. A second striking feature of the poem is the complex relationship between the classical works to which Tennyson alludes. Theocritus helps to construct a pastoral landscape in a general sense, and references specifically to the second Idyll are important because of the parallel situation of the rejected lover, the use of a refrain, and because of the poem's reference to the mythological account of Ariadne and her betrayal by Theseus ( , 45-46), a famous prototype of the rejected female lover. In addition to Greek lyric poetry, Tennyson refers to Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound, and it should be recalled that one of the most important features of this play is Prometheus's prophecy concerning the child of Thetis, who will be Achilles, the greatest Greek hero of the Trojan War, a cataclysmic event brought about by Paris's abandoning of none for the Greek queen, Helen. Tennyson's allusion to Ovid's tale of Io at the beginning of the poem proves to be all the more appropriate when one considers the important role that Io plays in Prometheus Bound. In addition, the reference to the story of Dido and Aeneas is appropriate due to the fact that Aeneas's adventures were occasioned by his flight from Troy after the Trojan War. Tennyson's reference to Catullus 64, the epithalamion for the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, ties together elements of all of these stories. Opening with the lines referring to the destruction of the trees that built the Argo, the poem describes the wedding festivities of Peleus</page><page sequence="6">40 Victorian Review and Thetis (at which a noteworthy guest is Prometheus), and digresses into a long ecphrasis of the tapestry that covers the marriage bed, which depicts Ariadne's abandonment by Theseus. Ariadne's plight and emotional state are very similar to those of none, and images of fire and burning to describe both Ariadne's love for Theseus (91-93) and her rage at being rejected are also important connections to " none" (197). The connection between the story of none and that of the myth of Theseus is also referred to by Ovid in Heroides V, when none reminds Paris that Helen was abducted by Theseus even before her marriage to Menelaus, and that she is likely to run off with other men. Additional connections to " none" lie in the conclusion of Catullus 64, including a prophecy that Achilles will be the offspring of the newly married Peleus and Thetis, and a prophecy that the Trojan princess Polyxena will be killed by Achilles and burned on his funeral pyre, again foreshadowing none's death. In addition to these similarities of image and emotional state, Tennyson's echoing of Catullus is ultimately of thematic significance because it is at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis that Eris throws down the very golden apple that Paris would later award to Aphrodite. The connection of the stories of Peleus and Thetis, Ariadne and Theseus, Dido and Aeneas, and even Io and Prometheus in the fabric of allusion that Tennyson weaves through none's monologue is akin to the complicated ways in which classical poets such as Catullus, Ovid, and Propertius interweave allusions to mythology not only to underscore theme and image, but also to indicate relationships between the stories themselves. The stories of all of these characters come to bear on the fate of Troy, a fate that Tennyson conflates with the personal tragedy of none. Although classical allusion has been a common feature of British poetry in every period, Tennyson's replication of the complex relationships between myths and mythic figures in " none" comes closer to this characteristic of classical poetry than do most post classical works that use classical allusion to underscore theme or image. After the death of his friend Arthur Henry Haliam in 1833, the classical dramatic monologues to which Tennyson devoted himself in the early 1830s, like the poetic experiments that were to become In Mem?ri?m A.H.H., began to be shaped by his speculations on death and dying. Among the first experiments of this period was a trilogy of classical monologues dealing with different attitudes toward death: "Ulysses," "Tithon," and "Tiresias." While "Ulysses" and "Tithonus" both have attracted a great deal of critical attention, "Tiresias" has received very little; nor have critics read "Tiresias" in terms of its relationship to these other two classical monologues. Although "Ulysses" and "Tithonus" are commonly recognized as pendants, the three poems should be viewed as a trilogy, each of which examines a distinct view of</page><page sequence="7">A. A. MARKLEY 41 death and/or the life well lived. To Ulysses's cry "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield" in the face of death (70), and to Tithonus's pathetic begging to be allowed to yield to death, "Tiresias" adds a third interpretation of a particular view of death, that of "life's best end" being "to end well" ? whenever that end may come (126-27). Tennyson's attempts to develop both an appropriate idiom and a complex system of allusion in " none" is again evident in "Ulysses" and "Tithonus," but despite the success and abiding popularity of these two poems, the poet did not duplicate this particular achievement of " none" until he completed the composition of "Tiresias." In "Ulysses," Tennyson's attempts to approximate classical poetry in the sound of his own verses are less smoothly integrated into the poem as a whole, no doubt in part due to the fact that his interpretation of Ulysses's character seems to owe more to Dante's conception of Ulysses than to Homer's Odysseus. In the phrasing of such verses as "There gloom the dark broad seas" (45), "the deep / Moans round with many voices" (55 56), and in Ulysses's call for his crew to "smite / The sounding furrows" (58-59), Tennyson is clearly attempting to remind the reader of Homer. Nevertheless, these deliberately Homeric lines contrast sharply with the tone of the rest of the poem. The majority of Ulysses's words are so carefully measured, so rational and straightforward, and so rarely dotted with lyrical language that the poem as a whole lacks an extended resonance of Homer, or indeed of other ancient authors. "Tithonus" offers a far better example of a sustained use of language and imagery that achieves something of the purity and beauty of Homer. The language with which the mortal Tithonus describes his immortal lover, Eos, for example, is both beautiful in itself and highly appropriate to her aspect as the dawn. Tithonus speaks of the "old mysterious glimmer" stealing "From they pure brows" (34-35), her cheek which "begins to redden through the gloom," and her eyes that "brighten slowly close to mine, / Ere yet they blind the stars" (37-39). A Renaissance sonnet written to emblazon a poet's mistress might make use of similar language to compare the beauty of the woman to the splendor of celestial light, but here the woman and the light of the sky are one and the same. Thus Tennyson effectively achieves an authentic Greek characterization of a deity who represents a natural phenomenon; that is, as both natural manifestation and anthropomorphic figure simultaneously.9 The remarkable achievement of "Tithonus," however, lies not in the development of a classical idiom, but in the manner in which Tennyson implies through Tithonus's monologue not only the presence of the auditor in the poem, but of her reaction to what Tithonus is saying. The pathos of the poem is heightened by Eos's silence in the face of her miserable lover's laments. Tithonus speaks of her growing beautiful in</page><page sequence="8">42 Victorian Review silence, and to her departure without providing him with an answer to his questions, he responds, "Thy tears are on my cheek" (45), Here Tennyson cleverly uses the single-speaker format of the dramatic monologue to emphasize the silence of Tithonus's auditor, and thus her tearful answer to his question ? an answer made by omission. In terms of Tennyson's attempt to approximate the experience of reading classical verse, "Tiresias" provides one of the finest examples of his ultimate success in sustaining this goal throughout an entire poem.10 In choosing to work with the figure of Tiresias, Tennyson had a number of classical sources from which to develop his particular version of this character's personality and story. One of the earliest accounts of Tiresias is found in Book XI of Homer's Odyssey, in which Odysseus travels to the Underworld to seek Tiresias's advice concerning returning to his homeland. Here Tiresias's spirit tells Odysseus of Poseidon's hatred for him, and warns him that the god will make it difficult for him to return home safely. Tiresias also gives Odysseus an encouraging prophecy concerning his eventual return to Ithaca, his triumph over the suitors, and the reestablishment of order in his family and home. Interestingly, this version of Odysseus's story with its prophecy concerning Odysseus's eventual death is the one in which Tennyson found the inspiration for "Ulysses." Tiresias also appears in several of the Greek tragedies, in which he is brought on stage in order to provide a prophecy concerning how the protagonists in these plays may save the city of Thebes from plague, siege, or some other threat of ruin. In Sophocles's dipus Tyrannos, a reluctant Tiresias is brought before dipus, who demands that he tell him the reason for the city's troubles. dipus bullies Tiresias into telling him what the old seer knows the king will not hear ? that dipus himself is the cause of his kingdom's ruin. As a result, dipus taunts Tiresias for being blind and thus unseeing. Similarly, in the Phoenissae, Euripides recasts the story of dipus and his family, starting at the point at which dipus's son Polyneices, having been refused his share in the rule of Thebes by his brother Eteocles, attacks the city with an army he has raised among the Argives. Once again Tiresias is brought on stage to give advice that will not be welcomed. The current ruler, Creon, is shocked to learn of Tiresias's prophecy that his son Menoeceus must die in order to appease the wrath of Ares that has hung over the city for generations. Creon tries to persuade his son Menoeceus to flee the city, but Menoeceus takes Tiresias's prophecy seriously, and courageously tells the Chorus that he will gladly give his life to save his country. The classical account to which Tennyson most heavily alludes in "Tiresias" is the fifth hymn of the poet Callimachus, known as "The Bath of Pallas." This short hymn to Athena addresses the goddess's priestesses, calling them to prepare her bath, and warning men of the</page><page sequence="9">A. A. MARKLEY 43 danger of viewing Athena while she is bathing, citing the story of Tiresias's blinding as an example. "The Bath of Pallas" describes a young Tiresias searching for water with which he might quench a powerful thirst. When the young man inadvertently stumbles upon his mother, Chariclo, and the goddess Athena at their bath, an infuriated Athena blinds him. In order to comfort Tiresias's distraught mother and to mollify the punishment, however, Athena adds the gift of prophecy to her curse. Although he sets "Tiresias" during the siege of Thebes as dramatized in Euripides's Phoenissae, as well as Aeschylus's earlier Seven Against Thebes, Tennyson's treatment of the story of Menoeceus's self-sacrifice during the siege is original in its focus on a meeting between Menoeceus and the prophet.11 Tiresias begins his speech to Menoeceus with the story of how he was blinded, using imagery that is notably visual. He describes his youthful and dangerous yearning to learn more about the gods, and he then sets the scene in the mountains in the dry heat of noon, a heat so hot that it leads him to seek out a shady spot. Tennyson alters the Callimachean tale in order to make Tiresias's chance encounter with Athena, or wisdom, the ultimate end of his hubristic goal to see the gods face to face and not simply the result of looking to quench a literal thirst. In Tennyson's version of the story, Tiresias inadvertently gains the gift of prophecy "at a glance" simply from seeing the beautiful goddess (54). In addition, Athena's curse is a double one, depriving Tiresias not only of sight, but also of the power to act for his country, because no one will believe his prophecies. Here Tennyson departs from classical tradition. Tiresias's prophecies are rarely heeded in the classical sources, and he complains in the Phoenissae, for example, that it is folly to be a prophet, because when one speaks truths that are unwelcome, one will be answered with bitterness (954-56). But Tennyson's emphasis on a divine mandate that ensures that Tiresias will not be believed, probably borrowed from the story of Cassandra, is a notable difference, particularly when one remembers that in several versions of the story, including that of Callimachus, the power of prophecy was given to Tiresias to alleviate the curse of blindness. In adding the detail that Tiresias's prophecies were never to be heeded by others, Tennyson is able to emphasize Tiresias's sense of futility and frustration in not being able to provide any help to his people. Thus, Tiresias's great anxiety clearly demonstrates for Menoeceus that having the power and opportunity to save his country is a great gift. In addition, this situation provides a psychological context for the poem, explaining Tiresias's motivations in rallying Menoeceus to action, for Menoeceus does have the power to act, and Tiresias can therefore act through him.</page><page sequence="10">44 Victorian Review At line eighty-eight of the poem, Tiresias concludes his account of how he gained the gift of prophecy, and begins to refer to the attack that he can hear being waged against the city. Here, notably, the imagery of the poem shifts from visual to auditory images, an appropriate shift for the now blind prophet. Tiresias tells the boy Menoeceus, "thou hast eyes," and "I can hear" the "tides of onset" sapping the seven high gates of Thebes. His statement that he can hear the oncoming crisis recalls an unusual use of synaesthesia in a line spoken by the Chorus in Aeschylus's Seven Against Thebes, in which they say " e a," or "I see the sound," meaning, of course, that they could see the cause of the noises of the impending assault on the city (102). Tiresias's use of polyptoton in reference to the brothers in stating that "the twain / Would each waste each" (67-68), also closely follows a line describing the brothers' deaths in the Seven Against Thebes, which is translated, "They are each dead, each slain by a brother's hand" (811). Moreover, his warnings that "the tyrranny of one / Was prelude to the tyrrany of all" and that "the tyranny of all / Led backward to the tyrrany of one" (72-75) represents another example of chiasmus, a type of word play that is frequently to be found in the poetry of both Greek and Latin authors. The specific auditory references that follow in Tiresias's vivid description of the sounds that he hears are directly taken from the Seven Against Thebes and the Phoenissae, and it is noteworthy that Tennyson is able to translate the elements of sound that Aeschylus employs so closely, while simultaneously achieving those very sound effects of the clash and clatter of impending war in his particular choice of words, exactly as the ancient playwrights do in the Greek. The "ringing axles" and the "jingle of bits," the "tramp" of the horse grinding the dust beneath its feet, and the "stony showers" of Ares's "hail" crashing into the walls are images quite close to those used by Aeschylus and Euripides, who likewise cluster words that echo the sounds being described. Aeschylus compares the crashing feet of soldiers to a waterfall roaring down a mountain, and describes murder moaning through the bits in the horses' mouths, and the clashing of the chariots's axles in the axle boxes (lines 83-86; 122-23; 153). Drawing on Aeschylus's play, Euripides's description of the siege of Thebes also includes such elements as the clattering chariots, the clashing of horses' bits and hooves, and the crash of stones showering the city (794-ff). In addition, as classical authors such as Homer and Virgil alter the rhythm of their verses to reinforce certain situations of distress, such as battle scenes or storms at sea, Tennyson likewise breaks out of his consistently smooth and graceful blank verse to echo the chaotic</page><page sequence="11">A. A. MARKLEY 45 Situation of the storming of Thebes. The reader's impression of the scene is greatly affected by chaotic rhythm and sounds of these lines: Rides on those ringing axles! jingle of bits, Shouts, arrows, tramp of the hornfooted horse That grind the glebe to powder! Stony showers Of that ear-stunning hail of Ares crash Along the sounding walls. (91-95) In addition to his aural echoes of the Greek tragedians, Tennyson's "tramp of the hornfooted horse" is borrowed from one of his favorite passages to quote aloud in Virgil's Aeneid Book VI.12 Similarly, the phrase "grind the glebe to powder" (93) specifically echoes two descriptive passages in Virgil's Georgias I, in which the word glaeba or gleba, meaning clod, is used in descriptions of crumbling lumps of earth broken apart by the spring thaw, and as they are baked by the hot summer sun.13 In lines 108 and following the description of a fiery Ar?s standing in the darkness shouting his hatred to the Thebans mirrors a passage in Book XVIII of Homer's Iliad in which Achilles, similarly wreathed in flames, terrifies the Trojans with his horrible war cry; Tennyson published his translation of this passage in 1877 as "Achilles Over the Trench." Tiresias's chief message to Menoeceus is that there is no greater honor than to give one's life for one's "sweet mother land" (118). This sentiment echoes a number of classical sources; most particularly, Horace's assertion in Ode 1112: "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori11 ("It is sweet and proper to die for one's fatherland," line thirteen).14 In his attempt to convince the boy of this sentiment, Tiresias uses water images to symbolize one's potential to contribute to his community. Tiresias says that, Virtue must shape itself in deed, and those Whom weakness or necessity have cramped Within themselves, immerging, each, his urn In his own well, draw solace as he may. (84-87) But solace is not Tiresias's object; he uses this image to represent the weak individual, drawing water from his own well strictly for his own personal needs, if we recall the classical sources in which Tiresias's desire to quench his own thirst brought about his blinding or his death,15 we can appreciate the subtle irony in this element of Tennyson's imagery. Tiresias finally urges Menoeceus to "blunt the curse / Of Pallas, hear, and though I speak the truth / Believe I speak it" (149-51). The</page><page sequence="12">46 Victorian Review prophet's only hope that his prophecies will save his city rests in the boy's hearing and believing his words, and in his acting, so that Tiresias, through Menoeceus, can ?vercome Athena's curse. Menoeceus is ultimately persuaded by the old prophet's words; the reader can infer this from Tiresias's "Gone! / He will achieve his greatness" (160-61). The one warm tear that Tiresias feels on his hand as the boy leaves him is the only bit of evidence we have concerning Menoeceus's reaction to Tiresias's speech. As in "Tithonus," the speaker's reference to the tears of his auditor allows the reader to infer the auditor's reaction. "Tiresias" closes with the seer's vision of the afterlife, when he will meet former friends and again enjoy the benefit of all of his senses. After his lesson to the boy on "life's best end" being "to end well," and after finally succeeding in persuading someone to believe him and to act on his prophecy, it is appropriate that the old man begin to look ahead to his own death and to the promise of the afterlife. Tiresias describes the activities that will make the afterlife a paradise for him, from chariot races to hunting expeditions. Theodore Redpath points out the importance of one of Pindar's fragments as a source for the final lines of the poem: On them is lit the strength of the sun beneath the darkness we know here, and the space before the city of them lies in bright-flowering meadows, shadowy with incense-trees and heavy with golden fruits. And some with horses and exercise, some with draughts-games, some with lyres take their pleasure, and a whole life of bliss breaks into flower upon them. A lovely fragrance is scattered across the place as they join all manner of sacrifices to bright fire on the gods' altars. There the torpid rivers of the gloom of night break through the endless dark.16 Redpath cites this passage as an example of Tennyson's method of inventing his own original context for a classical fragment of unknown context, thus neatly adding this fragment to the other bits of classical references he has worked into Tiresias's language. Not satisfied with merely appropriating the images from this fragment alone, however, Tennyson mixes with it the elements of the worshipful populace, the chariot whirling about the goal, and the hunters and warriors striving for glory, all borrowed from Horace's well known meditation on his version of the ideal life in Ode LI. As in the case of " none," Tennyson subtly alludes to a complex interrelated system of Greek myths throughout the text of "Tiresias." Early in the poem, Tiresias refers to the story of Cadmus, the founder of</page><page sequence="13">A. A. MARKLEY 47 Thebes, and his slaying of the dragon which brought the wrath of Ar?s onto successive generations of the city's royal house. Towards the end of the poem, Tiresias ties in the tale of this same beast with that of the Sphinx from Euripides's Phoenissae, who later, he says, occupied the same cave on the outskirts of the city. Here Tiresias's reference to "A wiser than herself" (147) is a reference to dipus, whose life and downfall, appropriately, had brought on the civil war during which Tiresias is speaking. The simple inclusion of the phrase "song-built towers and gates" in line ninety-six recalls the story of the building of Thebes, during which the rocks and stones of the city rose into place to the music of Amphion's lyre ? a visual antithesis for the destruction of the city that is beginning as Tiresias speaks. Finally, Tiresias's narration of this version of his own blinding closely parallels the more famous story of Actaeon. Because he was a grandson of Cadmus, Actaeon and his bloody death represent merely one more chapter in the troubled history of the Thebans. Critics from the Victorian era through the modern day have valued "Ulysses" for what they have taken to be its moral, despite the conflicting interpretations that the poem allows. Likewise, they have consistently praised "Tithonus" for its emotional poignance and exquisite lyrical beauty. Nevertheless, "Tiresias" is far more successful than either "Ulysses" or "Tithonus" in terms of Tennyson's achievement of an authentic idiom for his classical speaker. In the incorporation of linguistic material, and in the complex fabric of mythological allusions blended throughout his original approach to a familiar story, "Tiresias" represents a consummation of the project that Tennyson undertook in his classical dramatic monologues as early as the late 1820s, and one that he continued to attempt to perfect at regular intervals throughout his career. More than any other classical dramatic monologue, "Tiresias" illustrates Tennyson's lifelong dedication to this particular project; although he began work on the manuscript in 1833, it was not until his revisions of 1885 that he considered it to be publishable, and then made it the tide poem of a new volume, Tiresias and Other Poems. "Tiresias" provides scholars with a view of Tennyson at the height of his powers in terms of producing an English poem worthy of comparison to the classical sources from which the poet's inspiration sprang.17 Notes 1. All quotations of Tennyson's poetry are taken from Christopher B. Ricks (ed.), The Poems of Tennyson, 3 vols. Essex: Longman, 1987. 2. Paul Turner has also pointed out the similarity of these lines to Ovid's description of the setting of his own version of the Judgment of Paris in Heroides XVI, 53-58. Turner was among the first to discuss the classical</page><page sequence="14">48 Victorian Review allusions in this poem in "Some Ancient Light on Tennyson's O enone " Journal of English and Germanic Philology 61 (1962), 57-72. Turner describes " none" as a "distillation" of the works of both the classical and the English Romantic poets, and he argues that the poem fails ultimately, due to its unusually heavy allusiveness. I wish to argue, rather, that Tennyson's project here was not merely to amalgamate multiple literary passages, but to evoke such passages in order to approximate the experience of reading Greek and Latin poetry for the English reader in the nineteenth century. 3.

This antithesis is very common in classical literature, perhaps most notably in Sophocles's edipus Tyrannos and Euripides's Bacchae. The polyptoton involving the word "hearing" also recalls Paris's invitation to none to hide in the cave where "unheard" she might "hear all" (87-88). Cf. Ricks, I, 394, and Turner, 65. 8. In Theocritus's Sixth Idyll the shepherd Damoetas studies his reflection and assesses his physical virtues in trying to understand his rejection by a lover (11.34 ff). Likewise, in Idyll XI, the Cyclops Polyphemus concludes his lament to his beloved sea nymph Galatea by reassuring himself of his attractiveness to women on the land. Virgil's shepherd Corydon similarly attests that he is not ugly upon inspecting his reflection. Like Amoetas, Corydon tries to find a reason why the beautiful Alexis is not attracted to him (Eclogue II, 11.25 ff). See Ricks, I, 395, and Turner, 66. 9. An example of this aspect of Greek theology can be seen in such works as Hesiod's Theogony, in which Gaia stretches out as the earth beneath her husband, Ouranos, yet later in the poem also runs to hide the newly born Zeus from his father Cronus on Crete in an anthropomorphized manifestation. 10. The same can be argued for Tennyson's poem "Lucretius" (1868), although a full discussion of that poem lies beyond the scope of this essay. 11. Statius's Thebaid includes a similar account of the persuasion of Menoeceus to sacrifice himself, but it is the goddess Virtue who persuades him, in the guise of Tiresias's prophetess daughter, Manto (Book X, lines 628-85). 12.

This passage also echoes Cassandra's words in Euripides's Trojan Women, in which the prophetess asks who could be happier than the Trojans who laid down their lives for their own people (line 386). In addition, Menoeceus's choice parallels that of Achilles, who in the Iliad must choose between a long but insignificant life or the glory of a hero's early death (IX.412-ff).</page><page sequence="15">A. A. MARKLEY 49 15. At least one ancient account of Tiresias's death attributes it to his attempt to quench his thirst in the frigid spring of Tilphossaeum after finally helping to save the people of Thebes from an Argive onslaught (Diodorus Sieulus, iv? 66(4)-67(l).) 16.
