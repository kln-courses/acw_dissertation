<plain_text><page sequence="1">Desperate R emedies and the Victorian Sensation Novel LAWRENCE 0. JONES 1HOMAS HARDY'S first published novel (1871), Desperate Rem- edies, has received little critical attention. It is not one of Hardy's better novels and would probably be forgotten by now if it were by a less well-known author. However, when viewed as a step in Hardy's development as a novelist, it is an interesting work, for it is an early and unsuccessful resolution of a problem that was to follow him throughout his career and was to come to a head with Tess and Jude-the problem of the conflict between what Hardy called his "idiosyncratic mode of regard" 1 and the conventional mode demanded by his late-Victorian audience. Hardy had already experienced this clash when he could get neither his early (and quite idiosyncratic) poetry nor his first novel published. In his poems of 1866-1867, he had expressed quite explicitly his pessimistic views of nature ("Hap" and "Heiress and Architect"), urban society ("Dream of the City Shopwoman"), and sexual love ("Her Confession,'' "At a Bridal,'' "The Dawn after the Dance," "Neutral Tones," etc.). No one would publish such un- conventional poetry. In his first novel, The Poor Man and the Lady, he evidently criticized Victorian middle-class urban society (only conjectural fragments of the work remain). He finished this novel in 1868 and submitted it to Alexander Macmillan. Macmil- lan's answer (which Hardy interpreted as a letter of rejection) Lawrence 0. Jones is Lecturer in English Literature at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. 1 Hardy considered this "mode of regard" the central element of art: "Art con- sists in so depicting the common events of life as to bring out the features which illustrate the author's idiosyncratic mode of regard, making old incidents and things seem new" (quoted from his notebooks, Florence Emily Hardy, The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, 1840-1891 [New York, 1928], p. 244). For similar statements, see also pp. 198, 231-232, 242-243, 299). [35]</page><page sequence="2">36 Nineteenth-Century Fiction shows how unacceptable by conventional standards was Hardy's "idiosyncratic mode of regard": "Your description of country life among working men is admirable, and, although I can judge it only from the corresponding life of Scotland, which I knew well when young, palpably truthful. Your pictures of character among Londoners, and especially the upper classes, are sharp, clear, in- cisive, and in many respects true, but they are wholly dark-not a ray of light visible to relieve the darkness, and therefore exag- gerated and untrue in their result." 2 David Daiches uses the letter as an object lesson in the difficulties faced by a novelist with an unconventional way of viewing reality. He comments: True but dark, and therefore untrue. That is what the argument in the last sentence amounts to. Truth of observation is not "truth"; for the thing observed ought to have been modified before observation by the conceptions about life in general of the observer, and if that has not been done the necessary modifications must be made afterward.3 Macmillan elaborates his criticism: It seems to me that your black wash will not be recognized as any- thing more than ignorant misrepresentation. Of course, I don't know what opportunities you have of seeing the class you deal with.... But it is inconceivable to me that any considerable number of human beings-God's creatures-should be so bad without going to utter wreck in a week.4 Daiches comments on this passage: This culminating argument is no argument at all, but simply a piece of magical incantation.... The phrase "it is inconceivable to me" de- liberately removes the argument from the plane of objective reality, while the parenthetical "God's creatures" suggests that if he believed Hardy he would be going counter to some belief enjoined by his re- ligion and therefore the facts, even if they appear so to observation, cannot be really so.5 After Macmillan's rejection, Hardy submitted the manuscript to Chapman and Hall. They accepted, but then George Meredith, 2 Quoted in William R. Rutland, Thomas Hardy: A Study of His Writings and Their Background (Oxford, 1938), pp. 353-354. 3 The Novel and the Modern World (Chicago, 1939), p. 69. 4 Quoted in Rutland, p. 354. 5 Daiches, p. 70.</page><page sequence="3">The Victorian Sensation Novel 37 their reader, persuaded Hardy that the novel should be withdrawn because it would be so controversial as to doom any possibility of future public acceptance of his work. Thus Hardy learned the lesson that he has Knight state in A Pair of Blue Eyes: " 'It re- quires a judicious omission of your real thoughts to make a novel popular.' 6 Meredith further advised him that to win public favor he should "attempt a novel with a purely artistic purpose" and "with a more complicated plot." Hardy took the advice to mean that he should attempt a popular sensation novel. Thus he undertook to write Desperate Remedies. Mrs. Hardy describes the results of following this advice: The powerfully not to say wildly melodramatic situations had been concocted in a style which was quite against his natural grain, through too crude an interpretation of George Meredith's advice. It was a sort of thing he had never contemplated writing, till, finding himself in a corner, it seemed necessary to attract public attention at all hazards.7 II On the surface, at least, Hardy did write in Desperate Remedies a conventional sensation novel. However, he could not totally suppress his personal mode of regard. Characteristic Hardyan ele- ments inevitably appeared. Arthur McDowall has noted that the "real interest" lies "in the curious sense one has of reading, simul- taneously, another novel-the novel of Hardy's instinct, not his plan, which he did not write, but which yet writes itself indelibly into certain passages." 8 There is definitely a tension in the novel between Hardy's natural impulse and the opposing demands of the conventional genre, between the tragic pattern implicit in his "mode of regard" and the ultimately comic pattern demanded by the sensation novel. Each pattern would require a different treatment of the center of interest of the novel-the love situation 6 Wessex Edition (London: Macmillan and Company, 1912), ch. xvii, p. 176. 7 Early Life, p. 112. 8 Thomas Hardy: A Critical Study (London, 1931), p. 46.

The conventional pattern for the sensation novel (the melo- dramatic variation of the traditional New Comedy pattern) is obvious. The characters should be the "undivided" types of melo- drama, wholly good or wholly evil. Springrove and Cytherea, the brave hero and the virtuous heroine, should be temporarily thwarted in their love by the evil machinations of Manston, the villain-lover, and Miss Aldclyffe, the "scheming woman." Spring- grove should struggle against these forces of evil, unravel the mystery surrounding the villains, reveal the extent and motivation of their evil-doing, and win Cytherea as a reward for his valor. The pattern should imply a universe ruled by a benign Provi- dence and a just social order, a universe in which evil (defined as opposition to that social order and thus to Providence) is always punished and virtue (conformity to the social order and the will of Providence) always rewarded. Ultimately, the novel does take such a pattern. However, in the first half of the book there are in- dications of a different and conflicting one, a pattern similar to that of Far from the Madding Crowd and The Woodlanders, a tragic pattern which would imply some of the themes of the early poetry. According to it, the characters should be complex, divided figures. Cytherea should be possessed, against her moral reason, by a natural impulse to attract men and should entice both Manston and Springrove to love her. She should so let her sexual instinct overcome her reason as to give herself to Manston, the most sexually attractive but the least worthy of the two. From this mistake should arise some sort of catastrophe, accelerated by the arbitrary working out of the course of events. This pattern ap- pears only fitfully and finally disappears almost altogether, but it is definitely evident in the first half of the novel, especially in Hardy's conception of his main characters, in the early develop- ment of the central love situation, and in the use of the rustic chorus. The major characters are established at first as divided figures, potential characters in a Hardyan love tangle. They have some attributes of conventional types, but they are more complex than is necessary for the sensation novel pattern. They have unusual in- tellectual concerns, concerns implying some of Hardy's themes, and they have an irrationality, especially in their sexual impulses,</page><page sequence="5">The Victorian Sensation Novel 39 that is quite unconventional. Because of their complexity, they do not fall into simple categories of good and evil. Miss Aldclyffe as the evil manipulating outsider suggests a melodramatic stereotype, the tyrannical, scheming virago.9 And yet she is more than that. She is also a rather pitiful creature, frustrated by the social repression of her sexual drive. Her moti- vation for trying to arrange a marriage between Manston and Cytherea is not jealousy or malevolence but rather a sort of substitute gratification. Because of a previous illicit affair with her cousin, she was socially ineligible to marry Ambrose Graye, the man she loved. The marriage of her illegitimate son to Graye's daughter becomes her "sweet dream," her means of symbolically satisfying her love.'0 She is not a simple evildoer, but is to some extent a victim of her own passions and the social system. Similarly, Manston is more than a conventional, consciously malevolent villain." Like Miss Aldclyffe, he is also somewhat the victim of the irrational forces that seize him. He is sexually at- tractive and accounts for it by "the law of natural selection" (ch. ix, pt. 6, p. 182).12 He himself has a strong sexual impulse, a "susceptibility of heart" (ch. viii, pt. 4, p. 150), with which he un- successfully struggles. Given uncontrollable desires that his social and natural environment prevents him from satisfying, he is a "satanic" rebel against an unjust universe: By collecting the round of expressions that they [his eyes] gave forth, a person who theorized on such matters would have imbibed the no- tion that their owner was of a nature to kick against the pricks; the last man in the world to put up with a position because it seemed his 9 Malcolm Elwin's description of one of the recurring types in the novels of Mrs. Henry Wood would roughly fit her: "There is usually a virago of middle-age- often a step-mother-who works a load of mischief under the inspiration of malevo- lence or jealousy" (Victorian Wallflowers [London, 1934], p. 253). (The example Elwin uses, Mrs. Clenwaring from Dene Hollow, has, interestingly enough, a tall, dark, fierce, dissipated, villainish son who inherits her vices.) Guerard, too, notes that in one aspect "she is a Dickensian figure of illegitimate domination working on Cytherea's imagination" (p. 103). 10 Guerard comments at length on her doubleness and her symbolic satisfactions (p. 104). The scene in which she comes to Cytherea's bed has strange, Lesbian overtones. Hardy would seem to see this aberration as simply another means of substitute grati- fication. Guerard states that Hardy probably "had no idea what he was writing about," yet showed a relationship that is "unmistakably that of a Lesbian attachment" (p. 105). 11Guerard likewise comments on his doubleness, both "a damaged soul, longing to do right, and a very melodramatic stage villain" (p. 97). 12All citations are to the Wessex Edition (London: Macmillan and Company, 1912).</page><page sequence="6">40 Nineteenth-Century Fiction destiny to do so; one who took upon himself to resist fate with the vindictive determination of a Theomachist (ch. viii, pt. 4, p. 150). In the first section of the novel, at least, he raises the question of whether he is not more sinned against by the universe than sinning. Edward Springrove also raises unresolved questions. No con- ventional hero, he voices disquieting thoughts quite inappropriate to the simple world of melodrama. He is an idealist, disillusioned by what he has seen of Natural Law and society, one who is always, according to his father, " 'thinking o' perfection in things, and then sickened that there is no such thing as perfection' " (ch. viii, pt. 3, p. 147). He is bitter because society is so structured that he cannot make a living writing verse (ch. iii, pt. 2, p. 48).13 His one experi- ence in love has been such as to make him echo the sexual pessimism of Hardy's poetry: He says that your true lover breathlessly finds himself engaged to a sweetheart, like a man who has caught something in the dark. He doesn't know whether it is a bat or a bird, and takes it to the light when he is cool to learn what it is. He looks to see if she is the right age, but right age or wrong age, he must consider her a prize. Sometime later he ponders whether she is the right kind of prize for him. Right kind or wrong kind-he has called her his, and must abide by it. After a time, he asks himself, "has she the temper, hair, and eyes I meant to have, and was firmly resolved not to do without?" He finds it all wrong, and then comes the tussle (ch. ii, pt. 3, p. 25).14 Most important among the characters is Cytherea. Like Bath- sheba Everdene of Far from the Madding Crowd, she is not just 13 Hardy comments on the dissatisfactions inherent in such a society: "It is a melan- choly truth for the middle classes, that in proportion as they develop, by the study of poetry and art, their capacity for conjugal love of the highest and purest kind, they limit the possibility of their being able to exercise it-the very act putting out of their power the attainment of means sufficient for marriage. The man who works up a good income has had no time to learn love in its solemn extreme; the man who has learnt that has had no time to get rich" (p. 50). 14 Note the very close resemblance to the earlier poem, "At Waking." Hardy has admitted that much of the material of the early poetry appears in the novel, further evidence of his divided purpose: "The reader may discover, when turning over this sensational and strictly conventional narrative, that certain scattered reflections and sentiments therein are the same in substance with some of the Wessex Poems and others, published many years later. The explanation of such tautology is that the poems were written before the novel, but as the author could not get them printed, he incontinently used here whatever of their content came into his head as being apt for the purpose-after dissolving it into prose, never anticipating at that time that the poems would see the light" (vi).</page><page sequence="7">The Victorian Sensation Novel 41 the sweet, innocent virginal heroine of melodrama, but is rather somewhat of an instinctive coquette. Moved by "the instincts of her sex" (ch. i, pt. 3, p. 8), she effortlessly and unconsciously at- tracts male attention. Her flirtatiousness and fickleness are sym- bolized by her steering in circles while boating with and flirting with Springrove (ch. iii, pt. 2, pp. 44-45). Her instinctive recep- tivity to male domination appears in the strange storm scene when she is almost mesmerized by Manston, so attracted that his "pres- ence fascinated her into involuntariness of bearing" (ch. xiii, pt. 1, p. 266). Her instinctive animal jealousy appears in her meeting with Adelaide Hinton: The two rivals had now lost their personality quite. There was the same keen brightness of eye, the same movement of the mouth, the same mind in both, as they looked doubtingly and excitedly at each other. As is invariably the case with women when a man they care for is the subject of excitement among them, the situation abstracted the differences which distinguished them as individuals, and left only the properties common to them as atoms of sex (ch. viii, pt. 2, p. 135).15 Instinctive in her sexual conduct, she is likewise instinctive in her will to live. She bounces back from the shock of her father's death: There is in us an unquenchable expectation, which at the gloomiest time persists in inferring that because we are ourselves, there must be a special future in store for us, though our nature and antecedents to the remotest particular have been common to thousands (ch. i, pt. 5p p. 13).16 Her instinctive resilience is symbolized beautifully by the trees the morning of her marriage-so weighted with frost as to be bent almost double and yet, on the whole, holding up. She ex- plicitly relates them to her situation, establishing the symbol: "I never could have believed it possible," she thought, surveying the bowed-down branches, "that trees would bend so far out of their true positions without breaking.... Or that I could so exactly have imi- tated them" (ch. xiii, pt. 1, p. 269). As a creature of such powerful instincts, she is unable to live by 15 Note the similarity to the scene with the milkmaids in Tess, bk. III, ch. xxiii. 16 The passage is similar to one used to describe Fitzpiers' attitude in The Wood- landers, ch. xvi.</page><page sequence="8">42 Nineteenth-Century Fiction reason. Sexually attracted to Springrove, she allows her imagina- tion to build glorified images so that he "stood a cubit higher in her imagination than he did in his shoes" (ch. v, pt. 1, p. 64). She often acts instinctively, only to regret it later. As with later Hardy heroines, such as Tess and Sue Bridehead, the conflict between reason and instinct leads to a masochistic sense of guilt. She takes "a wayward pleasure in giving herself misery, as was her wont" (ch. viii, p. 2, p. 137). She has that "illogical power entirely de- nied to men in general-the power not only of kissing, but of delighting to kiss the rod by a punctilious observance of the self- immolating doctrines in the Sermon on the Mount" (ch. xii, pt. 1, p. 240). She "could not help indulging in a woman's pleasure of re-creating defunct agonies and lacerating herself with them now and then" (ch. xii, pt. 7, p. 257). This tendency is most evident in a strange masochistic dream she has of being whipped by Manston (ch. xiii, pt. 1. p. 268)-a symbol both of her instinctive attraction to his masculine mastery and her desire for punishment because of her sense of the unworthiness of that attraction. Thus the major characters implicitly raise the problem of man's. instinctive irrationality. They imply the plight of the conscious individual in an unconscious universe, ruled by irrational forces that are beyond his control. They are the material for a Hardyan love tragedy. At first the love situation arising from the interaction of these characters seems to move toward a tragic conclusion. The back- ground to the situation has tragic implications. Miss Aldclyffe, seduced by a cousin, bears an illegitimate child and is kept by shame from marrying Ambrose Graye, the man whom she really loves. Ambrose is broken by the disappointment and later marries a second choice and settles down to a frustrated existence. He sees love as a delusion and warns his son against it: He said, "Owen, don't love too blindly; blindly you will love if you love at all, but a little care is still possible to a well-disciplined heart. May that heart be yours as it was not mine.... Cultivate the art of renunciation" (ch. i, pt. 4, p. 13). The main love situation also begins as if it were to lead to a catastrophe.17 Cytherea, ripe for love, instinctively attracts Spring- 17 Harvey Webster comments that the characters "follow the pattern of his (Hardy's) 'sexual pessimism' to a degree surprising in so conventional a novel" (On a Darkling Plain: the Art and Thought of Thomas Hardy [Chicago, 1947], p. 97).</page><page sequence="9">The Victorian Sensation Novel 43 grove. They enter that "Eden-like" period "at the dawn of the emotion when it is not recognized by name, before the considera- tion of what this love has given birth to, the consideration of what difficulties it tends to create" (ch. iii, pt. 2, p. 43). Already engaged to Adelaide Hinton, he yields to the attraction. Each imaginatively idealizes the other. Then Miss Aldclyffe enters to complicate matters. She introduces Cytherea to Manston, who is already secretly married to a dissolute actress. Cytherea immedi- ately attracts and is attracted to him, against her will. Manston fights his own sexual impulse, controls himself, only to be con- fronted with the return of his drunken wife. The plot builds toward catastrophe as the process of sexual selection leads to a complicated situation in which someone must get hurt. Meanwhile, the rustics provide an occasional choric background. Their comments imply the nature of the forces at work. When Mrs. Leat discovers that a woman has been visiting Manston, she states that " 'Whatever may be the truth on't I trust the Lord will settle it all for the best as He always do.' " Mrs. Crickett answers that "'I have always found the Lord a different sort of feller'" (ch. ix, pt. 4, p. 175). The coachman, commenting on Miss Aldclyffe's conduct, declares that " 'the Lord must be a neglectful party at heart, or he'd never permit such overbearen goings on! ' " (ch. v, pt. 1, p. 68). Similarly, Clerk Crickett and Farmer Spring- grove watch the love tangle grow and comment on the vanity and irrationality of woman, the strangeness of Fate, and the wonders of matrimony, that "'do begin wi' 'Dearly Beloved,' and ends wi' 'Amazement,' as the prayer book says'" (ch. viii, pt. 3, p. 142). These wise innocents seem to see an arbitrary Fate working through irrational love to bring unhappiness to the main char- acters. Chance, the usual accelerating factor of the Hardyan drama, enters with the return of Manston's wife. By accident Manston misreads the railroad schedule and fails to meet her. She arrives, finds the house locked, and angrily goes to-the inn. Here, by the inexorable and arbitrary workings of Natural Law, a smoldering weed fire, a thatch roof, and a capricious gust of wind interact to produce a fire that burns down the inn. A host of anthropomorphic images in the detailed description of the fire imply the workings of an active force hostile to man:</page><page sequence="10">44 Nineteenth-Century Fiction But the continuance of this quiet process is throughout its length at the mercy of one particular whim of Nature. It truly seemed as if the treacherous element knew there had arisen a grand opportunity for devastation. But Nature does few things directly. After many intermediate deposits and seemingly baffled attempts, another fragment fell on the mangelwurzel grave. The autumn wind, tameless and swift, and proud, still blew upon the dying old house. All stood still, and gazed silently, awestruck and helpless, in the pres- ence of so irresistible an enemy (ch. x, pt. 2). The fire brings about the turning point of the novel. Manston thinks that his wife has perished in it. He returns home and falls on his knees to thank "some Being or Personality, who in frigid moments is dismissed with the title of Chance, or at most Law" (ch. x, pt. 7, p. 210). But, arising from his "prayer," he sees his wife, who has miraculously escaped from the fire but has been seen by no one but a porter. His revolt rises to the surface: "I gnashed my teeth in a frenzy of despair; I had lost Cytherea; I had gained one whose beauty had departed, whose utterance was com- plaint, whose mind was shallow, and who drank brandy every day. The revulsion of feeling was terrible. Providence, whom I had just thanked, seemed a mocking tormentor laughing at me. I felt like a madman" (ch. xxi, pt. 1, p. 433). He hits her and accidentally kills her. In striking her down, he is really trying to strike down an unjust God, a God who gives men desires for happiness but denies them the means to fulfill those desires. His passionate action turned by accident into a serious crime, he fearfully hides the body. If Hardy had shown us this scene, the novel might well have become a love tragedy, and Manston would be seen as a victim of the inner and outer forces of Natural Law. However, Hardy cloaks the event in mystery. He omits the meeting of Manston and his wife without any hint to the reader that such an event took place, only to reveal it in Manston's confession 200 pages later. The technical problem involved here is significant. Hardy has written the novel from the omniscient point of view. Such a technique is satisfactory for a love tragedy in which there is no</page><page sequence="11">The Victorian Sensation Novel 45 mystery and in which the reader understands and to some extent sympathizes with the motives for the crime. Thus, for example, Dreiser uses an omniscient point of view in An American Tragedy and presents to us both the crime and the full motivation of the tragic criminal. On the other hand, in a sensation or mystery novel in which the total effect depends on the reader's not knowing the motives and identity of the criminal until the end, such a technique is inappropriate. The author needs to use a limited point of view so that he will not seem to be withholding anything from the reader for the sake of mystifying him.18 If the story is told from the limited point of view of the characters who are trying to solve the mystery, then the reader shares the process of discovery. For example, Wilkie Collins in The Moonstone and The Woman in White has a series of characters tell the story, and Conan Doyle has the rather obtuse Dr. Watson narrate the Sher- lock Holmes stories. If Hardy wanted to write a sensation novel in which the emphasis was on the mystery surrounding the crime, not on the tragic plight of the criminal,19 he should have used such a limited point of view. He does use such a technique in some sections of the novel (notably the scene in which Manston digs up the body), but, on most occasions when it is necessary to keep information from the reader, he either arbitrarily leaves out the event or he suddenly blocks out parts of the scene so that we cannot see what a character is thinking or hear what he is saying.20 By arbitrarily leaving out the crucial action here, he 18 See Norman Friedman, "Point of View in Fiction: The Development of a Critical Concept," PMLA, LXXX (December, 1955), 1181. 19 W. H. Auden makes this distinction to point out the difference between the mystery as "detective story" and the mystery as "work of art" ("The Guilty Vicarage," The Critical Performance, edited by Stanley Edgar Hyman [New York, 1956], pp. 313-314). Edward Wagenknecht makes a similar distinction in differentiating the use of mystery in The Moonstone and The New Magdalen (Cavalcade of the English Novel [New York, 1954], p. 239). Hardy himself seemed aware of such a distinction in 1887 when he wrote the following note: "A 'sensation-novel' is possible in which the sensationalism is not casualty, but evolution-not physical but psychical.... The difference between the latter kind of novel and the novel of physical sensationalism- i.e. personal adventure, etc.-is this: that whereas in the physical the adventure itself is the subject of interest, the psychical results being passed over as commonplace, in the psychical the casualty or adventure is held to be of no intrinsic interest, but the effect upon the faculties is the important matter to be depicted" (Early Life, p. 284). 20 Note the following instances of arbitrary withholding of information: (a), Manston overhearing the "ear-witness" account of his crime (ch. xiv, pt. 1, pp. 314-315); (b), Raunham's discussion with Springrove concerning Manston (ch. xviii, pt. 2, p. 380); (c), Manston watching his wife on the train (ch. iv, pt. 2, pp. 165-166); (d), Manston's</page><page sequence="12">46 Nineteenth-Century Fiction irrevocably commits himself to a sensation novel and shows how inappropriate for such a novel was the technique he had originally chosen. Now, with this key omission, the center of interest must change from the tragic clash of desires in the love tangle to the unravelling of the mystery. The tragic pattern continues awhile. Manston comes to court Cytherea, and Hardy implies that at least one reason for her yielding to him is his sexual attractiveness. There is an important scene in which he courts her by the swampy river. The setting is significant: "The helpless flatness of landscape" gives her "a sense of bare equality with, and no superiority to, a single entity under the sky." As Manston pushes the suit and takes her hand, she looks at "the fragment of a hedge-all that remained of a 'wet old garden'-standing in the middle of the mead, without a defi- nite beginning or ending, purposeless and valueless." The hedge is "overgrown and choked with mandrakes" so that "she could almost fancy she heard the shrieks." She surrenders to Manston, allows him to continue with his suit, and feels as "one in a boat without oars, drifting down a river-she knew not whither" (ch. xiii, pt. 6, p. 21). There is the implication that Cytherea is passive because of the influence of natural environment and circumstance; she is helpless in the grip of Natural Law, like all other things "under the sky." And all of this process is without purpose, as the old hedge suggests. All this pain and suffering in human affairs is like the seeming pain and oppressiveness of the mandrakes and weeds-the result of natural growth in a garden that has no overseeing "gardener." The scene at least suggests a Hardyan love tangle, a tragic mismating coming about through the inner and outer workings of nature.21 But this pattern soon fades out. Manston wins Cytherea, not because he is sexually attractive, but because Miss Aldclyffe elimi- nates Springrove as a suitor through threatening to foreclose on Farmer Springrove and because Owen Graye's illness puts Cytherea in financial need. The marriage is thus brought about by a varia- mental resume of the night of the fire, in which it is implied that he does not know whether his wife is dead or not (ch. xviii, p. 3, p. 381); (e), Miss Aldclyffe's mysterious planning concerning Manston (ch. vii, pt. 1, pp. 110-111); and (f), Miss Aldclyffe's con-, versation with Manston on. November 29th (ch. xi, pt. 1, p. 210). In each case Hardy arbitrarily deprives the reader of the thoughts or conversation of one of the char- acters. 21 Parts of the scene and even fragments of the phrasing are extremely similar to a passage with Eustacia and Clym in The Retur-n of the Native, bk. III, ch. v.</page><page sequence="13">The Victorian Sensation Novel 47 tion on the old melodramatic motifs of the sick family and the threat of foreclosing the mortgage. After the marriage, the conventional sensation pattern becomes dominant. The unravelling of the mystery becomes the motive force of the novel. The characters shrink to the undivided types of melodrama so that Manston becomes a simple villain, Spring- grove a resourceful hero, Cytherea an innocent heroine. Chance occurrences still influence the action but, unlike the fire episode, they are simply plot devices (and implicit proofs of Providence)22 rather than concrete representations of the action of an arbitrary Natural Law. There are, however, occasional incongruous sections that imply some of Hardy's themes. Among these are various rather irrele- vant authorial comments that raise Hardy's concerns. While searching for evidence, Springrove meets Mrs. Higgins, whose life is "a depressing picture of married life among the very poor of the city." Hardy comments on her plight as an example of one of the most "ingenious and cruel satires that from the beginning till now have been stuck like knives into womankind," that "the most wretched of men can, in the twinkling of an eye, find a wife ready to be more wretched still for the sake of his company" (ch. xvi, pt. 4, pp. 350-351). Thus implications of social protest and sexual pessimism rather incongruously enter. Later, Hardy shows Manston in London observing almost unconsciously that all of the different people going in different directions were "like the inwoven threads which form a banner" but were "unconscious of the significant whole they collectively showed forth" (ch. xvi, pt. 4, p. 350).23 The passage is isolated and undeveloped, but it implies Hardy's later view of the Immanent Will, the omnipotent life force made up of individual manifestations of life.24 22An exception would be typically Hardyan chance motif of the confusion over dates which causes Cytherea to marry Manston just hours too soon for Springrove to be free to claim her. 23Note how Hardy juxtaposes his omniscient naturalistic view with Manston's limited individual view. Note also the resemblance of the description of' the woman to the earlier poem "The Ruined Maid." The passage is a good example of what W. L. Myers calls Hardy's use of "the trivial or irrelevant as a matter of consciousness" (The Later Realism: A Study of Characterization in the British Novel [Chicago, 1927], p. 141). 24 Ernest Brennecke, Jr. (Thomas Hardy's Universe: A Study of a Poet's Mind [London, 1924], p. 41) notes the similarity to the pictures of the workings of the Immanent Will in The Dynasts and cites the passage as evidence of the continuity of Hardy's thought.</page><page sequence="14">48 Nineteenth-Century Fiction At the end, elements of the earlier tragic pattern re-enter. Manston's written confession (found after his suicide) removes him from the category of conventional villain. The tragic nature of his crime becomes clear, and his bitter statements form an in- dictment of Natural Law: "'Having found man's life to be a wretchedly conceived scheme, I renounce it' " (ch. xxi, pt. i, p. 432). Farmer Springrove's thoughtful comment as he sees Manston's coffin lends dignity to the dead man and implies that the tragic affair was the result of the inevitable workings of Fate: Ah, Baker, we say sudden death, don't we? But there's no difference in their nature between sudden death and death of any other sort. There's no such thing as a random snapping off of what was laid down to last longer. We only suddenly light upon an end-thoughtfully formed as any other-which had been existing at that very same point from the beginning, though unseen by us to be so soon. It is just a discovery to your own mind, and not an alteration in the Lord's. That's it. Unexpected is not as to the thing, but as to our sight (ch. xxi, pt. 1, p. 43). However, the ending is strictly conventional. Miss Aldclyffe must catch a chill helping Manston try to escape and must then die as punishment for her evil-doing. Springrove must win Cytherea, and there must be no question as to their future marital happiness. The tragic elements are suppressed, Manston is forgotten, and the novel ends on the C-major chord of convention. D. H. Lawrence well summarizes the "morality play" conclusion: "The Murderer, overtaken by vengeance, is put to death, whilst Divine Justice descends upon the Adultress. Then the Virgin unites with the Virgin Knight and receives Divine Blessing." 25 III The novel thus illustrates the clash between Hardy's "idiosyn- cratic mode of regard" and the conventions demanded by the late- Victorian reading audience. Some elements of his later tragic patterns appear: the early development of the love situation as an example of the working of sexual selection, the full early de- 25"A Study of Thomas Hardy," Phoenix: The Posthumous Papers of D.

But the require- ments of the conventional pattern are too great; with a rather clumsy jolt after the fire scene, Hardy turns the book in a conven- tional direction so that the novel as a whole is a sensation novel. Because Hardy cut off the potential love tragedy when he did, the conventional pattern is not obscured, the novel does not give the impression of being drastically discontinuous. The opening chapters, like the first acts of Measure for Measure, form a usable, if somewhat unnecessarily complex, rising action for a melodrama as well as for a tragedy. Hardy's excision of the climactic murder is analogous to Shakespeare's having the Duke overhear the climac- tic scene between Claudio and Isabella; his consequent change in the dominant interest from the love situation to the mystery is similar to Shakespeare's change from a potentially tragic situa- tion to an elaborate, melodramatic, ultimately comic plot. Although the clash of tragic and conventional patterns does not lead to a radically divided structure, it does lead to a diminution of the vitality and significance of the fictional world. Once Hardy is irrevocably committed to a sensation novel, the vitality inherent in his own tragic vision is lost. The simplification of melodrama re- places the vital complexity of the Hardyan drama. The characters in the last half of the book shrink into conventional stereotypes; the setting, which had taken on at least some symbolic value in the marsh and fire scenes, becomes mere backdrop; the chance events, which had had some significance as examples of the arbitrary workings of Natural Law, become mere authorial manipulations; the rustics, who had served as a tragic chorus, become irrelevant local color. The real weakness of the book is that Hardy, after a brief struggle, rejected a potentially vital personal pattern for an oversimplified, melodramatic pattern that did not suit his natural gifts. Later, in his major novels, Hardy came to resolve this conflict more fruitfully, to express his personal vision more freely. But in Desperate Remedies, as he himself admitted in his 1889 preface to the novel, he compromised that personal vision too much in order to force it into conventional molds: The following novel, the first published by the author, was written nineteen years ago, at a time when he was feeling his way to a method.</page><page sequence="16">50 Nineteenth-Century Fiction The principles observed in its composition are, no doubt, too exclu- sively those in which mystery, entanglement, surprise, and moral ob- liquity are depended on for exciting interest; but some of the scenes, and at least one or two of the characters, have been deemed not un- worthy of a little longer preservation; and as they could hardly be reproduced in a fragmentary form the novel is reissued complete (p. vi).</page></plain_text>
