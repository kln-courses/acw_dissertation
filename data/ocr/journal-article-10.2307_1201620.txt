Albany: State University of New York Press, 1976. xiv+344 pp. $20.00. This powerful, imaginative book is built on the thesis that the Hellenic perception of divinity as the form of recurrent events can deliver us from the perverse magnification of and bondage to the will which stems from the Judeo-Christian tradition. The Christian God, to Curtis Bennett, is a great projection of the human will, and faith in such a God prevents that ac- ceptance of reality as it is, which is the essence of true (Hellenic) piety. Bennett has read his Greeks profoundly, and he enriches his interpretation by perceiving the deep parallels between ancient Greek paganism and a central group of American writers, particularly Whitman and Wallace Stevens. He holds that a coherent perception of divinity as form moves through Greek poetry and philosophy from Homer through Sappho and Pindar and the tragedians to Thucydides and Plato, with Xenophanes marking a shift away from the anthropomorphism of the earlier perception but not altering its basic substance. The Greek perception of divinity, as Bennett presents it, is essentially an act of phe- nomenological reduction, by which one stands outside of oneself and sees the processes at work in one's life and environment not as assertions of one's own will or individuality, but as expressions of the various recurrent natural forms which shape our destiny. "The Greek gods are not another world governing this one for their own moral or self-glorifying ends; they are the forms for the pressures, the energies, the processes revealed as event in this one" (p. 15). The implication is that one finds oneself by losing one's self-assertive identity and accepting the wonder of mortal existence with its pressures, including sexuality (Sappho) and mortality (Pindar). Central to his presentation is the Castor and Polydeukes myth as set forth by Pindar; the identification of Castor and Polydeukes does not represent some emotional brotherly love (brothers more commonly feel for each other as did Cain and Abel, Eteocles and Polynices), but the recognition of the relatedness of the psyche. In particular, the myth presents the miracle of the wonder of existence known in the acceptance of death (Polydeukes' identification with his mortal brother). This recognition of the presence of death 70</page><page sequence="2">Reviews in life and life in death is the true doctrine of the Incarnation, which is blunderingly carried forward in the Christian faith, turned aside from its true meaning by the wrongheaded glorification of individual will and hence longing for immortality in Christianity. The penetrating interpretations of Homer, Sappho, Pindar, Thucydides, and Plato can only be mentioned here. They are all well worth pondering. The book conducts a constant warfare against the patriarchal style of Jewish and Christian apotheosis of will (as the author perceives it), in the process putting some sharp questions to this tradition. Bennett's treatment of early Christianity finds the true dynamic center of that faith as the Greek myth of the Son of God, which means the presence of God in man to be recognized as the wonder of recurring form. This myth entered Christianity before the time of our earliest written sources, which already show a mixture of the true Greek faith and the Hebraic, will-centered, self-centered view which demands a literal resurrection. This analysis does not enter into dialogue with earlier writers who had dealt with this sort of issue, such as Wilhelm Bousset, or with con- temporary scholars like Hans Dieter Betz who study the interaction of Hellenism and early Christianity. It suffers from a certain unevenness, but it does raise important questions whatever one makes of the specific historical reconstruction. Bennett does not inquire into the social locus of that rigorous willingness to accept the given, that resolute conformity of individual will to what is, that for him is the touchstone of Greek religion. Nor does he study Greek popular religion. It is clear that the "theology" which Bennett presents is a thoroughly aristocratic one. It is rebels or outsiders, wanderers in the desert or social rejects in the Hellenistic world, who visualize a process imaged as will which, sometimes with, sometimes without their participation, will work a change in the way things are. Of course either the aristocrat or the outsider may be the victim of ideology. Thus the book leaves us with an important choice: Are the deeper insights likely to come from the es- tablished or from the disestablished? Surely the formative insights of the Judeo-Christian tradition originated with the latter, and this tradition cannot maintain its vitality unless it maintains some real contact with the outsiders of successive generations of society. To say this, however, only leaves open the question of how such a tradition is to deal with the aris- tocratic and reality-accepting faith so brilliantly described by Curtis Bennett. WILLIAM A.
