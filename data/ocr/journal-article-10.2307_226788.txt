The motives that impelled a physicist of the stature of Professor Schrodinger to dis- cuss early Greek thought about nature are of importance for the history of science, because he expects help from this historical investi- gation. Our philosophy and our knowledge, he argues in the introductory chapter, have become divided. In a world shaken in its very foundations, the "'two paths,' that of the heart and that of pure reason," seem separated as if by a wall (p. ii). Thus we look back to the Greeks where it was "still agreed that the true subject was essentially one" (p. I2) in the hope that we may find a way out of the separation. There is, more- over, good reason to turn just to the Greeks, for it is from them that the special features of a scientific world picture were derived. If, on the positive side, the Greeks represent scientific thought before its separation from religion and philosophy, they may, on the negative side, also reveal the weak points that have led to a crisis in modem basic science, a crisis "that points to the necessity of re- vising its foundations down to very early layers" (p. i6). Thus, "there is not only . . . hope of unearthing obliterate wisdom, but also of discovering inveterate error at the source, where it is easier to recognize" (p. i6 f.). This program of the little book is pursued through six subsequent chapters, five of which are devoted to various aspects of pre-Socratic philosophy, arranged according to a connec- tion of subjects rather than in chronological order. In these chapters Professor Schro- dinger shows not only his intimate acquaint- ance with the pre-Socratics but also his love for them, a love that at times leads him beyond the framework of his initial questions. He believes that Parmenides and Protagoras represented the two extreme sides in the age- old competition of reason versus senses, al- though a truly scientific attitude only became discernible with the Pythagoreans on the one hand, and the group comprising the Ionian philosophers of nature, Heraclitus and Xe- nophanes, and the Atomists on the other. The Pythagoreans reduced the world to numbers, and their particular biases helped to lay the foundation for a heliocentric system. More- over, by having the earth move as a planet they achieved an admirable liberation from prejudice. The other group was held together by taking the world as given to us by our senses. The agnosticism of Xenophanes and the enlightenment of the Ionians changed the world from a playground of capricious gods to a universe that can be understood accord- ing to "eternal innate laws" (p. 55). The Ionians, in particular, believed that all matter is intrinsically the same stuff and that rare- faction and condensation are transformations of matter (Anaximenes). This latter tenet led to the atomism of Democritus, while Heraclitus, by his emphasis on what is "com- mon" helped to form the idea of a world around us in which "reality" consists of the overlapping sensations and experiences which all men share. Democritus, who gave this idea the form of an atomistic world in which the soul itself is composed of atoms and thus made subject to determinism, was aware of the fatal consequences of a "reality" that excludes man's most intimate experiences. Thus the Greeks themselves recognized the</page><page sequence="2">390 BOOK REVIEWS danger of that feature of a scientific philos- ophy which, according to Professor Schro- dinger's last chapter, weighs so heavily upon us. This last chapter raises the question as to "what are the special features" of our sci- entific outlook that we owe to the Greeks? The answer given is a summary of the book. To the Greeks we owe the conviction that the display of nature can be understood, but also the concept of a reality which eliminates the mind of the observer and leaves the world void of all those things which are of deepest concern to us. Professor Schrodinger's analysis of pre- Socratic thought has, apparently, helped him to a deeper insight into the philosophical position of modern science. The specific answers he found to his questions will, how- ever, not be acceptable to everybody, at least not without qualification. Generally speaking, it seems to me that he has still carried over too much of the attitude of the modern physicist into his investigation. By limiting himself to the pre-Socratics and here again to those facets that seem related to modern physics, he has succeeded in tracing our pic- ture of the meaningless universe to the Greeks. An inclusion of Aristotelian philos- ophy would have revealed a picture that did not abstract from the mind of the observer. But the Aristotelian type of science was given up in the seventeenth century in favor of the type we have now. The burden then lies with us who chose among the various possibilities the Greeks offered. Moreover, Professor Schrodinger's Greek sources are open to some- what different interpretation where the "un- derstanding" of nature is concerned. He is well aware that the meaning of this term is not obvious and its application to physics questioned by rigorous Positivists. Beyond this one may ask whether a universe of natu- ral law is really more "understandable" than a universe of anthropomorphic gods. It is more rational and predictable; but even the capricious acts of men-like gods seem more directly understandable to us. It is not even certain that the scientific understanding was quite as abstract as it would appear to Pro- fessor Schrodinger. In one of the finest sec- tions of his book he characterizes the essen- tial feature of atomism, both ancient and modern, as "a means for bridging the gulf between the real bodies of physics and the idealized geometrical shapes of pure mathe- matics" (p. 86). This is a scientific explana- tion of atomism which disregards the possi- bility of atoms standing for individuals all interacting with one another. I do not know whether this animistic image of atomism can be imputed to Democritus; but there is little doubt that it existed in the minds of some scientists from the seventeenth century on. These remarks are not intended as criticism of the book. Professor Schrodinger will hardly have expected the answers to his ques- tions to be accepted as final. The great value of the book consists in the lucid formulation of the problems. He has shown in an ex- emplary fashion how fruitful it is to raise these particular questions and how rewarding the study of Greek science can be made to the historian and the scientist.
