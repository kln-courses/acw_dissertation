Kerry In recent years the surveys of both the Dingle and Iveragh peninsulas have vastly increased our knowledge of the archaeo logical site type known as rock art. The discovery rate of inscribed rocks has ensured that the south-west of Ireland is synony mous with this type of monument. Several new rock art motifs, not previously known in the Irish repertoire of decorations, have also been identified. It is generally accepted that the main corpus of rock art dates from the Bronze Age, but it may have its genesis in the Neolithic. Similarities with passage grave art have also been suggested. The meaning of rock art motifs still eludes us, and indeed there are almost as many suggestions as to its function as there are inscribed rucks. Left?Decorated rock face, from north.

Archaeology Ireland Autumn 2001 Two field-walkers discovered this beauti fully decorated piece of rock art in February 2001. Becoming curious, they lifted the growth of peat which covered the southern third of the rock, revealing an additional six incised circles, which form the basis of this article. The main body of decoration is excellently executed and is comparable with the finest pieces known in the country. However, it is the incised circles on the southern side of the rock which may help to fill in another small part or our under standing of the phenomenon of rock art. Location This piece of rock art occurs on a natural outcrop of red sandstone in an area of rough pasture in the townland of Carhoomeegar East. The surrounding land has undergone reclamation in recent years, while the land immediately to the north is bog. The deco rated face of the rock is inclined towards the Collins touring map of Ireland 17</page><page sequence="3">east, where Mangerton Mountain dominates the skyline, and the recently discovered radial-stone cairn on the crest of Mangerton Beg is visible from the site. Peakeen Moun tain is immediately to the north, while Boughil Mountain is to the north-west and the waters of Kenmare Bay are visible to the south. Though not visible, the Paps Moun tains are about ten miles to the east of this site. The nearest recorded piece of rock art is approximately five miles to the west, and there is some debate as to the authenticity of this particular piece. Another recently recorded piece is located near Kilgarvan (Archaeology Ireland 11 (3), Autumn 1997), some eight miles to the east of Kenmare. The concentration of rock art at Derrynablaha, approximately eight miles to the north-west, is the largest in the country. Description This decorated stone measures 3m north-south by 2.85m east-west and is a splendid example of this type of monument. The main area of decoration, on the northern side of the rock face, has been placed within a cordon in the form of a curving, wide, shallow groove. The separa tion of the decorated area from the rest of the rock face serves to increase the dramatic effect. This cordon takes the form of a large shallow groove, 3cm in width, curving from west through to north. In total it contains twelve cup-and-single-rings, four cup-and two-rings, and one cup-and-three-rings which has two parallel radial lines extending from the inner ring through the outer rings. The rock face also contains five unenclosed cupmarks. A series of short grooves link the outer rings of some of the unenclosed rings with other outer element* of nearby motifs. Five incised conjoined rings and one single incised ring are to be found outside the main area of decoration on the south side of the rock face. A central groove runs east-west along the area of decoration before joining with a naturally occurring crack in the rock. A second, broader groove extends through the cordon before disappearing off the edge of the rock face. The most prominent motif which leaps out to meet the eye, especially when viewed from the east, are a pair of cup-and-rings, each with a groove extending from its outer 18 The overall effect is anthropomorphic, the cup-and-rings appearing as a pair of staring eyes and the parallel grooves simulating a slender neck ring. The overall effect is anthropomorphic, the cup-and-rings appearing as a pair of staring eyes and the parallel grooves simu lating a slender neck. Is this merely a coin cidence, or is this intended as a stylised face? This type of motif is known from western Europe to Scandinavia, where it has been suggested that the staring eyes repre sent the mother goddess. Face-like designs are also known from Newgrange, Knowth and Fourknocks passage tombs. Is it possible, therefore, that tfte eyes are looking to the east in the direction of the Paps Mountains, the most powerful symbol of the mother goddess in this country (Heritage Guide No. 10)? Function The choice of rock faces and the preferred locations have been discussed at length else where. However, the mechanics of the execution of the designs have been some what overlooked. It is generally accepted that rock art designs were executed with a metal or stone point, but it is not known exactly how the designs were initially laid out on the rock face. Indeed, it does seem that it was not a haphazard exercise, as adorned rock faces show a very controlled use of the decorated area. Were the designs therefore laid out as in a template or simply added at random? If not random, then how was the work surface laid out prior to the commencement of work? As we can see from an overall look at the indigenous examples, there is a certain uniformity in the choice of motifs drawn from a broadly similar repertoire. How, then, were the rock faces treated in advance? As an architect will work from a blueprint, or as an artist works Archaeology Ireland Autumn 2001</page><page sequence="4">Rock art m from a sketch, did the rock art scribes lay out the range of motifs prior to pecking out the designs? Some of the designs and motifs, which we see again and again on decorated rock surfaces, are precisely executed, espe cially in the cup-and-multi-ringed examples. Surely these were not haphazard attempts that time and again resulted in almost perfect circles? This rock art at Kenmare may provide an answer to this question. Underneath, protected by a thick growth of peat and grass, an intriguing design was noted which opened up several possibilities and raised some inter esting questions. Here an assemblage of five conjoined rings with a sixth isolated example to one side was noted. What distinguishes these motifs from the rest of the ornamenta tion on the rock is their method of execution. These rings are incised into the rock surface, as opposed to the pecking technique utilised elsewhere. Each of the rings is exactly the same size, 17cm in diameter, and each exhibits a central indentation, indicating that a compass-like instrument was used in their creation. The workmanship is of an excep tionally high standard as no part of the circle overlaps, thereby making it impossible to discern where the ring began or ended. Parallels This technique of incising the design appears to be almost unique in Irish exam ples of rock art. An incised ring is known from Castle Lachlan, and two are recorded from a stone at Inch Kenneth, both from Argyll in Scotland. It must also be noted that some incised decoration is known from Irish passage grave art, for example Kerbstone 86 at Knowth. These examples from Argyll are very deeply incised, and are obviously meant to stand alone as designs in their own right. Are the incised examples at Kenmare meant to be designs, or were they intended to func tion as a pre-engraving sketch? These incised motifs are so far unparalleled in the known rock art in Kerry. However, a single example of rock art from Srugreana, near Coomduff Mountain on the Iveragh Peninsula, comprises a single shallowly pecked ring Left?Decorated rock, viewed from east. Above?Incised circles. whose centre is marked by a shallow peck mark. It therefore appears likely that this motif was laid out using the same technique as is apparent on the Kenmare example. Conclusion Free-hand drawing of a circle is a very diffi cult technique to master, and in fact only the most accomplished artists can complete this exercise with any degree of exactitude. It would therefore seem unlikely that the more perfect circles and rings were applied to the rocks without the help of a mechan ical aid of some kind. Is it possible that these incised rings represent the technique of laying out circles or rings prior to their being pecked out of the living rock? If, as it appears, these are not motifs in their own right, has this fortuitous discovery allowed us a precious glimpse into the past, to a time when the rock was being prepared for decoration?
