<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AGENT AND THE OBSERVER. I. IN comparing the various modes of viewing human action and experience, there is no contrast more striking than that fur- nished by viewing a situation from within as agent, and viewing it from without as observer. There is no greater difference than the difference between the way a thing feels when you do it your- self, and the way it looks when you see it done by another; be- tween having an experience, and contemplating the expression of such an experience. This contrast of point of view will furnish the subject matter for the following pages, in which it will serve as the basis for a mainly descriptive analysis of the distinction between subject and object. The current modes of stating this distinction are very largely formal. Suppose a pack of cards to represent so many items of experience; the various distinctions of subjective and objective may then be indicated by supposing the cards to be sorted into two groups (not necessarily mutually exclusive) according to cer- tain rules. One rule separates the immediate from the inferred; another the individual and peculiar from the common and uni- versal; a third marks off a mathematically coherent group as ob- jective and scientific, leaving ' subjective' to stand for the residuum. But none of these distinctions seems to effect any important trans- formation in the nature of the terms distinguished; whether a term falls within the subjective or objective group is treated as a mere accident of position involving no difference of quality; whereas, as I aim to show, the distinction involves a difference of quality and interpretation which is world-wide, and is of funda- mental significance for both psychology and metaphysics. Even in the more overt bodily actions there is a surprising dif- ference between how an action looks and how it feels. Things simple in the observing are unaccountably hard in the doing. The successful strokes of another in tennis or billiards seem clearly a matter of course, his failures stupid, and a good game, so easy 489</page><page sequence="2">490 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVII. and graceful in the observing, is full of stress and strain in the playing. Take even a difficult sonata of Beethoven; I can hardly conceive that what seems so easy and natural for the virtuoso is utterly impossible for myself, especially when my impression of the sonata is vivid and its meaning seems clear. Now in these more overt activities the ground of the contrast is to a degree simple. The point of view of the doer is different in a spatial sense from the observer's. The agent views the situation literally ' from the inside' of his body,- that is, he has muscular as well as visual information of his movement. We shall ask presently whether this difference is not of vital significance for the general peculiarity of the agent's view. But the point to be noted at present is that, in contrast to the observer, the agent knows what he is doing,- i. e., he knows the purpose of his action. For him the present act is a term in a continuous process in which it is blended with past terms leading up to it, and with anticipations of future acts to follow, the whole pointing in a more or less definite direction whose signs are mostly hidden from the observer. As we pass from relatively overt acts to more complex attitudes, the contrast of point of view becomes more striking. Sidgwick has noted that, while we are confident that our own acts are the expression of choice (and more confident at the moment of choice), we are disposed to view our neighbor's acts as externally deter- mined. My life-insurance policy is a mark of judgment; my neighbor's is the result of the persistence of the company's agent. This attitude is typical of all of our judgments of self and of others. My neighbor's toothache is never so bad as my own; his grief cannot be so real; nor are his children so essentially interesting. His friends have not the same intelligence, substance, and dignity of character. His opinions are never so obviously sensible. I cannot admit that his appreciation of Beethoven is so thoroughly nice and comprehensive (note the jealousy which guards the musical self). And, above all, where my love-making is a mat- ter so deeply serious, his cannot fail to be somewhat ridiculous. Altogether I find it difficult to credit him with the same richness of inner life that I find in myself, or to believe that his acts have an equal significance.</page><page sequence="3">No. 5.] THE AGENT AND THE OBSERVER. 491 Narrowly speaking, I can never fully appreciate what it is to be any one but myself. Though I know how it feels to be a man, I wonder somewhat how it would feel to be a stout man, or a tall man, or a man of great strength, -as I wonder how it would feel to be President. It is still harder to imagine the inner life of a dog, harder again that of the snail; and how it would seem to be a watch, a steam-engine, or a water-fall, I can hardly even wonder. Yet it is relevant to note that even the last question is not without meaning. The refusal of modern thought to consider an 'inner' side for inorganic activities is based less upon rigid logic than upon practical incredulity. It represents the conven- ience of a simplified science, whose convenience would perhaps be better promoted if the inner side of the world could be dis- missed altogether. It is a question, however, whether the very meaning of scientific inquiry into the ultimate nature, - the inner constitution,' - of physical things is not to arrive at their I inner' nature in just the subjective sense now before us. A scientist may claim that by ' inner' he means only the inside in a sense purely spatial. But why should the inside be so sig- nificant? Because, one may say, by increasingly minute me- chanical analysis he hopes finally to arrive at terms whose rela- tions and interactions are not merely a matter of mechanical fact, but are at the same time logically necessary and self-evident, - in other words, necessary from the standpoint of conception and motive. But this, I suggest, would be equivalent to understand- ing how one would feel obliged to act if one were the object in question, and how it would feel to be that object. The agent's view may thus conceivably be extended to cover any action whatever. On the other hand, in its most intensive meaning, it is restricted not merely to myself and my action gen- erally, but to myself at the moment of action. For between my view of my action at the moment of action and my view of my action as past, there are differences of the same kind, varying according to remoteness in time or feeling, as lie between my view of my own action and my view of my neighbor's; and I never completely know how it feels to do a thing except while I</page><page sequence="4">492 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVII. am doing it. Here, indeed, we have the ground of Kant's dis- tinction between the ego as subject and the ego as object. To be the agent of an experience or activity, and to contemplate your own experience or activity, when necessarily it is in some degree past, are radically different; the way an action feels is never quite the way it looks even to oneself; and so far as the activity is merely looked at, it is looked at more or less in the same way, and presents the same appearance as the activities of other persons. This point is of great importance for the deter- mination of what we mean by introspection; for it may be said of the whole kaleidoscopic show of mental states exhibited as 'the results of introspection' by the usual associational-empir- ical psychology, that it rests less upon a genuinely introspective view than upon the relatively external view of the agent contem- plating his own action as observer. The ' mental state' is ex- hibited, not as it is felt by the agent when it occurs, at most as it appears to him sometime later, but rather as it ought to appear from the standpoint of a science of psychology based upon the observer's view. And so, as my action recedes into the past, I tend to feel about it more or less as I should feel about the action of another per- son. I begin to suspect that my taking out a life-insurance policy a year ago was not unrelated to the persuasiveness of the com- pany's agent. I am ready to join in the cynical or humorous view of my youthful aspirations; what was then tragedy is now more or less comic. And what I wrote a few years ago seems now more or less insipid, though what I now write seems none the less significant. The experiences that I recall of early child- hood seem almost to belong to some one else. Yet this is only the difference, written large, which lies between every act of mine when in the doing and when, as it passes into retrospect, I attempt to fix and hold it in idea. And if, again, we extend our conception of the agent to cover now not merely the whole individual, but a whole generation or historical period, we have the same differences repeated in the ways in which the life of the period appears to those concerned in it and to the historian who describes it. The historian neces-</page><page sequence="5">No. 5.] THE AGENT AND THE OBSERVER. 493 sarily interprets the life of a period in the light of later results, but it is always a question how far these results entered as pur- poses into the consciousness of the time, and how far we, with the later events in mind, can ever reconstruct its actual point of view. Inevitably we think of " when the world was young," as if -it had ever been anything but old and modern to those living it. We can hardly realize a point of view from which Locke's " dear old book," as James so fittingly calls it, was really modern thought, or from which its language and attitude were anything but quaint and naive. And, above all, we tend to think of nearly all historical periods as periods either of fixed conditions, or of steady progression, in contrast to which the present is a period of transition and unrest; whereas it may be asked whether every period is not a period of transition and unrest to those who live in it, and whether, indeed, if we accept the present theory of con- sciousness, it is not necessarily so. II. From this general sketch of the two views I proceed to a more exact analysis of their differences; and for a standing illustration let us suppose that two persons, who are to play the part of agent and observer, are in the agent's office or study; the agent's tele- phone rings and he responds to the signal. Our first question is, Why does he respond? How are we to describe the con- nection between signal and response? Let us put the question to the observer first. He will state the relation as one of stimulus and reaction, -in other words, of cause and effect. If, remembering that both signal and re- sponse were contemporaneous with other events and conditions, we ask why this particular effect was the effect of this particular cause, he will reply, following Mill and Jevons, that in a multi- tude of similar observations they are related as sole invariable an- tecedent and consequent. If we ask for any causal terms lying between signal and response, he will refer us to the nervous sys- tem, and affirm that between the points where the vibrations of sound meet the endings of the auditory nerve and where the motor nerves finally act upon the muscles, there is a continuous</page><page sequence="6">494 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVII. neural structure and an unbroken chain of neural causes. For the source of his information he will refer us to anatomical obser- vations made upon the nervous system of other agents. And if we object that such observations have not succeeded in com- pleting the chain of causes, he will reply that nevertheless the terms to be supplied must be of the same mechanical kind as those observed. And herein lies the peculiarity of the observer's view. The observer knows nothing of consciousness as such, since from his position as observer the conscious process is for- ever inaccessible. If for any reason he introduces conscious terms into his causal series, they must first be made over into ' mental pictures' or ' compounds,' and disfigured, so to speak, to fit the mechanical and causal categories; so that, as a matter of fact, he is not describing consciousness, but only such mechanical objects as pictures and compounds. And thus, however he may name his terms, his formulation of the relation of signal and re- sponse is a mechanical formulation, in which the relation is con- ceived to be one of cause and effect. But for the agent this mode of viewing the relation is quite irrelevant. The agent would never say: " I was caused to take down the receiver by the ringing of the bell." No one ever says of himself that he was caused to perform an act which was within his power of choice,-that, like an instrument of wood and iron, he was simply operated upon by forces from without. To say so is to write yourself down a fool; and you will avoid this admission as far as possible, not merely because it is unwelcome and de- grading, but because, from your point of view as agent, it is in the last analysis incredible. If you conceive yourself as agent, the only conceivable ground of action is, never a cause, but a reason. Other men may be caused to act, but one's own action can be conceived only as the expression of some conception of value. Even the victim of a post-hypnotic suggestion feels bound to ex- plain as an expression of judgment what, for the observer, he was clearly, so to speak, wound up to do. And so the agent of our illustration would reply to this effect: " I answered the telephone- call because I expected to hear a message of some interest to me." He might admit that no expectation of the sort was clearly</page><page sequence="7">No. 5.] THE AGENT AN1D THE OBSERVER. 495 defined, but he would insist that, apart from some notion of value, he could not have acted at all. Accordingly, where the observer looks for causes, the agent expects to find reasons. What the observer views as a relation of cause and effect is for the agent a relation of ground and con- sequence. For the observer the moving term is a blind force, for the agent it is a conception of value. In a word, the obser- ver' s view is mechanical, the agent's is logical and teleological. Passing from doing to knowing, our second question is, How does the agent know that the telephone-bell really rang? Now the observer has of course no direct access to the agent's know- ing, but he has what for him stands for the same thing, namely, the agent's reaction so far as it is externally accessible, which includes not only the grosser movements of walking to the tele- phone, etc., but what is more significant for his knowing, his speech, gesture, and facial expression. Accordingly, for the ob- server the second question is practically identical with the first, and his answer will be the same; as the agent's action is a matter of cause and effect, so is his knowledge; the stimulus as the cause of his reaction is the cause also of his knowing. But now for the agent. In answering the question, he of course is referring directly to his knowing, i. e., to his conscious process. And he cannot say, " I was caused to hear the bell by the ringing of the bell "; for, however you may analyze his situ- ation, he does not have both the hearing and the external ring- ing. To him the hearing and the ringing are one and the same; if he distinguishes them, the distinction is his own act; in any case, they are not so separated in time or in place that one may stand as the cause of the other. And if he had only the hear- ing (or the ringing) as presented at the time of its occurrence, he could not say positively whether the bell rang or only seemed to ring. His answer will accordingly be the statement of a con- clusion. He will say, perhaps: "When I answered the tele- phone, I found So-and-so waiting to speak to me; and thus I had reason to believe that the bell really rang." In other words, his belief as well as his action rests upon reasons rather than causes. From his point of view it is as incomprehensible that</page><page sequence="8">496 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVII. he should be caused to believe as that he should be caused to choose. Whatever he believes must in the last analysis be the expression of his ' will to believe'; it must be what he can ap- prove and verify as reasonable, intelligible, and consistent. Even when he is ' compelled to believe' what is relatively unsatisfying, it is only because, so far as he can see, any alternative belief would involve him in a greater and more unwelcome absurdity. The observer, as observer, is confronted with brute facts which compel his acceptance; for the agent, whatever is accepted must also be in some sense chosen. Let us carry the inquiry a step further. We have seen that the agent's logical process presupposes that for everything there must be a reason. A third question then arises, Upon what does this principle rest ? Does it in the last analysis arise from the nature and point of view of the agent, or is it simply the result of the environment in which he is placed? The latter is the observer's view. For him the only question to be asked about this or any belief is one of origin and history. Now the observer has before him the vast expanse of nature with its exhibition of regularity and order. He sees individual men in contact with nature, and he notes in their behavior a regularity and order corresponding to that of nature, and corresponding ever more perfectly as time goes on. Accordingly, just as the individual stimulus is the cause of its reaction, so is the regularity of nature the cause of the corresponding regularity of human behavior. As a psychologist, the observer will express this in terms of the law of association, according to which the order of experience tends to become fixed, through the formation of habit, in the order of thought. In strictly external terms, this means that the order of sense-stimuli determines the order of reactions. The principle that everything must have a cause is then simply the expression of one of the most ingrained of these habits. That it must have a cause means only that the habit is unbreakable, the association is indissoluble, -not that the con- trary is logically inconceivable, but simply that any other mode of thought, or rather any other mode of responding to stimuli, is mechanically impossible.</page><page sequence="9">No. 5.] THE AGENT AND THE OBSERVER. 497 The agent, however, is not confronted with the broad expanse of nature, but only with so much of it as can reach his sense- organs. And, as Kant pointed out, there is a radical difference between the "subjective order of apprehension," the order in which facts are received, and the " objective order of appercep- tion," or the order in which they are finally disposed as details of an objective world. Where the observer has before him a rela- tively complete series of causes and effects, which he either ob- serves himself or accepts on the authority of other observers, the experience of the agent is highly fragmentary. He has causes without effects and effects without causes; and causes after effects and effects before causes. An objective space-order may be for him a time-order. Moreover, even if his experiences were, as a matter of fact, a faithful and complete copy of the external order, it is not to be seen how, from the cause alone, he should be impressed with the order of cause and effect; for individual causal series are not presented separately but mingled together in one vast complex of experiences. And granting that he had succeeded in disentangling the individual series, and had located every detail as a member of such a series, he is still without a basis for affirming that everything must have a cause. For to the agent this means, and means necessarily, that the contrary is inconceivable. And this means, again, not merely that he is unable to construct the contrary in thought, but rather that he has investigated the conditions of such construction and finds that they involve a positive self-contradiction. Now, because two terms are found always together, there is no contradiction in con- ceiving that they may exist apart; and that I have always thought of them together furnishes no ground for supposing that they necessarily belong together. A habit or association, however in- grained, falls always short of a logical necessity; and for the agent nothing is really indissoluble except that whose dissolution in- volves a self-contradiction. Accordingly, for a subjective interpretation of the necessity of the causal relation, we must refer once more to reasons as opposed to causes. And here it is to be noted that we are speaking of the ground of the assumption rather than of its history; and,</page><page sequence="10">498 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVII. moreover, that the relation designated by the assumption is in- tended to be a relation of ground and consequence rather than of cause and effect, -the subjective expression of the law of cause and effect is the principle of sufficient reason. Now when I say that for every event there must be a reason and that the contrary is inconceivable, it is because there must be a reason for every action of my own. For me as a conscious agent a ground or reason furnishes the only conceivable basis or motive for action, the only basis upon which I can render any action intelligible, and therefore the only basis which I can admit to be possible or real. Accordingly, when I undertake to say how a body must be conceived to act, what I do is to put myself in its place and say how I should act, and should feel in reason obliged to act, if I were that body. Such, for example, is the meaning, for me, of Newton's first law, which declares, roughly speaking, that a body at rest must remain at rest until moved, and a body in mo- tion must move until stopped. Judging the matter from my own standpoint, as of one who knows directly what it is to move or to stop moving, I declare it inconceivable and in contradiction to the nature of a motive being that it should move or stop or make any change whatever without a sufficient reason for doing so; and therefore I affirm that action without intelligible ground must be forever impossible and unreal, and that the real world must be a world of reason and motive. Thus the agent's view is, if you like, essentially anthropo- morphic, and not anthropomorphic merely, but, to use Spencer's word, automorphic. For it conceives the world not merely in the form of reason, abstractly considered, but in the form of that indi- vidual purpose which gives body and concrete meaning to one's judgments of what is reasonable and of value. Not only must the real world be a rational world; no world can be finally and satisfac- torily rational which does not justify my individual existence and my individual ideals from the standpoint of the ideals themselves. To this motive must be ascribed the extraordinary vitality (from any objective standpoint) of the belief in a future life. In the broad daylight of scientific observation and common sense, belief in a future life can be explained only as a relic of superstition, but to</page><page sequence="11">No. 5.] THE AGENT AND THE OBSERVER. 499 the inner personal consciousness it expresses a motive profoundly logical, which survives as a logical determinant after the sub- stance of the belief has been lost, and compels attention from those who deny that it is logically valid. For it will be noted that, even where the personal motive is formally rejected, the argument against future life rarely fails to include the ad hominesm argument to show, either that individual aims are satisfied within the present life, or that from their own standpoint a continuance of existence is not really desirable. III. Passing from these more general considerations, I shall en- deavor now to illustrate by a few brief examples, introduced somewhat parenthetically, the importance of our distinction for detailed psychological description. i. Are sensations to be described as the elementary material of thought, or as its final product? This subject has been involved in great confusion. Professor James has suggested that the status of sensation will differ according as our view is ana- lytical (the agent's) or physiological (the observer's);1 and the confusion of these has been neatly characterized by James him- self as the psychologist's fallacy. Yet I think he is guilty of this fallacy, when he presently tells us that sensations are first things in consciousness. For the only standpoint from which sensations can be described as prior or elementary is that of the observer. From the observer's point of view, the stimulus acts first upon the sense-organs, and the nerve-current then passes along the sensory-nerve to the brain; at the same time the several kinds of stimuli furnished by the one object first excite separate sense- organs, the currents from which are then combined in the brain. But it is not so for the agent. The sense-qualities of his object do not first appear separately and then unite to form an object. It is even inconceivable how a quality could be apprehended except as a quality of an object. For the agent, sense-quality and object are the final and coordinate product of a process of analysis and definition. 1 Principles of Psychology, Vol. II, pp. 1-3.</page><page sequence="12">500 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVII. 2. Hence, for the agent sense-qualities and thought-qualities (e. g., the hardness of a watch and its value or its accuracy) are equally original and ultimate. The broad distinction between sensation and thought is an observer's distinction. Not even is nihil est in intellect an axiom for the agent. Rather is he bound to assume that, since reality is one, any feature of reality may, with sufficiently acute analysis, be derived from any other, and that a man born blind may thus be conceived to obtain from hearing or touch, not merely a knowledge about, but some knowledge of or acquaintance with the nature of color. 3. I have noted that for the agent knowledge is.necessarily a question of internal coherence. But for the observer it is of equal necessity a question of correspondence between the object and the agent's idea, or the reactions supposed to express his idea. For where the agent has only his process of knowledge, by which, for him, the object and his idea of it are coordinately distinguished and determined, the observer has the object before him as a fixed datum wholly independent of the agent's recog- nition of it. Hence, the only question for the observer is whether the agent's recognition corresponds in the normal way to the characteristics of the object. 4. Again, is the perception of the object followed by the re- action to it, or are the two simultaneous ? It will be remembered that James's scheme of idea-motor action, which furnishes the basis for his theory of emotion, consists, on the subjective side, of an idea (or perception of an object) followed by a feeling of movement. Dewey has pointed out that this relation of succes- sion is the product of reflection. It is also, however, as I should prefer to say, the direct consequence of the observer's view. The sequence of stimulus and reaction, which exists only for the ob- server, has been simply transferred to the consciousness of the agent. There is no such sequence for the agent. He does not, to use James's illustration, first perceive the bear as an indifferent object and then, by running away, appraise him as dangerous. On the contrary, the dangerous quality is necessary to the appre- hension of the bear as a bear, and the act of running is simply one of a group of simultaneous activities, including the adjust-</page><page sequence="13">No. 5.] THE AGENT AND TEE OBSERVER. 501 ment of the sense-organs, etc., in the coordination of which the agent defines his object. And here I may remark that James's whole account of emo- tion suffers from a failure to keep the agent's and observer's views distinct, and thus to adhere consistently to one view or the other. After the process of emotion has been described in purely mechanical fashion as a conflict of instincts, i. e., of pre- formed neural tendencies, initiated by environmental changes, for which the human soul serves only as a theatre of action, one is somewhat astonished to learn that the view is not to be called materialistic; whereas, if the conflict had been described from the beginning as it would be interpreted by the agent, as the value-side of the process of comparison involved in forming a decision, the teleological intentions of the theory of emotion would have been perfectly clear. IV. So far the agent and observer have been presented as living in different worlds and speaking wholly foreign tongues. The problem of bringing them into relation and stating their differ- ences systematically involves too many considerations to be at- tempted here. Our descriptive account has shown, however, that the two views differ, among other respects, in content and position, and it will be profitable to consider the possible bearing of these differences in particular upon their more general peculi- arities and relations. We have seen that, at least in the more overt bodily actions, the point of view of the doer is different in a spatial sense from that of the observer, inasmuch as the agent views the action lit- erally from the inside of his body, and that this difference is re- lated to a difference of sense-content. Confining our attention for the present to the difference of content, it will be worth noting that it is current usage which speaks of how an action looks to an observer, but of how it feels to the agent. And this at once recalls the fact that an observer's view of his neighbor's action is predominantly visual, though of course not exclusively so; that this is more the case in proportion as the neighbor is in any</page><page sequence="14">502 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVII. sense a distant neighbor; and that in any case the observer has no direct information of how it ' feels' to perform the act of an- other, in terms of muscular and organic sensation. Now, as James has suggested, every stimulus sets up a movement which reverberates throughout the organism and causes changes in probably every part of the system. Of this incalculable mass of change probably every feature is represented to some degree in the feeling-tone of the agent; but only a few are directly acces- sible to the view of the observer. And thus, with regard to a particular momentary act, the scope of the observer's view,- of the look as compared with the feel,- is extremely limited. On the other hand, if we adopt the common view that every change of thought or will is the parallel of some organic movement, we may assume to have in the movements hidden from the observer the basis for those features of the agent's thought which are private to himself, -in particular, his consciousness of the pur- pose and direction of his activity. This would be given in those beginnings of movement which are felt by the agent, but which have 'not yet eventuated into movements sufficiently gross to be externally evident. It is perhaps too much to say that there is any internal move- ment of the organism which may not, with sufficiently minute analysis, be discovered from its external accompaniments. But there is another factor which contributes to the limitations of the external view, namely, the narrowness of attention,- a factor which, by the way, has much to say in determining the logical and psychological peculiarities of all aspects of human thought. The individual's momentary act, inconceivably complex in itself, is still but one term in a vast system of activities constituting his personal character, which, again, is but one term in the yet vaster system constituting the character of the race. Now it may be said, I think, that any view of any portion of human action is not only partial and one-sided, but also to that degree materially false, which is not also a view of human action as a whole; and, moreover, that any view of the whole is so far false which is not also a view of the whole in detail. But it is obvious that no human view can meet these conditions. A given act of thought may</page><page sequence="15">No. TH] THE AGENT AND TIE OBSERVER. 503 cover a larger or smaller field, but not with the same fulness of content; or if with the same fulness, not with the same systematic unity and definiteness of detail. These conditions must then be included among those governing the distribution of content be- tween the two views. Owing to the way the act is presented to him, the agent's view of his own act is many-sided and rich in content; but, as a matter of attention, he cannot apprehend with similar fulness the acts of his many neighbors. On the other hand, the broad range of his observational view, as well as its systematic clearness, both of which are related to its visual char- acter, require that it be a partial and abstract view of any indi- vidual act. These differences have undoubtedly a bearing upon the logical attitudes expressed by the two views. The special fitness of muscular and organic content for an interpretation in terms of purposive activity can perhaps be only suggested, but it seems to me that the relation between visual content and the mechanical interpretation can be made reasonably clear. For the essence of the mechanical view is that aspects are not only distinguished, but distinguished as spatially separate parts, each, so to speak, wholly within its own skin; and there is no region of sense-con- tent where this is so completely possible as the region of sight. One may say, indeed, that the perfection of the mechanical con- ception is to be found only in visual geometry, - as also the per- fection of systematic clearness. And, moreover, as just pointed out, the systematic clearness of the external view, as well as its breadth of field, which is again a special characteristic of vision, impose upon it a high degree of abstractness and simplicity. So we find that it is the tendency of the external view, first, e. g., to reduce all springs of action to pleasure, and then to refer pleasure to the activities of reproduction and nutrition, -thus reducing the whole complex of human activity to the simple interworking of the two factors most obvious to the external observer. But this very simplicity may, I think, be recognized as the special correlate of mechanism. Here, again, it is easier to suggest a relationship than to prove it.' But the redundancy of the phrase I In Chapter XVI of my Introductory Study of Ethics this point has been treated more at length.</page><page sequence="16">504 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVII. 'mechanical simplicity' is an evidence of the parallelism in our thought. At the same time, it may be noted that the most com- plex of the objects concretely recognized as mechanical, - namely, the machines made with hands, -is enormously simple as com- pared with any animal organism. It may be pointed out, more- over, that the cold-blooded aspect of their operation is a function not only of their simplicity, as conceived by us, but of the pre- dominantly visual character of our conception. Our view ignores the molecular stresses and strains within the parts. If these fac- tors were included, it is doubtful if we could grasp the activity either as simple or as purely mechanical. So much for the difference of content. We have now to note that these differences are referred to one object, and, indeed, local- ized as belonging respectively to the inside and outside. This suggests that the two views, in spite of the difficulty of combining them, may, as general points of view, be regarded as belonging to the same field and supplementing each other. Consider, for example, the matter of sexual attraction. To the observer this is simply the antecedent cause of reproduction; to the young lover nothing could, as a rule, be more remote from his purpose or possibly more abhorrent. Yet subsequent reflection will probably convince him that this feature, both in its immediate and its remote aspects, was really indispensable to his purpose, and that he could hardly have made a choice from which it had been expressly excluded. Here, then, the external view serves to complete and to correct the agent's definition of his purpose. On the other hand, the external view misses most of the factors necessary to account for the concrete choice. To the observer the case in hand is one of simple sexual attraction. He compares it with the sexual behavior of the lower animals, already con- ceived by him too simply and impersonally, and recognizes no important difference. The complex sympathies, whose correlation represents to those concerned the fulfilment of highly personal ends, - these are hidden from the observer, and can hardly be included in a view which will be definite, systematic, and scientific. They belong rather to the sympathetic insight which finds ex- pression in the work of the poet and novelist; yet in the last</page><page sequence="17">No. 5.] THE AGENT A ND THE OBSERVER. 505 analysis they are needed for a fully scientific determination of the concrete choice. From this it will appear that each view is in its way partial, in- adequate, and abstract. But, in particular, it will be worth noting how much of the content of human life is excluded from the view of the observer, and how this exclusion involves also a distortion. The observer of an act sees only a stimulus followed by a reac- tion, which he can interpret only as a sequence of cause and effect. But the agent has before him a more or less extended process of debate, including the alternatives rejected as well as that finally adopted, and involving their comparison and valua- tion. He is thus, by the very nature of the situation presented by his broader view, justified in regarding his act as the expres- sion of choice. Likewise he is in a measure justified even in the undue emphasis placed upon his own view. He regards his own children, his own friends, his own appreciations and opin- ions as more significant than those of others, but he has the advantage of a more intimate acquaintance. His own views are involved in a network of subtle suggestion and cross-sug- gestion of which he is conscious 'as no one else can be. His intercourse with his friends reveals complexities of character which are hidden from more remote acquaintances. He errs only in assuming that his own are exceptional. So far, then, from discounting the agent's view because of its individual emphasis, we may rather assume that all agents' views are likely to be true. It is possible that the great mass of ' men on the street,' so des- perately uninteresting in the crowd, might all turn out to be sig- nificant personalities if only they could be individually studied. And when we attempt to conceive the result of a possible unified total of such individual views, and place over against it the total result of observers' views, it is at once suggested that the observer's view is truly, as it is instinctively felt to be, a superficial view, how- ever necessarily so, and that its superficiality involves a rather serious misinterpretation of the subject-matter. And this sugges- tion is strengthened when we remember, not only that the personal life suffers abstraction at the hands of the observer, but that it suffers a similar abstraction in the agent's present view of his life</page><page sequence="18">506 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. as a whole, - that, indeed, no individual life has ever been viewed as a fully concrete unity even by the agent himself. The results of such abstraction are to be seen in the various conceptions of humanity offered by the social sciences, so called. There is the economic man of classical economics, whose only activity is to buy cheap and sell dear; the hedonistic man of sci- entific- ethics, who sums up pleasures with the impersonality and indifference, of an adding machine; the reproductive man of sci- entifi'&amp; anthropology, who perpetuates his kind regardless of what ;kind he' may perpetuate; and, finally, the associational man of dtitra-scientific psychology, whose activity is confined to combin- ing mental elements into compounds, and whose structure is a tdombinatioh of the kaleidoscope, the vitascope, and the cash-reg- ister.` These conceptions have an important function as instru- 'ments of analysis, but as pictures of human life they are neither living nor human. And it is no wonder that to the popular mind the social sciences, with their conceptions of social progress, tepresdtnt the negation of all that is humanly interesting. Their picture of human life bears a general resemblance to the shades 'of Greek mythology. Psychologically they are largely visual abstractions; constructed by an observer who sees without feel- ing, and to whom, therefore, human activity presents itself as a series of phantom-like images.
