<plain_text><page sequence="1">A BHA NDL UNGEN EVIDENCE OF MINOAN RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS AND THEIR SURVIVAL IN THE MYCENAEAN AND GREEK WORLD Mountain peaks and caves have always been considered as peculiarly Minoan cult sites. Few, if any, caves on the mainland can be shown to have witnessed cult in Mycenaean times.' To some extent no doubt this is due to the poor Greek evidence, for there are signs that caves were inhabited and saw cult over long periods in the Stone Age. The Franchthi Cave near Hermione in the Argolid, the Alepotrypa Cave in Laconia, and the Kitsos Cave in Laurium, are good examples of this point.2 Most probably, too, the nature of the cult in these mainland caves would have been familiar to many other Aegean peoples in the Stone Age from Crete to Anatolia.3 So much seems clear from finds like the head of a stalagmite type marble idol from the Alepotrypa Cave4 and some similarly shaped figurines which were found mixed together with other Middle Helladic remains in the Sarakinos Cave at Orchomenos.5 However, no unambiguous example of Mycenaean cave cult in Late Helladic has as yet been indentified. Peak sites continued to be frequented in Crete until historic times. By then there is clear evidence of cult on the summits of hills and mountains in Greece as well, but very little before the Iron Age. In both countries the two divine names most commonly associated with these sites were Zeus and Apollo, the latter quite often as Hyacinthus. In fact the epithet of Hyacinthus linked peak cults in Greece and Crete. For example Apollo Hyacinthus was honoured in a peak sanctuary at Pyrgos near Tylissos and special coins were minted bearing his name during the Hyacinthia festival in town.6 On the mainland in Laconian Faure holds that at least in the Peloponnese and Cyclades caves continued to be used until historical times as burial and cult sites, P.

DIETRICH Amyclae the god also enjoyed a similar cult which quite probably was as old as the Late Bronze Age.' Hence the link may have begun before the end of that age, although this must remain unproved until it can be established whether the Laconian cult of Hyacinthus had travelled south or originally been imported to Greece from Crete.8 Apollo with the local title of Aktios had a peak cult in historic times at Anactorion on the Ambracian Gulf, and another one nearby at Leucas.9 At the former site Augustus still paid homage to the god after the battle of Actium.'" Zeus was associated with numerous peaks in Greece, the best known of which is Mt. Hymettus in Attica. His sanctuary there was in use not before the end of Protogeometric." In fact, with one or two exceptions, peak cults in Greece can not be attested before Geometric times and most of them flourished in the eighth and seventh pre-Christian centuries."2 Mycenaean remains have turned up at a few sites, like Hymettus, Oros and Ayios Elias at Mycenae"3 but in uncertain contexts. There were really two kinds of peak site which ought perhaps to be told apart. The first, un-Mycenaean, type consisted of a sacred temenos, with or without, sanctuary buildings on an isolated peak or mountain summit. Its form and nature have been discussed elsewhere. As far as it is possible to see, they were concerned with the worship of an apotropaeic, protective deity of nature.14 The second type also occurred on the top of a mountain but in association with a settlement. The latter, at least in Crete, chronologically ranged from the beginning of the Bronze Age, as at Fournou Korifi in the south of the island with shrine and bell-shaped goddess figurine,'5 to Middle Minoan at the neighbouring "peak site" at Pyrgos,16 and indeed to the very 7 Dietrich, "The Dorian Hyacinthia.

There may have been an altar on the summit as early as the twelfth century B. C. However, the sparse remains from Early Middle and Late Helladic can not obviously be connected with Zeus' sanctuary which probably began its "life" in the second half of the tenth cent. B.

The shrine in Pyrgos IV for example had been built on the first floor of a large "country house" of the New Palace period.'8 But offerings in these "settle- ment" or "domestic" shrines did not differ substantially from those in pure peak sanctuaries with their horns, goddess with upraised arms19 and even terracotta models of animals and beetles.20 Thus scholars generally discuss both types under one heading2' which implies, however, that every settlement, every acropolis, from the massively impressive Ryzenia (Prinias) and Gortyn in Crete to the acropolis of Athens in Greece, should be included in a list of peak cult sites. How specialised was the cult in type one? That question would be difficult to answer, except that beside the patently "domestic" nature of the former, the isolated peak cult seemed to have been more closely related to that obtaining in caves in Crete. Many peak sites were almost identical with rock shelters which belonged to the category of cave cult.22 Quite illuminating in this respect is the discovery of a deep fissure with votive offerings in the sacred precinct of the peak sanctuary on Mount Jouktas.23 In Mycenaean Greece the nearest parallel to the second type, that is a peak cult associated with a settlement, is the cult on the summit of Mt. Kynortion at Epidaurus. North-east of the classical temple there stood an open-air altar. Its date was about the seventh century B.C., but it was constructed on the remains of a similar Mycenaean altar. Perhaps Mycenaean remains beneath the earlier sixth century temple also belonged to a sanctuary at the spot, to judge from the ceramic fragments from there. Other Mycenaean votive finds, like large wheel- made animals and "phi" figurines, can only be associated with the general area.24 Altar and sanctuary, if there was one, were part of the Mycenaean settlement on the summit of Mt. Kynortion. The historic cult on the site of course belonged to Apollo Maleatas as apotropaeic and healing god, hence the proximity of Asclepius' worship there. No archaeological sign survives, however, which might point to continuity of cult on Kvnortion: the '7 J. D. S. Pendlebury, The Archaeology of Crete, London 1939, 306; V.

DIETRICH Mycenaean altar might have triggered off the renewal of cult in the seventh century B.C.,25 although the apotropaeic figure of Apollo suggests that the salient features of the old peak and community deity had been preserved in Epidaurus as well as for example in Laconian Amyclae.26 And this is after all the most important point, namely that the cult of Apollo on Mt. Kynortion was that of the community god and directly linked with the ancient "domestic" cult. A number of Zeus' historic peak cults in Greece, like that on Hymettus, show the characteristics of Minoan type 1, that is an isolated temenos or shrine high on the mountain peak and divorced from any settlement. On Hymettus there was a sacred enclosure containing an open-air altar,27 probably that of Zeus Ombrios.28 Many high peaks functioned as weather indicators to the Greeks according to Theophrastus,29 which explains Zeus' title of Ombrios here and in his cult on Mt. Parnes.30 But this type of cult appears to have been an historical development in Greece,31 and it is remarkable that, apart from these two instances, Ombrios and the identical title of Hyetios, though common in Greece, were not associated with mountain tops.32 Beside Ombrios Pausanias also mentions local epithets of Zeus like Hymettios, Parnethios and Anchesmios whose image stood on Mt. Anchesmos in Attica.33 Interesting memories of prehistoric peak cult are brought to life by an altar to Apollo on Hymettus, although his title of Proopsios is less than helpful. But, again according to Pausanias, Zeus Ombrios shared a common altar with Zeus Apemios on Mt. Parnes, that is the apotropaeic "Averter of Ills".34 The many martial finds on Hymettus of bronze knives, shields and iron daggers35 are not particularly enlightening concerning the nature of Zeus' cult; but they do recall the finds in the Minoan caves of Arkalokhori and Psychro.36 But if Pausanias' account is reliable, the cultic remains and the titles on 25 Arch.

Beside Zeus the Weather- and Rain-god and Zeus Hypsistos, the supreme Olympian, peaks in the main continued to be remembered as the place where Zeus was thought to have been born and where he died.3" These were the traditional aspects of Minoan cave and peak cult which manifestly survived strongly enough in Greece to hold their own next to later concepts and of course in Greek myth throughout its history.38 It may be argued that the memory of cultic beliefs, which continued to be tied to specific areas like peaks and caves, does not presuppose the survival of the actual cult performance. On the contrary myth and memory could have become the substitutes for cult. However, in this case the evidence satisfactorily shows that the Mycenaeans and their successors did in fact retain the cult itself but not in its original site. Greek caves were unimportant in historic cult: the haunt of monsters like Lamia and the Harpies,39 or the home of Pan and the Nymphs who occasionally through age- old memory still received gifts as "Geburtsgottinnen".40 But otherwise the rites had been transferred to new homes, and this practice may have begun as early as the Mycenaean age. In Crete both cave and the closely related peak cult had been "domesti- cated" before the end of Middle Minoan,41 although of course both also continued in a number of their original locations.42 The move to new quarters, 3" For a list of the evidence see Cook, Zeus 1 (1914), 124-163; Zeus 11 (1925), Append.

(1978) 297. 41 Levi, P.d.P. (1978), 296; 311, most recently discusses the connection of both types of cult. 42 In Crete some fifty sanctuaries have been identified within the last decade as well as over forty caves, which witnessed cult at different times of the Bronze Age and beyond, and twenty- five open air sanctuaries, P. Faure, "Cultes Populaires dans la Crete Antique", B.C.H. 96 (1972) 401; 425; cf. Arch. Rep. 1974/75, 27 and 28. There may be another one in the "Gorge of the Dead" near Kato Zakro, Arch. Rep. 1975/76, 31f.; B.C.H. 100 (1976) 723; Faure, B.C.H. 102 (1978) 639; Levi, P.d.P. 181 (1978) 294-313, who rightly counts the rock-shelters among the cult caves (p. 296). All the evidence of the known Cretan caves has been collected and discussed in a recent study by E. Tyree, Cretan Sac-red Caves: Archaeological Evidence, Diss. Columbia 1974. Cult continuity within a cave can be shown on archaeological grounds in at least the four caves at Phaneromeni, Psychro, Skoteino, Amnisos. However, with the possible exception of Psychro, there is no published Protogeometric material from any one of these caves suggesting that the cult had been temporarily suspended before Geometric (Tyree 118). Archaeological gaps notwith- standing, important indications of basic continuity can be found in the persistence from Minoan to Geometric times of the same types of offerings in cave cult. Cult vessels and votives, including human and animal figurines, as well as implements, weapons and also double axes (Tsoutsouros Cave) continued in the same forms until the eighth century B.C. (Tyree 125; 127; 128; 132; 138;</page><page sequence="6">6 B. C. DIETRICH which echoed an astonishingly similar development in Anatolia more than a millennium earlier,43 left distinct traces in the dedication of stalagmitic concretions in the little Palace at Knossos for instance." Most probably it was the positive aspect of the goddess, her life-giving powers, which went to the new temple or sanctuary, for there are indications that the part of the cave cult, which was concerned with death, also found another home in specially constructed tombs. These were built in Crete at least from the beginning of the Bronze Age, and they witnessed some form of cult even then,45 but the first conclusive evidence of the transfer of cave cult from cave to cave-like tomb dates from the beginning of Middle Minoan in the shape of more anthropomorphic concretions. Examples have come to light in the Apesokari Tomb in the Mesara.6 It would probably be wrong to interpret such changes as signalling a centralization of cult in the new palaces, tombs and so on because the old sites continued to be visited.4" The development at that time rather suggests the existence of the same basic cult which was celebrated in different types of sacred areas.48 The confusion, or interchangeability, is illustrated by a cult site like Kato Syme Viannou in southern Crete. Seen from the modern village of Simi the imposing peak leaves no doubt in one's mind that this was an isolated peak cult of our first category. The site is of considerable importance to the history of Greek and Cretan religion because it is one of very few which preserved the unmistakable signs of cult continuity at least from the Late Bronze Age until 139). There were some minor changes and omissions without, however, any obvious effect on the nature of the cult. By Geometric times kernoi and rhyta shapes had disappeared, for example, and so evidently had horns of consecration (Tyree 140). But only two examples of the latter, both from the same cave (Patso), have ever been dicovered in connection with cave cult (LM III, Tyree 106). In the seventh century the orientalising style dominated in the manufacture of votives which, though, most likely belonged to the same type of cult, i.e. birth, fertility and vegetation in general. The history of cult in the Idaean Cave illustrates the dangers of relying too much on the archaeological evidence. Zeus was worshipped in this cave from Geometric. The absence of classical cult objects suggest a break in Zeus' cult between the fifth century and the Hellenistic age when it flourished once more until Roman times (Tyree 219 with references). But a fifth cent. inscription from Gortyn, which refers to Zeus' trieteric festival at his cave on Mt. Ida, proves that the cult continued through the Classical age (IC IV.80. Cf. R. F. Willetts, Cretan Cults and Festivals, London 1962, 243; Tyree 137). "' See Dietrich, Origins 165. r Oigins 92; 110; 170f.; 183; 304. 45 See I.

This point, as well as the divine nomenclature and the curious male and hybrid figurines, which have turned up on the site, have far reaching implications for later Greek religion. The Bronze Age complex of cult buildings on the peak at Syme included some eleven or more rooms and an open paved court which in the Iron Age provided the area for altar and cult in the open air. However, in Late Minoan times, that is contemporary with the Mycenaean age, the arrangement of the sacred structures echoes that at Mycenae and elsewhere and therefore appears to reflect the practice of domestic rather than peak cult.53 This conclusion is reinforced by a good many of the offerings from there; they seem more at home in the so-called domestic shrines. Doro Levi, for example, compares the kernoi and conical vases from Syme with those found in the sanctuaries of the Rural Villa at Kannia near Gortyn.54 Quite clearly then cult tradition was more important than the actual site in all three main categories of domestic, peak and cave cult. The mixture of Mycenaean/Greek and Cretan material at Syme suggests that the same principle applied on the Greek mainland in Mycenaean and later times. In fact a good deal of otherwise puzzling archaeological evidence can be plausibly interpreted on the same grounds that in Greek belief tradition outlived the original cult site. To illustrate this very important point it is best to begin with a Cretan example. A curious feature in the Late Minoan villa at Slavokambos (LM IA-B) consists in some natural rock which was allowed to protrude above the floor level of two rooms, at least one of which had been set 4 See the reports in Arch.

DIETRICH aside for cultic purposes.55 This natural outcrop in one of these rooms retained the marks of past burnt sacrifice, that is charcoal together with burnt animal bones, as well as offerings of bowls and sherds stuck into the crevices of the rock.56 The last feature in particular rules out any secular use of the room.57 Both rooms had been subterranean chambers originally, and the rock with its offerings recalls the scene of both cave and peak cults.58 The shrine at Slavokambos was evidently intended to reproduce a cave or rock shelter. No stalagmitic concretion of human or any other shape has survived. But quite clearly the natural rock itself was felt to possess the same sacred properties as had been in the cave. The Minoan example therefore admirably explains related but less obvious features in Mycenaean sanctuaries. At Mycenae Taylour excavated two sets of cult rooms on the steep terrain between the Citadel House and the great ring wall.59 They were basements, and the most important set consisted of a group of oblong rooms reminiscent of the megaron form. The main room had a low central platform, shelves for idols and offerings like the typical shelf in a Minoan sanctuary, pillars and stairs leading up to a kind of deposit room where other idols were found. To the left of it was a triangular alcove enclosing the outcrop of the natural rock. The megaron's somewhat tomb-like effect can be judged by the two contemporary but better preserved subterranean cult rooms in Thebes. They had been cut into the natural sandstone and, with their frescoes, benches and the like, were distinctly similar to the Mycenaean rooms.60 In Mycenae the rock chamber was next to the megaron-shrine or temple and beyond the platforms with the large goddess idol. The rock's prominent position in the whole complex underlines its undoubted cultic significance.6" But the rock itself was screened from view by a wall and may have been a kind of inner sanctum. In historical times the adyton became a particular feature of temples which were dedicated to chthonic deities or heroes who received funerary cult. A case in point are the temples of Artemis at Brauron, next to a 55 Rooms 15 &amp; 19, see Sp. Marinatos, Eph. Arch. 1939/1941 (1948), 69ff.; Rutkowski, Cult Places lO1f.

Nevertheless the equation of rock = adyton of the megaron-shrine and = cave strongly suggests itself. If this conclusion is correct the rites within this Mycenaean "temple" at the end of the Mycenaean age perpetuated a cult that had been celebrated on mountain peaks and in caves by the Minoans. The shrine in Mycenae seems a particularly good example of the survival of an older tradition in new surroundings, but there might well be others which until now have gone undetected. One comparable instance, which comes to mind, is the remarkable recent discovery of a Mycenaean religious complex in Phylakopi on the island of Melos. The sacred area consisted of an East Sanctuary (LH IIIB) and an earlier West Sanctuary (LH IIIA) flanking two sides of an open temenos with a round stone altar or baetyl.63 To the west of the West Sanctuary there was an additional small chamber which possessed the remarkable feature of a niche containing four wheel-made bull votives together with a grotesque head in the east wall.64 The niche and bull figurines could also be remnants of a cave cult transferred to new surroundings on analogy with identical practices elsewhere in the Aegean but ultimately deriving from Anatolia in the Neolithic Age.65 The relationship of niche and chamber, where stood the large goddess figure with upraised arms, with the main West Shrine at Phylakopi was not unlike that of megaron-shrine and idol with the small rock chamber at Mycenae. In Neolithic atal Hiiyiik the niche was generally in the eastern wall, i.e. that part of the shrine which had been given over to the ritual celebration of death.66 The Melian shrine, too, had its niche in the eastern wall of the adjacent chamber, while the natural outcrop of rock at Mycenae formed the north/eastern corner of the small alcove beyond the main shrine. The location might well be fortuitous in both cases, nor is there any sign in the remains of the Mycenaean sanctuaries that they witnessed scenes of funerary ritual. Without written records nothing can be certain. The traditions connected with chthonic cave cult did, however, tenaciously survive into historic times and generally in the cult of Demeter.

DIETRICH floor of the Eleusinian Telesterion, has caused endless debate for the past 150 years.67 The rock actually marked the site of the ancient anaktoron,68 within which occurred the central ceremony of the Mysteries, and therefore symbolically represented a cave. The exact procedure of the rites of the Eleusinian Mysteries remains unknown, but the famous light and the hierophant's fire ritual within the "cave" suggest the setting for an annual reenactment of birth and renewal.69 The scene with its elements recalls the myth of Zeus' periodic rebirth in a cave accompanied by a great flame of fire.70 lThe "Palace" and Telesterion stood on the site of an earlier Mycenaean building or "temple"71 of about the same date as the Mycenaean and Melian 72CUt7 sanctuaries and very probably continued Mycenaean cult.73 In that case the Mycenaean Megaron B already must have witnessed the traditional cave cult in the symbolic setting of a sanctuary. It would not be unreasonable to conclude then that the symbolism of the rock in Eleusis and Mycenae and possibly even that of the wall niche in Phylakopi conveyed the same cultic message. In fact the association of birth and cave, of goddess and divine associate, strongly continued to permeate Eleusinian cult. When the tyrant Peisistratus enhanced the lustre and importance of the Mysteries, he not only constructed the new Telesterion but actually added a nearby cave to the sanctuary area and built a "Plutonium" within it,74 which was restored some two centuries later.75 Demeter had another temple and "Megaron" in Arcadian Lycosoura together with ancient Mystery rites.76 This "Megaron", too, played the part of a subterranean chamber or cave, although it was no more than an open sacred area. The altar within it, however, incorporated a natural rock which still bears the traces of sacrificial ashes.7 The Arcadian myths of Demeter were ancient, 67 G. E.

In fact Demeter/Kore had probably always existed side by side with the male figure. 76 According to Herodotus 2, 171, only the Arcadians preserved their Mysteries after the "Dorian uprising". 77 K.

Demeter's temples were commonly called megara.8" There is some evidence that megaron was a Semitic loan word deriving from the Hebrew mecara meaning "cave ".82 Hesychius records the tradition of megara describing subterranean dwellings or pits.83 Certainly in classical Greek usage a megaron meant the inner room within a temple,84 or the entire building: this being its exclusive significance in Herodotus.85 Some of Demeter's temples actually retained adyta or megara in the form of subterranean rooms. Examples have been excavated in Priene86 and in Cnidus.87 In these cases, like the historic cave at Eleusis, the megara with their offerings and rites more explicitly continued the religious traditions which survived only symbolically at Lycosoura, in the Eleusinian anaktoron, and indeed in the Late Bronze Age shrine at Mycenae. The same was true of some of Demeter's festivals such as the Thesmophoria in Attica, Potnia and in Cnidus. On those occasions real caves or substitutes were used in the celebrations.88 Also ceremony and offerings quite clearly expressed the See Dietrich, "Demeter, Erinys, Artemis", Hermes 90 (1962) 129-148. 7 She hid in a cave after the rape of Persephone, Paus. 8, 42, 2. 80 Paus. 8, 37, 8f.; Nilsson, Gesch.3 I, 479; Burkert, Gr.

Of course the Megaron at Lycosoura really belonged to Despoina, Demeter's daughter (Paus. 8, 37, 8; cf. Eur. I.T. 1462f.) just as the heroon, which succeeded the cave at the foot of the Brauronian acropolis, belonged to Iphigeneia where she was associated with Artemis, Paus. 1, 33, 1. Cult at the site dates from Neolithic to the end of Mycenaean but no sign of historic cult survives there before about the middle of the eighth century B.C., Kahil, Acts XI Intern. Arch. Congr., 1979, 76f. Megaron-temples were not exclusive to Demeter but could for example belong to Aphrodite, Dionysus (Paus. 8, 6, 5) or the Kouretes (Paus. 4, 31, 9). 82 H.

DiETRICH, Evidence of Minoan Religious Traditions celebrants' concern for the renewal of life.89 In Demeter's recently excavated sanctuary in Cnidus, too, the prolonged cultic tradition, the terracotta bull figurines, as well as the cave within the temenos tell their own story.90 In sum, historical Greek linguistic and traditional, together with the archaeological, evidence tend to confirm that even in the case of peculiarly Minoan sites like caves and peaks the cult content was shared with the people of the mainland. Evidently the actual physical site did not greatly matter: it was not essential to the performance of the cult. This was true in Mycenaean Greece at the end of the Bronze Age, but also and even earlier in Crete judging from the "mixed" architecture, cultic paraphernalia and offerings in so-called "domestic" and peak and cave sanctuaries. The inference seems to be that religious ideas were transmitted to Greece and survived even when a cult had been removed from its traditional site. Historians tend to underestimate the longevity of religious concepts in the Cretan and Greek worlds. For the unbiased observer there are clear signs that gods and their cults could not only endure into historic times, but they could be transferred to new homes or even from one country to another. The scope and extent of such moves are difficult to assess, but they did undoubtedly occur, so that many an historic site with relatively late sanctuary structures concealed an ancient cult. A splendid instance of this development exists in the cult of Artemis Orthia in Sparta whose first sanctuary was Protogeometric in date,91 or possibly even later,92 but for all that preserved the impression of being identical with that of the goddess on the Gortynian acropolis in Crete. Not only were all types of divine representations in Gortyn imitated in Sparta, but the style and form of the latter as faithfully reproduced the Cretan model as for example the type and design of the seals in the Mycenaean Shaft Graves.93 Evidently the history of the site is no indication of the age of the religious tradition.
