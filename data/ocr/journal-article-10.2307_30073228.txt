KARFI (CRETE) IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY: PRESENTATION OF NEW ARCHITECTURAL DATA AND THEIR ANALYSIS IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT OF RESEARCH' INTRODUCTION THE saddle below Karfi,' in the north Lasithi mountains, was excavated by the BSA in 1937-9, revealing a settlement of the earliest Iron Age (c. 1200-1000 BC; Late Minoan III C through 'Subminoan'; EIA: c. 1200-700 BC).3 The site is still one of the standard references for the period, dramatically typifying the new defensible locations to which much of the Cretan population moved after the collapse of Late Bronze Age state systems.4 1 I thank the 24th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities for the award of architectural and topographical recording permit in 2002 and for a five-year period thereafter.

KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 217 architecture is now also severely constrained by its badly deteriorated condition.5 In this paper, I present the first detailed drawn record for four selected areas of architecture about one quarter of the excavated area), prepared as part of an integrated management/ research study at the site in 2002-4.6 The areas were selected as representing some of the best-preserved on the site and the most informative in a wide range of respects. Three of the four have, since their excavation, been given regular scholarly attention in an ongoing debate on the character of elite or special buildings and their use in Early Iron Age societies (referred to below). The new study was undertaken partly in an attempt to contribute further to this debate. The form of this paper reflects my aim of placing the new data (which in themselves provide small, dispersed, and unconnected pieces of information) in a broader interpretative context. In many parts of the site, advanced deterioration and the poorly preserved character of the walls on excavation meant that drawn recording was unlikely to produce much new information of value. Instead, systematic new written observations were made on all the site's excavated buildings (considerably enhancing the excavation record) and then used to put the information from new plans in a broader analytical context. All the new data were archived in paper and database form with the BSA and the 24th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities in 2003. The voluminous and highly detailed nature of the written observations means they could not be presented here in full. The first full topographical plan for the excavated area, and an accurate plot of its substantial unexcavated remains, were prepared, and are also presented and discussed here. Separate reanalyses of the pottery and cult-related finds from the original excavation, currently in progress,7 provided part of the impetus for a new architectural study. The new data have already been made available to and discussed with the scholars involved in these studies. However, work on the artefact material is not yet complete, and could not be systematically taken into account when making the current analysis. Even after these studies are complete, the limited nature of the original records on finds, architecture and stratigraphy will always restrict analysis of building context and function. In these circumstances, a significant opportunity to contextualize the new data is offered by comparisons with other contemporary excavated sites of the same period and defensible type (investigated mostly in the last twenty-five years). These show some major differences 5 The condition assessment carried out in 2002-3 found that 39% of walls at the site had deteriorated by more than 50%/0 since excavation; 19% were entirely or almost entirely deteriorated or obscured, 7% in imminent danger of complete collapse, and 12% of complete obscurement. Of 234 architectural joints, 133 were obscured or destroyed, seriously restricting the reconstruction of building sequences. 6 I have discussed the management-related aspects of the study in another article: S. Wallace, 'Bridges in the mountains: structure, multivocality, responsibility and gain issues in filling a management gap in rural Greece', JMA 18. 1 (2005), 55-85; ead., 'Study towards the development of 21st-century management and research strategies at the archaeological site of Karfi, Lasithi, Crete' (unpublished archive report, 24th Ephorate of the Greek Archaeological Service/British School at Athens, 2003). The study's recommendations included preparation of a full management plan, pilot conservation of the best preserved and most interpretatively significant complexes, and the institution of a condition monitoring programme for the site. It was advised that all buildings be recorded at 1 : 50 before any clearance or consolidation work takes place on them. A conservation plan is needed to define the acceptable limits of restoration, particularly in cases like those of the Megarons and Great House, where the original positions of large fallen blocks are clear. Intervention along the above lines seems vital both to preserve Karfi's research significance, and develop and promote it to public advantage. 7 L. P.

Gesell, Cult Finds from Karphi (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="4">218 SARO WALLACE from Karfi at a number of levels. For example, all of them are considerably smaller, and thus may have had a different level of complexity in social organization. Some are excavated only in a very limited area. None of them have a record published in final form. Preliminary accounts lack quantitative information on finds by context or details of stratigraphy, restricting independent use of the evidence to draw conclusions on building function and development. Even so, they comprise a substantial new knowledge base which cannot be ignored in considering Karfi's relevance today, and in fact supports significant revisions of the Karfi excavators' original conclusions.8 In some cases detailed publication is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future, so this data must either be used in its present form, or not at all, in studying EIA architecture. Comparisons between Karfi and these other sites in terms of architecture and of social and economic organization are already frequently made in the literature: this made it seem a good time to revisit and improve the Karfi record before the architecture deterioriated further, and thereby add more body to the debate. The separation of formal architectural analysis from context and finds information is not an effective archaeological methodology. However, because architecture is the element of the record currently most accessible for the largest number of relevant sites (and at Karfi forms the main surviving source of data) the main emphasis throughout this comparative paper is on architectural form, though all relevant context and finds information available is taken into account. Drawing together architectural information provoked new questions about EIA society which may be more fully answered through the more detailed study of finds records from Karfi and other sites. After a brief evaluation in Part 1 of the ways in which the site and its architectural remains have been interpreted to date, the second part of the paper presents the new record of excavated and unexcavated remains, and interprets their physical and chronological relationships, drawing on both the old and new data. I then put these buildings into the context of the wider site, using both the old and new records to analyse the kinds of architectural forms characterizing the settlement, and features of its layout. At this stage, I start to bring in comparisons with other sites, but mostly in terms of discussing specific architectural elements. In Part 3, I undertake a broader comparative analysis of building function and use, and their relationship to social structures and systems, in twelfth- to tenth-century Cretan settlements. The new Karfi data, and the existing debate on special- function buildings in LBA-EIA Crete and Greece,9 are my starting points for asking how far we can identify any Cretan buildings as having specialized use outside the cult sphere (which has already been extensively discussed for this period). I look at how we can identify domestic, cult, industrial, and public architecture at Karfi and other sites and how subtle those differences can be, in what seems a period of limited social and site hierarchy. I then go on to explore whether we can say that a certain kind of building with a specialized secular use, possibly connected to public feasting, regularly appeared in the new communities, and if so, what this tells us about large-scale social structures. Lastly I touch on how this type of building may have altered in its social remit over the course of the 8 I have benefited from close contact and discussion with the primary investigators of eight recently excavated or restudied sites of this type, viewed excavated material from five, and taken part in the excavation of three. This close contact with the primary data helped partly to overcome the shortcomings of the published record. 9 See especially Mazarakis Ainian.</page><page sequence="5">LAST CHANCE TO SEE? KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 219 EIA in relation to the role and form of settlement temples, which also changed over the same period. In this way, the limited quantity of new data presented here feeds into a very much broader and more adventurous discussion. The field recording and basic analysis could easily have been undertaken on its own as part of a standard management exercise. Only by putting it in a broader research context does it become interpretatively meaningful. Despite the limits of the presently available data, there remain a variety of ways to retrieve further information from the site which build on both the original study and the re-studies, and use them to test and pose new research questions. I explore these avenues in a brief conclusion to the paper (Part 4). The quality limitations of the current record, coupled with the site's still high potential to expand and develop existing interpretations of the Cretan EIA, make it seem especially important to move ahead with new research. The paper's title reflects my overarching aim of bringing Karfi up to date by (1) enhancing the existing record through proper documentation and re-examination; (2) interpreting the record in the context of new data from other sites, and (3) identifying new research issues in the social archaeology of EIA Crete which the site can help in resolving. In showing how consideration of new data forces revaluation of views formed more than sixty years ago, I hope that future studies at the site will build on my work in the same way. I touch on a broad range of issues (often addressed in more detail in my other work on EIA Cretan society) and extend some of my commentary to touch the Protogeometric- Archaic periods (PG-A: c. 1000-580 BC), though without ever going into depth. It is not my intention to attempt definitive answers on any single issue in the study of EIA Cretan society, but to assess how far the architectural evidence so far acquired can take us in some new research directions. Nor does this paper comprise an exhaustive study of the Karfi architectural record: rather, it uses a strategically targeted field exercise to demonstrate the research value of that record long after excavation. PART 1. PREVIOUS FIELDWORK AT KARFI AND THE SUBSEQUENT INTERPRETATION OF ITS RESULTS John Pendlebury's team'o excavated c. 6,000 m2 of a total c. 30,000 m2 settlement area," and twenty contemporary tombs on the slopes to east and south. A report on the work, well rounded by the standards of its time, was published before Pendlebury's death in 1941. It briefly addressed building phasing and function, cult and mortuary practice, craft production, and economy, but lacked consistent or detailed stratigraphic description, quantifications of finds by context (including faunal or botanical remains) or artefact 0o The excavation report on Karfi was published under the names ofJohn Pendlebury, his wife Hilda, and Mercy Money-Coutts. J. Pendlebury, the project's formal director, was by far the best-established scholar and excavator. Neither of the co-authors took responsibility for publishing the site in more detail after Pendlebury's death in 1941, though Money-Coutts published a brief summary of the pottery in 1960 (see below). The archives clearly show that Pendlebury was mainly responsible for architectural recording and interpretation, as well as for the overall research strategy: much of Pendlebury's notebook text is word-for-word directly that of the published report. Thus we can legitimately read the published discussion on architecture as authored by Pendlebury, though he rightly paid credit to other team members for their interpretative contributions. It is for the above reasons, as well as for convenience, that I refer in the text to 'Pendlebury' as the primary author of the observations published in Pendlebury et al. " Nowicki 1987, 242-4, notes that only about one- fifth of the settlement has been excavated, on the basis of surface material: 'less than a third' was estimated by Pendlebury et al., 58.</page><page sequence="6">220 SARO WALLACE drawings. Quantified analyses of pottery types and fabrics were also lacking, though a 1960 article by one of the original report's co-authorsl included drawings of some 'typical' pottery shapes and brief descriptions of the most common fabrics. The archive notebooks contain very little more data about architecture, contexts, or finds.'s Graphic recording reached the average standards of the 1930s, including stone-by-stone plans and sections of the tombs and a 1:300 settlement plan (FIG. i). The emphasis of the latter was on broad spatial relationships. Walls were indicated as solid lines only, and phasing and constructional details were not illustrated (for example, through the use of elevations). Absolute heights (taken on walls alone) were indicated only on two whole-site cross-sections. Topography was shown by a partial contour plan, combined with a sketch impression of the cliff line north of the saddle, which is the most prominent aspect of the site's defensibility. Specific preconceptions typical of early Aegean archaeology, or related to his personal experience, affected some aspects of Pendlebury's analysis in ways which improved contemporary knowledge allows us to re-evaluate: the present paper addresses several of these issues. For example, Pendlebury drew parallels between his recent findings at Amarna and those at Karfi, despite the extreme contrasts in site type and historical context.'4 His hope of discovering the remains of a 'city', with functionally differentiated buildings, together with his experience in excavating and studying the palace of Knossos, conditioned the terms he chose to describe the earliest excavated buildings, such as 'the Magazines' and 'the Barracks':'5 These are retained here for convenience, without any interpretative overtones. The generally limited state of knowledge of contemporary sites of the same type'6 at the time Pendlebury was writing encouraged him to conclude that Karfi had a central role in the island: Since Karphi is quite the largest in extent and the richest of these cities of refuge, it was evidently the centre of the old regime [i.e. of a "pre-Dorian" Cretan population]. We can imagine the ruler still calling himself by the title of "Minos".'7 1' M. Seiradaki, 'Pottery from Karphi', BSA 55 (1960), 1-37. '3 Rutkowski, 258, 270. 14 In a letter of 22 May 1938 (BSA ArchiveJP/L/766), he wrote: 'We are going to get a sort of robber baron's Amarna-one of the first connected town plans ever found-or rather dug-in Greece.' 15 The name 'Barracks' for rooms 2-7 was adopted because workers saw this block as 'guarding' the entrance to the site from the south, and because its plan resembled that of the Barracks block at Amarna. Pendlebury et al., 64. Pendlebury initially interpreted the architecture in this area as the remains of a palatial building, explaining his use of 'Magazines' to designate a block of smaller rooms to the west. He quickly gave up the idea of a palace as the site was explored further (letter of 31 May 1938, BSA Archive JP/L/767). Other names laden with interpretative preconceptions include the 'Baker's House' (with a circular structure thought to be a bread-oven), the 'Priest's House' (where an attached small room held some cult material), and the 'Great House' (the final plan of which seemed exceptionally large and impressive (see Nowicki 1987, 238 contra this view). A similar practice of naming by Evans at Knossos is discussed by Koudounaris and L. Hitchcock, 'Virtual discourse: Arthur Evans and the reconstructions of the Minoan Palace at Knossos', in Y. Hamilakis (ed.) Labyrinth: Rethinking Minoan Crete (Oxford, 2000), 51-2. 16 Only Kavousi Kastro (then thought to date only in the Geometric period), Kavousi Vronda, and Vrokastro, all in east Crete, had been excavated to any significant extent.

Research has advanced to show the wide spread of defensible sites in the island at the period of Karfi's foundation, around i200 BC.'8 Typical examples in the Lasithi region alone which, like Karfi, date only to the earliest part of the EIA period, include Erganos Kefali, Kritsa Kastello and Loutraki Kandilioro. Together with Kalamafki Kipia in eastern Crete, Kastrokefala in central Crete, and others, these join Karfi in the top size class for defensible sites of the early Cretan EIA (c. 3-4 ha). Many settlements in central Crete with continuous occupation between the LM III C and Archaic periods (c. 1200-600 BC) were probably already as large as or larger than Karfi in their early phases, though later material obscures much of the occupation of this date. Though no contemporary defensible site of parallel size has yet been excavated, Pendlebury's claim that Karfi was outstandingly rich has also lost ground. Metal artefacts, for example, parallel those from tombs and settlement areas at the recently excavated sites of Monastiraki Chalasmeno and Kavousi Vronda in east Crete (though certainly more densely concentrated in the excavated area of Karfi).'9 In fact, among the more than 120o settlements now known to have been established in LM III C, no clear hierarchical relationship in size or function is seen at either regional or supra- regional level, though some degree of complementary specialization seems likely to have operated between Karfi and smaller, lower settlements nearby.0o Complementary or broad- based economic models for the site contrast with Pendlebury's: '... picture of [Karfi as] a brigand city, living largely on the wealth of the lowlands, raiding the fertile valley of Gonies and Avdou, spoiling the rich coastland of Mallia and retiring with the booty',21 or Watrous's more recent idea of the settlement as a base for seaborne pirates.2 These views are undermined by evidence for the very widespread nature of relocation from c. 1200oo BC: there are very few low-lying undefended towns or villages, outside the continuing large sites at Knossos, Phaistos and Chania, in the twelfth to eleventh centuries. Questionable assumptions about how material culture relates to ethnicity underpinned some of Pendlebury's other interpretations.23 He suggested that a wave of 'Dorian' immigrants entered Crete at around the time Karfi was founded, displacing communities to the hills. He also saw other Aegean groups making their way to Crete at this time as refugees from the same Dorian invasions. He accepted a prevailing idea that a previous influx of mainlanders to Crete in the LM III period had led island societies to become 18 Nowicki 1987; 1990; 1999, 158, 164, 167; 2000, 157-64, 247-9; Wallace 2002; A.J.

KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 223 'ruled' by mainland groups, and suggested that in the community which relocated to Karfi, Achaeans formed a 'ruling caste'. Nonetheless, he argued that typically 'Achaean'- type building as opposed to Minoan construction (including the use of the 'megaron' form)24 only came into its own during the phase of fresh settlement foundation starting c. 1200oo. Implicit in this model is the idea that 'Achaean' building designs and techniques, and 'Achaean' people themselves, stayed separate and distinct from the 'Minoan' cultural sphere for more than 300 years. Again, the changed context of knowledge and interpretation of the archaeological record promotes re-evaluation of these views. It was partly lack of data on LM III A-B architecture which allowed Pendlebury to see Karfi's material culture as more 'Achaean' than that of the preceding period in Crete.25 An undeveloped theorization of culture contact and change (the notion that Mycenaeanized material culture represented political control by people of mainland origin)26 permitted him to assume 'foreign' dominance. Concerning the idea of major immigration at this period, Crete seems to have had few security advantages over mainland regions which would be likely to encourage one-way migration from the wider Aegean world. Along with a number of other scholars, I see increased opportunities for maritime trade and/or raiding after the collapse of palatial systems c. 1200oo BC as leading to more generally increased mobility, insecurity in island and coastal regions, and the building of new contact networks across the Aegean.'7 The post-1200 settlement pattern in fact seems to reflect the consequent retreat of large parts of the LM III B population of Crete to defensible sites, even while the few largest former centres and trade gateways continued in use.28 The limitations of detail in the record have permitted imaginative, but not always reliable interpretations of the architecture, and of the site's general development and role, in the post-Pendlebury era. Many new treatments have aimed to develop insight into EIA Cretan social structures. Most recently, Day and Snyder have suggested (drawing on comparisons with the more recently excavated site of Kavousi Vronda) that finds in the Karfi Great House and Priest's House might represent feasting activity with a ritualized, prestigious 24 Hayden 1987, 199-201; Darcque. These authors expose problems with the way ethnic/status significance has been attributed to 'megaron' plans in the Aegean by demonstrating problems with defining the term, the variable and repeated appearance of structures designated in this way throughout the LM II-III period in Crete, and the diversity of settlement contexts in which they are found. Of the term Darcque (p. 31) notes: 'I1 est employ1 pour faire pencher la balance en faveur de theses diffusionistes. La raisonnement propose, de fagon plus ou moins explicite, se pr6sente de la faqon suivante: lI ofi il y avait un &lt;&lt;megaron, les Myc6niens ktaient pr6sents, ils exergaient le pouvoir.' 25 For example, the sites of Chondros Kefali and Malia Quartier Nu, offering important angles on this question, had not been excavated. The LM III A-B record outside Knossos is still under-researched and under-published.

He identified diachronic modifications in the Temple, and discussed the character of cult practice there with reference to cult finds elsewhere on the site.31 Single, specialized cult buildings similar to the Temple have since been found at several other excavated LM III C defensible settlements,32 a fact which suggests a strong, standardized social role for public cult in communities formed during the relocation of c. 1200 BC. In fact, Mazarakis Ainian recently used the Karfi architecture to highlight Crete's partly anomalous relation to his generalizing model for the Aegean EIA-that is, that the social role of elite dwellings ('ruler's houses') as venues for ceremonial gatherings was replaced by the emergence of specialized cult buildings in the eighth century: an either/or approach which is difficult to reconcile with the Cretan evidence for much earlier cult buildings.33 The significance of 'megaron'-plan buildings vis-a-vis the ethnic and cultural affiliations of Cretan EIA society is still a live issue. While the concept of the 'megaron' has been regularly redefined and criticized, received notions of the direct connection of 'megaron' buildings in LM III C Crete to mainland incomers and/or elite status persist (see below).34 The Karfi architecture, including a block on the north-eastern part of the site and the Great House, both argued by Pendlebury to have been based around a 'megaron' plan,35 has been used to support a number of different arguments. Darcque cited Karfi's north-eastern block in reassessing the problematic use of the term and its ethnic overtones.36 Considering these buildings within his model of the EIA 'ruler's house', Mazarakis Ainian drew heavily on Pendlebury's interpretation and on the received ethnic connotations of the 'megaron' plan in arguing for the idea of co-resident mainland and Cretan groups at the site. He suggested that the Cretans imitated aspects of the mainlanders' culture, to explain the similarities of plan between the Megarons (which he saw as built by mainlanders) and the Great House (representing a local imitation of the mainland style).37 Nowicki used the slightly different idea of two distinct Cretan groups resident at the site, one local and one 'Mycenaeanized', to help explain some of the differences in plan between the east and west sides of the 29 Day and Snyder. 30 Mazarakis Ainian, 275-96; I.

KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 225 site.38 Preziosi39 viewed the Megarons and their surrounding buildings as a 'megaroid palace' with central court, again treated as the residence of the settlement's rulers. Architectural chronology and construction methods at Karfi have also been revisited in the literature. Nowicki attempted to tie some visually identifiable building sequences directly into the very general cross-site scheme outlined in the 1939 report.40 This approach had only limited success, in the absence of any record of deposits associated with individual walls or features. Another important aspect of Nowicki's work has been exploration of the unexcavated architecture. Pendlebury had noted the existence of well-preserved building remains on the hills of Megali Koprana, to the south, and Mikri Koprana, east of the excavated area.4' Nowicki sketch-mapped these areas and the furthest visible extent of the cemeteries at the site: he also located another small, separate settlement area, the 'North- Eastern site'.4' Recently, he has returned to studying the excavated architecture in detail, reconstructing the use of space within several of the largest buildings. 43 He highlighted visual differences in plan and layout between buildings on the eastern and western halves of the saddle, suggesting that the homogeneous, regularly planned structures on the eastern part of the site post-date the irregularly laid-out settlement 'core' around the Karfi peak on the west.44 Conversely, Pendlebury thought that the east saddle's plans represented the first stone-built construction on the site.45 While twelfth-century Cretan settlements on defensible hilltops do often seem to have spread out over time,46 problems arise with both models, particularly in their lack of support from ceramic chronology (Day's new study confirms there is no dating difference in the ceramics retained from each zone).47 None of the above studies produced new detailed plans or elevations, or extensive written records, to support their conclusions on the excavated architecture, relying mostly on the small-scale plans and brief descriptions published in 1939. The studies in progress by Day and Gesell will include new drawings and photographs of many artefacts. A gap clearly still exists in the scholarship, then, with regard to analysis of architectural form, sequence and function based on adequate documentation. It is this gap which the present study was intended to fill. PART 2. DETAILED RECORD OF AND OBSERVATIONS ON THE FORM OF KARFI ARCHITECTURE, 2002-3 (a) METHODS AND PRODUCTS OF THE NEW STUDY The first task of the fieldwork was contour planning of the excavated area at 1 m intervals, based on EDM survey. This aimed to produce a more accurate and representative record of topography, including absolute contour heights and an accurate plot of the north cliff line (FIG. 2). Beyond the excavated area, EDM plots were made, and photographs taken, of all ancient structural remains clearly visible on the surface (FIG. 3). The EDM was also 38 Nowicki 1999, 147-8. 39 D.

The topographical work was followed by recording at scale 1 : 50 of four excavated building complexes- the Megarons (rooms 135-142), Great House (rooms 9-14), Priest's House (rooms 61, 8o, 58-60) and part of the Cliff Houses (rooms 120-121-13-14). Along with the rest of the excavated architecture, these were also the subject of a detailed written and photographic record, aimed at illustrating their construction, chronology, and condition. The various facets of these buildings' significance which justify their close study are addressed at length in the archive report.48 All the selected buildings were judged to possess some of the best preservation on the site, in terms of standing wall height and the integrity and visibility of construction over a sizeable area. The first three buildings were judged as highly interpretatively significant, with regard to the amount and type of information they had produced during excavation, the excavator's evaluation of them, the amount of research and analysis dedicated to them by subsequent scholars, and the extent to which new records of them would be of interest to current research on EIA architecture and society. The last structure, much less focused on by past scholarship and treated by the excavators as an ordinary house, was studied as a useful comparison, furthering the study's aim of more systematically evaluating distinctions in use and form between 'standard' domestic spaces and 'special' buildings. The focus on these particular structures does not indicate that the other excavated buildings are insignificant: later, I suggest which of them might repay detailed study of a similar kind. For the first time anywhere at Karfi, wall elevations were drawn for the highest-preserved walls in the selected buildings, and appear here alongside the plans. They proved useful in the comparative analysis of construction techniques within and beyond the site. Despite their relatively good preservation, the selected buildings have already suffered considerable deterioration (and their height makes them especially vulnerable to damage in the immediate future). The recording took place in the driest season (July-September) when plant cover was at its lowest, but plants still often heavily obscured the walls. Given the walls' fragility, the quantity of fallen blocks, and the absence of consolidation alongside with the recording exercise, the clearance of stones or vegetation could not be undertaken before drawing without risking further damage. For this reason, structures were drawn and photographed as found. A set of 'cleaned' plans (reconstructing the obscured areas) was also produced, and is provided here for easy reference. The absolute heights shown inside the architectural spaces represent current ground levels and are meant to show the relative preserved heights of walls and features, not the level of any archaeological deposit. The new observations on building chronology, technology and form presented here cannot be treated as ordinary 'primary' analysis of archaeological data. The buildings and their associated deposits were already described and interpreted together by the excavator as well as in later discussions. Since a long gap has elapsed since the buildings were first uncovered, changing and obscuring them, the excavator's account is vital in understanding how they originally appeared. There would be no point in trying to exclude it from my analysis at any stage, and the earlier publication must be consulted alongside my new 48 Wallace, 'Study' (n. 6). The report includes a multifaceted assessment of the significance of the site and its component parts, in the expectation that defining and rationalizing significance will be highly relevant to future conservation decisions.</page><page sequence="15">LAST CHANCE TO SEE? KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 229 observations throughout, in order to understand the relevance of the latter. They mostly emphasize simple differences from, or gaps in, the earlier accounts. While I reserve the later parts of the paper for more broadly generalizing discussion, I try already in this section to combine my observations with Pendlebury's to make some new basic small- scale interpretations. My discussion also draws on a knowledge of other sites with better context records in identifying and discussing specific types of feature (e.g. bins, doorways, and storerooms). (B) DETAILED OBSERVATIONS ON NEWLY-PLANNED BUILDINGS Rooms 113- 14-12-I 2 1 (part of 'Cliff Houses')49 (FIGS. 4-6) This complex represents a typical agglutinated unit in the architecture of the western saddle. It lacked distinctive finds of cult, feasting, or craft equipment, suggesting a fairly simple domestic structure. Despite the relatively good preservation, many joints are damaged or obscured. The complex contains what Pendlebury described as 'earlier walls' (one at the south end of room 120 and one just west of that room's western wall) and he also noted 'many pits filled with charcoal' under the floor of room 1 13, suggesting a fairly complex developmental sequence. The western walls of rooms 120, 113, and 114, preserved to eight courses, illustrate construction techniques particularly well. The two 'earlier' walls found near room o20 suggest a structure with location and dimensions similar to the present room (the wall at the south-west corner of 120o is now marked only by a rubble concentration). An earlier (open?) activity area to the south of 120, not necessarily contemporaneous with these earlier walls, seems represented by the sub-floor deposits in room 113. The large, thick-walled complex 102-1 o6-115 seems to abut room 120's south-west corner, and probably pre-dates the second incarnation of 120 for reasons noted below. A narrow east-west running wall, not mentioned by Pendlebury, and not very clearly identifiable today, may have subdivided the current room 120 c. 2.3 m from its south end, or represent part of the earlier room. Almost all of 12o's north wall is now eroded over the cliff edge. There is no topographical constraint to explain why room 14, opening out of the present 120 to its south, is smaller than room x 13, and this suggests that these rooms were not built together. The thickness of room 114's south wall suggests an exterior, and so the room could have been built together with 120, with room 113 being added later. Room 114's north wall, constructed in small rubble (and thus resembling a partition) supports this idea. It seems to have been built up against the east wall of 10o6-1 15-1o02: if it was indeed contemporary with the rest of 120's construction, rather than rebuilt at a later date when room 114 was added to room 120, room 120 post-dates io6-115-102. Room 121 abuts the north wall of io6-115-102 and west wall of 120, post-dating both. Pendlebury argued that the small rooms 115-102 were for storage, noting carbonized olives from l o0. The small size and uneven rock floor of room 121, together with the fragments of five pithoi recovered there, also suggest a storage function, most likely for 12o-114, though the room has no visible doorways. The BSA Archive notebook MCS-2 5-8.94 records it as containing heavily burnt deposits. This suggests a significant volume of organic remains, possibly foodstuffs. 49 Pendlebury et al., 94-6.</page><page sequence="16">230 SARO WALLACE bedrock vegetation Legend 112139 Il1;~36y~: 11 0.39 ^1-lA o- footpat+, 1118 121 120 1122.12 ~112.17 earlier? wall 114 106-115- 102 113 I -l 6 QA sw) '- 1817 doorway 0 2m FIG. 4.

KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 233 Pendlebury argued that the construction of room 89, which narrowed the access road 117 to the east of the complex, required replacement of the doorway in the east wall of 113 by one in the room's south wall, giving onto road 103-105. However, after construction of room 86 blocked this street, access seems to have been more clearly obstructed from the south than it was from the east, 50and the sequence of doorway construction may have been the other way around. The south-east part of room 12o's east wall, shown as a thin diagonal line on Pendlebury's plan, has a rough character, possibly suggesting rebuilding on a slightly different angle in order to maximize light or access between 120 and 11 0-89 as 89 was being built. Neither the 'column base'nor the plaque floor reported in room 1i135' are identifiable today. In this narrow space it is difficult to explain the use of a roof support, and column bases are generally unusual on the site. It may instead be a flat jar-stand, like those found at contemporary Kavousi Vronda, or part of the paving.52 The archive notebook suggests that a central pit containing charcoal found in this room was a hearth, with posts either side of it: nothing survives of this. The stone-built bin in the north-west corner of room 114 is buried by fallen stones, but has parallels in rooms 9 and 139 at Karfi, both the main rooms of their respective buildings (see Part 3a), and in main rooms at Vronda, which may have housed water jars or cooking pots.53 As their elevation shows (FIG. 6), the west walls of 120 and east wall of 102-106-115 use large blocks (many above 1 m long), contrasting with the small rubble construction of the cross-walls. This solidity is characteristic of back walls on the saddle's slopes, and created strong terrace-like supports for the buildings. 8-17 ('Great House')54 (FIGS. 8-12) Pendlebury's sequence for this building's construction was as follows. Rooms 9 and 16- 1755 were followed by room 8, then room 14, and at some stage by rooms 11 to 13. This is partly confirmed by observation today. Partition walls in the latter rooms abut the much more massive south wall of 16-17, and the doorway between rooms 9 and 11 was cut through the existing wall of 9. Pendlebury's plan exaggerates the offsetting of the north walls of rooms 9 and 16-17 to highlight their separation. In fact, some care was taken to build these rooms/houses at right angles, suggesting careful planning. Nowicki's corrected version of Pendlebury's plan shows the addition of room 14 as preceding the construction of room 8, a conclusion my observations support.56 In room 16-17, a c. 2 m- long threshold stone, the largest on the site, was positioned centrally in the original fagade. The entire effect of this was changed by the addition of 14, producing a new smaller 50 Nowicki 1987, 239. 5' BSA Archive MCS-2 5-8.94. 52 Day et al. 1986, 373. 53 Coulson and Tsipopoulou, 71; Day et al. 1986, 373, 386. Pendlebury et al., 88 suggest that this feature could as easily be a 'fireplace' as ajar-stand. This explanation is less convincing in room 139, which already has a hearth. However, such features could also conceivably represent the bases of small ovens. Some mainland EIA examples contain charred foodstuffs. Fagerstr6m, 131-2. Similar features had appeared in LM III A-B main rooms at Kefali Chondros Viannou and Kommos: Platon, 362; Shaw, 238-9, who notes, p. 238, that these 'bins' at Kommos sometimes contained cooking pots, and closely resemble hearths at the site, as do enclosures at Chondros Kefali; Hayden 2002, 210. 54 Pendlebury et al., 77-9. 55 I think the latter should be treated as a room, not a courtyard, given its uniformly heavy and careful construction, self-contained character, and the fact that it possesses a single, monumental entrance accessed from a street. 56 Nowicki 1987, 238; 1999, 148-9.</page><page sequence="20">234 SARO WALLACE bedtrock vegetaton L.egend 40 ej ,.J 'bench' or earlier wall 16 11101.75 ( (I 2.5 m remains of steps I 1o 9, 9 17 1109.83 ~cr j4W 1 ' 5 ,I9 3 13 Ills. 12 iT IoX. 11188 - 4 ,f_.

'Bench' in 11-12, from south. doorway into room 16-17 which incorporated only part of the original threshold. The intrusive nature of this change suggests collaboration in, or acceptance of, the extension to room 9 by the owners/residents of 16-17 (potentially a distinct group, since these rooms never communicated). Collapse from the north wall of room 9 completely obscures the hatch found between rooms 9 and 14, where floor levels were separated by at least 0.7 m. Awkward for everyday use, the hatch entrance fits Pendlebury's characterization of 14 as a storeroom, and is paralleled in some other likely storerooms on the site, though no special concentration of pithoi was found in this case. The new observations help in assessing the function of a 'bench' or 'ledge' identified by Pendlebury in rooms 12-11 (FIGS. 11-12). This continues between the rooms along the north wall, running through a narrow doorway in a way highly inconvenient for regular use. Its width in most places is a half to one stone wide (max. 0.55 m), minimally adequate for use as a work surface or shelf.57 It is c. 1 m above the approximate floor level, with an uneven upper surface and an increasing east-to-west offset from the wall. Many of these 57 Benches at the contemporary Chalasmeno and Vronda sites are 0.6-0.9 m wide (Coulson and Tsipopoulou, 76-7).</page><page sequence="24">238 SARO WALLACE features cast doubt on its functional character. It may represent (along with the bench on the east wall of room 12, no longer preserved) the walls of an earlier room which covered a similar area to the present rooms 12 and 13, predating the present room 16/17 and thus adding another phase to the history of building in this area. Pendlebury records that 'Both these rooms [12, 131 were built over an earlier rubbish-tip,'58 noting that the latter extended up to 1 m below the foundations of the present rooms 11-13, 16-17, and 70o. I suggest this 'tip' could represent deposits belonging with an earlier construction, though in a sketch section Pendlebury also represents the 'bench' as overlying these deposits.59 He noted that the 'tip' contained a high number of fine sherds (possibly suggesting a special or high-status function for this potentially early structure, echoed by the finds from the later Great House, discussed below). The ephemeral subdivision wall in 16-17's south-west corner, reported during excavation but no longer visible, might belong with the same early phase. Another interesting feature in 16-17 is a buttress of small rubble construction, running halfway along the line of its west wall-possibly used to strengthen the wall when its height was increased at the time room 70 was built towards the end of the site's lifespan, showing the sequence of building in this area.6o As shown by the elevation of the well-preserved north wall of room 16-17 (FIG. 1 o) the Great House is remarkable for the consistent use of large roughly-coursed blocks (many c. o.8-1 m in length) in its core walls. It was clearly felt appropriate, when adding subsidiary rooms, to maintain the original high building standard-the north wall of 14 and south wall of 11-12-13 include substantial, regular blocks: the partition walls in the latter area have smaller stones, usually up to 0.5 m in length. Bedrock forms most of the west wall of 13, where it is probably cut back to a vertical face, and has an interesting role to play in room 16-17, where it runs in a low ridge across the width of the room. Pendlebury links bedrock outcrops in buildings across the site with finds of cult objects, but any directly functional role of this one-e.g. as a bench-is unlikely, since it is uneven, low (c. o. 1 m high) and runs right across the width of the room, only c. 1.25 m west of the doorway.6' 135-44 ('Megarons' block)6 (FIGS. 7, 13-14) The way the block is represented on the 1939 plan, and its isolation, has often encouraged its analysis as a package, though it is the suite of rooms 138-139 -140 which are most frequently singled out for attention as representing a distinctive 'megaron plan.63 The new observations highlight the fact that though they share mostly centrally-aligned room entrances and all contained central hearths, the block's components are not very closely similar in plan. Rooms 137-141 form a much smaller structure than 138-140. The south wall of Building 137-141 is set back more than a metre from that of building 138-139- 140, and sharply rising bedrock at the north end of room 137 means it cannot have had the length which the original plan gives it. Though observation is hampered by much 58 Pendlebury et al., 77. 59 BSA Archive MCS-2 5-8.94. 6 Pendlebury et al., 77. 6' Ibid., 85.

Gesell 1985, 45-6, suggests this feature was a bench. 62 Pendlebury et al., 70-2. 63 The unaltered plan of these rooms, and of the whole block, has frequently been reproduced to support interpretations: e.g. Mazarakis Ainian, Table X; Darcque, 29; Nowicki 1999.</page><page sequence="25">LAST CHANCE TO SEE? KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 239 erosion and disturbance, I was able to identify a few stones in line potentially indicating 137's north wall, at a point roughly in line with the north wall of room 138 to the east. Despite the suggestion in the old plan, there is no clear evidence for the deliberate design of space 141, at the south end of the building, as an open anteroom to 137. After the addition of enclosure 142 to its west, this was simply an irregular space formed by the west wall of 138, extending south of 137's south wall on the east side, and the corner of room 136, extending south by a shorter distance on the west. Before the building of 142 it is difficult to say what form this space took, since we do not know at what stage room 136 was added to the complex. Instead, room i37 might have had a closed anteroom inside its south wall, mirroring the building to its east. A possible subdivision wall (lying slightly further south than suggested on Pendlebury's plan) comprises a single line of small to medium-sized stones. But this would create a very small anteroom, only c. 0.7 m wide. The wall could alternatively represent the remains of an earlier structure, replaced by rooms 137-141. Another possible subdivision, in the northern half of room 137, is noted by Nowicki.64 The present study recorded a concentration of very small stones in the same approximate area, but these are not very convincing as a wall (and perhaps simply represent post-excavation collapse). The tripartite division indicated if both walls are accepted would produce a very small central room (2.3 x 3 m):65 it seems likely that one wall is either illusory, or pre-dates the final plan. The northern walls of all three 'Megarons' buildings are actually perched on or very close to the cliff edge, though Pendlebury's plan misleadingly suggests that extensive further building space extended to the north. Room 138 has lost most of its north wall over the precipice. Bedrock formations isolate the block on other sides, too, rising in the cliff of Mikri Koprana to the east and dropping down by c. 2 m west of room 1 36. This room has bedrock as a major component of three walls, with a low (possibly cut) ledge, c. o.6 m high, separating it from room 137. Its simple plan strongly resembles those of the neighbouring Barracks (rooms 2-6), though its central hearth, as well as the party wall, ties it together with the structures to its east. Building 138-140 clearly has a single-phase plan. The solid east wall, a continuous build, helps terrace the building on the slope. The main entrance in room 140, which is rather wide for the site, at c. 1.17 m, preserves no trace of a threshold stone. The uneven configuration of bedrock, rising slightly east of the doorway, is probably what caused the door to be positioned at one end of the wall, rather than centrally, as elsewhere in the complex. The doorway between rooms 140 and 139 also lacks a threshold, but a single- slab threshold is well preserved in the doorway between 139 and 138, making a step up from the floor of 139. The hollow space to the east of the building, enclosed by rising bedrock cliffs on its north and east sides, seems to have been used at least in its southern section (143) for food storage (twelve pithoi were found here), though this section was not closed off at the front: perhaps the storage was short-term. This large external storage 64 Nowicki 1999, 151-2. Assuming room 138 to have been a specialized storage area, he reconstructs 137's hypothetical back room in the same way. There are parallels at Vronda Building I, and Smari Building 2, where the small back room had storage evidence: Glowacki 2002, 41; Glowacki 2004, 41; Hatzi-Vallianou 2004, 114. 65 Hayden 1987, 203 suggests such a plan at Chondros Kefali Building A-B, with an inner anteroom only 1.6 m wide. However, lack of published stratigraphy makes it unclear whether this was in contemporaneous use with the main room.</page><page sequence="26">240 SARO WALLACE bedrock vegetation Legend 1~e 1122.57 138 122.8K I123.88 144 "'F2--?2-301 1122.44 143 1121 ,41 f - "'1882 ~c 139 1121.73 n I 1 136 137 d ir 9 0( a 3 O 1- ~e h 1122 140 o, .' 141 m 121.17 11196 1119.40 Y \Z ~2f~t";i;; '5C3h R~ J1121.79$ 1OOWO 12w3 135 o Yr20. 2m FIG. 13.

The fact that the division wall across the hollow is set almost flush with 139's north wall (rather than nearly halfway down 139's length, as Pendlebury's plan indicates) and may have been bonded into it, suggests this unit formed an integral part of 138-140. However, room 144, to its north, lacks preserved communication with either room 138 or the space 143 to the south. Pendlebury noted traces of hatchways in both rooms 143 and 144, linking them to 138-140, but the latter case seems unlikely, given the short length of 144's west wall.66 Room 142 includes rock outcrops in all its walls and encloses an uneven rocky surface: outcrops close it off to the south. It might have been an external larder or animal pen. To the south of the Megarons, the ground surface is mostly eroded to bedrock-some soil may have been cleared by Pendlebury. There are no traces of ancient building, and c. io m to the south the eroded/excavated area gives way to agricultural terraces, pre-dating the excavation. As FIG. 7 shows, the construction in this complex uses medium-sized blocks (up to about 0.75 m in diameter), smaller than those in the core walls of the 'Great House', but solid enough to provide a good terrace into the slope. The coursing is very rough and small stones fill many interstices. Numerous gaps between the stones suggest considerable use of mud bonding or small stone packing. Priest's House (61, 80, 58-60)67 (FIGS. 15-18) The name of this complex reflects Pendlebury's view of it as having a special, even elite function. This association, as well as its size, integrity and relative clarity of plan (though rapid deterioration is changing this) made it an attractive target for study. Like several others on the site, the building contains traces of probable earlier constructions, which the inadequate stratigraphic recording did not allow to be related with each other. Charcoal deposits were recorded under the floor of room 61, and traces of a c. 1 m thick wall run parallel to the west wall's outer face. An off-parallel line of medium-sized stones juts out under the east wall, and an earlier built corner protrudes at angles from under room 59's south-east corner. Although Pendlebury interpreted the last two features as a means of catching water runoff, all together these elements strongly suggest earlier construction in the area. The first two walls suggest a building of similar dimensions and orientation to the final room 61. The parallel circumstances in rooms 12o and 12-13 hint that rebuilding at Karfi often closely followed earlier plans: since this often applies to the core main rooms of buildings before many extensions were built, it might even suggest that a major rebuilding event occurred early in the site's history. The 1939 report used extra-thick lines to show the west walls of rooms 61 and 80o, and indicated a recessed area on the latter's east face, possibly the 'high ledge' mentioned in the text. The results of the new recording explains the excavators' reasons for representing the building in this way, not explained in the original text. The new plan suggests an 66 Pendlebury et al., 71. Pendlebury may have beenmisled by the erroneous final plan (the original sketch plan shows the correct position) and in fact have seen hatchway(s) only between rooms 139 and 143: he refers to the second hatch as located in the NE corner of 139- Another external storage area reached via a hatchway appears east of room 2. It is possible that the wall between rooms 143 and 144 was placed to extend the building's south faqade, making it look more impressive. 67 Pendlebury et al., 77-9.</page><page sequence="29">LAST CHANCE TO SEE? KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 243 eastward reorientation of room 8o's west wall somewhere south of its midpoint at the time room 58 was added, possibly to preserve space and light between the building and rooms 69-81 to the west. The west wall of 58 was extended south at some point after completion of the room, closing off access from the south to major east-west and north- south routes across the site. Other walls or buildings were also placed across streets late in Karfi's occupation, restricting access to the central saddle. The south wall of room 59 joins the east wall of 58 at about its mid-point (rather than almost meeting room 8o's south-east corner, as on Pendlebury's plan) and so looks to have been constructed after 58. The protruding corner south-east of room 59, mentioned above probably represents an earlier small structure on the site of 59, not necessarily joined to the wider complex: it is not clear when this fell out of use. The west wall of room 61 is of double construction, showing 61-8o to be a completely separate structure from the small rooms to its west (83 and 84), which are entered from room 85. Although the double-wall technique is used elsewhere at Karfi (for example between rooms 47-43 and 44 in the southern sector) it is not a consistent feature of agglutinative building there. Here, where a steep slope produces a difference in floor height of more than 0.7 m between 61 and the rooms to the west, the use of two lower walls, rather than a single high one, might improve structural stability.68 Plans focused around a single 'main' room are typical at Karfi and other contemporary sites, in all types of building. The near-duplication in size of the large room 61 by the connected room 8o is a more unusual feature. Owing to a build-up of loose soil and partial collapse their party wall is not clearly visible today, and the doorway indicated in 1939 is no longer clear. Parallels may exist with the Great House, where two originally independent, offset single-room structures became more closely linked over time (though never clearly linked or functioning as a single house). It is possible that room 80o post- dates 61, or that the connecting doorway was knocked through to link two originally separate buildings. The following features tend to support this idea. The double wall between room 61 and the buildings to the west is not replicated in room 80o. The floor height difference of c. o.6 m between the rooms suggests a step was needed: if rooms 61- 80o had been built originally as one unit, levelling of the floors might be expected. Room 80o shows evidence for food storage as its last main use, with eight pithoi found there, but is considerably larger than any other likely storeroom on the site. The small size of room 6o suggests an abbreviated anteroom or storeroom. It was probably never the main entry route to room 61, and room 59 eventually closed off its external access. Because of the presence of some cult-related artefacts there, Pendlebury saw room 58 as a semi-public shrine, accessible from the street but somehow linked to the main building. An interesting parallel appears at LM III B-C Katsambas, but here, too, the relation of the cult room to the main structure is unclear.69 If room 8o is seen as a 'main room' (see below) in its own right, separate from 61 at some point in its lifetime, the form of room 58 echoes the porch found before the main rooms of other large buildings at Karfi, and at Vronda, though 68 Use of a similar technique may appear in the stepped rebuild of 71-73's east walls when 70 was constructed: Mook, 47. At the LM III A-B hilltop settlement of Chondros Kefali, double walls were used fairly regularly. Platon, 365- 69 Pendlebury et al., 53; Alexiou.

Construction quality supports the notion of an important, high-investment building hinted at by the remarkably large storeroom and the 'cult' room. Medium to large rubble blocks were used in room 61 's east and north street fagades, and traces of lime plaster (not paralleled elsewhere on the site) were found on the west wall of room 80.7' The unique ledge in room 80, and the longest bench on the site, along room 61's west wall, are also noteworthy.

Cleaned/restored plan of 'Priest's House'. from the large building shown in Nowicki's sketch, Megali Koprana shows a spread of architecture dated to the LM III C period by its associated pottery. The smooth surface of the soil suggests relatively deep and well preserved, rather than eroded, archaeological deposits in this area. The apparent placing of rooms off a 'spine' wall along the western edge of the summit finds parallels at hilltop settlements in the LM III C, but also the Geometric to Archaic, periods.72 It seems related to local topography, since spine building would be of limited use in the saddle. Building Ai, located in the hollow immediately north of Megali Koprana, appears of simple rectangular plan, a fact which encouraged Nowicki to connect it to the 'late' uncluttered structures of Karfi's east saddle.7s However, 72 Day et al. 1986, 375-6. The remains of a recent small drystone building may obscure the ancient wall line on the west side of the summit. Earlier use of the spine technique appears in a perimeter wall supporting agglutinative architecture at Chondros Viannou. Platon, 358-60. A more complex structural role for such walls existed by the Archaic period at hilltop settlements: see Haggis et al. At 6th-c. Azoria, a massive wall c. 250 m long acts as a terrace retaining the whole summit, as well as a building spine. Haggis et al., 349-51, note parallel examples at unexcavated Archaic settlements in the Meseleri valley, and the use of 'spines' at individual building level in the settlements of Lato and Onithe Gouledianon.

(c) GENERAL COMMENTS ON FORM, SIZE AND LAYOUT OF THE KARFI ARCHITECTURE: CROSS-SITE OBSERVATIONS AND OFF-SITE COMPARISONS Below, I draw on Pendlebury's account, and on the new record, to produce a general commentary on the chronology, form and technology of buildings and features across the site.75 This is enriched and supplemented by comparisons with more recently excavated sites of the same type and date. It forms an important grounding for Part 3, where I move on, using evidence from moveable finds, to consider the functions and status of rooms and buildings, and the types of activities which took place there. Again it is necessary for the reader to refer to the earlier account for a full description of the layout and character of building complexes. Observations on architectural sequences throughout the site suggest that as in the blocks studied above, many of the earliest structures were of a free-standing, simple type, involving one or two rooms: room 44, in the south sector, and 55-57, a self-contained two-room unit before the addition of the Baker's House complex to its north, reflect this pattern.76 Over time, buildings expanded in an agglutinative manner, paralleled at all contemporary sites. This saved space in settlements with tightly restricted topography, and must also have had social implications, which I discuss below. Although in this analysis I assume that abutment joints indicate building expansion over time, they may often represent the easiest technique in one-phase constructions.77 The slightly greater thickness of the earliest external walls in many blocks often seems related to the need to terrace buildings into the slopes, but may also have had agglutination in mind, with the original outer walls designed to be used as spines.78 By the end of Karfi's lifespan, as I have shown above, buildings were differentiated by construction techniques as well as by plan and features. Pendlebury's impression was that 'Large and small stones seem to be used almost indiscriminately.'79 In fact, as we saw above, visible contrasts in construction methods seem to indicate varying degrees of investment, as well as showing building sequence. At the same time, the exclusive use of specific features or techniques in the interests of demonstrating a building's status or function is generally rare, as I show repeatedly below. All walls were of worked rubble-the highest now preserved (the north wall of room 16-17) is eight courses high (1.7 m).8o Their 74 A. Brown (ed.), with K. Bennett, Arthur Evans's Travels in Crete, I894-1899 (BAR Siooo; Oxford, 2001), 219, 337-8. 75 Building on, and filling some gaps in, the discussion in Pendlebury et al., 66-8. 76 Ibid., 81-2, 84. The original report suggests room 44 was added late to this block, but the solidity and size of the structure suggest otherwise. Wall joints are not currently well-preserved enough to make certain. 77 Fagerstr6m, 113-15, notes the difficulty of wall bonding in uncoursed rubble architecture. 78 Hayden 1983, 375; Nowicki 1999, 152. 79 Pendlebury et al., 66-7. 8o Mudbrick building on stone socles is the main technique at Vronda and Chalasmeno (with evidence for second storeys at the former site).

KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 249 thickness is standard for EIA sites (0.6-0.85 m).8' Full stone second storeys would be heavy in this technique, especially since supporting posts or columns are not widely documented, except in the largest rooms. Short ladders or stone steps probably linked some rooms terraced onto the slopes, such as 23 and 22 in the Magazines: in general, though, the building of long houses oriented north-to-south along the contours seems to have avoided the need for two-storey buildings. Hearths were represented by patches of burnt soil/clay and charcoal. Similar circular, central clay hearths, sometimes with stone bedding/surround, had appeared in LM I-III B domestic contexts, and are seen in LM III C at Vronda, Chalasmeno, and Chania.8A At Karfi, the concentration of hearths in the Megarons is striking,83 but needs assessing with great caution: hearths are in general rarely reported at the site. It could relate to (a) poor hearth preservation in other parts of the site (with the Megarons cases perhaps representing specially large or intensively used examples, a fact in itself significant); (b) extra-careful documentation by the excavators in this case because of the expected association of 'megaron' buildings with central hearths; or (c) the real character of cooking organization at Karfi, explored below. In contrast, most Vronda structures had a central hearth and/or rectangular clay oven in their main room, though some buildings at Chalasmeno lack any trace of cooking facilities.84 Ovens were used at Karfi, too, as the circular 'bread oven' in room 73 shows,85 but the singular size and form of this feature (1.5 m external diameter: Vronda averages are 0.5 m) and its central positioning, suggest an extra-household function. worked rubble or mudbrick.

The walls of sizeable LM III A-B buildings average about 0.75-0.8 m.

Similarity between LM III A-B and LM III C hearth forms appears at sites with continuous occupation between the periods, as at Chania. On new LM III C sites, the role of local cooking traditions is clear: all hearths on a site tend to be of the same type and pattern from the start. However, there is considerable variability between sites. For example, wall/corner hearths appear at Chalasmeno but not at Vronda; Karfi has very few hearths in general. These facts undermine any notion that widespread, novel cooking traditions accompanied major immigration in the 12th c. 83 The Great House may have produced evidence for a hearth which was not directly reported (Pendlebury et al., 137). The excavators reported a small stone-built oven in the south corner of room 89 (D. 0.7 m) and 'fireplaces' in rooms 68 and 113 (ibid., 88-90o). The poor record and the currently bad preservation of room 89 makes it unclear at what stage the oven was built, or how it was used. 84 Glowacki 2002, 42; 2004, 129-30; Yasur-Landau forthcoming; L. Day, K. Glowacki, and N. Klein, 'Cooking and dining at LM IIIC Vronda, Kavousi', in He7rQay'gva 2000, 117-18. Vronda ovens are characterized as too small to have contained the cooking dishes found at the site, and thus were probably used for cooking bread or other containerless food items. They seem to have been regularly cleaned out after use. s5 Pendlebury et al., 86-7.</page><page sequence="36">250 SARO WALLACE It is not absolutely clear that it was actually used for food preparation, but this is likely: two cooking dishes were found inside. It was not built in the first stage of the room's use, leaving open the question of what kind of cooking systems it replaced. Distribution of cooking facilities had also varied across and between LM III A-B sites. At Kommos, cooking facilities (stone-built hearths which might double as ovens) were lacking completely in some houses; where they appeared, some were located in main rooms, others in separate 'kitchens' associated with major complexes (e.g. 019; 012).86 The latter pattern is also seen at Malia Quartier Nu, suggesting to the excavators that some role for centralized cooking existed in this complex."' Benches appear in a minority of Karfi buildings, though common enough not to suggest any special significance. They are commonest in main rooms, less frequent in smaller rooms identified as specialized storage areas, and probably had multiple uses.88 The wall- to-wall benches in rooms 3 and 33 are positioned on the rooms' short sides: there are benches shorter than room width in rooms 132, 6, and 76, which have parallels at Vronda and Chalasmeno. The bench in room 6 simply comprised two large squarish stones set against the wall, and most other benches (including the exceptionally long example in room 61) were probably of this 'leaning' type. The bench in the Temple, created by filling a c. 0.7 m gap between two walls with rubble and earth packing, is unique in its scale, construction and solidity.89 Pendlebury probably under-estimated the number of doorways, since many walls were preserved to only low heights. The lack of doorways in a complex as large as 26-27, for example, is not easily explicable, suggesting they might have been positioned higher in the walls. The elaboration of doorways by the use of squared jambs and large threshold slabs mostly correlates with the size of room and the importance of the entrance within the building as a whole. The main external entrances of the main rooms 61, 9, and 16-17 have large single-block thresholds, contrasting with the modest paved threshold of the subsidiary room 58, for example. Once again, differentiation in this regard is rarely extreme. Even large and potentially special-function buildings like the Megarons and Priest's House lack doorways over 1 m wide.91 Subsidiary rooms and partition walls have the narrowest 86 Shaw. 87 Driessen and Farnoux 1994, 60. A separate kitchen seems to have existed in the largest building at Chondros Kefali (Platon, 360). The 'stoa' at LM III Kommos contains five hearths, suggesting a very concentrated cooking function (Shaw, 251). By the late 6th c. at Azoria, the development of separate household-level kitchens seems indicated at Azoria: small houses at Bioo and B300 seem to have a dedicated space for cooking and food processing. Haggis et al., 352-6 1. A grouping of two 'kitchens', with corner hearths and food storage and preparation evidence, occurs near and possibly in association with a public dining and storage complex on the site's west slope (A6oo). Haggis et al., 368, 378, 383- 4. The coexistence of domestic and public cooking in both the LBA and Archaic periods suggests it also occurred in the EIA. Yasur-Landau forthcoming. 88 Room 81, probably a storeroom (see below) is an exception. At Vronda, benches are sometimes located in subsidiary/store rooms, but mostly in main rooms. Glowacki 2002, 41-2. They appear in storerooms at LM III B-C Katsambas and Archaic Azoria (B4oo, A12oo). Alexiou; Haggis et al., 363, 368, 375. Recesses for pithoi at Geometric Zagora point to use of benches as shelves in storeroom contexts. Fagerstr6m, 33-5- 89 Gesell et al. 1985, 340-2; Pendlebury et al., 75; Rutkowski, 260. 90 This width is comparable with Vronda and Chalasmeno doorway width. Coulson and Tsipopoulou, 77, 82; Glowacki 2002, 38. In LM III A-B buildings of medium to advanced size and complexity, doorway widths paralleled or exceeded the exceptional 2 m-wide example in Karfi 16-17. The entrance in the north building at Plati is 2 m wide; in Gournia Building He the main doorway is 3.4 m wide and the second largest 1.2 m. Doorways seem to become generally more modest in Early Iron Age architecture, and this pattern continues into the Archaic period. At Archaic Azoria, the 1.1 m doorway to A8oo (interpreted as a public dining room) is unusually wide. A further decline in the use of broad, slab- threshold doorways by this period may relate to the fact</page><page sequence="37">LAST CHANCE TO SEE? KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 251 doorways; those of rooms 12, 130, 82, and 59 are among the smallest on the site. Knocked- through doorways, like the one between rooms 9 and i1, are less elaborate than those which were planned into structures from the beginning. The latter example is narrower than the main external doorway to room 9, and uses small, shaped-rubble jambs instead of the latter's impressive blocks. The use of hatches in rooms 84-85, 2, 131 and 14, identifiable as storerooms (see below), suggests that storage spaces did not require full doorways.9' In the latter case, where there is a difference in floor levels between rooms 9 and 14, a hatch may have been easier to knock through than a doorway when room 14 was added. Hatches were just one way of dealing with regular differences in floor level on a sloping site. Pendlebury suggested that short ladders offset floor level differences where steps were absent, e.g. in the c. o.5 m gap between rooms 79 and 89 in the 'Commercial Quarter', and between rooms 61 and 80.92 He also argued that some rooms could only have been entered by trapdoors from above because no doorways were preserved. This idea is not always convincing, as in the case of rooms 12 and 13, suggested to have had trapdoor entrances. These had a high bedrock terrace to their west, making access from above very difficult, and could not be accessed from the north by this means either. They were built together with room 1 1, itself communicating with room 9 by an ordinary doorway, and doorway access from 11 is much more likely.e9 The ladder method seems awkward and sometimes unnecessary where only small height differences were in question. Short flights of stone steps between rooms are also found here and at contemporary sites, e.g. in the Vronda complex I-O-N.94 Room 16-17 was entered by steps: so was room 23, which also had internal steps leading to 22 at its east end.95 The Temple had external access on its east, and internal communication via steps.96 Though Pendlebury suggests that many rooms lacked windows,97 the use of simple hatches (without built frames) in internal walls shows that the appropriate building techniques were in use. In room 2, an opening in the external back wall, looking into a small bedrock hollow, could have performed either function, but more probably that of a hatch: the hollow could easily have been used as a storage area.98 Pendlebury reported a 'window' high up in the south-east corner of 23.99 The hatch between rooms 9 and 14 might conceivably have been a low-set window before 14 was added. An elaborate ceramic window-frame found in Vronda Building A/B led Day to suggest that windows were associated with elite dwellings and/or public buildings, categories in which the later Great that as social status had become less vested in personal, house-based competition with the development of more complex civic centres, domestic rooms had become more evenly sized and specialized in use. The smaller size may have made it important to maximize activity space.

Hatzi- Vallianou 2004, 109. 92 Pendlebury et al., 85. 93 Ibid., 68. Reconstructing a door between 11 and 12 relies on the reinterpretation of the bench on the east wall of room 12. The assumption of a bench here almost certainly encouraged Pendlebury to suggest other means of access to the room. 94 Glowacki 2004; id., 'House, household and community at LM IIIC Vronda, Kavousi, Crete', in R.

Interior paving was documented in some places, e.g. in the possible storage room 138, and the south-east corner of the small room 96, which was also probably used for storage.'0' It may have been preferred for liquid-storage areas, and has parallels in LM III A-B and Archaic buildings.102 Otherwise, floors seem to have been of tamped-down soil, though main rooms like 9 were sometimes also partially paved, perhaps to make storage or food preparation easier. Buildings at sizeable, low-lying LM III A-B settlements like Gournia and Katsambas had seen investment in plastered floors, but it is possible that during the foundation of new settlements on rocky hilltops, plastering came to be seen as a dispensable or difficult practice. It could also represent a wealth or status-differentiating feature, discarded in a new tendency towards an 'egalitarian' built environment, suggested by the other limits on differentiation I have already observed. The paved courts/squares and streets found at Karfi are paralleled at Kavousi Vronda and probably Chalasmeno.103 Some of these open spaces incorporate rock-cut or built steps (32 and 105-111).'04 The number of designed and maintained open spaces at early Karfi, where many buildings seem originally to have been simple freestanding structures, suggests careful planning and investment in public amenities. However, the frequent intrusions on such areas through the extension of houses over the settlement's lifespan noted by Pendlebury suggest rather fluid dynamics of space control, rather than the static, uncontested recognition of public space. In LM III C Crete building sizes seem to vary rather less, whether within a site or between sites, than they had done in the LM III A-B period. Marked or obvious differentiation by size seems deliberately limited, as the case of Karfi illustrates well. I define buildings here as sets of rooms linked by visible doorways, but the same observation applies even where a group of rooms seemingly belong together but lack a preserved doorway. Karfi's buildings, like those at other LM III C sites, also have a maximum size smaller than many LM III A-B structures. Even the exceptionally large building at Vronda, the largest known from any III C site, falls short in size of the several large single houses of LM III A-B date at Gournia and Plati, for example. These facts seem to relate to defensible sites' special topography, contemporaneous foundation, and similar circumstances of development over time as well as to possible proscriptions on extreme differentiation in newly formed communities where social cohesion was important. LM III A-B building size had varied not only with a site's topography and its earlier architectural history, but also with its place in the political and economic hierarchy. The Malia Quartier Nu complex, at a major regional centre, is on a wholly different scale 10,oo L. P. Day, 'A Late Minoan IIIC window frame from Vronda, Kavousi', in P. Betancourt, V.

KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 253 from the spacious single houses at Plati and Gournia (long-established regional nucleations). These in turn differ from the compact and densely grouped urban houses of Katsambas and Chania, or the modest-sized structures at the hilltop village of Chondros Kefali, where the topography and building sizes most closely parallel those at LM III C defensible settlements. The new reasons to keep size relatively small overall in LM III C settlements must have given less general scope for differentiation in this aspect of material practice, and this in turn had an impact on social practice and structure.'os This also worked the other way around. Larger houses, even if only modestly differentiated from others in the settlement, may not only have been built by the largest or most powerful families, but have imposed some public roles on their residents. PART 3. DOMESTIC, CULT AND FEASTING-RELATED USES OF ARCHITECTURAL SPACE, THEIR OVERLAP, AND THE NATURE OF LM III C SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS This five-section part is almost a second paper in itself, but deeply grounded in the discussion above. Developing this kind of analysis (incomplete though it is) was one of the main reasons for doing the fieldwork in the first place. My aim here is to combine examination of architectural forms and moveable finds and contexts to look at the function, role and status of rooms and buildings at Karfi. I gradually narrow my focus onto a discussion of buildings which seem marked out architecturally as having some sort of specialized (secular) public function or status, probably involving ceremonial feasting, at Karfi and other sites. I have noted elsewhere that Cretan societies incorporated remarkably strong and coherent social institutions, including (i) public cult (at both settlement and regional level) and (2) some kind of ritualized collective feasting from a very early date after 12oo BC.106 This seems to me to be bound up with a very proactive response in the island, through the physical fragmentation and strategic relocation of communities, to the collapse of political systems and related insecurity. Both institutions were important in developing the cohesion and identity of the newly co-resident groups: both drew on and transformed elements of LBA social practice. They also formed important arenas for status competition following the collapse of stratified social relationships. Though I will refer regularly to the social role of cult and the spaces occupied by cult activity, my interest here is mainly in dimensions of ritualized public activity with a role and location distinct from that of mainstream cult practice. Though very strong overlaps in meaning and symbolism do seem to have existed between the two, the absence of concentrated cult assemblages in the buildings I will discuss here clearly sets them apart from settlement temples. The LM III C cult sphere has already been well-explored, due to its accessibility through the finds record.'17 Other 105 The effects of architectural space on social structuring are noted by J. C. Barrett, 'The mythical landscapes of the British Iron Age', in W. Ashmore and A. B. Knapp (eds), Archaeologies ofLandscape: Contemporary Perspectives (Oxford, 1999), 257; P.

My discussion below simply suggests some interesting links between certain architectural forms and specialized social practice at Karfi and other sites: a fuller study would require more detailed publication of finds and contexts and a parallel discussion of the cult sphere.o18 Advanced debate already exists about who controlled feasting activities and their venues in EIA Greece, usually tied in to a more general discussion of how elites achieved, represented, and maintained their status.'09 Three of the Karfi buildings I studied in detail (the Great House, Megarons, and Priest's House) have been variously suggested to have possessed a prestigious status or function, as the residences of powerful families who might have hosted status-enhancing ceremonies including collective feasting.no But identifying 'special' use clearly requires an understanding of how other architectural spaces were functioning in the same settlement, which has been too little engaged in: this is my starting- point below in section (a). A crucial point which emerges from the analysis is the fluidity and overlap between 'ordinary domestic' and potentially 'specialized' feasting, cult, and craft activities at different points in the lives of many buildings. It is thus difficult, even pointless, to make absolute categorizations, especially given the limited state of knowledge on the finds. I do highlight, however, how buildings changed their use and form over time in ways probably related to changes in the status and ambitions of their owners and users, and in the practices reflecting them. The notion that most building plans of the period were conceptually related to a symbolic 'household' template (a single rectangular main room with small subsidiaries)-is supported by the generally very limited differentiation in size or constructional features between buildings of the period. These special features mean that the conclusions I arrive at below on building use are all tentative in nature. These conclusions are: that at least one building block at each new LM III C site may have been designated for ceremonial public use of a type different from that seen at contemporary settlement temples, and that this building need not have been used as a residence at all. Some inter-site similarities in plan between buildings which I suggest to have had this role suggest that a template of design for 'special' buildings of this kind may have been shared between different communities. The possible feasting element in their use is interesting in regard to the Archaic to Classical tradition of public feasts (syssitia) as a central feature of Cretan society, held in buildings referred to as andreia, and to a recent claim to have identified a sixth-century andreion at the site of Azoria.'" ios I discuss the two spheres and their relationships in more depth in a forthcoming monograph, S.

KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 255 (a) BUILDING/ROOM FUNCTION I start by looking at the types of space used for a range of relatively clearly identifiable activities at Karfi-cooking and dining, storage, craft production, and cult-and their distribution across the site. All these activities often seem to have met in the house. It is clear that functional division of space within Karfi houses was not rigid. It is also clear that even though the same types of use of space were replicated in houses across the site, the format of the spaces involved was never repeated exactly between different building units: there was considerable flexibility in the way common activities were housed. Assemblages are often also basically similar between all types of building, with only a few special differences pointing to special function: even the temple includes cooking and storage pottery and loomweights alongside its concentration of cult objects. As at other contemporary sites, there is no standard plan for the dwelling house like that which developed in later (Archaic-Classical) houses on mainland Greece,'12 but the assemblages described by Pendlebury, paralleled by those from contemporary sites, suggest most building units functioned as houses through most of their lifetime. The large rectangular room (e.g. 9, 23, 120) seems the focus of most buildings at Karfi (including the Temple and other potentially special buildings). This pattern is also echoed at contemporary sites. Evidence for multiple uses of the main room had already existed in modest LM III A/B structures like the Katsambas house and those at Chondros Kefali, and the assemblages in these rooms often differ only subtly from those of subsidiary rooms. Even the high-status complex at Quartier Nu, where we might expect a more formal/ceremonial use for main rooms, had grinding equipment in the anteroom of its main room, X 3."V3 A typically mixed household assemblage of storage pottery, cooking wares, eating and drinking pottery, loomweights, stone tools, and sometimes food remains appears in most Karfi main rooms, and is well paralleled at Vronda and Chalasmeno and in LM III C houses at the site of Smari Profitis Elias, in central Crete."4 The main room sometimes seems to have comprised the entire residence-the standard mixed assemblages from the single large rooms N4 and C4 at Vronda suggest that large individual Karfi units like rooms 2, 3, and 7 could also represent whole households, an idea which the latter's assemblages do not contradict."5 Some main rooms might develop more specialized uses over time after extensions were made to the buildings concerned (as in the case of rooms 9 and 14, discussed above). "1 L. Nevett, House and Society in the Ancient Greek World (Cambridge, 1999). In LM III A-B Crete there are only partial indicators of anything like a common house template. Hayden 1987, 217. The similarity of plan-a corridor with a main axial room and storage rooms located off it-between Ayia Triada's monumental 'North-West Building' and large houses at sub-regional centres suggests there was a recognized LM III A-B standard for elite dwellings which had relationships to mainland tradition, but also drew on LM I plans, often literally adapting LM I structures. The popularity of the corridor element is reflected even in the small house at Katsambas (Alexiou; Cucuzza). Nonetheless, considerable variability in house plan is notable within and between sites. The corridor disappears, perhaps mostly for reasons of space restriction, in the new LM III C settlements, but other elements of existing plan types remain in use. Even by the fifth century in Crete, standard house forms do not seem to have been used across settlements, as the Azoria excavations show. Haggis et al. "3 Alexiou; Driessen and Farnoux 1994, 62. At Quartier Nu, stone tools, including querns, also cluster in the subsidiary rooms X5 and X12, behind main room X11, suggesting a more complex distribution of activities in large structures. 114 Coulson and Tsipopoulou, 71-7.

The one-room house seems to occur more often in LM III C.</page><page sequence="42">256 SARO WALLACE Main rooms are often read as the material construction/representation of the basic family unit (oikos) at this period."6 In this regard, their limited size and frequently repeated distribution across settlements developing in agglutinative fashion suggests that adult children usually relocated out of the parental home."7 At the same time, the close proximity of such 'nuclear' units, and their linking up over time within small agglutinative blocks, indicates strong attachment to the extended kin group, and close collaboration between its members. The Kavousi Vronda block I-O-N illustrates well the regular distribution of main rooms, each with its typical hearth and oven, as household 'cores' through a block."8 The sizes of Karfi's largest main rooms (c. 29-9-56 m') resemble those of Vronda (c. 24- 38.9 m2)-with the exception of Vronda Building A's unique main room (74.2 m2)-and of the buildings at Smari Profitis Elias. The latter (about which only limited published data is available) include a large isolated block, the 'Megarons', of which the last use is dated in the Late Geometric period (LG: c. 750-700 BC) but said by the excavator to have continued in broadly the same form from the twelfth century onwards, though there are traces of a burnt destruction within the LM III C period. The sizes of the main rooms in this block are c. 31.2-32.5 mi2.19 Chalasmeno lacks rooms above c. 28 m'. Karfi's slightly higher upper size limit may be generally representative of larger and more complex settlements of the period, or relate to technical considerations: stone walls could more easily support wide roofs, given the apparently limited use of supporting posts. The sizes of main rooms in LM III A-B houses had often been similar,120 but had varied more broadly between buildings and sites. In LM III C, then, the picture is again of limited scope for differentiation in architectural forms, whether for practical reasons of limited space, or because of social proscriptions on this type of competition, or both. Similar sizes for main rooms are still seen by the Geometric to Archaic periods in Crete. At Kavousi Kastro and Azoria, two defensible sites established c. 1200oo BC but continuing much later, the largest rooms of houses dating to the late eighth/early seventh century (in the first case) and the 6th to early 5th century (in the second), are between 30 and 43 m2 in size. By this time, though, many houses include two or more equally-sized rooms, rather than a core room with subsidiaries.121 At the new LM III C sites, ancillary rooms are usually fewer than they had been in LM III A-B houses. Apart from storerooms (discussed below), the examples which do exist "6 Mazarakis Ainian. 117 The tomb record of the period, with a strong emphasis on small family or couple groupings, partly supports this idea. The fact that as families grew, children moved out of the parental home, may have limited the scale of investment in the same building over time. R.

The main room in Plati Building A is 29.5 mi, and the large eastern hall of Malia Quartier Nu (X 11), 26.5 m'. 12" The pattern of room use within a household had apparently altered by this time, possibly becoming differently specialized. For example, following a new subdivision of space at Azoria in the late 6th c., B3oo has a hearth in its slightly smaller room, two pithoi in the other; in Bloo, the hearth is again located in the smaller room; suggesting a limited, specific kitchen space.

KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 257 have no clear specialized function (I discuss the special case of entrance anterooms further later on). For example, no site includes anything similar to the bathroom with drain like the one seen at LM III B Katsambas, though some Karfi rooms produced a few ceramic drain pieces.22 Both a flattening-out of access to social distinction through architectural form in the new communities, and the probably reduced space allowance as a result of the restricted topography may again help explain this. Sizeable back rooms separate from storage facilities are found in LM III A-B buildings (e.g. Gournia Building Eh), suggesting that in better-off households separate sleeping had been a possibility. The smaller and simpler houses at new III C settlements offer little space for sleeping outside the main room. Evidence for cooking and dining suggests these activities took place at extra-household level, as well as domestically, in LM III C settlements and this point is important to some of my arguments below. Architectural features and movable finds combine to give this impression. There are indications of collective cooking/dining at Chalasmeno (Sector B's concentration of hearths and cooking pots) and at Vronda (Building A/B's clustered small storerooms, hearths and cooking pots; the number of large kylikes found there; the large courtyard and concentrated food remains). These existed alongside plentiful evidence for domestic cooking (and dining) in houses across both sites."3 Some clustering of cooking facilities at Karfi (the oven in room 73 and the cluster of hearths in the Megarons) suggests partly similar public cooking patterns to those at other sites. Karfi differs, though, in having an apparently somewhat more limited background distribution of domestic cooking facilities (though evidence for widespread domestic cooking and dining does appear in the spread of cooking pots and trays and fine drinking wares throughout the settlement). This cooking pattern is interesting to consider alongside finds suggesting that some buildings at Karfi were used for specialized or ceremonial dining."14 Some co-ordination of cooking would facilitate the investment of individual small groups in the hosting of public feasts, helping a number of houses take on a semi-public role in this regard from time to time. At the same time, widespread access to these facilities might hold back full or permanent appropriation of ceremonial feasting by any single group. Day and Snyder pointed out a group of exceptionally large kylikes from room 9 in the Karfi Great House, not paralleled in the rest of the site assemblage. They relate these to similar examples found in Vronda Building A/B.125 There is a concentration of horns in the Priest's House (room 61) which may parallel the modified cattle skulls with horns found associated with concentrated cooking and dining evidence in Building A/B at Vronda."26 Day and Snyder see the Vronda skulls as decorative symbols, potentially marking out an exceptional role for the structure, perhaps connected with ceremonial 22 Alexiou; Pendlebury et al., 83, 90.

A bull skull with horns attached was also found in the Smari 'Megarons' complex, which was rich in other dining debris too, in the form of animal bones and drinking vessels dating in the LM III C through LG periods.127 Below I shall discuss special architectural features linking these buildings, but the slenderness of published finds and context evidence poses a real problem for theorizing 'feasting' in this context and for identifying specialized venues for it with any accuracy. The concept I have in mind in the discussion below is of a ceremonialized, collective, and organized activity involving a group beyond the immediate family.128 In Karfi houses, one subsidiary room, plus part of the main room, was often used for food storage in pithoi, a feature paralleled at other LM III C settlements. Clustered groups of small storerooms like those found in LM III A-B houses above a certain size (and, presumably, status) at large sites, and more rarely in modest buildings at small settlements are suggested at Karfi by rooms 81-84 and possibly rooms 102-105.129 This may reflect a tradition or practice partly retained during the movement to new sites, possibly associated with prestigious status of a building or group. However, these groupings of small rooms at Karfi do not correlate with especially large or impressive buildings, as they do in the case of Vronda Building A/B. Much more common in most LM III C houses were single, small- to medium-sized storerooms, often adjoining the main room. These vary widely in size and in pithos concentration (of those found to contain pithoi, room 14 is 8.75 m', with io pithoi, room 80o is 20.1 m', with 8, room 22 is 5.6 m2, with 8). Finds suggest they were also used to store household ceramics and other types of goods as well as food.'13 Their size must have related to the size of the residence group at the time of construction, but could also have been determined by the level of hosting activities engaged in at a particular house, additional uses of the storeroom, and the space available for storage in the adjoining main room. Storerooms which were added to a building over time, like room 14 in the Great House, may reflect increases in group size or an expanding scale of social activity, but were also constrained by available extension space. The fact that LM III C settlements lack obviously hierarchical or distinct functional relationships to each other, and the lack of evidence for very large-scale specialization of 127 E.

Platon, 362 notes a group of small unattached rooms beside the largest and most complex building at Chondros Kefali. Similarities in layout and size with LM III C storage complexes should be viewed in the broader context of changes in building scale after c. 12oo BC. In the Ayia Triada North- West Building, for example, individual storerooms dating to LM III A are similar in size to LM III C examples (and larger than those in small III A-B buildings) In aggregate, however, they provided more dedicated storage than those in any LM III C structure (Cucuzza). The volume of storage-type rooms at Gournia Building Eh roughly parallels the B complex at Vronda (Day et al. 1986, 357). But Vronda A/B cannot be treated as representative, being the largest building on any LM III C site, and almost certainly possessing a special social role. Some of the small rooms in the B complex probably had other functions, like cooking, while the Gournia house had additional subsidiary rooms beyond the storage group. In sum, storage space per household seems generally more modest at LM III C settlements than in those of LM III A-B. 130 Room 80 contained cooking pots and lekanai; room 121 included a tripod cooking pot. Household ceramics appeared alongside pithoi in probable storerooms at the LM III B Katsambas house, in Malia Quartier Nu room 112, and in B3oo at Archaic Azoria.

KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 259 production, contrasts substantially with the seemingly more centralized, complex organization of production in the LM III A-B palatial economy reflected in settlement pattern, the movable-artefact record, and the Linear B tablets.'~' Specialized areas for metalworking or ceramic manufacture were not identified at Karfi. They do seem likely to have existed, however, given the settlement's status as the largest in its region, and that region's relative isolation from the low-lying trade gateways through which much of the island's raw metal and at least some manufactured metal artefacts must have passed. These factors suggest Karfi might well have had some kind of regionally centralized productive role. The large quantities of bronze artefacts found at the site, and the similarity of Karfi's ceramic fabrics to those of surrounding smaller settlements,132 support this notion. Contemporary sites of much smaller size, even where closely clustered, seem to have had their own production facilities. Vronda had its own kiln less than 30 m from the settlement, and a potter's wheel was found in a house at Chalasmeno (B2).'33 By the Archaic period, specific buildings were clearly being set aside for manufacturing at or near large settlements like Papoura (where Karfi residents probably relocated from the Protogeometric period).'34 However, even at these later sites, small work areas still seem to have been located within houses. For example, metalworking residues were found in Storeroom B3oo at Archaic Azoria, suggesting a long tradition of household craft production.'15 At Karfi, the small size of room 26 in relation to the adjacent large room 27, together with the large number of pithoi found there, suggests it was a storeroom, but it also contained exceptional quantities of bronze tools.'36 The high concentration of bronze tools and metal fragments in the small room 12 suggest it might have been a workshop or specialist tools storeroom attached to a large house, and the south part of room 16/17 also has high numbers of bronze objects, including tools. This pattern could possibly represent a concentration of craft activities in the central saddle, or under control of the powerful residents of the Great House, but the evidence is slim (for example, a concentration of metal craft items was also found on the western saddle, in room i o6). It could almost equally well be read simply as indicating the relative wealth of the building's inhabitants (though such concentrations are lacking from other large and important buildings like the Priest's House). In contrast, the wide distribution of loomweights across the site (also paralleled at other settlements) suggests that textile working took place in nearly every household.'37 '31 J.

This suggested to Rutkowski that the whole central saddle, including the Great House, might have been dedicated to cult practice alone at some point in the settlement's life. While I think the cult finds are too widely dispersed and the stratigraphic information too poor to firmly support this idea, the blocking-off of much of the central saddle at a late date in the settlement's life could conceivably be connected to a changed use of all or part of the excavated area, perhaps with an emphasis on cult, at this point in time.139 The change might have been connected to the community's probable resettlement at Papoura.14o However, except in the Temple, the numbers of cult objects were always an extreme minority in relation to standard domestic artefacts in each room or building where they were found. The idea of more specialized use of buildings over time lacks clear stratigraphic support.'14 The exceptionally wide scattering of cult items, compared to contemporary excavated sites may simply relate to Karfi's size and complexity, in ways the limited detail of the record does not allow us to understand fully. Differences in the type of cult items found between different rooms and buildings may be significant, though there are many overlaps. Combinations of goddess figurines, snake tubes, concentrations of kalathoi, and clay stands, all associated with settlement-level public shrines in LM III C Crete, were found in the Temple and in rooms 16-17, 27, 57, 58, 70, 85 and 106.142 Other objects with probable cult associations, including animal figurines, cult vases, bronze votive axes, an anthropomorphic rhyton, and a triton shell, came from rooms 16-17, 85, 26, 27, and io6.'43 These most resemble the material found at contemporary extra-settlement sanctuaries (possibly representing personal votives).'44 The contents of room 58 in the Priest's House, which belong to the first group, together with the room's architectural status as an addition to a large, wealthy complex, may represent attempts by an increasingly powerful family to emulate elements of standard settlement cult. The ritually-associated material found in room 16-17 (which includes both categories of object) together with the room's location in another prestigious and 138 Possible cult-related items were found in domestic contexts at Vronda and Chalasmeno.

KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 261 expanding building, might represent a rival group's deliberate promotion of a more widely resonant type of cult practice. Ownership of some aspects of cult by powerful private groups is already suggested in LM III A-B Crete at Chondros Kefali, where the largest house (Hi-G1) incorporated a cult area, perhaps on a second storey. Malia Quartier Nu may have contained its own small shrine in room VII: 1. No separate, specialized cult building was found at either settlement, though one existed at Gournia, showing a complex role for cult already in this period.'45 After the settlement relocation and social restructuring c. 1200 BC, public temples became a more standard part of everyday life, almost certainly comprising an important reference point in social cohesion and identity-building. In this context, cult seems likely to have become a much less easily alienable social institution, and private power display may have been increasingly channeled into feasting. Even so, continued attempts at the appropriation of some aspects of cult activity by individual groups seem to have continued. (b) USE OF STATIC VERSUS AGGLUTINATIVE PLANS TO DIFFERENTIATE 'SPECIAL' BUILDINGS I now want to concentrate further on how power relations in EIA Crete may have been reflected and negotiated in architectural forms. I have shown above that consideration of structural alterations over time throws important light on building status and function, in an environment where such alterations were frequent.146 One aspect of the Karfi plan which has attracted considerable scholarly attention is the impression that the site is divided into an eastern zone, of more regular, simply planned buildings, and a western one, of heavily agglutinated, irregularly planned structures. Nowicki explained the simple final plan of the eastern buildings by arguing that they represented the expansion of the settlement in its latter stages. In doing so, however, he had to suggest that they were built 'still within the early period, 1200-1 170 BC' to get over the absence of differential pottery dating.147 In fact, the hypothesis of later construction in the eastern zone is undermined by Pendlebury's, Nowicki's, and my own studies of buildings in the western sector, which suggest that its final plan developed over the site's entire lifespan. It seems to have had an initial pattern of fewer, simpler (often single-room) structures, including 55-57, 44, 120, 61 or 80, 60, 9, 16-17, possibly 67-9, the Magazines block, and the Temple, though it cannot be proved that these are all contemporary.'48 This kind of pattern would have more similarities with the final plans of the east sector. There are resemblances, for example, between the 'Barracks' in the east sector and the 'Magazines' in the west: both are rows of single-room structures, sharing party walls. I think that the east sector buildings may be more usefully characterized as having not just simple, but static plans, which altered minimally during the period between construction and abandonment. The main component in the 'Megarons' block, rooms 138-140, is the best example, in having a single-phase 145 Eliopoulos 2004; Platon, 361-2; Boyd 1905, 22, 43, 48; Gesell 1985, 42-3, 82; Farnoux and Driessen 1994, 63- See recently, for Palaikastro, T. Cunningham, 'House, shrine, or house-shrine? Assessing cultic vs. domestic function in Late Bronze Age Crete', in Glowacki and Vogeikoff-Brogan (n. 109). Each situation is different and needs a different explanation: I do not attempt here to model LM III A-B cult practice in detail. 146 Rutkowski, 259- 147 Nowicki 2002, 158-61. The lack of clear dating difference is confirmed by Day's restudy of the ceramic finds (Day, pers. comm.). 148 Pendlebury et al., 77; Nowicki 1987, 238.</page><page sequence="48">262 SARO WALLACE plan, with main and subsidiary rooms designed together. This contrasts with most buildings in the western sector, where subsidiary rooms were added over time.'49 Nowicki has also suggested that the differences between the sectors might reflect a long-term concentration of residence on the most defensible, western part of the site. It is useful to test this idea with reference to other settlements. At Vronda, though agglutination took place, this happened in a balanced fashion, with the original wide spacing between all blocks never becoming completely closed in. Following Nowicki's argument, the contrast with Karfi's west sector might seem related to Vronda's less polarized defensible topography.15o Chalasmeno is more like Karfi, in that distinct zones of more 'static' and more 'agglutinative' planning are seen, with the Megarons of sector A contrasting with the more agglutinated sector, B.'5' Yet the sector B topography lacks any special defensible characteristics. In all three cases, the blocks with mostly static plans have other distinctive characteristics, discussed further in (d) below, which suggest they may have been left unchanged for social and symbolic reasons. An argument for agglutination level as the major distinguishing feature between zones at Karfi is hard to reconcile with ideas that the ethnicity or social standing of the builders/ owners determined the final form of the eastern zone buildings, especially the Megarons. These such analyses pay very little attention either to architectural changes over time, or to site-wide architectural context, skewing understanding of an environment where agglutinative building was a widespread and socially meaningful practice. When the unusually static aspect of some blocks' plans is recognized, it is difficult to suggest that these plans represent one ethnic or power group without explaining why this group never needed to expand or adapt its buildings. It might be argued that one group controlled larger areas of building space than another, allowing more spaced-out, simpler construction in one zone, while another group was forced to develop its architecture agglutinatively in a more constricted area. In fact, though, on the basis of presently available data, Karfi's 'static' building zone looks much more limited in size than its 'agglutinative' one. Though this impression could easily be reversed by extension of excavation on the site, the relatively limited size of the static-plan zone is reflected at the more completely excavated sites of Chalasmeno and Vronda. Concern with end-state plan alone can also be misleading when analogies are sought for EIA cultural patterns. For example, Pueblo villages of the seventeenth century AD in New Mexico were founded by residents from a number of different earlier settlements in circumstances of political insecurity, provide an interesting comparison with Karfi.152 These new villages often had bizonal plans, one zone formal and regular, the other roughly-built and apparently unplanned. Here, zoning did represent groups of different origins/cultural traditions. But significantly, growth over time occurred in both zones: regular, formalized expansion within the first sector, and looser agglutinative growth in the second. Distinct patterns were deliberately maintained by distinct groups, but each expanded in its own 149 There is some degree of alteration over time in the eastern sector-room 142 is probably an addition to the Megarons block. Conversely, some buildings on the western side, like the Magazines, seem to have altered rather little over time. 150 Day 1997, 394; Glowacki 2004, 129-34- '51 Tsipopulou 2004- 152 R. W.

Some other elements of the case may however provide better analogies for Karfi. House plans in the formal sectors show an observance of local cosmological tenets, absent from the informally planned zones: it seems that a recognized building template was being perpetuated and adapted at new locations to invest groups using it with legitimacy and identity under colonial pressure. Cretan EIA communities may also have developed sets of strict rules about the form and use of some buildings or zones which played a role in the construction of community identities, as I shall suggest below. (C) DISTINGUISHING IMPORTANT RESIDENCES FROM SECULAR 'PUBLIC' BUILDINGS AS FEASTING VENUES Even if feasting was an important institution in LM III C communities, it does not follow that it required a separate, specialized venue. In some cases, it seems very likely to have taken place in the private residences of powerful groups (see above). This assumption has been used to support the more complex hypothesis that collective or ritualized feasting was controlled either by a single community leader or a number of eminent persons or groups.'53 The pan-Aegean model of Mazarakis Ainian suggests that separate institutionalization of cult only emerged in the eighth century, with the rise of the polis state. This evolutionary type of scheme clearly fails to explain Crete's record of EIA development, not only regarding cult, but in the area of other kinds of public ceremonial activity, which may or may not have incorporated elements of cult.'54 The presence of more than one large and elaborate building with evidence for feasting at Karfi undermines any notion that this type of public ceremony always took place under the direct control of a resident ruler. This is especially interesting in view of the later tradition of the andreion in Crete. We saw that the assemblage from room 9, in the large and elaborate Great House, shows evidence for special feasting use at some point in the room's life; room 16-17 also has hints at special use, including cult artefacts. As the Great House expanded, linking these two main rooms, both may have eventually become mostly publicly orientated, with domestic activities being concentrated in the extension 11-13. The Priest's House also has indications of a developing public role over time, including the addition of room 58 with its 'public cult' type of assemblage, the concentration of animal horns in room 61, and possibly the linking of room 80 to room 61, as an exceptionally large storeroom. These building histories suggest that success in hosting ceremonial activities could only be easily reconciled with domestic functions in relatively spacious buildings, and ambitious hosts may have expanded their houses with this kind of activity in mind. The existence of restrictions on the ultimate expansive capacity of any single building on this tightly packed site, especially in the agglutinative western sector, may help explain the development of a number of 'special' buildings only slightly larger or more elaborate then their peers. There are also likely to have been social or economic boundaries on the space, facilities, and resources able to be appropriated by any one group, as the possible use of shared cooking facilities suggests. In the end, only about thirty people could be accommodated for feasting 153 Day and Snyder; Mazarakis Ainian. Hatzi-Vallianou 2004 has recently interpreted the large complex at Smari, with its associated feasting evidence, as the residence of a 'Homeric' ruler between the LM III C and LG periods. 154 Mazarakis Ainian, 333-7-</page><page sequence="50">264 SARO WALLACE activities in any main room at Karfi, even assuming that storage, everyday food preparation and sleeping were located elsewhere in the building. In this regard, the Megarons block has a remarkable layout in comparison to other large buildings at the site. Treating the block as a whole, rooms 136 and 137 seem unlikely to have been domestic 'backup' for the public use of the large room 139, as I argued for rooms 11-13 in the case of the Great House. Rather, their large size, separate entrances and central hearths suggest closely parallel uses. Room 139 had a limited amount of dedicated adjacent storage space, room 138, but the other units lacked storerooms altogether. All three, however, could have participated in the use of the external storage area in 143, with its unusual open character. If the rooms did function together in this way'55 the block would have had a significant capacity for formal feasting (and the storage to support it) but rather low potential for combining domestic life and feasting. At Vronda, Building A/B was apparently never seriously competed with by any other unit in the settlement, in terms of size, architectural elaboration, or evidence for concentrated feasting activity. Its size meant it could more easily combine domestic and feasting roles than any Karfi structure. However, this assumes there was no social imperative to restrict access to the domestic quarters during public activities or hide domestic trappings or family members from visitors' eyes: sleeping, everyday storage, and work activities must all have taken place in the single large main room. The excavators read the building as a residence of a single leader or ruler.'56 But like the Karfi Megarons, Vronda Building A/B could be seen as a structure specifically for feasting use, rather than a residence. In either case, it would seem that the small size of the Vronda community permanently restricted scope for competition in the hosting of ceremonial feasts from an early date. The fact that domestic cooking facilities are widespread at the site suggests a stable, well-established system of both private and public cooking and dining. Depending on the interpretative model selected, this could be seen to reflect the early consolidation of a permanent leadership system, of chiefdom type, or the clear and permanent separation of a building for ceremonial activity from ordinary houses throughout the life of the settlement. The Karfi pattern, with indications of collective cooking facilities separate from any residential structure, but also apparently more limited residential cooking provision, suggests greater difficulty in maintaining either a fixed venue or a stable control system in a large settlement where multiple competing power groups were all using feasting as a social tool. (d) IDENTIFYING A TEMPLATE FOR SPECIALIZED SECULAR FEASTING-RELATED BUILDINGS IN EIA CRETE The idea that a certain rough template for buildings used for feasting-related public ceremonies emerged from soon after the establishment of the new Cretan sites is partly supported by a comparative study of buildings showing similar distinctive features across a number of LM III C sites. I leave the question open as to whether or not such buildings were always also residences. There are exciting implications in being able to tentatively identify the existence of such templates. First, if they are indeed associated with feasting, they help to confirm the 155 It is still unclear what connection this block had with the 'Barracks' buildings or to the exceptionally large but poorly preserved building 146 to the east. 156 Day and Snyder.</page><page sequence="51">LAST CHANCE TO SEE? KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 265 strength of the public feast as an institution in the new social environment, highlighting a considerable degree of complexity in pre-polis Cretan societies. The amount of planning and deliberation involved in adopting such a template in widely scattered new communities suggests that linked social structures had come into existence over large regions of the post-collapse island, possibly rooted in a sense of collective identity which went beyond the individual settlement or region. Lastly, the fact that some features of the suggested template seem to draw on prestige building traditions dating back to the LM III A-B periods suggest that collective consciousness in the new communities may have been tied into an idea of history and 'ancestry'. This promotes the development of cultural models which give a bigger role to human agency and the manipulation of material culture than the ethnicity-based perspectives still used to analyse architecture at this period (see above). By looking at buildings with possible specialized use and format in their site context, and by examining both formal plan and associated finds, I highlight the assumption- ridden overtones of the term 'megaron', which has been applied to several of the examples discussed.'57 Indeed, a desire to explore systematically the value of the term in relation to EIA Cretan architecture was one of my reasons for re-examining the Karfi Megarons here. In the archaeological literature, the term is strongly associated (implicitly or explicitly) with Mycenaean palatial dwellings and with the Homeric tradition of leaders as living in palaces centred around a 'megaron' plan. Applied to LM III C buildings, it helps (in a rather circular fashion) to encourage interpretations of their plans as direct correlates of the inhabitants' ethnicity, as well as the assumption that such buildings were elite residences. Even while querying these models, I conclude that excavators and analysts have often been right in identifying something 'special' about the buildings in question. I suggest, however, that they have often failed convincingly to systematize their observations or to put them in a broad enough interpretative context. More critique seems needed to avoid perpetuating confusing assumptions into secondary analyses. I shall start by looking at how particular aspects of size and plan especially distinguish some buildings from others in their site context, in a way roughly comparable across sites. The generally limited size range of LM III C buildings means that special-function buildings cannot easily be identified on the basis of size alone: inter- and intra-site context, and building expansion over time, must be taken into account.'58 Vronda Building A/B, at 90.3 m2, is the only example of a building really set apart by size in an intra-site context. It is somewhat larger than LM III A-B buildings at hilltop villages or densely packed lowland towns, yet still modest by the standards of buildings at regional settlement centres of the LM III A-B period.' 59At Karfi, though the Megarons unit 138-140, the Great House, and the Priest's House are some of the largest buildings on the site, none is marked '57 Darcque; Gesell et al. 1985, 352-3; Tsipopulou 2004; Hatzi-Vallianou 2004; Nowicki 1987; Mazarakis Ainian, 207-31, 286-305. 158 Thus Building D at Vronda is larger than the individual units of the Karfi and Chalasmeno 'Megaron' blocks, which I argue may have had a special role. Yet it almost certainly lacked the status of Building A/B on the same site, given the concentration of distinctive features in the latter building. '59 Chalasmeno and Vronda had several buildings in the range 30-50 m , and Karfi, by its final stage, had a number of buildings above 50 m'. For LM III A-B, building sizes range much more widely according to site type and history. At Chondros Kefali, sizes are mostly between c. 20 and 40 m2, with the largest central building being 62.5 m2, The largest LM III building at Tylissos is 54 m , and at Katsambas 63.9 m2. Some Plati and Gournia buildings are above oo m2 in size, Ayia Triada's North-West Building 168 m'; Quartier Nu 1116 m2.

It seems important, however, to note the similar sizes (within about 10o m) of buildings at several different sites. These buildings-all three of the Smari Megarons, Karfi unit 138-140, and the Chalasmeno Megaron A-are also distinguished by other features, discussed below. The parity in size contributes to the impression of an accepted rough template for special-function secular structures from soon after 1200 BC. Use of an axial plan (with short-side, centred entrances) features in a limited number of buildings at LM III C sites. It is characteristic of the plans of palatial and elite architecture of the Mycenaean mainland, and of ordinary houses (as well as apparently special-function buildings) on the mainland in the period post-1200 BC.1'6 Such plans had appeared in a variety of LM III A-B building types, first being taken up in Crete during the main period of Mycenaean acculturation in LM II-III A, very likely as a prestigious and exotic form.'6' They appear in more than one building at all substantially excavated sites founded in the LM III C period, and are therefore difficult to use on their own to identify special status or function. However, some buildings with these plans possess other special features as well. The Megarons blocks at Karfi, Chalasmeno, and Smari, which all have axial plans, are additionally distinguished by their static, non-agglutinative character, of which I have noted the possible symbolic significance. Incorporation of a full-width anteroom in the axial plan is another feature of the 'classic' megaron, which also had precedent in LM III A-B domestic architecture.162 The appearance of such anterooms is rare overall on LM III C sites. The difference in length between anteroom and main room is often more pronounced than in LM III A-B, suggesting an increasingly stylized, symbolic role for the anteroom and a more strongly symbolic meaning for its inclusion. In this light, the appearance of full-width, but very shallow anterooms in the Smari, Chalasmeno, and Karfi 'Megarons', with their other special features, is notable, though such anterooms are also found in other buildings at each site. Vronda Building A/B, which has a strong range of other evidence supporting a special function, may also have had a full-width anteroom, but it is not certain whether this was located at the front or back of the building. If the feature was used to differentiate buildings with a special social role, its inclusion and format was clearly flexible. Nowicki has reconstructed the Karfi Megarons as an ordinary domestic structure. In doing so, he argued that anteroom 140 was a cooking area, and drew a similar conclusion about anteroom 8, in the Great House. This begs several questions, especially in view of the other special characteristics of both structures. If cooking was the main function of anterooms, it is difficult to explain their rarity, why some buildings only had them added over time, and why hearths are rarely found in them.'63 In their full-width form, anterooms in fact seem to have had no standard domestic role. Their earlier heritage, and the other ,6o Mazarakis Ainian, '6' Like other elements of mainland material culture. Hayden 1987, 205-9; ead. (n. 40), 21o; Darcque, 24; Preston (n. 26). It seems they may have became more 'democratized' in form and distribution over time, a process paralleled in the case of tholos tombs by the LM III C period. 162 e.g. at Plati (Building A), Malia Quartier Nu (rooms Xi 1-13) and Chondros Kefali (Building A-B).

These look too small for kitchens, though in the Cliff Houses the large, late anteroom 1 13 did contain a hearth. Nowicki's suggestion is undermined by the fact that hearths are located in main rooms at most LM III C settlements. In Vronda building I, for example, food preparation was concentrated in the main room 13, not the anteroom 14, though use of</page><page sequence="53">LAST CHANCE TO SEE? KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 267 distinctive features with which they are often associated, suggest that they could have formed part of a template for buildings with a special public function. In this light, their emulation by ambitious groups as they developed their own houses for public activities like the hosting of feasts would be understandable. Mazarakis Ainian suggested that the adding of the anteroom 8 to the Karfi Great House emulated a pattern set by the Megarons.'64 This argument is based on his assumption that the Megarons were built by mainlanders, which rests on no other evidence than the kinds of assumptions about 'megarons' noted above. The established and prestigious associations of the form in Crete offer a more contextualized and convincing explanation for this kind of emulation. The Megarons at Smari and Chalasmeno and the Great House at Karfi included column bases in their main rooms. In the case of the first two blocks, the feature helped their excavators to tag them with the name 'megarons' because it partly echoes the pattern in Mycenaean palatial architecture. Like the other distinguishing features listed here, they had already been used in LM III A-B buildings of a variety of sizes, and at different sites. Wherever bases are present in LM III C structures, there are usually two along the room's axis. This pattern, adequate to support the roof span of the largest sizes of room used in the period, is the same one which had appeared in some large LM III A-B rooms.'65 In LM III C, they seem one of the least reliable indicators of a building's special function if treated on their own, because of their generally irregular use: this was often probably a matter of practicality in large rooms. It is noteworthy that the Karfi Megarons block, though it possessed many other distinctive features, did not incorporate them. They were found in ordinary-looking houses at Smari, as well as in the undoubtedly important Megarons complex at the same site. Recovery procedures and interpretative bias heavily affect the identification of column bases. Small examples can be accidentally removed with stone tumble, since floor surfaces are evanescent at most LM III C defensible sites. Conversely, any flat stone may tend to be interpreted as a column base if the building seems to have other features on the preconceived lines of a 'megaron'. Some of the bases identified in the Chalasmeno south megaron (A), for example, could as easily be pot- stands, like those at Vronda.166 The possible use for specialized feasting of buildings which were set apart by their architectural form is suggested by the finds evidence reviewed above. Distinctive concentrations of animal bones, including horned skulls or horns themselves (argued by Day and Snyder to have had a possible decorative or ritual use) mark out buildings at three different sites-the Smari Megarons, Vronda Building A/B, and the Priest's House at Karfi. The Smari buildings also contain heavy concentrations of other (burnt) animal bones, likely to represent intensive dining use between LM III C and LG). Exceptional quantities and types of fine drinking ceramics distinguished Vronda Building A/B, the Great House at Karfi, and the Smari Megarons. A hint at the possible use for feasting of outdoor areas for food preparation is evidenced in the court E7 and outside Building I, and in Chalasmeno court B7.

We might expect to find central hearths associated with large-scale feasting activity. These are indeed present in many of the LM III C buildings which possess both feasting- related finds and the 'special' formal attributes I have noted above. Their appearance at this date has often been used to support ethnicity-related interpretations of architectural change.169 But central hearths had already appeared in the main rooms of various types of LM II-III B structure, suggesting that their use in LM III C could represent a simple continuation of tradition in some cases, and a more selective, symbolic use of that tradition in others.17o This dual model is supported by the very variable occurrence of central hearths in domestic contexts between different sites, but their more uniform occurrence in buildings with other distinctive attributes. Intra-site context is very important in using the presence of central hearths to identify special-status buildings. For example, in the large, axially planned Vronda Building D, the central hearth is not a distinctive factor, since most other buildings at the site have one. On the other hand, the exceptional concentration of central hearths in the Karfi Megarons might well be connected to their special status at the site. Despite the frequent use of benches to line the walls of specialized feasting rooms in Archaic to Classical Greece, there is no regular association of benches with the possible LM III C special buildings I mentioned here.'71' The varying size and distribution of benches in apparently ordinary, as well as exceptional, buildings at the period generally invalidates them as a diagnostic feature, except where highly concentrated. The Smari Megarons, with benches lining all the sides of the main room, is an example of such a case, and is paralleled in another possible special-function building at Vasiliki Kefala (see below). Thinking about seating arrangements encourages consideration of exactly how 'special' buildings were used, if they did indeed act as venues for feasts. Their size means they can have been used by only fairly small groups of feasters (potentially groups of affines or extended kin units) and this use was perhaps organized in rotation, or according to the changing balance of power within the community. Larger-scale feasting, if this existed, probably took place in the open air. The presence of unusually large open spaces adjacent to several of the buildings named above may thus help indicate their role in 167 Tsipopulou 2004. 168 The largest building at Chondros Kefali had evidence for feasting in its main room (D1) and substantial additional space for domestic activities. It had its own kitchen (Ii), and an adjacent room dedicated to storage of fine ceramics. Platon, 361-2. 169 Eliopoulos 1998, 305; Nowicki 1999, 50; Mazarakis Ainian, 219. LH III mainland hearths were mostly rectangular in form. 170 Hayden 1987, 203, 216, writing prior to the investigation of Malia Quartier Nu, where they appear in main rooms, argues that central hearths were rare on LM III A-B Crete, except at Chania.

Civic dining rooms in city centres, ritual dining complexes at temples and sanctuaries, small dining rooms for invited guests in private households, and the tradition of the common meal in Crete and Sparta indicate both the continued importance of this mode of social interaction, and its multiplied nuances in Classical Greece.</page><page sequence="55">LAST CHANCE TO SEE? KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 269 public feasting and gathering ceremonies. The central position of Vronda Building A/B and the courtyard in front of it (onto which the cooking and storage facilities of Building B opened directly) the large open space east of the Megarons at Chalasmeno (also centrally- located), and the lack of any adjacent structures immediately to the south of the Karfi Megarons, are all noteworthy in view of the buildings' other special features.1'7 The Karfi Megarons are located adjacent to the steep cliff at the site's north edge. The position offers a striking panorama over much of the north central Cretan coast and the populated valleys to the north, and is the only part of the excavated settlement visible from the surrounding landscape. An extensive open area lay to the south of the block. This siting may possibly have helped differentiate the Megarons as a special building: it may be meaningful that the Temple occupies a similar location. It seems significant, too, that the Smari Megarons have a central, isolated, and dominant position on the acropolis, separate from any other structures (apparently the case also in their LM III C incarnation) and inside the site's inner fortification wall. In summary, exceptional size, anteroom presence, axial plan, central hearths, column bases, benches, feasting-related finds, and central or isolated positioning all seem inadequate (whether individually or in limited combination) to securely identify a single conceptual template for special-function buildings at Cretan sites in the twelfth to eleventh centuries. All the same, the regular combination of such features in certain buildings across a number of sites is suggestive in this respect. At large sites like Karfi, the presence of several sizeable buildings sharing such features suggest they or their inhabitants had important status within the settlement, but it is so far impossible to say exactly how that status differed or in what exactly it consisted. Distinctions between special-use buildings and domestic architecture seem to be subtle, small and partial at this period in Crete, so that proper whole-site context information is crucial to identifying the former. Unfortunately, adequate contextual analysis is missing from many EIA architectural studies, which either start by over- segregating certain buildings into an arbitrary closed category of 'special structures', often based on certain received ideas about plan types, or lump all contemporary architecture together to draw highly generalizing conclusions about features in use at the period.'73 While my conclusions here are cautious, I hope they will provide a grounding and direction for further systematic and contextualized discussion of special buildings and their functions, as more complete finds records become available from future excavations. The excavators of any new LM III C defensible settlement may, on present evidence, reasonably expect to find a settlement shrine. I suggest that they may also often expect to find at least one large, probably isolated block with static plan, incorporating many of the above features and possibly preserving evidence of concentrated feasting. Whether or not such blocks were ever residences, they seem likely to have been a familiar component of the LM III C built environment, which held special meaning for the communities of the period. 172 Day et al. 1986, 365-6, 371, 373; Rutkowski, 259. Tsipopoulou. The Smari Megarons were also isolated by the LG period, but discovering whether or not this was the case during LM III C would require excavations under the paved courts surrounding them. Hatzi- Vallianou 2004. 173 Fagerstrim tends to the lumping approach. Mazarakis Ainian, 42, defends a generalizing treatment of pre-selected 'special' buildings across sites and regions, with little or no attention to site context, as helpful in modelling long-term social developments.</page><page sequence="56">270 SARO WALLACE During the LM III A-B period, strong regional settlement hierarchies may have limited the requirement for or importance of formal gathering venues (whether secular or religious) at small- to medium-sized sites. Where they did appear, these may have been closely attached to, or integrated, in residential structures owned by powerful families. In the changed environment of the LM III C period-similar small-to medium-sized settlements with no strong hierarchal relation-both settlement temples and public feasting venues seem to have become more important foci for societal self-conception and interaction, more formalized in nature, and probably increasingly separated from direct personal control, even though individual groups regularly attempted (often with considerable success) to emulate or appropriate their function. Certain features of plan, some tied into exotic/ prestige traditions dating back in the island as early as the fifteenth century, but also linked closely to the contemporary domestic template, were newly combined to distinguish important buildings, possibly used for feasts, whether or not these were also the dwellings of prominent families.'74 These features seem too selectively used, and and in too concentrated a form, across a number of sites, to directly reflect the presence of a major new immigrant group. The shared characteristics of special buildings suggest strong, regular contacts and shared social norms between the island's communities, yet there was clearly considerable room for variation in how public feasting spaces were constructed. At LM IIII C Thronos Kefala, for example, an open-air feasting area represented by pits occupies the summit area, separate from any building in the settlement.175 It is interesting to consider the way 'special building' templates may have drawn on past traditions in the light of Preucel's observations on the Pueblo settlements, built in a context of ethnic revivalism sparked by changes in the level of contacts with non-local groups: 'The form and layout of the plaza pueblo of Kotyiti can be interpreted as an architectural assertion of ethnicity-linked tradition. In this sense, it is an archetype village, the outcome of the broader pan-Pueblo discourse on shared origins and the local invention of tradition by the Chichiti people'.'76 We might modify this interpretation for EIA Crete to talk about the emergence of 'archetype' feasting blocks of formalized plan which drew on a recognized and prestigious pan-Aegean heritage. (e) PUBLIC CULT AND FEASTING IN EIA CRETE: THEORIZING THEIR RELATIONSHIP IN SPATIAL AND SOCIAL TERMS Above, we have seen how closely cult and collective feasting practices overlap in EIA Cretan societies, as they did in other Aegean regions. Despite this, the existence of possible 'special' buildings in which assemblages do not include evidence of standard cult practice represents an exceptionally balanced pattern for the twelfth- to eleventh-century Aegean. This duality may help to explain the continued strong institutional role for secular public feasting in Archaic-Classical Cretan society. However, the relationships between the two sectors seem to have varied between different communities, and over time, especially as the distribution of settlement changed, with a distinct nucleation movement accompanying '74 Barbara Hayden's idea, that these features represent the peak of intensity or 'culmination' of Myceneanization of Cretan culture, sidelines the evidence for strongest, widest-ranging acculturation occurring in LM II-III A, focusing on the architectural evidence only.

KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 271 complexity growth from the tenth century onward.'77 I want to end this section by addressing two difficult sites: Smari, discussed above, and Vasiliki Kefala,'78 in the northern lerapetra isthmus, which stimulate thinking on the flexible relations of the two spheres. Building E at Vasiliki Kefala (for which no excavated site context information is available) seems to combine elements of the special-function 'template' discussed above with those of a contemporary public cult building. It is agglutinative in plan, rather than having been built as a single unit. Its north section has three large rectangular rooms, two side- by-side and communicating (E3 and E2), one at right angles to them (E6). Their sizes are 36.8 m', 32.8 m2, and 36.1 m', in the upper size range for the period. They both have features in common with the probable special-function buildings discussed above. Room E6 has a central hearth, with two column bases in axial alignment, and a rear anteroom. It contained cooking and storage vessels, perhaps used to support dining activities in the main room. The idea of large-scale feasting in this block is supported by the fact that room E3 is lined with benches on all sides. Room E2 also has two axially aligned column bases. These three rooms abut, but never communicated with, the smaller room E5 (20 m') and a similar room, E4, to the south, which are also both bench-lined and lie at right- angles to each other. Both contained standard public cult equipment: E4 had a small central altar. The three northern rooms, while clearly different in both assemblage and plan from standard cult buildings of the period, do possess features linking them to cult activity at some point in their lifetime, in the form of a central stone feature in E3 termed an 'altar' by the excavator, echoing the position of hearths in later Cretan temples.'17 Room E6 has a feature identified by the excavator as a bothros or ritual deposit pit in its north-west corner. Could the large rooms have had a function as secular feasting structures, based on aspects of the new template for such buildings, but have developed an especially close relationship with public cult activities over the site's lifetime (LM III C-PG)? Or was strong separation of the two spheres lacking in this community from the very beginning? A published stratigraphy and an exploration of the broader site are needed to answer this. To me, the characteristics shared with probable special-function secular buildings at other sites suggest there may be more to Building E than just an especially complex temple, as the excavator currently interprets it.180 The long-term use of the Smari Megarons block may well involve changes in emphasis over time between secular feasting and cult. It may only have started to be used in a specialized fashion after the partial or total abandonment of the site as a habitation, as occurred in the very similar case of Chalasmeno. By the LG period a small temple of Athena, located east of the Megarons, had become the main focus of activity on the Smari summit. There seems little doubt that the social resonance of this cult overlapped with, or built on the contemporary feasting use of the Megarons. From the early seventh through the fifth centuries, standard public cult became the only use of the site. Both Vasiliki and Smari are of interest in thinking about how changes in Cretan settlement from PG onwards affected the relationship between cult and feasting as '77 Nowicki 2000, PG-A sites: Wallace 2003. 178 Eliopoulos 1988. 179 Mazarakis Ainian, 290; J.

Cult is usually seen as becoming publicly orientated-indeed, the central institution of public life-during polis emergence, and secular feasting as taking on a more individualized and privately relevant role, though both remained powerful forms of social interaction at a number of levels.'8' In Crete, too, where public cult was already very well-established in a complex public role, it also seems to have become strongly linked up to state-level politics. The traditions about the common meal in Crete show that secular collective feasting also maintained an important role there right into the Classical period, while we have less clear evidence that private symposium-type feasting was important in Cretan society. The change of use of the Smari summit buildings, from apparently 'secular' feasting to cult (perhaps as a territorial temple for the nearby town of Lyttos), fits quite well with Mazarakis Ainian's model, of 'ruler's dwellings' being transformed into temples by the Late Geometric period-leaving aside my doubts as to whether such buildings were ever really residences. But things are much less straightforward elsewhere in Crete, where this kind of on-the-spot change can have occurred only rarely, due to the abandonment or internal reorganization of many settlements between c. 1200 BC and the eighth century. The subtly differentiated nature of architecture in LM III C settlements suggests that the conceptual line between household-level, affinal, and cult- related feasting and ritual spaces could be easily crossed back and forward by different groups at different times, and engagement in both arenas was important to maintaining the political power of any individual group. On the other hand, while the two institutions probably became more formally segregated and elaborated over time, the evidence suggests that they already had important, separate forms and remits from the twelfth century on. Cretan societies had a significant level of complexity long before the emergence of the state. At Azoria, the possible andreion was focused around a single main room but incorporated specialized blocks of rooms for food storage, dining or cult, and large-scale food processing."18 This suggests increasingly elaborate provision for secular gatherings, in units increasingly distinct from domestic houses, at the large nucleated sites (all of which probably also possessed temples, on the Prinias/Dreros analogy). Unfortunately no PG-A site of this type is well enough excavated to offer examples of both types of building. In contrast, at the few small defensible sites which continued through the PG-A periods, public cult and secular feasting may have started to overlap much more in spatial terms, during a process in which expanding polities within the same regions exclusively appropriated formal cult architecture. At Kavousi Kastro, no separate cult building was found in the LG settlement, and the Vrokastro settlement also lacks a temple by the same period. Indeed, it is difficult to identify particular buildings at these sites as having any kind of public ceremonial role. However, the Vrokastro room block 16-17 (77.1 m2) is larger than most other buildings on the site, and its assemblage suggests that some kind of cult practice (perhaps more linked to open-air sanctuaries and personal worship than to contemporary town cult) took place there, possibly in a combined secular feasting and cult unit.'83 181 See n. 171. t82 Haggis et al. 183 Hayden 1987, 371'; B.

KARFI IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY 273 PART 4. AVENUES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH Drawing on the observations made above about the current interpretative interest of Karfi's record, I shall finish by briefly suggesting a number of new avenues for further research. The present study was designed to be both broad-ranging and superficial, an updated evaluation of the site, covering a number of aspects of Karfi's current interest. Development of an agenda for further research seems valuable in view of Karfi's high interpretative significance, the deteriorated (and still-threatened) condition of the standing remains, and the lack of a detailed stratigraphic record from the earlier excavations. Warned by experience, any new research should aim to retain significant parts of this otherwise unthreatened archaeological resource for future investigation. Some non-invasive work- further architectural recording in the excavated area-could further understanding of constructional sequence and techniques (especially in the Temple, rooms 55-57 and 43- 47, the Barracks, and the Magazines). Excavation in selected areas, including the small unexcavated section in the south part of the saddle,'84 would allow the first documentation of a representative stratigraphy and full range of artefact types in context, greatly helping in the identification of functional and developmental contrasts between zones of this complex settlement, and allow revision or enhancement of the arguments put forward in this paper. The Megali Koprana summit and the area of Building A1, with their apparently deep deposits, are especially likely to include well-preserved architecture and/or stratigraphy. Systematic recovery and analysis of organic remains, uniform dry sieving, and soil micromorphology studies would help in the identification of cooking features, illuminate the use of enclosures, benches, storage or workshop areas, and cooking and dining zones, and contribute to an already active scholarship on EIA subsistence. The results of studies on plant and animal remains could be usefully tied into recent analyses of soils and geomorphology in the vicinity of Karfi'85 which suggest extensive cultivation on the surrounding slopes during the site's occupation. Study of stratified ceramics, including petrographic analyses, would improve understanding of the site's diachronic development, and of EIA pottery chronology, production, and exchange in the wider region. Trial excavation might also be carried out in this connection at some of the many other EIA sites nearby, including Papoura, perhaps as part of an integrated project. Fieldwalking around the Karfi site would help to locate undisturbed tombs, of which some examples have already been found. Sample excavation of one or more of these could expose standard burial rites and a complete assemblage from which to extrapolate to the already-known tombs.'86 Why excavate anew in this region, when several other sites of the same type and period in Crete have recently been excavated (though at variable standards) and await publication? Apart from the reasons given above-the chance to enhance the original very limited record-Karfi's unique size and complexity compared to other excavated sites, combined with extensive preservation of a stratigraphic record dating to the earliest part of the EIA and undisturbed by later development (as at many other excavated sites), offer a notable 184 Though Pendlebury et al., 64, noted the making of a field in this area during excavation, suggesting major disturbance, it could provide the last chance to explore in detail a similar stratigraphy to that found in the rest of the saddle. 185 Morris (n. 20).

The site's location in one of the Aegean's best-documented EIA cultural landscapes'87 offers opportunities to develop understanding of prehistoric social organization at a regional and diachronic level, in a territory with a varied topographical and ecological cross-section, including lowland valleys, rocky mountain peaks and slopes and Crete's largest fertile upland plain. The position of the Karfi site-between mountains and sea, on a major natural communication route to a large arable plain-reflects an important symbolic, economic, and political role in the wider region, over a timescale much longer than the EIA.'88 A research project focused on the site and its region offers good opportunities to link broad diachronic, structural, and spatial frameworks of human activity to agents and actions at site level. Excavation of a concentration of EIA sites on the lerapetra isthmus (Kavousi Kastro and Vronda, Azoria, Chalasmeno) has already promoted this kind of investigation. The study of a contemporary landscape with many contrasting characteristics would allow social and economic models for EIA Crete developed in the isthmus area to be reviewed and built on further.
