<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DOCTRINE OF ANALOGY IN THE AGE OF LOCKE IN an article entitled 'Mansel's Theory of Regulative Truth'1 I men tioned Mansel's appeal to earlier discussions of analogy in Britain, in support of his claim to be historically orthodox in his views. In this article I shall give some account of the most important of these controversies, which took place in the generation after the publication of Locke's Essay concerning Humane Understanding in 1690. In that period speculative metaphysics was beginning to decline ; a represen tative theory of perception was generally held; and philosophical empiricism, with a psychological emphasis, began to be influential. For these three reasons, and others too, the question of our analogical knowledge of God became urgent.2 Around the end of the seventeenth century, if a moderate English churchman was challenged on the subject of analogy he would be likely to invoke the sermons of Archbishop John Tillotson (1630-94), the oracle of the age and the exemplar of reasonable and practical divinity : It is foolish for any Man to pretend, that he cannot know what Justice, and Goodness, and Truth in God are: for if we do not know this, it is all one to us whether God be good or not ; nor could we imitate his Good ness; for he that imitates, endeavours to make himself like something that he knows, and must of necessity have some Idea of that to which he aims to be like. So that if we had no certain and settled Notion of the Goodness, and Justice, and Truth of God, he would be altogether an unintelligible Being; and Religion, which consists in the Imitation of him, would be utterly impossible.3 It is not clear with whom Tillotson is disagreeing, but Hobbes had treated the divine attributes in a non-cognitive way in the Leviathan4 and elsewhere. Knowledge and understanding are 'but a tumult of the mind, raised by externall things which press the organicall parts of mans 1 J.T.S.

Such 'Indefinite Attributes' as good and just do not 'declare what he is ... but how much we admire him, and how ready we would be to obey him'. Since God is the expression of the human need to worship, his attributes are but emotive ejaculations expressing our awe. Tillotson's opinion, that religion consists in the imitation (so far as it is possible) of God by man is, of course, to be found both in Plato1 and Aristotle.2 Although Aristotle satirizes anthropomorphic views of the divine attributes, he still argues that the divine is imitable. The gods are most happy, and their activity is contemplation. The happiest human life will be that which most nearly copies the divine—that is, the con templative life. To many who were of Tillotson's mind his views seemed such mani fest sense that this passage from him was continually quoted3 and even shamelessly plagiarized.4 Tillotson distinguishes between God's meta physical perfections which are incommunicable to us, and his moral perfections which are communicable to us and imitable by us.5 For Tillotson natural religion, and in particular the testimony of con science, is the surest part of our knowledge. Even if an angel from heaven were to teach Calvin's doctrine of reprobation we ought still to reject it as inconsistent with what we know of the goodness and justice of God.6 Tillotson's confidence is a moral confidence. In reply to Roman Catholic writers he will acknowledge quite openly that the Church of England does not pretend that absolute certainty or infallibility is pos sible in matters of faith. Faith is morally probable, a shrewd investment, safer than atheism. This moral confidence, which Tillotson inherited from his master, Chillingworth, could hold off epistemological scepticism. 1 Theaetetus, 176 a-c; in F. M.

CUPITT Tillotson, like Newton,1 Locke, and most of their contemporaries held a representationalist view of perception. On this point Gassendists, Cartesians, and traditionalists were in broad agreement, though the markedly psychological emphasis which came in with Locke intensified the problem. People were representationalists then faute de mieux ; be cause, with the conspicuous exception of Berkeley, they saw no alter native.2 They were aware of the difficulties. When Locke proposed to found all knowledge upon ideas of sensation and reflection, and Browne indeed upon ideas of sensation alone, the possibility of scepticism was clearly opened up. John Sergeant wrote a book called Solid Philosophy, asserted against the Fancies of the Ideists (1697). Edward Stillingfleet, in his controversy with Locke, increasingly exploited the sceptical im plications of the new way of ideas.3 For we seem to be deprived by definition of any assurance that our mental representations, whether of physical objects or of God, adequately represent the extramental original. But it seemed sufficient at first to many to go on appealing to common sense and the veracity of God. Locke himself is prepared to do this,4 although he ordinarily does not like to rest epistemological theory on a divine guarantee. Peter Browne is more explicit.5 And as we have no good reason to suppose that God has given us misleading faculties of perception, so it was felt that we have no good reason to suppose that he has made us incapable of knowing and imitating his moral nature. For Tillotson and many after him, the veracity of God is the foundation of faith. And since, therefore, for broad churchmen the adequacy of our idea of God's moral attributes was a religious neces sity and was guaranteed by his veracity, those who wished to insist on its merely analogical character had to tread warily. To plain men it seemed clear that if God is the God of truth, and if he reveals himself, then he makes himself known and his revelation must give us adequate knowledge of him. Daniel Whitby warns that if we do not hold fast by our reason and God's veracity we shall 'level the best religion in the world (that is, the Church of England) with the wildest and most absurd enthusiasm'.6 In this word 'adequate', however, lay an unexpected measure of agree ment between the party of revelation and mystery and the party of 1 H. G. Alexander, The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence (1956), pp. xv f. Newton was so extreme a representationalist that he thought even God must have an inner 'sensorium' or theatre in which to perceive : to save God's omni science the world of space and time may be regarded as that sensorium.

He proposes to make Infinity itself 'as little Mysterious as that three and two make five'.2 The Divine Being is no more mysterious to us than the most con temptible of his creatures.3 But Toland himself adopts Locke's dis tinction of nominal and real essences. He asserts that we know things not in their real essence, but only in their attributes; and that our faculties are adapted to practical ends. An adequate, unmysterious know ledge of a thing amounts in the end to no more than a knowledge of it sufficient for moral purposes.4 As Leibniz remarked, Toland's aim was 'to withdraw men from speculative theology to the practice of its pre cepts'.5 If this is so, then the disagreement between the two parties is reduced to one of emphasis : the party of mystery is more struck by the theoretical insufficiency of the religious knowledge accessible to us, and the party of reason by its moral sufficiency. Locke himself had been concerned to show that although our knowledge is limited, it is practically sufficient for our condition.6 It is highly characteristic of the period that while on the surface there is a brave show of metaphysical confidence and even arrogance, when one digs below one finds sceptical currents flowing strongly. An out standing example is Samuel Clarke (1675-1729), who was reckoned the leading metaphysician of his day. Clarke sets out his Discourse Concerning the Being and Attributes of God (Boyle Lectures 1704-5) with a great flourish more geometrico. But he preserves a strict agnosticism about the Divine Essence, and denounces the 'Vanity of the Schoolmen' who invent 'empty sounds' which have 'no manner of Idea' such as that God is Actus PurusP And though Clarke's a priori proof of God (a mixed one, which incorporates the causal maxims) is held by him to be strictly demonstrative, it is remarkable how little he claims for it. That God is, is strictly demonstrated : but what God is, is utterly incompre hensible. But if this is so, then the assertion that God is finds its mean ing whittled away: and so Clarke will even allow (what Hume should have given him more credit for8) that his demonstration is not sufficient 1 To call them 'the orthodox' and 'the Deists' is somewhat misleading. 1 Christianity not Mysterious, p. 83. 3 Ibid., p. 89. * Ibid., pp. 75-79· 5 Cited by Mark Pattison in Essays and Reviews (i860), p. 258 (= Pattison's Essays, ii, p. 46). 6 Essay, IV. xi. 10. 7 Part i, Prop, iv, ad fin.; (9th edn., 1738), p. 41. 8 David Hume, Dialogues concerning Natural Religion, ix (Kemp Smith edn., 1947), p. 190, 'why may not the material universe be the necessarily existent Being?'

CUPITT to establish theism rather than atheism.1 To give his theism any content Clarke must establish divine intelligence by appealing to the teleological argument which is admittedly only probable. Clarke still adheres to the two causal maxims, that every effect has a cause, and that the cause contains eminently all that is in the effect: it would be a mistake to think of him as asking how they can be established or what they mean. But he is discovering that they will not do very much. The psychologiz ing of causal belief, already begun in Locke and completed in Hume, was a much more serious blow to natural theology, but it had already been discovered independently that it could do less for theism than used to be thought. The question of analogy was raised very acutely in Tillotson's last years by the beginning of the Trinitarian controversy. What is meant by the terms predicated of God in trinitarian doctrine ? When God is said to be in three persons, what does the word person mean ? fn 1689 Thomas Firmin and his friends began to issue, more or less clandestinely and anonymously, a stream of anti-Trinitarian pamphlets. Two of them are of particular interest in anticipating Toland's arguments in Christianity not Mysterious. An Impartial Account of the Word Mystery as it is Taken in the Holy Scripture (1691), the seventh of Firmin's first collection, anticipates Toland's treatment of the word mystery. The claim that in the New Testament the word mystery refers, not to some thing incomprehensible in itself, but to something hid from former ages and now made manifest, was bitterly opposed by the orthodox, till at last conceded by Richard Whately.2 Considerations on the Explications of the Doctrine of the Trinity . . . (1694), perhaps by Stephen Nye, is the first pamphlet in Firmin's third collection, and criticizes the way in which Stillingfleet, the Bishop of Worcester, had invoked the analogy of nature to mitigate theological mysteries. In a sense, nature is mysterious. Not all the Fellows of the Royal Society put together can make a grain of wheat. But the clergy do wrong in supposing that this admitted fact licenses them to pass off nonsense as sense.3 Thus in the Firmin pam phlets, and Toland's apparent borrowings from them, the rational unitarianism of the seventeenth century is turning into the free-thinking of the eighteenth. The controversy upon the Trinity, however, was chiefly caused by 1 Prop, viii; ed. cit., p. 50. Anthony Collins, in A Vindication of the Divine Attributes (1710), similarly criticizes William King. King's very agnostic account of our knowledge of God pares away our knowledge of him to a point where his existence can no longer be proved in any sense sufficient to distinguish theist from atheist, pp. 17 ff. 1 Mark Pattison, in Essays and Reviews (i860), p. 292 (= Pattison's Essays, ii, p. 81). 3 Op. cit., p. 4.</page><page sequence="6">ANALOGY IN THE AGE OF LOCKE 191 the fact that the orthodox, in replying to the Firminians, fell out among themselves. One may contrast the treatment of the word person by Dr. William Sherlock, and Dr. John Wallis. Descartes had led people to think of a person as an individual self-conscious subject. Sherlock extended this univocally to God.1 He modernized the Cappadocians, postulating in God three self-conscious subjects who (because they were infinite) did not exclude each other, but were conscious of and permeated each other. His doctrine was charged with tritheism by Robert South, and condemned, amid a furore, by decree of the Hebdomadal Council at Oxford. Wallis, the Professor of Geometry at Oxford, was more cautious and appealed to analogy. The Doctrine of the Blessed Trinity Briefly Explained, in a Letter to a Friend (1690) was the first of seven open Letters on the subject. It appeared a few months after Sherlock's book, but reference to Sherlock begins only in Wallis's second letter. From the fact that Wallis was involved in over a dozen published exchanges in seven months we can gauge what the progress of technology has done for the communication of ideas since his time. Wallis says in his first letter that we use the word perron, when speak ing of God, simply to denote a distinction which Scripture obliges us to make. The distinguishing characteristics of the persons, and indeed their names, are but metaphors whose meaning we do not know. We do not even know what a finite spirit is.2 All the apologist should do is demonstrate from natural reason the possibility and from revelation the fact of the Trinity. All reason need show is that there is no con tradiction in the proposition 'That there be Three Somewhats, which are but One God'.3 'If it be said, It (the word, person) doth not agree to them (the Three in God) exactly in the same Sence in which it is commonly used amongst men; we say so too, nor doth any Word, when applyed to God, signifie just the same as when applyed to men, but only somewhat analogous thereunto.'4 Now there are many instances of a thing's being three in one sense and one in another. A cube has three dimensions, and yet is but one cube. A spirit may be said to be, to know and to do, and yet is but one spirit. Thus statements logically similar about the Trinity cannot be ruled out a priori as self-contradictory; and if the doctrine is in fact revealed, then that is enough. 1 William Sherlock, A Vindication of the Doctrine of the Holy and Ever-Blessed Trinity (1690). 2 pp. 3 f. 3 p. 9. But it must be said that Wallis, by the very choice of his 'similes' illustrating how what is three in one sense may be one in another, slightly prejudices the issue. He takes such an example as that the same man may be king, father, and husband (Third Letter, pp. 62 ff; Fourth Letter, pp. 13 f.). His examples are perhaps a little biassed to encourage us to think of the 'somewhats' in one way rather than another. 4 p. 10 (my parentheses).</page><page sequence="7">192 D. CUPITT Now in these letters by Wallis several crucial points appear, which we can follow up in the controversies caused by the writings of William King and Peter Browne. Wallis uses the terms figurative, metaphorical, and analogous indif ferently. The Firminians called him a 'Nominal', one for whom the terms Father, Son, and Spirit were mere names, and they wondered how one of these 'somewhats' can be thought of as becoming incarnate rather than the others, and distinctly from them.1 The Dublin theologian Peter Browne later endeavoured at great length to distinguish Divine Meta phor from Divine Analogy,2 and he criticized William King for having failed, like Wallis, to do so.3 But the distinction is oddly hard to make clear, and Browne can hardly be said to have provided a satisfactory criterion by which we may know which we are dealing with in a particu lar case. For example, Browne suggests that metaphor employs ideas of sense, whereas analogy employs concepts, such as the moral virtues, and mental perfections.4 Thus talk of God's face is metaphorical, and talk of his wisdom analogous. This is hardly satisfactory. Another sug gestion might be that the distinction between divine analogy and divine metaphor is like that between a natural and a conventional symbol. But these distinctions are not clear cut. Wallis's position, at any rate, came to be regarded as orthodox. Robert Jenkin, author of the standard textbook of the next generation,3 allows that we do not comprehend at all what is meant by such terms as person, begotten and proceeding when used in trinitarian doctrine, but denies that if so, then trinitarian language is redundant or useless. On the contrary, so to think of God kindles the religious affections and 'disposes the soul to the obedience of the Gospel'. It was therefore 'very reasonable and expedient that it should be reveal'd and should be re quired to be believ'd'. When the orthodox are challenged to give some content to, to explain the meaning of, religious language they are to be found above all pointing to its function in regulating the religious life. The clearest example of this is Peter Browne's reply to Toland. Toland's question is a good one : Could that Person justly value himself upon being wiser than his Neighbours, who having infallible Assurance that something call'd Blictri had a Being in Nature, in the mean time knew not what this Blictri was ?6 1 Observations on the Four Letters of Dr. John Wallis . . .

Although Toland professed to be a follower of Locke (to the latter's embarrassment) the point he is making here could create difficulties for Locke. For Locke's treatment of our complex idea of what God is in Essay 11. xxiii is by him rather sharply distinguished from his demon stration of God's bare existence in Essay iv. x.1 It is not altogether clear how Locke is sure that the demonstrated God instantiates the conceptual God.2 And Locke's demonstrated God has no more content than can be extracted for him from the causal maxims. Now Locke, in spite of his empiricism, does employ such allegedly self-evident a priori truths at certain key points in his treatment of substance and causality, but it is at least arguable that for him they have no more than a psychological reality. It is simply a fact about us that we are obliged to think of ideas as inhering in substances, and of effects as produced by 'greater' causes. So there is a real danger that Locke's demonstration of God will crumble; not because, or not only because, it is an unsound argument, but because it is unproductive. The causal maxims, which had meant so much to a certain kind of theism, are in a double danger. Even if they will stand as metaphysical axioms they may not of themselves yield enough, for the f are notion of a general cause of all effects is not a sufficiently definite description of God. And if causal belief is psycho logized, then a Hobbesian account of our belief in God seems irresistible. We are, as a matter of fact, driven by an ignorance and terror before the mystery of the universe to worship: our natural knowledge of God is reduced to a series of emotive ejaculations of awe and wonder.3 Another difficulty raised by Toland, and one of which Locke himself was well aware, is a more general one about particular substances. A substance is that which supports accidents, the subject of propositions attributing properties to it. The trouble is that if you abstract all the properties (not forgetting, of course, the property of being able to have properties) nothing is left. Nothing can be said of a substance because anything said about it becomes an addition to the list of its predicates and so not something said about it. Presumably you cannot even say of substance that nothing can be said of it. But now we begin to suspect that the inaccessibility of substance to thought is not a metaphysical mystery, but a mere logical triviality. 1 See Molyneux's letter of 2 March 1692/3 and Locke's reply of 28 March. 2 For example, Locke's conceptual God is infinite; his demonstrated God is not. 3 James Collins, God in Modern Philosophy (i960), pp. 96 f. 621.1</page><page sequence="9">194 D· CUPITT Now the orthodox are fond of saying that God is incomprehensible. God as he is in himself, in his own essence, is inaccessible to our thought. At most, we can only speak of his attributes. Wallis distinguishes very sharply between knowing that something is so, and knowing how it is so, knowing that God is and knowing what he is. Browne does the same. Clarke, who differs greatly from them on the question of analogy, says that God's being is incomprehensible, but that we can know his at tributes. All, in their different ways, wish to distinguish a sense in which God must elude thought from a sense in which he is thinkable. But now the suspicion arises that God's incomprehensibility is of the same order as the elusiveness of the particular substance; namely that it is trivial. Locke and his contemporaries were fond of denouncing scholastic fictions, but it seems possible that they kept one of the most important of them. And Toland is trying to banish it, by repudiating the notion of truths above reason. So Peter Browne had a large task. He begins1 by saying, Ί grant I know as little of the real nature of the Glory of God, and of the Saints in Heaven, as I do what that Blictrimeans; and yet God doth not speak Nonsense, when he reveals to me that there is such a thing in Heaven as Glory'. Browne gives four reasons. In the first place God supplies us with perfectly intelligible analogies of it drawn from our experience, such as 'the brightness of the Sun, and Glory of a Kingdom'. Secondly, we are told of the relation which this glory bears to us, namely that it awaits us, that we shall enjoy it, and that it will make us happy beyond all imagination. Thirdly this glory is revealed to incite us to obedience ' and holiness. Lastly, we do know that we lack the capacity to under stand what glory is, whereas (one presumes Browne means) we do not know whether Blictri is a word in a foreign language, or a nonsense word, or whatever. Browne's method, then, is to insist indeed upon the incomprehen sibility of God, but to stress that the analogies he employs in revelation are intelligible in themselves and morally effective. But it is evident that religion as Browne conceives it cannot begin to move until we are assured that we have in fact an authoritative revelation from God. It would seem that we need a non-analogical statement about God affirming his existence and sufficient reason for thinking some supposed revela tion emanates from him. So Browne still claims that we can have non analogical knowledge that spirits exist,2 and that God exists. And this, as I hope to have made clear, is impossible. For the statement that God 1 A Letter in Answer to a Book Entituled Christianity Not Mysterious (1697), PP· 133 f 1 Browne's Letter, pp. I04ff. All our ideas about spirits are analogical.</page><page sequence="10">ANALOGY IN THE AGE OF LOCKE 195 exists cannot assert anything until the term God is given a content— which must be analogical. Men in that age were very much aware of the dangers of Spinozism. Even Locke allows that, if Spinozism is to be avoided, the concept of substance must be analogical, though he had no taste for such meta physics.1 But men thought there could be a non-analogical notion of Being in the sense of bare existence.2 Unfortunately, by the time the concept of being has been made sufficiently abstract it has become quite empty. And so Browne did not wholly meet Toland's point, unless he is prepared to give up natural theology and rest even belief in God's existence and the authenticity of the Christian revelation on the ground of their moral efficacy. This, of course, Browne in his generation could not conceive of doing. I have mentioned that for John Wallis the denial of any direct or adequate knowledge of God is joined with, and related to, the denial of any direct or adequate knowledge of the self. We have here, of course, a point of immense importance for the relation of empirical philosophy to theology : perhaps the most important single difference between Berkeley and Hume. Let us begin with Locke. As is well known, Locke drastically criti cized the metaphysical doctrine of substance, but then retained it in a psychologized form. One might have expected him to treat our idea of substance in general in the same way as he treats other abstract nouns—namely, as a mixed mode.3 This he does not do.4 He insists that 'substance' is not given in experience. Only simple ideas are given, but they are given in clumps or bundles which 'go together' in a regular way. And since we are unable to imagine ideas as subsisting sine re substante we are obliged to postulate an unknown substratum in which they in here. Locke feels that he has said just enough to avoid scholasticism and idealism, and will say no more.5 As for our ideas of particular substances, they are complex ideas of bundles of qualities which are observed to go together—in fact, nominal essences.6 Locke's agnosticism is apparent. Our idea of substance in general has no content. Experience gives only the idea and the intuited relation of being-dependent-upon of which the idea is the occasion. From the 1 Essay, II. xiii. 18 ; xxvii. 2. 2 Berkeley is exceptional in being aware that the Schools treated Being analogically: Alciphron, iv. 20. 3 D. J. O'Connor, John Locke (1952), p. 86. 4 All things other than substances are 'but modes or relations ultimately terminated in substances' ; Essay, II. xxvii. 3. Locke gives a certain supremacy to the idea of substance. 5 Essay, II. xxiii. 1 and 2. 6 Essay, 11. xxiii. 3 and 4.</page><page sequence="11">196 d. cupitt idea and the relation we infer a metaphysical entity which ex hypothesi can never be presented in experience. So there is nothing to say about it. Our idea of some particular substance is plainly not the thing itself, for the principle of unity underlying the complex can never be given in sensation. Locke's treatment of the self is of a piece with his account of sub stance. Although he echoes Descartes in talking of our 'intuitive know ledge of our own existence'1 given in every mental act, the Ί' thus given is a particular substance, and hence in itself an inferred entity, a something-we-know-not-what. Our idea of it is a complex idea with the same status as the complex idea of any other particular substance. Locke denied that the essence of the soul is thought. Pace Descartes, the soul manifestly does not always think, though God may do so.2 Thinking is something the soul does, rather than the essence of what it is.3 We have clearly no way of knowing that spiritual substances must be immaterial, or that material substances cannot think. Indeed, as Stillingfleet points out, it is hard to see how we can distinguish material and spiritual substances at all.4 We thus know the Τ not for what it is in itself, but only through what it does. It is not surprising that Locke gratefully leaves it to Revelation to determine the origin and destiny of the self, and sharply distinguishes his treatment of personal identity from his treatment of the substantiality of the self. Locke's proof of God, again, is of a piece with his treatment of sub stance and the self. He need only add the causal maxims to have all the premisses he needs. And our complex idea of God is of course for Locke simply the idea of an ideal self, indefinitely magnified. Browne thought it 'Monstrous', an 'Unnatural hideous composition'. 'Nothing that is Finite, can be of the same Kind with that which is Infinite.'s Instead of thinking God through an enlarged ideal self, we should take the actual self as an analogy believing that there are in God inconceiv able perfections correspondent to its powers. In the scholastic language, Locke employs the analogy of attribution, Browne his own positivist form of the analogy of proper proportionality. Locke emphasizes how far our complex idea of God falls short of what God is.6 Browne develops Locke's doctrine in an agnostic direction. In the famous sermon of 1709 to which we have already referred, William King 1 Essay, iv. ix. 3. 2 Essay, II. i. 10. 3 See J. W. Hudson, The Treatment of Personality by Locke, Berkeley and Hume (Missouri, 1911), chap. ii. 4 Edward Stillingfleet, Works, iii (1710), pp. 505 f. 5 Procedure, pp. 449 ff. 6 See the letter to Anthony Collins of 29 June 1704.</page><page sequence="12">ANALOGY IN THE AGE OF LOCKE 197 remarked incidentally that we describe even our own mental acts by bodily analogies.1 Browne, who attacks Locke for talking of ideas of reflection, seizes upon and elaborates the point: 'we are so far from having any Immediate, Simple, or Original Ideas of the Operations of our Mind, that all the Ideas we attempt to form of the Manner of its Acting, and the expressions we use for it are borrowed from Sensation'.2 Where even self-knowledge is perforce analogical, divine knowledge is a fortiori so. On the other hand, there is a suggestion in Locke of an analogy be tween divine creativity and human voluntary action.3 Those who think, with Berkeley, that we do have an adequate notion of ourselves as active spirits will straightway think God as active spirit, and will not take so sceptical a view of analogy.4 Locke himself did not take this road : as we notice in his extraordinary reticence on the subject of imagination. In all his writings there is scarcely any reference to the subject except in the Journal for 1878, where he links imagination with madness.5 Stillingfleet pointed out to Locke very forcibly the need and the difficulty, on his premisses, of providing clear criteria for distinguishing ideas of sense from ideas of imagination.6 Locke's second reply to Stillingfleet simply fails to take up the challenge, and it was left to Berkeley to do it. Berkeley is obliged to make a very careful distinction between sense and imagination in order that his immaterialism shall not be mistaken for subjective idealism. Ideas of sense are the product of divine crea tivity, ideas of imagination of human creativity. Once the distinction is made, it can serve Berkeley as his fundamental analogy for theism. For we have immediate, intuitive knowledge of ourselves as active spirits : we have immediate knowledge of the products of our own creative im agination : and we have immediate knowledge of the ideas of sense, the products of God's creativity. Having thus three terms of an analogy of proper proportionality we can complete the second ratio, and so gain analogical knowledge of the fourth term. On Berkeley's premisses it is but a pardonable hyperbole for him to speak of our knowledge of God as 'certain and immediate'.7 Since the analogy of proper proportionality is an analogy between relations, the knowledge of God it yields is a know ledge of God in relation : but this does not worry Berkeley, for his God is essentially active spirit, creative mind. 1 § xix.

And it is partly because Berkeley gives such special status to self-knowledge, that analogy as he sees it yields knowledge of God in a much more positive sense. The difference between Berkeley and Browne needs to be elaborated. Edmund Law (of Sidney Sussex College), in the edition of King's Origin of Evil to which we have referred, argues that we experience within ourselves various kinds of knowledge, 'by Sensation or Reflection, by Deduction or immediate Intuition'.1 Yet we call them all by the same word, knowledge; so that evidently we are able to distinguish knowledge as such from particular modes of knowing. Similarly in Alciphron Berkeley's Crito claims that we can distinguish the formal essence of goodness or knowledge as such from the imperfect mode of its particular instantiation in ourselves. 'In knowledge simply, or as such, there is no defect.'2 It is this knowledge and goodness as such which are properly attributed to God and supposed to be realized in him in a mode un known to us. But to Peter Browne and to William Law3 (of Emmanuel College) there was a suggestion of blasphemy here, a suggestion that there might be a formal essence of goodness or knowledge as such, prior to its instantiation in God on the one hand, and the creature on the other. Such a theory of analogy put God and the creature side by side as mem bers of a class. That way in theology led to the subordination of God to the moral law and to the eternal truths, to a God who was not God be cause he was not free and transcendent. Indeed, the freedom of God is another crux. In the first edition of Locke's Essay that philosopher conceives the freedom of man ana logously with the freedom of God. Good is 'that which determines the will'4 and, admittedly with hesitation, Locke goes on to say that 'God himself cannot choose what is not good: the freedom of the Almighty hinders not his being determined by what is best'.3 Leibniz approves.6 Clarke agrees.7 Locke, of course, had many hesitations and changes of mind on the question of the relation of God to the moral law. Sometimes he does affirm the natural moral law, and at others all law is positive. At any rate there is no doubt that Browne and William Law were sharply opposed to any subordination of God to the moral law and the eternal truths. And if so, divine freedom is different in kind from * Law/King, op. cit., p. 91. 2 Alciphron, iv. ai. 3 The Case of Reason (1731); in Law's Works (Moreton edn., 1892), vol. ii, esp. pp. 81-92: a remarkable book, too little known. 4 Essay (1st edn.), 11. xxi, 29. 5 Ibid.

'God cannot be under any law in common with us his creatures, any more than he can be of the same rank or order with us. . . . And we have no more reason to be afraid to be left to a God without a law, than to a God that had no be ginning. .. ,'1 One good way of exposing the disagreement between the two parties on the subject of analogy is to take up the ever-popular simile of the blind man. Consider a man blind from birth, whose knowledge of light and colours is based entirely on the testimony of others. Is this a fair illustration of our situation in relation to divine things ? Edward Synge, answering Toland in An Appendix to A Gentleman's Religion, uses the illustration to show that it can be reasonable to be lieve, upon the testimony of others, in something quite outside our ex perience, or 'above our reason', as he puts it.2 Light and colours are more to the blind man than Toland's Blictri, for his other senses can supply him with analogies. Touch can supply the ideas of a stream of particles, and of shapes : hearing can supply the ideas of directional sensation, and of qualitatively different sensations. The weakness of Synge's illustration is that in relation to divine things we, the blind, are not surrounded with sighted men to guide our thinking. Rather, the whole race is blind and some blind men have come to be persuaded that there is such a thing as light. How can one blind man persuade another ? Peter Browne, in his reply to Toland, imagines a blind man directly instructed by God. Browne's purpose is to show that God cannot reveal directly what light and colours are, but must supply analogies employing ideas which are within the blind man's experience. Browne deliberately rules out the possibility that God might open the eyes of the blind. That would be enthusiasm. Revelation cannot give us 'direct, immediate or proper' ideas of divine things.3 In the Procedure of 1728 Browne adheres to this position,4 but in the Divine Analogy of 1733 he hesitates a little.5 The simile of the blind man is not quite adequate because there can be no real correspondence between the blind man's concepts of light and colours and the sighted man's experience of them : whereas we believe on the authority of revelation that there is a real correspondence between human perfections and their archetypes in God. William King, in his Sermon, also quotes the blind man, pointing 1 The Case of Reason, ed. cit., p. go. 2 1st edn. (1698), pp. 11 f. The Appendix was bound up with the 2nd edn. (1698) of A Gentleman's Religion, and so came after Browne's Letter. Leslie Stephen nods here. 3 Browne's Letter, pp. 41 ff. 4 e.g., p. 127. 5 pp. 411 ff·</page><page sequence="15">200 D. CUPITT out that if there were a fair expectation of gaining his sight thereby, the blind man might reasonably 'submit to the most difficult and tor menting Operations of Physic and Chirurgery' to do so.1 But King also uses the analogy of the map. Now between a map and the terrain it represents there is in some respects a real mathematically definable proportionality; and this suggests a much more Berkeleyan account of analogy. King uses his map illustration to argue that many objections to religious beliefs are rather like the objection to a map that the country it represents is not made of paper.2 This does, of course, raise the ques tion of how we can tell in which respects some image does correspond with its original and in which respects it does not. And the notion of correspondence is itself notoriously complex. Synge, Browne, and King,3 then, are prepared to use the analogy of the blind man, in various ways. Clarke and Berkeley repudiate it, chiefly because it suggests that we are entirely dependent upon revelation for our religious knowledge, and that unaided reason can no more attain to a belief in the being of God than a blind man could learn, without the aid of a sighted man, of the existence of light.4 Berkeley complains that Peter Browne has forgotten his Euclid and lost sight of the fact that an analogy is a 'similitude of proportions',5 a relation between two relations rather than among four terms. Finally, Wallis appeals to the analogy of nature, for example in treating of the Incarnation. That the Son of God should be hypostati cally united with a human nature is no more incredible than that an im material soul should 'inform, actuate and manage' a human body.6 There are obvious dangers in arguing, as so many divines of that period did, that since we are obliged to believe six impossible things before break fast every day, the addition of a few more is neither here nor there. The Deists tried to keep a check on this style of argument. They usually 1 § vii (Whately edn., p. 30). 2 Collins, in his Vindication, pp. 36 f., voices a frequent criticism of King. The conventional signs used on maps are not intended to represent rivers or windmills to those who have never seen them, but merely signify them to those who know already what a windmill or river is. Collins's point is that both the blind man and the map similes presuppose that some people at least have the direct experience with which the mediate symbolic knowledge is being con trasted. Whereas King and Browne are trying to insist that there could not be such direct experience of divine things. 3 Robert Jenkin, in The Reasonableness and Certainty of the Christian Religion (ed. cit.), vol. ii, p. 425, also uses it. 4 Clarke, op. cit., prop, iv (9th edn., 1738, p. 38.) 5 The Theory of Vision . . .

The orthodox, like Wallis and Butler, commonly held that natural and divine mysteries were not precisely of the same kind, but merely analogous to each other. But to say this weakens the force of the appeal to the analogy of nature. Take, for example, the passage where Locke says that though admittedly we cannot conceive creation ex nihilo, neither can we explain how thought can cause bodily motion, though we must acknowledge the fact.1 So, Locke says, the inconceivability of a doctrine is not of itself a reason for disbelieving it. On the Deist view the divine mystery is of the same kind as the natural mystery, so that it proposes to us, not a fresh kind of difficulty, but merely another instance of a kind of difficulty we have already met. But on the orthodox view the divine mystery is different in kind, and an argument already merely negative and rather weak is weakened still further. If God's mysteriousness is sut generis, then to say that Stillingfleet's spire of grass, or Locke's pebble or fly, are also mysterious, but in a different sense, helps very little. Appeal to the analogy of nature slides imperceptibly into the use of analogical inference. It is worth noticing that different writers have given the name analogical inference to a number of arguments of slightly different kinds. For Butler an analogical inference is the complex kind of argument by which one might establish, or make it probable, from internal evidence that the author of Hamlet is the author of The Tempest. For J. S. Mill an analogical inference is an argument that if two objects share properties a, b, c. . . , and one of them has the further property /, then there is a slight presumption that the other also has the property /. Mill says that this kind of inference is useful in suggesting possi bilities for scientific investigation, but naturally insists on how little it can do in its own right.2 Russell includes analogy among the 'postulates of scientific inference' and is mainly concerned with our analogical in ference that other people's behaviour is actuated by thoughts and feel ings similar to those which actuate our own.3 Analogical inference of such kinds clearly underlies the various forms of the teleological argument for the existence and attributes of God. Butler's kind seeks to show that the three ordered systems, of natural religion, of revealed religion, and of nature itself, have a common author. In all three we find analogous contrivances employed. Butler seems not to notice that he is comparing a physical system with conceptual systems. Mill's kind of analogical inference resembles that of the 1 Essay, ιν. χ. ig. 2 A System of Logic (1843), bk. iii, chap. xx. 3 Human Knowledge (1948), pp. 501 ff.</page><page sequence="17">202 D. CUPITT physico-theologians. The world is like a machine in certain respects, so that there is a presumption that it is like a machine in the further respect of having a maker. Russell's kind of analogical inference reminds us of Berkeley's divine visual language. From their observable behaviour I infer that my friends are actuated by feelings like my own ; and from the visible world as a whole I infer that it is actuated by a wise and benevolent creative mind—like my own. In these types of theism, though the inference is analogical, the at tribute of God discovered by it is predicated of him univocally. Thus Paley infers the goodness of God from the beneficence of the con trivances in the natural order, and the gratuitous pleasure of animals.1 The inference is analogical, but the goodness itself is predicated uni vocally. In an argument of this sort the distinction discussed earlier between analogy and metaphor is particularly critical. Suppose one person looks at a turbulent sea, and says that the sea rages. Another person admires with Paley the shrimps dancing on the sand and ex claims that God is benevolent. What is going on in these two cases? How are they different, if at all ? After Butler's Analogy appeared in 1736 discussion of analogical pre dication died out until revived by the interesting controversy which followed the publication of Edward Copleston's An Enquiry concerning the Doctrines of Necessity and Predestination (1821).
