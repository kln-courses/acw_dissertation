<plain_text><page sequence="1">Colin Symes Keeping Abreast With the Times: Towards An Iconography of T-Shirts. CLOTHED IN WORDS Though certain of its poses can be suggestive, the naked body is usually devoid of meaning, devoid of clues that enable its owner's social and economic status to be determined. Nudity is disarming for this very reason: that bereft of garments and other caste markers like jewelry, the body is almost indecipher able. As several writers have suggested (Coward 30, Craik 67-83; Eco 191-195; Lurie 3-23), clothes cover the anatomy but, at the same time, reveal much about a person's drives and propensities, internal state and external status. The technical function of dress is combined with symbolic features that enable clothes to be fashioned into elegant sentences and rhetorical flourishes, understandable to the reader of raiment. The anatomy corre sponds to a blank page, to a tabula rasa, on which the calligra phy of clothing is inscribed, erased, rewritten . .. like a veritable palimpsest, according to the exigencies of decorum and circum stance, to the dictates of fashion and good taste. Clothes have a rich overlay of meaning which partly stems from their function but also reflects, changing norms, especially those to do with sexuality and identity. Thus, as Coward (35) has intimated, the fashions of the 1960s are ciphers of 1960s sexuality, when the corsets of repression were drawn rather more tightly. The meanings that are attached to apparel systems are mostly infer ential, being derived, as Roland Barthes (8-27) pointed out, from the significance attached to certain colors and designs, as they have been typified in fashion magazines (parole) or the more vernacularized (langue) garment culture. Nowhere is this more evident than in that most linguistically direct of garments, the t shirt embellished with slogans and images of various kinds.</page><page sequence="2">88 Studies in Popular Culture Able to codify a range of messages, both personal and collective, the t-shirt is a garment like no other, one in which the language of clothing meets the language of statement, in which textile be comes textuality. Since the late 1960s the repertoire of dress, particularly for the young, has expanded its range, encompassing attire once considered deviant and immodest. Clothes along with rock mu sic and lifestyle, have become integral parts of an increasingly diverse and factionalized youth culture. Reflecting this, new clothing "dialects" have emerged which enable factions to be identified and contrasted, and individuals to be placed within one of the battalions of youth culture. These dialects function like badging devices, carrying messages, both symbolic and in ferential, about one's sexual preferences, as in the case of the gay uniform that Fischer has examined. But there are dialects of dress that are less obviously part of a defiant subculture but which, nonetheless, constitute a contrast to normal dress and create a sense of solidarity and filiation. The "three piece" suit of leisure, comprising sandshoes, jeans and a t-shirt, is a case in point. Originally associated with the proletariat, with factory and field work, these clothes, in the 1960s, were donned by artists and beatniks as a symbol of protest, violating the discipline of capitalist dress. Once established as the sartorial esperanto of youth, they lost these protest connotations. Moreover, since the variations and nuances of the garments involved conformed to an unvarying register, there was little to distinguish individual from individual, nothing to indicate their proclivities, social-eco nomic background or sexual preferences (Fiske, Hodge and Turner 102-103). As a code for the presentation of self, it was a restricted one, offering little scope for revelatory personal em bellishment; a case perhaps, of being naked with clothes on. The code, to continue with the Bernstein (150-151) analogue, was elaborated, in a number of ways. Mods, rockers, punks, gays and bikies developed their own variant attire, which, as de scribed by Hebdige (1978, 100-112; 1988, 91-115) and Willis (233-252) reflected the imperatives and values of their particular subcul tures. Other elaborative strategies centered on the garments themselves, and different groups and subcultures associated themselves with one brand and jean-type rather than another. The designer label phenomenon, which added haute to what otherwise was bas couture, provided additional variation and significance. However none of these variations permitted a high</page><page sequence="3">Symes 89 degree of individualization, not when compared with the t-shirt, which through its manifold motifs and slogans enabled elaborate meanings and personal statements to be codified, moreover, with a degree of precision and directness denied to other forms of clothing. That the garment fulfills some function in the modern community can be judged from the fact that t-shirts are on sale everywhere, either in specialist stores or as part of general mer chandise. They are part and parcel of the product promotion and souvenir industries, and the range of the motifs is consider able as can be judged from the fact that those stores specializing in t-shirts have catalogues of motifs arranged according to sub ject matter and artist. It could be argued that much of the evi dent popularity of the t-shirt stems from its cheapness and ver satility, yet this alone cannot explain its popularity, for a plain t shirt would serve both these functions equally well. THE ABC OF THE T-SHIRT The t-shirt combines the art of the advertisement with that of the cartoon, the headline with that of the punchline. De signed to catch the eye, it is the advertisement applied to the self; indeed, in many instances, it is just that: an advertisement using the torso as a bill-board, as a peripatetic commercial, on which to exhibit the logos and entreaties of companies like Bond and Fosters.1 T-shirts, in fact, are but one of the accou trements of promulgation available to the beer enthusiast. That there is so little resistance to this particular form of advertising, is indicative of the degree to which the imperatives of vanity now coincide with those of commodity fetishism, and the degree to which individuals wish to identify themselves through the products they imbibe and consume. Lurie (133) has noted an added irony and that is that consumers will pay handsomely for the privilege of wearing a t-shirt embellished with Christian Dior or Pierre Cardin logo, even when it is of inferior quality to a plain t-shirt. Activities, events, places, institutions ... are also the subjects of t-shirt celebration. As souvenirs, they provide a veritable gazetteer of the planet's tourist spots and chronology of its ma jor events, yet another example of commodification of time and place. Like some sort of vestimentary passport stamp, they en able a person to enrobe themselves with place names, to give</page><page sequence="4">90 Studies in Popular Culture material form to their holiday escapades ("I got wrecked on Great Keppel Island and Survived"). The t-shirt has also joined the programme, the record, the catalogue, the badge as another artifact of instant nostalgia, the one thing, apart from one's memories, that can be taken away from a rock concert or cul tural event, be it a camel race in North Queensland or a confer ence of phlebotomists ("A cut above the rest") in Newcastle, New South Wales. This souvenir can also serve a self-promotional function, signalling an individual's interests and history, as well as identi fying those with whom one is likely to have preoccupations in common. In this respect t-shirts function like the old school tie or college blazer, providing easily understood ciphers that enable an individual's cultural genealogy to be asserted, sometimes to emphasize nationality or political affiliation. At the Seoul Olympics, where anti U.S. feeling was high, an "I'm not an American" t-shirt was produced to do just this, to assert non Americanness. But in the "lonely crowd" of urban life such self-commentary can also be a contact maker, a reference point around which experiences can be exchanged and mutuality es tablished. Male garments, the tie being the best example, have always incorporated badging elements, signifying such things as education, military record and club membership. The t-shirt has usurped their function but in a non-gendered way. Moreover the old school tie of casual dress can present a wider range of mes sages. But it still operates like a heraldic device, a personal coat of arms, on which the emblems and escutcheons of popular and not so popular culture are born, and through which identity can be flagged. The t-shirt covers the body and in doing so reveals much about the person inside it; it dresses and undresses at the same time, and creates the means through which the person can be addressed. Sometimes the t-shirt is indeed propositional in character, advertising availability or sexual disposition, as in "I know what you're thinking. Let's do it." The t-shirt can give advance notice of intention, can speak without speech. COLLARING THE T-SHIRT As a form of cultural production the t-shirt is an epigone of Pop Art and Dada, a form of mild iconoclasm that, through the appropriation of the devices of advertising, permits institutions</page><page sequence="5">Symes 91 and corporations to be lampooned and impugned. Familiar im ages from television and commercials are reworked and repro cessed, distorted and refracted. The t-shirt designer is, above all, a recycler, a bricoleur, a Marcel Duchamp with the silk screen, a populist Andy Warhol, giving new lease of life to second hand images, offering new texts and contexts for the texts of advertis ing. In this way the more ubiquitous escutcheons and homilies of capitalism are mocked and undermined, imaginatively remade. Thus "Heinz" means "Fartz"; the feeling of a XXXX "coming on" becomes one "coming up," complete with cartoon of vomit ing man. The slogan is used against itself, and an advertisement is translated into animadversion, promotion "demotion" ("I went to New Zealand. There was no one there, just 70 million sheep"). Toyota, Coca Cola, McDonalds, nothing is sacrosanct in this version of the buga up aesthetic. Logos, politicians, news stories, all have been subject to t-shirt redesign, as in some grand expos of the images which have most exposure in our culture. The adulteration shows how close these images are to the crude, the immoral and the illicit, and are a subtle reminder of how the entreaties of capitalism can be subverted through an adding a letter ("Le Croq Sportif") or modifying a logo. One t-shirt, cap tioned "Adihash—for all grass sports," reshapes that of Adidas into a marijuana leaf. The t-shirt designer then, appropriates and modifies the devices of modern advertising and the media. It is popular art being applied against the artifacts of mass culture, being used to resist the colonizing tendencies of capital and its propaganda machine, advertising.2 For instance there are large number of t-shirts devoted to the bizarre news story, a shooting in a McDonalds Family restaurant in Oklahoma ("I ate McDonald's and lived") and, most popular of all, the Azaria Chamberlain case, recently the subject of the film Evil Angels (A Cry in the Dark in the U.S.).3 As with the jokes and the morbid speculation that surrounded the case, the t-shirts offer an alternative editorial on the inci dent, a sort of trial by t-shirt innuendo. There are countless shirts on the subject, many of which have become best sellers. One encaptioned "Darwin's theory," showing Lindy emerging from the skin of a dingo, includes all the bric-a-brac of the case: the scissors, the camp site, the matinee jacket. Another, entitled "The Revenge," shows Azaria eating, with appropriate sound ef fects, the dingo. The same sort of ghoulish humor is evident in those t-shirts devoted to the eating habits of the North Queens</page><page sequence="6">92 Studies in Popular Culture land crocodile, many of which parody the more conventional tourist t-shirts. One such shows a traumatized male wearing a "Visit Queensland" t-shirt, surrounded by the infamous saurians. Such t-shirts present the dark side of Australia's wildlife; they are cautionary tales in the tradition of the werewolf, a contem porary bestiary, one that serves to mythologize the beasts in our midst. Thus Azaria is constructed as an antipodean version of "Little Red Riding Hood" (appropriately inverted for the down under market), highlighting the perils in the outback conserva tionists exhort us to venerate. Those endangered species are also dangerous! The mythologizing, then, serves to demystify the ex cesses of the conservation ethic; but it also highlights the con tradictory messages presented in the media about Australia's wild life. Public figures, especially of the anti-hero kind, are predomi nant in the t-shirt pantheon, the most popular being the English test cricketer Ian Botham. Whilst the media lauds his cricketing powers yet denigrates his philandering and alleged involvement with drugs, the t-shirt "editorial" offers a different view alto gether, attributing those powers to "not being able to keep off the grass." As with the t-shirts of politicians, there is an overlap with the cartoon here, though the barbative tone of the satire involved is much coarser and more risque, of the sort that would be regarded as tasteless or in a newspaper. For example there are t-shirts which compare politicians to vegetables, that show them defecating or otherwise caught with their pants down. The Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke, and his Treasurer, Paul Keating, have been depicted thus. This indecent exposure of those in power is especially evident in a t-shirt designed to ac company the Pope's visit to Australia in 1986. Emblazoned with the words "The Pope Down Under," it shows a gleeful looking John Paul the Second with his hands beneath the habits of two nuns. There is a double irony here in that the tour was called "The Hand of Hope." It is not just that these type of t-shirts appeal to those with a taste for wearing the tasteless and ob scene but that they open our eyes to the other side of power and moral leadership, that even the Popes and Prime Ministers of this world, contrary to their publicly constructed image, are prey to their instincts and lascivious desires.</page><page sequence="7">Symes 93 X-RATING THE T-SHIRT One way the t-shirt arrests attention is to plumb the depths of bad taste; another is to use wit and humor, both pictorial and verbal. The t-shirt has become the stand-up comic of garments, a vestimentary jester providing free entertainment through its one-liners. Above all, the t-shirt is domain of the double-enten dre, of that division of word play of multiple meanings in which sexual connotations shadow seemingly innocent phrases. Adver tisers have long understood the drawing power of word play and puns, of employing innuendo and amphibole, of refurbishing hackneyed phrases through word displacement and replacement. Two meanings for the price of one, if nothing else, makes sound economic sense, and also provides some comic relief from the otherwise deadly business of capitalism. The point has already been made that t-shirts are convenient medium for self-promo tion, a sort of mobile curriculum vitae ("I'm a trendy left wing subversive"), offering a summary account of the self for public consumption. Where space, as on a t-shirt, is limited space sav ing language of the punnish kind makes sense. It is precisely because puns overplay language, and exploit the literalness of words, that their meaning cannot be taken in at one glance, that a second look is required for the second meaning, often bawdy and vulgar, to be apprehended. As Redfern (24) and Zijderveld (66) have argued, puns stretch our minds and thereby double our attention; they increase cognitive reflection on cliches and slo gans, on a language overused and under contemplated. For the person who wants their cause or themselves to be noticed and noted, then, vestimentary wordplay is an effective tactic, one that peace groups ("Legs against arms"; "There's no right side in a war. Only who's left") have often employed. The X-rated t-shirts (often kept below the counter) illustrate this salacious potential residing in everyday words, as does the "Pope Down Under" shirt already discussed. In fact "down un der" has become t-shirt argot for pudenda, and countless shirts use it, as a way of advertising Australian sexual power. T-shirts of this kind exemplify the craft of ribaldry in action, of the way below the belt humor is transmitted above it. Commercially very successful,4 they often make connections between self-ad vertisement and sexual prowess, either through occupation or ethnic background, as in "Librarians make novel lovers" or "Greeks do it best." The phrase is simultaneously suggestive</page><page sequence="8">94 Studies in Popular Culture and self-recommending, according to the way its read. This pro vides a refuge for the wearer, who wishes to repulse sexual ad vances, for the librarian who really loves novels more than coital gymnastics. Other t-shirts give illustrative embodiment to a message or caption, so that as in a titled painting, the t-shirt is a composite work of pictura and poesis, in which there is a constant circle of recursiveness between picture and caption, the one sometimes dominating the other and vice versa.5 "Be kind to pets: kiss a pussy" is like this. There are versions in which the message ap pears alone, others in which two cats engaged in cunnilingual ac tivity are depicted, corrupting the innocuousness of the message just enough to make its import unambiguous. In fact many t shirts use anthropomorphism in this way, to give animal form to human sexual behavior, as if two koalas copulating (rather than cuddling) is more acceptable than two humans. Such t-shirts of fer an interesting countertext to those which portray the koala and the kangaroo as the quintessence of charm and innocence, as the epitome of Australiana. Two koalas copulating, another holding a condom ("The Bear essential") and a kangaroo de picted in a state of sexual excitement ("I'm so horny even the crack of dawn isn't safe") add dimensions to the national bes tiary foreign to the asexual codes of patriotism and nationalism. There is obviously an implied bestiality in the images, as if Aus tralians not only love their animals but they know how to make love to them too. Indeed one t-shirt identifies Australia as a place where men derive much of their sexual satisfaction from such. It shows a man copulating with a sheep, and has the cap tion "Australia: where men are men. And sheep are nervous. It's shear ecstasy." This is garment as dirty joke, one in which one of the epitomes of Australian manhood, the shearer, is ex posed as a sexual pervert, as one who seeks sexual satisfaction from sheep rather than sheilas. It also represents the comic side of sexual inadequacy, an assault on the dominant ideology of sexuality, that Australian males, contrary to their popular image, really are a sheepish lot, that down under all is not what it seems. There are some t-shirts in which, calligram-like, some of the meaning of a slogan is visually incorporated or represented in its typography. In "Flies spread diseases .... keep yours zipped," the letter "z" is actually drawn as a zip; and in "Life is a drag," the "i" takes the form of a cigarette. Sometimes the typography</page><page sequence="9">Symes 95 is arranged so as to minimize the offensiveness of a word, as in the slogan "FLICK THE SYSTEM," where the "L" and the "I" are sufficiently close to one another that they could be taken for the letter "U." In another t-shirt, which reads "Buzz Off," the typography is formed from a swarm of flies, and represents a clear injunction to those pests, both human and insect, who might harass its wearer. A t-shirt in the similar vein, is "STOP STARING AT MY TITS." This not only gives new meaning to body language but it actually incorporates the signified elements into the slogan. By contrast, there are many t-shirts which are crude and gross in their artifice, that exploit the rhetorical forms of the comic strip rather than the "high art" of the advertisement. Their fascination derives from the tastelessness and the dis agreeableness of their subject matter and the crudeness of its presentation. This is especially true of those t-shirts which deal with scatological and emetic themes or which promulgate, with appropriate visualizations, the virtues of over indulgence. One such provides a pictorial taxonomy of the fart. Defined as "A small explosion between the legs," it parodies systems of classi fication yet, at the same time, mocks the standards of public de cency. It is an assault on the bourgeois order through the use of a bourgeois ordering system, an order that enjoins modesty and good taste, particularly, as Gombrich (230) once pointed out, in the area of dress and, above all, control over the cloacal regions. Thus farts are not supposed to be heard, and still less seen on a t-shirt which deconstructs their auditory and olfactory character. On the other hand, taxonomy is a legitimate epistemological method, applied to just about other type of cohort, so why not flatulent behavior? In this respect the t-shirt's educative preten sions are shared by those t-shirts which adapt the dictionary def inition and present, as in the case of the "Wombat," some com ments about its behavior that double as comments about sexual ity. Because the dictionary entry is accepted as a repository of truth, it serves to elevate the tone of the comments and give them ethological authenticity. These t-shirts then, are a product of a literate society, one that is able to recognize and reinterpret important epistemological forms, to give them meanings which transgress taste and operate at the margins of decency, that use the forms of civilization to mock its civilizing tendencies and to carnivalize the regime of purity and decency. They experiment with the aesthetics of offense through non offensive forms, and</page><page sequence="10">96 Studies in Popular Culture counter the homilizing tendencies of a society that has repressed expression from the excrement end of the body. They mock good taste and standards of decency. They place the humor of the water closet on the street, and there is a sense of "carnival" evident in the t-shirts which, opposed to an authoritarian moral ity that has shamed the lower parts of the body into privacy and silence, is potentially progressive. (Bakhtin, 368-386). This is even more evident in those t-shirts which celebrate physical excess, which, in effect, constitute a riposte to the "new temperance," the emergent morality of self-denial and respect for the body. This culture is perceived as anti-hedonistic, as life denying rather than affirming. One t-shirt, for instance, reads: "How come everything I love is either illegal, immoral or fatten ing"; another: "Diet is 'die' spelt with a 't'." These t-shirts, and there are countless numbers of them, act as a critical sub-text to the Life-Be-in-It campaign, and demonstrate that the morality of indulgence persists, in spite of the state's attempt to discourage it. Many of these t-shirts, for instance, promote the view that inebriation and narcosis and unthinkingness are the apotheoses of consciousness. To the point is one t-shirt which reads: "There are only two states to be in: Queensland and Pissed." Drugs and alcohol are presented as harmless, innocuous chemicals, particu larly when taken in excess. Appealing to those who are proud of their defects and vices, many of these of t-shirts, show a pros trate male (and it is only a male), with an enormous beer gut, surrounded by his mates, with a caption that something along the following: "I don't have a drinking problem. I drink. I get drunk. I fall down. No problem." As one t-shirt, showing a can of XXXX being carried on a stretcher, suggests, beer is the "Great Aussie Lifesaver," as much as part of the culture as the koala, the shearer and the Bondi lifesaver. In a culture in which "I can feel a four XXXX coming on" has assumed the propor tions of a national anthem, in which beer and cricket are the mainstays of male ockerdom, t-shirts like "Chunder Down Un der,"6 which entreat us to "Party until we Puke," exhibit the in tersection of many facets of pub(lic) culture: sport, drink, sex ... but they also highlight the contradictions between the state's morality of restraint and the morality of consumption preached by the profiteering pleasure industries.</page><page sequence="11">Symes 97 ABREAST WITH POLITICS As well as providing a means of communicating personal vices ("Beer put me where I am today"), the t-shirt has also be come part of the wardrobe of protest, part of the uniform of the street demonstrator. As a sort of vestimentary placard, it en ables the community to be picketed, to remind it of important causes and deviant ideologies and to promote an oppositional point of view. The character of a community's politics can be from inferred from its t-shirts. Like political posters, the history of contemporary protest can be traced through t-shirts, and they provide an ideological almanac, recording victories and defeats, as well as ongoing causes. The Johbuster7 t-shirts, which were produced at the height of the SEQB dispute, are still worn by unionists, at Labor Day Marches, yet another example of the way t-shirts often translate popular culture into oppositional forms. Others show the links between causes, a reminder that solidarity rather than division is needed, that to think conserva tionally is to think peacefully. As one animal liberation t-shirt has it: "Animals are used to test weapons. Another reason for peace." Often t-shirts will draw parallels between the local and global politics. The Queensland Council for Civil Liberties has a t-shirt that suggests Brisbane is more like Moscow and Santiago than London and New York where the denial of basic rights is concerned. Being part of the street culture, such t-shirts add to the "market place of ideas," providing peripatetic reminders of the issues of the day, a consciousness raiser on the move. Though they might not be a particularly powerful weapon in the arsenal of subversion, t-shirts advocating illicit activities or pro mulgating an abhorred political view have been banned in South Africa and in some parts of Australia. A sixteen year old boy in Soweto was arrested and tortured for wearing a "Free Mandela" t-shirt. And in Queensland it is an offence to either wear or market t-shirts displaying crows getting "stoned" or the sun shining out of the former premier's posterior. Not all t-shirts are politically enlightened. Many reflect the sensibility of the bigot and are openly racist and sexist ("A number eleven is a girl who swallows it"), and promote an ag gressively nationalistic stance, depicting Australians ("If you're not an Aussie lie about it") as a superior race, particularly in the domains of sex, drink and sport. This was evident in many of the t-shirts which were produced at time of the America's Cup.</page><page sequence="12">98 Studies in Popular Culture Few ethnic groups escape t-shirt vituperation, though a number like the English and New Zealanders and most recently of all, the Asians, come in for special treatment. One especially taste less design shows an Australian on skis ("Ski the slopes"), mow ing down Asians. TAKING THE T-SHIRT SERIOUSLY Unlike most clothes which mumble and stammer their mes sages, the t-shirt "talks" directly to its audience. As we have seen, its motifs and designs are multifarious, covering everything from the deadly serious to the comic, from high art to the bawdy and obscene. Disparate themes are often amalgamated, establish ing, through perverse word play, connections between the objec tionable and the acceptable. As a garment, the t-shirt enables its wearer to more precisely put him or herself before the public eye, to communicate their proclivities and interests, fantasies and fears, desires and actions. It enables the private to become visi ble. But the t-shirt, because it recycles images from popular cul ture, because it reprocesses the language and slogans of our time, because it wants to be not just seen but also read, is one of those forms of ephemera like graffiti and cartoons, bumper stickers and badges—the folk poetry of the 1980s Smith has called them—that records much of the insecurity and anxiety that our society collectively feels. The t-shirt homily is a good guide to the late 1980s, to the range of sectarianism which exists in our society. Hitherto there has been a tendency to see individuals as being manipulated by the fashion industry, to regard them as mere clothes horses, donning the dogma of the chic. The t-shirt, perhaps more than any other garment, has transcended the dic tates of the fashion house, and represents a genuinely demotic mode of dress, offering a choice of messages and images of al most infinite variety. Through it, individuals can define them selves and present events of their autobiography. No other gar ment is so unambiguous in its communicative power, in offering commentaries about ourselves and about our times. Above all, it contains important messages about contemporary culture, about the contradictions which exist in that culture, about our aspira tions and fears. As such, it is a garment whose seriousness and non-seriousness demands to be taken seriously.</page><page sequence="13">Symes 99 Cultural and Policy Studies Group Department of Education Studies Kelvin Grove Campus Brisbane College of Advanced Education Kelvin Grove Q Australia 4059 NOTES 'One Sydney manufacturer of t-shirts, Hans van der Meulen, has pointed out that they are very much cheaper form of advertising than television, costing between $A6 and $A8 to produce, as against $A2,000 plus production costs for 30 seconds for a tele vision advertisement. See Burns (35) 2Similar counter-hegemonical tendencies are evident in graffiti, yarns, jokes, bawdy ballads, children's rhymes, satirical songs, all of which appropriate and refract jingles, advertisement slogans, television programmes. See McGregor (34) and Factor (210-212) for Australian examples. ^The Azaria Chamberlain case was one of the most important cases in Australian legal history. Baby Azaria was allegedly taken by a dingo at Ayers' Rock, in the Northern Territory, but her body was never found, and, as a consequence, Lindy, the baby's mother, and her husband, were charged with murdering the child. A number of court cases were held, the most notable being held in Darwin, and Lindy was eventu ally found guilty of murder, largely on the basis of forensic evidence, and served a jail sentence. The evidence was later brought into disrepute and all charges relating to Lindy dismissed. John Bryson's book Evil Angels, upon which the film is based, helped bring about a retrial. ^Throughout Australia, one thousand of such prints are sold per month. (See Burns, 33). In many respects these t-shirts could be said to have inherited the tradition of the dirty postcard, of the Donald McGill kind, which is additionally born out by the fact that such t-shirts sales are very high in holiday resorts and there are countless shops that sell no other merchandise in such resorts. 5For more on the relationship between the title and the titled, the caption and the captioned, and the subsumption of the one to the other, see Foucault (33) and on the theme of recursiveness in t-shirts, see Smith (141-149). For a more general discussion of the theme of pictura and poesis, and the "protracted struggle" between pictorial and linguistic signs in Western culture, Mitchell is particularly enlightening. '"Chunder" is an Australian colloquialism meaning to vomit, particularly after a drinking spree. It derives from, like many Australian colloquialisms, rhyming slang; and has been given modern currency by the Australian comedian, Barry Humphries, in his Bazza Mackenzie films (Wilkes). But the word has special significance on this t shirt because it replaces the word "thunder" in "Thunder Down Under", a television slogan for the Australia versus West Indies Cricket Test series. 7The "Joh" in "Johbuster" refers to Dr Sir Johnannes Bjelke-Petersen, former pre mier of the state of Queensland. An extreme conservative—Queensland is Australia's deep South—, who presided for twenty years over a corrupt and politicized police force, public service and judiciary, Petersen orchestrated an industrial conflict, purely for political purposes, involving South East Queensland Electricity Board (SEQB) workers. As with a similar situation in the U.S. involving Air Traffic Controllers, the dispute ended in the mass sacking of the power workers. The conflict was concurrent with the release of the Ghostbusters film in Australia.</page><page sequence="14">100 Studies in Popular Culture WORKS CITED Barthes, Roland System De La Mode.
