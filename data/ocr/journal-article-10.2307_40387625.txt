Stokes 3267 Cave Springs Ave., Bowling Green, KY 42104, USA ryan.stokes(2&gt;yale.edu Abstract In Dan 7:9-10, the apocalyptic seer narrates his vision of Gods heavenly throne. According to most scholars, Daniel's vision account depends literarily on the sup- posedly more primitive visionary traditions found in 1 Enoch 14 and the Book of Giants of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Certain divergences in these traditions, however, reveal that it is in fact / Enoch 14 that depends on a vision account much like that found in Dan 7. The Book of Giants and Daniel, on the other hand, both seem to make use of a common tradition, each adapting it in a different way. Keywords Book of Giants; Book of Watchers; Daniel; Enoch; Heavenly Court; Son of Man; Throne; Vision In Dan 7, the exiled sage Daniel receives a vision of four ferocious crea- tures. These hybrid beasts represent in apocalyptic fashion four kingdoms that wield dominion over the earth. Ultimately, however, judgment is passed in favor of a fifth figure, "one like a son of man," who represents the kingdom of the holy ones of the Most High. The climax of this vision is a judgment scene in which Daniel sees an Ancient of Days seated on his chariot-throne and surrounded by his heavenly retinue. In addition to affinities with the visions of Ezekiel, Daniel's account contains some nota- ble similarities to two extra-canonical throne visions. One of them is the vision of the antediluvian patriarch Enoch in / En. 14, and the other is the vision of the (also antediluvian) giant Ohyah in the Book of Giants discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls.

In recent discus- sions, several scholars have concluded that the visions of 1 Enoch and the Book of Giants represent more primitive forms of their respective traditions than does the throne vision of Dan 7:9-10. It will be demonstrated below, however, that there is good reason to suspect otherwise. Daniel 7 and 1 Enoch 14 The Book of Watchers (1 En. 1-36) expands the story found in Gen 6:1-4 of the "sons of God" who procreate with the "daughters of man." The "sons of God" in this Enochic pseudepigraphon are angelic beings called "Watchers," who are condemned for their illicit sexual activity with human women. In chs. 12-16, these transgressing angels ask Enoch to petition the Most High on their behalf. It is at this point in the story that God com- missions the patriarch to pronounce judgment on the sinful angels.1 The mode of this prophetic commission is a dream, in which Enoch ascends into the heavenly temple and arrives at its innermost chamber where the Great Glory sits enthroned. Dan 7:9-10 lEn. l4:18-232 And I watched Until thrones were set up, and the Ancient of Days sat. His clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like lamb's wool. His throne was [like] flames of fire; its wheels were [like] burning fire. A river of fire flowed, and went out from before him. And I was looking, And I saw a lofty throne; and its appearance was like ice; and its wheels were like the shining sun; and its &lt;guardians&gt; were cherubim; and from beneath the throne issued streams of flaming fire. And I was unable to see. And the Great Glory sat upon it; 1 On 1 En. 14 as a prophetic commission, see George W. E.

Dan 7:9-10 lEn. 14:18-23 A thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand ten thousands stood before him. The court sat, and books were opened. his raiment was like the appearance of the sun and whiter than much snow. And no angel could enter into this house and behold his face because of the splendor and glory; and no flesh could behold him. Flaming fire encircled him, and a great fire stood by him; and none of those about him approached him. Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; but he needed no counselor; his every word was deed; And the holy ones of the watchers who approached him did not depart by night, nor &lt;by day&gt; did they leave him. Scholars have long recognized that there is a literary relationship between the visions of 1 En. 14 and Dan 7. Striking resemblances between the two include the deity's white clothing, the river(s) of fire, and the "ten thou- sand times ten thousand" attendants, none of which is mentioned in the earlier biblical throne-vision traditions. While the visionaries who com- posed these passages almost certainly had access to and made use of the similar descriptions of God's throne found in Ezekiel, the resemblances between Dan 7:9-10 and 1 En. 14:18-23 are significant enough for most scholars to conclude that one of them is dependent on the other. Or at least, according to these scholars, they both depend on a common tradi- tion. When it comes to deciding which of these works contains the more primitive form of the tradition, however, there is no consensus. R.H. Charles, a pioneer in the study of Old Testament pseudepigrapha and apocalyptic literature, held that the Enochic passage depended on Dan 7:9- 10.3 Unfortunately, he did not share his reasons for this view. 3 R. H. Charles, The Book of Enoch or 1 Enoch (London: Oxford, 1912), 34.</page><page sequence="4">R. E. Stokes I Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 343 And, as Matthew Black observes, Charles appears to have been a little inconsistent on this matter, since he elsewhere expresses the opinion that chs. 6-36 of 1 Enoch are to be dated before Daniel.4 J.A. Emerton took a more skeptical stance, arguing that these visions were not as similar as scholars thought.5 In fact, Emerton claimed, they only appeared so similar when one ignored the differences between the two. In his analysis, these two traditions developed completely independently, and any similarity between the two was coincidental. Emerton's arguments did not sway the guild. T. Francis Glasson adopted Charles' dating of 1 En. 6-36 to the pre- Maccabean period and contended that Dan 7 relied on the Enochic vision.6 Assuming that there was a direct relationship between the two, Glasson concluded that the later work must have depended on the earlier. D.S. Russell, who regarded Charles' dating of 1 En. 6-36 with a little more suspicion, was agnostic with regard to the direction of dependence between 1 En. 14 and Dan 77 He also recognized the possibility that both works drew from a common source. Pierre Grelot was the first to enter the discussion following the publication of the Qumran fragments of 1 Enoch by J.T. Milik.8 Although Milik had conclusively demonstrated that the Book ofWatchers was written in the pre- Maccabean period, this newfound confidence in the relative dating of the two works did not settle the dispute.9 Russell had earlier raised the possi- bility that both works rely on a common source, so it was not out of the question that Daniel, now regarded as the later work, might reflect a more 4 Charles, The Book of Enoch, Hi; Matthew Black, The Book of Enoch or I Enoch: A New English Edition (Leiden: Brill, 1985), 151. 5 J.

E. Stokes I Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 primitive version of the throne tradition. Grelots analysis leads him to the conclusion that the vision of 1 En. 14 is an original composition. "En dépit du caractère anthologique de son imagerie, sa composition d'ensemble et son vocabulaire lui donnent toutes les apparences d'une composition originale."10 Daniel 7:9-10, conversely, according to Grelot, has an allusive nature which reveals its knowledge of the tradition found in the Book of Watchers. Helge Kvanvig, likewise, considers the vision of 1 En. 14 to be the more primitive of the two, though for different reasons from those of Grelot.11 According to Kvanvig, 1 En. 14 is more closely akin to Ezekiel's vision than is Dan 7. Therefore, Daniel is more likely to have relied on 1 Enoch than 1 Enoch on the Danielic vision. The Enochic vision, moreover, in Kvanvig's estimation, can be explained as a combination of the throne-vision tradi- tion of Ezekiel and the Gen 5 tradition of Enochs rapture. Matthew Black, more tentatively, suggests that Daniel is abridging or adapting phrases from 1 Enoch. Ultimately, however, Black concludes, "Perhaps the hypothesis of a common literary archetypal apocalypse is the least unsatisfactory solution of the problem."12 Unconvinced by arguments for the priority of the Eno- chic version, John J. Collins admits that Dan 7:9-10 may depend directly on 1 En. 14, but he also avers that, if Dan 7:9-10 is cited from an earlier source, it is impossible to establish which is the more primitive form.13 George W.E. Nickelsburg, similarly, notes that these two texts share unique parallels and acknowledges Kvanvig's argument that Dan 7 depends on 1 En. 14, but Nickelsburg does not himself express preference for one view or another.14 As the discussion currently stands, scholars are divided between the opinion that Dan 7 contains the later form of the tradition and the opinion that one cannot decide one way or another based on the information now available.15 No one since the publication of the Qumran 10 Grelot, "Daniel VII, 9-10 et le Livre d'Hénoch," 76. 1 1 Kvanvig, "Henoch und der Menschensohn," 1 1 4-3 1 ; idem, Roots of Apocalyptic: The Mesopotamian Background of the Enoch Figure and of the Son of Man (WMANT 61; Neukirchen- Vluyn: Neukirchener, 1988), 560-64. 12 Black, The Book of Enoch, 151-52. 13 John J. Collins, Daniel (Hermeneia; Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1993), 299-300. 14 Nickelsburg, 1 Enoch 1, 254. 15 It should probably be added that Loren T. Stuckenbruck ("Daniel and Early Enoch Traditions in the Dead Sea Scrolls," in The Book of Daniel: Composition and</page><page sequence="6">R E. Stokes I Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 345 fragments (to my knowledge) has argued that Daniel contains the more primitive form of the vision, and the majority prefers to see it as later than its Enochic counterpart. In evaluating the various possibilities with regard to the relationship between the two visions, one finds the arguments offered in favor of Eno- chic priority to be rather flimsy. Grelot cites a number of differences between the two visions for which the author of Daniel is supposed to be responsible. For example, the author of Dan 7 is supposed to have added the notion of a heavenly tribunal absent in 1 En. 14 to the vision.16 But Grelot never adequately demonstrates why Daniel's version must be that which has been modified rather than that of the Book ofWatchers.17 Kvanvig's observation that Enoch's vision more closely resembles Ezekiel's than does Daniel's proves nothing with regard to the direction of dependency. It merely demonstrates the likelihood that the author of the 1 Enoch account had access to Ezekiel independently of the Danielic vision. It is possible that the Enochic tradition makes use both of the tradition found in Dan 7:9-10 and that of Ezekiel.18 And, granted, Enochs journey to heaven Reception [ed. John J. Collins and Peter W. Flint; Boston: Brill, 2002], 2.368-86 at 384 argues that the vision of 1 En. 14, along with Ezek 1, was of formative importance for the author of Dan 7. 16 Grelot, "Daniel VII, 9-10 et le livre d'Hénoch," 78-79. 17 The same may be said of Black's comparison of the traditions. Black {The Book of Enoch, 1 5 1-52) argues, "At v. 20 the expression in Daniel, 'his raiment was white like snow' looks like a shorter form of the fuller line in Enoch (which does not lack poetic quality): 'his raiment was brighter than the sun and whiter than any snow.' Similarly 'the river of fire' in Enoch comes forth 'from under the throne' which seems more natural than Daniel's '. . . streamed and came forth from before him.' (Was this an editorial attempt to turn attention away from the throne to its occupant?)." Black does not offer any evidence that Daniel is abridging a longer tradition, other than the fact that Daniel's version is shorter and that the Enochic version "does not lack poetic quality." What would lead one to conclude that Daniel is abridging a longer tradition rather than 1 Enoch expanding a shorter one? Black's suggestion that Daniel may be directing attention to the enthroned individual rather than the throne itself is incredibly speculative. 18 For example, the fact that the visions of Enoch and Ezekiel may both be classified as prophetic commissions does not exclude the possibility that the author of 1 En. 14 made use of the judgment scene in Dan 7, placing that throne vision in a passage whose Gattung more closely resembles Ezek 1-2.</page><page sequence="7">346 R. E. Stokes I Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 has a basis in earlier tradition (e.g., Gen 5:24), but so does the figure who comes with the clouds of heaven in Dan 7 (e.g., Deut 33:26; Ps 68:5; 104:3; CTAlA.ll).19 An agnostic view, as other scholars hold, is understandable given the nature of the arguments that have been offered in favor of Enochic prior- ity. But neither is this more cautious position the best option. Rather, there are some pieces of the puzzle that have yet to be appreciated by scholars. And these pieces, when fitted together, tip the scale in favor of the Dan 7 tradition as the earlier of the two. Interestingly, we will take our cue from Emerton, who argued that only by ignoring the differences between the two visions can one conclude that they are related.20 We will take Emerton up on his challenge and conclude that, on the contrary, certain divergences in these two traditions call even more attention to their relationship. Of course, it is at times difficult to interpret the differences between two related texts. Enough similarity between traditions may evince some sort of a relationship, but their differences may or may not be significant. An author may adapt a tradition merely for personal stylistic preferences with no theological agenda whatsoever. But if certain divergences in one text may be easily explained based on the agenda of its author, especially if this agenda is observable elsewhere in the work, then this text is more likely to be the one making use of the other. Let us begin by looking at some ways in which the Dan 7 throne vision differs from that of 1 En. 14. and the Ancient of Days sat. His clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like lamb's wool (Dan 7:9). And the Great Glory sat upon it; his raiment was like the appearance of the sun and whiter than much snow. And no angel could enter into this house and behold his face because of the splendor and glory; and no flesh could behold him (7 En. 14: 20-21) 19 See Collins, Daniel, 280-94, for a discussion of the religio-historical background of Dan 7. 20 Emerton, "The Origin of the Son of Man Imagery," 229-30.</page><page sequence="8">R. E. Stokes I Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 347 Once Daniel has told us that the Ancient of Days is seated, he informs us that this figures clothing is white. Daniel then goes on to mention the appearance of this individuals hair, "like lambs wool" (7:9). Similarly, in 1 En. 14, the patriarch tells us that God is seated on the throne and then mentions the enthroned figures white clothing (14:20). Enoch does not, however, continue with a description of the individuals hair. But neither is he silent on the matter of the deity's appearance. Rather, Enoch proceeds to assert that no one is able to behold the deity's face on account of his splendor and glory (14:21). The depiction of God's clothing as white, as mentioned above, is unique to these two works. That both of these tradi- tions mention in the same order God's being seated, his white clothing, and either the deity's hair or face reinforces the conclusion that there is a close relationship between these traditions. Enoch's claim that no human can see God's face, of course, has its bibli- cal antecedents in Exod 33, Judg 13, and Isa 6, though it is a little odd in this vision where the patriarch seems otherwise to have a pretty good view of the deity.21 Likewise, Enoch's attention to God's glory is probably not unrelated to Ezekiel's attention to the same (Ezek 1:28), though Ezekiel does not appear to have as much trouble seeing God as he does describing what he sees. Daniel's vision also has its ancient antecedents in the Canaan- ite tradition of a hoary El.22 But it is much less likely that Daniel would replace the glorious God, upon whom neither humans nor angels can cast their gaze, with the superbly anthropomorphic gray-haired old man. One would expect, on the other hand, an ancient Jewish author to alter Daniel's vision according to the biblical tradition that one cannot see God. Enoch's language of God's glory also accords very well with the patriarch's ascent into the heavenly temple, so it would fit the Enochic editors agenda to alter the description of the deity at this point. Why Daniel would modify the tradition so as to emphasize the enthroned figure's age is not so easily explained. Certainly related to the contrary depictions of God's appear- ance in 1 Enoch and Daniel are the respective appellations these two vision accounts give the deity. In Dan 7:9, the one who occupies the throne is 21 Although Enoch prefaces his description of the enthroned figure with the claim that he could not see (14: 19b), it is apparently only the deity s face that gives him difficulty. 22 E.g., CTA 4.5.66.</page><page sequence="9">348 R. E. Stokes I Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 called "Ancient of Days." But in 1 En. 14:20, it is the "Great Glory" who sits. For Enoch, the enthroned deity is not an elderly gentleman, but the Glory of the heavenly temple, upon whose face no human may look.23 Another divergence in these accounts corroborates the view that the Enochic tradition reflects a development ofthat found in Dan 7. ten thousand ten thousands stood before him. The court sat and books were opened (Dan 7:10) Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; but he needed no counselor; his every word was deed (1 En. 14:22b); In Dan 7:10 and 1 En. 14:22, we read about the enthroned deity that "ten thousand ten thousands stood before him." Immediately following this statement in Daniel, we read that the court sat. The heavenly tribunal convenes. Immediately after mentioning the ten thousand ten thousands in 14:22, Enoch does not tell us that a heavenly assembly sits. But, once again, neither is the patriarch silent on the matter. Instead, he continues, "but he [the Great Glory] needed no counselor; his every word was deed."24 Enoch clarifies the nature of the relationship between the deity 23 Kvanvig ("Henoch und der Menschensohn," 121, 126; Roots of Apocalyptic, 562-63) attempts to explain "the Great Glory" (ή δόξα ή μεγάλη) as a translation of the Aramaic ΚΠ1Ί ΝΓΤΙ2Ί. But this rétroversion does not explain why the Danielic redactor would alter this form to poi* pTiy, as Kvanvigs hypothesis requires. A more likely, yet uncertain, rétroversion is NX1 *Hp' Cf. for this term Menahem Kister, "Notes on Some New Texts from Qumran," JJS 44 (1993): 280-90 at 286. 24 This verse poses a bit of a text critical problem. The Greek tradition contains only the second of the two statements, "his every word was deed." The Ethiopie tradition, however, contains only the first, "but he needed no counselor." Charles {The Book of Enoch, 34-35) and Nickelsburg (1 Enoch 7, 258) suggest that an earlier version of the verse contained both statements and adduce 2 En. 33:4, which seems to rely on this passage and contains both statements, as evidence. This is the best available solution to the problem with this text, though absolute certainty is impossible. That these two statements are placed in parallelism in 2 En. 33:4 may indicate that the difference in their meanings is not all that great. The Ethiopie tradition is concerned that God acts alone in passing judgment,</page><page sequence="10">R E. Stokes I Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 349 and his attendants. The hosts gathered about the throne in Enoch's vision have no say in divine policy, they are merely servants. The idea that God need not confer with a board of advisors is not an innovation of 1 Enoch (e.g., Isa 40:13-14). But it must be more than coincidental that this state- ment occurs precisely at that point in the Enochic vision that corresponds to Daniels reference to the heavenly tribunal. The reason this editor felt it necessary to adapt the tradition at this point is not clear. Nickelsburg notes the parallelism between the bicola of vs. 22.25 Flaming fire encircled him, and a great fire stood by him; and none of those about him approached him. Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; but he needed no counselor; his every word was deed; Perhaps the lack of a heavenly council related to God s unapproachability in the heavenly holy of holies. Although there is no questioning the fact that the Ancient of Days heads the panel of justices in Dan 7, it is also possible that the Enochic editor was uncomfortable with the perception of God as merely the chief justice of a heavenly court rather than the sole arbiter of divine judgment. In any case, there can be little doubt that it is the Enochic version rather than the Danielic one that has made the edito- rial move in this instance.26 Were we to broaden the scope of this analysis to include Dan 7:13-14, would that throw any light on the relationship of the two visions? In Dan 7:13, "one like a son of man" comes with the clouds of heaven. He approaches the Ancient of Days and is presented before him (pTip *rpi Tlimpn Tn/TTpl Πυη WUT1). If Enoch's vision contains a character that and it is probable that this was the concern of 1 En. 14:22 from the time of its composition. 25 Nickelsburg, 1 Enoch 7, 265. 26 In the throne visions of Isa 6 and 1 Kgs 22:19-22 (// 2 Chr 18:18-21), the deity seeks volunteers for special tasks from among those who stand around the throne. In Job 1:6-12 and 2:1-6, "the satan" obliges himself to challenge God's high opinion of Job. The imagery of Dan 7 goes a little further than the other throne visions of the Hebrew Bible in speaking of a seated heavenly court which renders judgment alongside of the deity.</page><page sequence="11">350 RE. Stokes I Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 corresponds to Daniels human-like figure, it would be the patriarch himself.27 Enoch reports, Behold, clouds in the vision were summoning me, and mists were crying out to me; and shooting stars and lightning flashes were hastening me and speeding me along; and winds in my vision made me fly up and lifted me upward and brought me to heaven (14:8). But as Enoch approaches the throne room, he learns that no one is able to draw near (Gk. έγγιζειν; Eth. qarba) the deity (14:22).28 Enoch does not appear to be an exception to this rule. An angel takes him as far as the door of the throne room, but Enoch does not seem to enter.29 And the Lord called me with his mouth and said to me, "Come here, Enoch, and hear my word(s)." And one of the holy ones came to me and raised me up and stood me (on my feet) and brought me up to the door. But I had my face bowed down (14:24-25). / Enoch's language of approaching or not approaching God reflects the biblical language of priestly temple service.30 But it may also be relevant that out of all the biblical throne visions only Dan 7 contains the root 2Ίρ. This parallel does not, of course, establish with any certainty that the source underlying 1 En. 14 contained a "son of man" figure. But it is pos- sible, and if so, Enoch has taken his place.31 Although Enoch does not "come with" the clouds in this vision, he is summoned by them and car- ried to heaven by the wind. But he does not approach the enthroned God 27 Glasson ("The Son of Man Imagery," 82-83) also suggests that Enoch and the "one like a son of man" occupy parallel positions in the visions of Enoch and Daniel respectively. 28 The passage is a little ambiguous at this point, since the next verse mentions (a special group of) angels who do approach the deity. 29 Nickelsburg, 1 Enoch, 270. 30 Martha Himmelfarb, Ascent to Heaven in Jewish and Christian Apocalypses (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 20. 31 Grelot ("Daniel VII, 9-10 et le livre d'Hénoch," 76) claims that the "son of man" has no parallel in the Book ofWatchers. He is correct that there is no individual in the Enochic vision that corresponds exactly to the Danielic son of man, but the parallels between the patriarch and this figure are close enough to raise the possibility that Enoch has taken the son of man's place.</page><page sequence="12">R E. Stokes I Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 35 1 as does the son of man, because it is impossible for a human to enter God's glorious presence. To be fair, Enoch's role in his vision as the recip- ient of a prophetic commission is not derived from the Danielic "son of man," but certain points of contact between the depictions of these two figures may reveal an awareness of a "son of man" tradition on the part of the Enochic author. When one compares how 1 En. 14:18-23 and Dan 7:9-10 deal with the deity's appearance and how they deal with the idea of a heavenly court, it appears probable that 1 Enoch depends on an account very similar to the Daniel passage. The cumulative weight of these two comparisons is hard to deny. The Enochic version of the tradition has replaced the Ancient of Days with the Great Glory of the heavenly temple. This deity does not have the appearance of an aging man, but is too glorious for human cyts. Neither does this God surround himself with counselors as in the more primitive form of the tradition, but he confers only with himself when rendering judgment. It may also be that the later Enochic tradition has replaced the one like a son of man who approaches the throne to receive dominion with a more fearful and humble Enoch who is unable to draw near to God or even to lift his own head to look upon the seated deity. Whether this is the case, it is very likely that 1 En. 14 has adapted the throne-vision judgment scene preserved in Dan 7 to a new context as part of a prophetic commissioning of Enoch which takes place in the heavenly temple. Daniel 7 and the Book of Giants The Aramaic Book of Giants builds on the story of the rebellious Watchers found in 1 En. 6-16, expanding it with information concerning the sinful angels' gigantic offspring. These propagators of violence on the earth, who remain anonymous in the Book of Watchers, are given names in this work. The Giants also receive dreams, which warn these sinful half-breeds of their fate. Unable to arrive at interpretations of these divine messages, they send one of their fellows to visit the revered antediluvian patriarch Enoch. Enoch is able to provide them with interpretations of the dreams which foretell their destruction. A certain one of these Giants named Ohyah receives one of the dream visions. This vision is not of heaven. Instead, the Ruler of the Heavens descends to the earth where thrones are erected.</page><page sequence="13">352 R E.

Stokes I Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 353 of the Qumran fragments of the Book of Giants, Milik remarked that the vision of Ohyah in this work is based on Dan 7:9-1 0.34 But once the Book of Giants fragments were made available to the public, this view ran into prob- lems. While Stuckenbruck does not deny that the two visions are related to each other, he argues that the relationship between the two is different from that presumed by Milik.35 Daniels vision contains material that Ohyah's does not: a description of the throne and the seated figure and material about the "son of man." While it is not impossible that the Book of Giants omitted the material found in Daniel, Stuckenbruck contends, this scenario is less likely than one in which Daniel elaborated on the tradition as it is found in the Book of Giants. Also, both Stuckenbruck and Puech restore *7D ("all") at the beginning of line 18 based on the presence of a partially visi- ble b, which excludes the reading ρΐΊ ΠΊ, ten thousand ten thousands.36 In the Book of Giants, therefore, there are hundreds and thousands gath- ered about the throne, whereas in Daniel there are thousands and tens of thousands. Numbers are more likely to be exaggerated than diminished, Stuckenbruck reasons, so it appears that Daniel contains the more devel- oped form of the vision. The Book of Giants, on the other hand, is more likely to preserve the more primitive form of the vision. Emile Puech con- curs with Stuckenbruck's assessment, as does Esther Eshel who also allows for the possibility that Dan 7 relied directly on the Book of Giants.07 Stuckenbruck is certainly correct that Milik's position on the relation- ship between the two visions is not without its problems. The issues that Stuckenbruck raises must be addressed in any analysis of this relationship. Qumran Fifty Years After (ed. Stanley E. Porter and Craig A.

Stokes I Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 But there are some other issues relevant to this discussion which Stucken- bruck does not address. The first is the observation that Ohyah's vision contains three cola describing the enthroned figure's attendants, whereas Daniel's account contains only two. While this fact is interesting in and of itself, it becomes especially significant when these lines are compared to the corresponding lines of Daniel's vision. A thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand ten thousands stood before him. The court sat, and books were opened. [A hundred hun]dreds were serving him, a thousand thousands [were worshiping] him. [Al]l[ w]ere standing before him, and, behold [, bo]oks were opened. Here the Book of Giants version of the vision modifies a component of the vision as it appears in Daniel. As does the tradition of 1 En. 14, the Book of Giants judgment scene removes any notion of a seated heavenly court. Where Daniel's vision says that the court sat, 'Ohyah's speaks only of peo- ple standing about the deity. If Stuckenbruck' and Puech's restoration of *7D to the beginning of line 18 is correct, as it seems to be, the editorial move becomes even more clear.38 In Ohyah's vision of the divine throne, none of those about it sit; all stand. That such a revision has taken place is further supported by the fact that plural "thrones" are set up in line 17. In Dan 7, these thrones seem to be occupied by the court that sits in verse 10. In the Book of Giants, only the Great Holy One sits, leaving the plurality of thrones unexplained. This discrepancy is best accounted for by supposing that the plurality of thrones is a remnant of an earlier version of the tradition in which the divine tribunal also sits. The implication of this observation is that one cannot claim simply that the Book of Giants contains a more primitive form of the vision than does Daniel. In at least this one instance, this Enochic work has altered the tradition preserved in Daniel. Furthermore, by nearly all accounts the Book of Giants postdates and relies on the Enochic Book of Watchers Ρ If the form of the tradition attested 38 This restoration is very likely to be correct, based on a partially visible hmed, the context, and the amount of space available. 39 Milik, The Books of Enoch, 57-58; Klaus Beyer, Die aramäischen Texte vom Toten Meer (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1984), 258-59; Florentino</page><page sequence="16">R E. Stokes / Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 355 in Dan 7, with its depiction of the deity, the throne, and the tens of thou- sands of attendants, came to be prior to the composition of 1 En. 14, as we suggested above, this form of the tradition may also predate the Book of Giants. The fact that the Danielic form of the tradition may well predate not only the Book of Giants ; but also one of its supposed sources, and the fact that in at least one instance the Book of Giants tweaks the tradition as found in Daniel raise afresh the possibility that the Book of Giants relies on the version of the throne vision attested in Dan 7. If one wishes to maintain that the Book of Giants relied on a throne vision like that in Dan 7, one must explain the components of the Danielic vision that are missing in the Book of Giants. Stuckenbruck explains these components of Dan 7 as secondary accretions to a vision like that found in the Book of Giants which are drawn from 1 En. 14. In light of our analysis of 1 En. 14 and its relationship to Daniel's vision, however, this explana- tion of how the tradition developed must be modified, the Dan 7:9-10 version being prior to that of 1 En. 14. The source of this additional mate- rial in Dan 7 notwithstanding, how likely is this material to be secondary to an earlier tradition as some scholars suppose? For instance, the material concerning the "one like a son of man" in Daniel is not found in 'Ohyah's vision. But this material is not necessarily a later development. It could just as easily have been omitted by an editor for whose work it was irrelevant. One can also account for the absence of a description of the enthroned figure in the Book of Giants. In Enoch's vision in the Book of Watchers, we have already observed a reluctance to describe the deity's appearance. A similar tendency would explain the absence of this description from the Book of Giants. AQ The absence of a description of the throne and the river of fire in Ohyah's vision are a little more difficult to explain, though the river of fire might have been incompatible with the terrestrial setting of Ohyahs vision. The "hundreds and thousands" of attendants seen by Ohyah, as opposed to Daniel's "thousands and tens of thousands" is the García Martínez, Qumran and Apocalyptic: Studies on the Aramaic Texts from Qumran (STDJ 9; Leiden: Brill, 1992), 113-15; J.

E. Stokes I Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 most difficult divergence to account for if the Book of Giants relied on a vision identical to Dan 7:9-10. Given that certain elements of the Book of Giants vision, especially the numbers of attendants, are not easily explained if we presume that this vision was derived from the Danielic form of the vision, perhaps it is best to conclude that both of these passages draw from a common tradition, each developing this tradition in its own way. But one cannot claim simply that the account of Dan 7:9-10 is more devel- oped than that of 4Q530 2 ii 17-18, since Ohyah's vision has eliminated the heavenly tribunal found in Dan 7. Conclusions 1 Enoch 14 and the Qumran Book of Giants describe visions of the divine throne in ways so similar to Dan 7:9-10 that there must be some literary relationship between the biblical vision and its extra-biblical counterparts. Despite arguments to the contrary, a good case can be made that the ver- sion of this tradition in Book ofWatchers depends on a vision account much like that found in Dan 7:9-10. Ohyah's vision in the Book of Giants is also more developed than Dan 7:9-10 in at least one regard, but Ohyah's account may also preserve some more primitive elements of the tradition. The primary smoking gun that gives away the direction of these relation- ships is the fact that certain statements in 1 En. 14 and the Book of Giants seem to respond to the corresponding statements in the Danielic vision. With the Book of Giants, the relationship, however, is a little more com- plex, since the evidence appears to point in both directions. At this point, we are in a position to offer one additional argument that 1 En. 14 depends on the Dan 7 version of the tradition. The formulation "X number times X number" with reference to the divine court is unique to the three throne visions we have considered, as is the statement that the deity's attendants "stood before him."41 If Dan 7:9-10 develops and combines the traditions found in 1 En. 14 and the Book of Giants, then one would have to presume that the Book of Giants and 1 En. 14 arrived at this description of the heavenly multitude independently. Either that, or they would have both had to depend on a hypothesized common source for which there is no other evidence. It is unlikely that either of these vision 41 Later works pick up this language from Daniel (e.g., Rev 5:1 1).</page><page sequence="18">R Ξ. Stokes I Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 357 accounts made direct use of the other.42 But if one posits that 1 En. 14 depended on Daniels version of the throne tradition, one can easily account for the similar expressions in 1 En. 14 and the Book of Giants. This observation contributes to the cumulative force of the arguments pertaining to the relationship between 1 En. 14 and Dan 7 above. To the implications of these arguments we now turn. Among the ancient fragments discovered in the caves near Qumran was a copy of the Book of Watchers dated by Milik to the first half of the second c. B.C.E.43 According to Milik, this was not the work's manuscript, but a copy of an even earlier document, dated to the third c. B.C.E.44 Moreover, certain components of this composite work may derive from a much earlier period. Nickelsburg, for instance, dates 1 En. 12-16 between 300 and 250 B.C.E.45 While assigning a date to these chapters of the Book of Watchers much before the late third c. B.C.E. requires some speculation, one may on the basis of Milik's paleographical work very conservatively postulate a late third c. B.C.E. terminus ad quern for these chapters. This latest possible date of composition would apply as well for the sources on which these chapters rely, which, we have argued, included a throne vision tradition much like that found in Dan 7:9-10. It is possible, though not certain, that the "son of man" material also belonged to the tradition by this time. The appropriation of this tradition or a similar one by the Book ofWatch- ers and the Book of Giants may give us insight into the throne speculation of the Second Temple period. First, it is interesting that both of these tradi- tions have removed any notion of a heavenly tribunal from the vision. Whether or not one of these two traditions has influenced the other, they both deal with the issue in different ways. 1 Enoch makes the statement that God does not need any counselor, while the Book of Giants has the divine entourage remain standing as judgment is rendered. Second, the Book of Watchers account probably also removed a reference to the deity's appearance. The author of the vision as it appears in the Book of Giants 42 If the Book of Watchers is older than the Book of Giants, as scholars agree, then dependence of the former on the latter is excluded. Since it is unlikely that the author of 'Ohyah's vision account would have diminished the number of attendants found in the source before him, dependence of the Book of Giants on 1 En. 14 is likewise improbable. 43 Milik, The Books of Enoch, 24-25. 44 Ibid., 141. 45 Nickelsburg, 1 Enoch 7, 230.</page><page sequence="19">358 Κ Ε. Stokes I Dead Sea Discoveries 15 (2008) 340-358 may have likewise edited the tradition, though this is much less certain. Rowland identifies an increasing tendency among apocalyptic writers of this period to avoid anthropomorphic depictions of the deity.46 Perhaps, the refusal of 1 En. 14 (and the Book ofGiantsi) to mention the deity's appear- ance reflects this tendency. Third, it may be that the tradition behind 1 En. 14 contained the "one like a son of man." If so, then the substitution of Enoch for this figure may have been the first step toward the full-fledged and well-documented identification of the patriarch with the "son of man" found in the later Enochic Book of Parables. Even if the "son of man" did not appear in the tradition before the Enochic editor, the fact that the patriarch occupies a place in his throne vision corresponding to that of the "son of man" in the closely related vision of Daniel may have contributed to the two figures' association in later tradition. It would have certainly been conducive to such an association. Finally, scholars have suggested that the author of the Book of Giants made use of the Book of Watchers as one of his sources.47 If this is correct, then it appears that he bypassed the throne vision of the latter in composing 'Ohyah's vision and relied instead on an even earlier version of the tradition, one which more closely resembles Dan 7:9-10. Of course, it is not certain that the Book of Watchers was in fact a source of the Book of Giants. It is possible that the author of the Book of Giants had access to some of the same traditions as found in the Book of Watchers by way of another source. The fact that the Book of Giants relies on an earlier version of the throne vision does not necessarily favor one of these scenarios above the other. The vision of the heavenly temple in 1 En. 14 would have been inappropriate for Ohyah's advent vision, so another throne vision would have been desir- able to the Book of Giants author. We know of at least one earlier and more suitable version of this vision that was available long after the Book of Watchers was written, and it is found in Dan 7. 46 Christopher Rowland, "The Visions of God in Apocalyptic Literature," JSJ 10 (1979): 137-54. Himmelfarb {Ascent to Heaven, 16) says of the vision in 1 En. 14 that it is not God himself, but his clothing that is described. 47 See the bibliography in n. 39.</page></plain_text>
