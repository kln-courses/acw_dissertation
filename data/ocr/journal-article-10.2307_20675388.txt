<plain_text><page sequence="1">LUCRETIUS IN THE APOLOGIE DE RAIMOND SEBOND The function of the Latin quotations in the Essais has received relatively little attention since the initial research of Villey.1 Critics have tended to evaluate the influence of a classical author on Mon taigne's thought by the number of citations in the text, without devoting sufficient attention to the individual contexts in which they appear. It is clear, however, that each citation plays an active part in the text as it was conceived by Montaigne. In fact an examination of the Lucretius citations in the Apologie de Raimond Sebond reveals interesting results which tend to suggest that the critic should be looking for a different kind of relationship between Montaigne and what we have come to call his classical sources than that which has hitherto been assumed to exist. The problem of the role played by Lucretius in the formation of the Essais is a complex one for many reasons. 2 In particular the question of Montaigne's religion is involved, and such fundamental issues as the immortality of the soul, and Epicureanism in general cannot be ignored when one is dealing with these authors. In these pages I wish to confine myself to a study of the citations alone, leaving aside such imponderables as the historical role of Lucretius in the formation of Montaigne's philosophy or moral outlook. Evidence is not lacking for a study of the text, for Montaigne quotes Lucretius textually seventy-six times in the course of the Apologie. Little wonder, then, that Villey was led to believe that Lucretius had con tributed to the logical development of the essay.3 As one studies the Lucretian citations in the Apologie, one soon notices the consistency with which Montaigne quotes the De Rerum Natura out of context, particularly when both authors are dealing with specific philosophical problems. Such disregard for the original context of a citation is typical of Renaissance writers, and Mon taigne is certainly no exception. But it is remarkable how often the Lucretius citations contradict the ideas they formerly expressed. Such a pattern of apparently deliberate misquotation leads one to conclude that Montaigne is anxious to destroy the reader's faith in Epicurean doctrine in a systematic though extremely subtle way. Of course this is not the final aim of the essay, but simply a stepping stone towards the destruction of our respect for all rationalist philo sophy. For the purpose of this study, the Apologie can be divided into six unequal parts : 1 There is only one general work : Michael Metschies, Zitat und Zitierkunst in Montaignes Essais, Geneva, 1966.

The other divisions are arbitrary, and the grouping of citations from Lucretius in them would seem to be largely fortuitous. The majority of the twenty-nine citations included in 1, 2 and 5 were present in A ; many of them appear in the section on man and the animals, where they serve to embellish the French text with their blend of conciseness, imagery and elegance which only Latin poetry can produce. There is no sustained argument in which the De Rerum Natura is used as a point of reference, although some topics, such as war, physical love or the gradual decay of civilisation occur with some regularity. When we consider the total number of Lucretius citations in the Apologie, the distribution of citations in the successive editions is interesting : 1580: 29 citations 1582: 1 citation 1588: 45 citations 1595 : 1 citation Although a large number was present from the start, almost twice as many were later added. Furthermore, if we consider only the three passages in which Lucretius is quoted most frequently (3, 4 and 6), the results are even more interesting. Of the forty-seven citations in these sections, thirteen are from 1580 and thirty-three from 1588, the remaining one being a C addition. There is a clear pattern of a vast increase in the number of borrowings from Lucretius between 1580 and 1588 in those passages where the overall subject matter seems to coincide. The quotations do not add anything to the sub stance of the argument which always remains complete without them. What they do add, with few exceptions, is colour, imagery and a type of backboard on which the echoes of the French text resound, so that there is constant interaction between the citation and its context. This last point is essential, for the citations added in 1588 are not only integrated into Montaigne's own text, they also influence the tone of the passages in which they occur. The manner in which this subtle change of atmosphere is achieved gives us an insight into Mon taigne's relationship with the De Rerum Natura. Montaigne's total disregard for the original context of his citations can best be seen if we consider consecutive lines from the poem of Lucretius, quoted in separate parts of the Apologie. Lucretius V. 121 appears on page 479 of Montaigne's essay; the two following lines (V. 122-123) are cited some twenty pages later.6 4 References are to the uvres Compl?tes, ?d. Thibaudet and Rat, (Biblioth?que de la Pl?iade), Paris, 1963. 5 For stimulating comments on this type of cross-reference by means of citations, see Michel Butor, Essais sur les Essais, Gallimard, 1968, pp. 117-119.</page><page sequence="3">NOTES ET DOCUMENTS 459 The first of these quotations is used by Montaigne to reinforce his castigation of those who conceive of an anthropomorphic God. The line must be read in its new context : (a) Nous disons bien puissance, v?rit?, justice : ce sont paroles qui signifient quelque chose de grand ; mais cette chose l?, nous ne la voyons aucunement, ny ne la concevons, (b) Nous disons que Dieu craint, que Dieu se courrouce, que Dieu ayme, Immortalia mortali sermone notantes ; ce sont toutes agitations et ?motions qui ne peuvent loger en Dieu selon nostre forme ; ny nous, l'imaginer selon la sienne. The Latin text is perfectly suitable in its new position, and the reader might assume that there was perfect harmony between the intention of Montaigne and that of Lucretius. However, it is illuminating to refer back to the original context of the line : religione refrenatus ne forte rearis terras et solem et caelum, mare sidera lunam, corpore divino debere seterna manere, proptereaque putes ritu par esse Gigantum pendere eos poenas immani pro scelere omnis qui ratione sua disturbent moenia mundi praeclarumque velint caeli restinguere solem immortalia mortali sermone notantes. It is at once obvious that the same line conveys a totally new meaning, once the context has been altered. Lucretius scoffs at men who fear lest they should defile the supernatural. Montaigne scoffs at those who do, in his view, tarnish the sacred character of the supernatural. Such a disparity of opinion is not surprising in two writers who clash on most important points of dogma. What interests us is the manner in which Montaigne borrows the literal meaning of the Latin poet, and uses it for his own ends. It is the style of Lucretius which attracts Montaigne, the sharp incisiveness of his language, which can be adapted to the style of the Apologie. Thus it does not worry him that the whole import of his work is contrary to that of Lucretius. He can and does abstract the purely literary qualities, and use them in the manner that suits him best. It would be possible to argue that quoting this single line, which originally came in the wake of a jibe at religious values : "religione refrenatus ne forte rearis...", might be a subtle way of getting across his own anti-religious bias. But as we shall see, all the evidence points to a contrary conclusion, and tempting as the theory may appear at first sight, it has little foundation in fact. Similarly the two lines which follow Lucretius' epigram convey a different message in their new context. In the De Rerum Natura they represent a return to the real opinions of the author, who believes that the phenomena of nature are not connected in any way with the gods. In the Apologie, however, separated by almost twenty pages from the preceding line, they refer to human emotions which man tends to ascribe to the divinity : (a) Il faut que cela soit party d'une merveilleuse yvresse de l'entendement humain, (b) Quae procul usque adeo divino ab numine distant Inque Deum numero quae sint indigna videri. TR, 497.</page><page sequence="4">460 NOTES ET DOCUMENTS Whereas the tone of these two lines is similar in both contexts, the meaning is again totally different. Lucretius stresses the distance between man and the gods in order to emphasize the dignity and independence of rational man. Montaigne creates as wide a gulf as possible between God and man in order to abase human pride and presumption. Thus in the original context the important word would be "distant" but in the Apologie the emphasis shifts to "indigna". Montaigne does not appear to distinguish Lucretius' views and those views collectively known as 4 anti-Lucr?ce chez Lucr?ce." All cita tions are subordinated to his own line of argument. This is quite understandable when we consider the normal practice of the Renais sance in matters of quoting, and one might well leave the problem on this level. Rut the consistency with which Montaigne quotes the De Rerum Natura in such a way as to deform the original meaning raises the question as to whether he had an overall purpose in so doing. The Latin lines fit their new contexts so perfectly that were a reader who had never set eyes on the poem of Lucretius asked to form a judgment on its author, he would surely have to say that there are two different arguments in the poem : one which favours religion, and the other anti-religious, and the weight of the arguments falls on the religious side. It would seem, then, that Montaigne exploits the ambivalence and ambiguity of many of Lucretius' lines in a deliberate and syste matic fashion. This hypothesis is confirmed when one examines the other sections of the Apologie in which Lucretius is abundantly quoted. In the discussion on the nature of the soul, Lucretius is quoted seventeen times in the space of ten pages (524-534). The first of these citations is typical, preceded by the laconic introduction : (a) Or voyons ce que l'humaine raison nous a appris de soy et de l'ame ; (c)... (b) Ignoratur enim quae sit natura animai" Nata sit, an contra nascentibus insinuetur, Et simul intereat nobiscum morte dirempta, An tenebras Orci vis?t vastasque lacunas, An pecudes alias divinitus insinuet se. Lucr. I. 112-116. In these lines Lucretius was lamenting the fear of death suffered by man through his ignorance of the nature of the soul. In no sense is it a blanket statement of universal ignorance, for he is about to prove to his readers that the soul is pure matter. Rather it is an affirmation of the existing ignorance of some, which he intends to dissipate with his logical reasoning. Montaigne, taking the passage at face value, places it at the head of his argument in order to highlight the doubt and confusion that reigns in this, as in all philosophical matters. The impact of the lines is the exact opposite of that intended by Lucretius. At the same time one cannot ignore the obvious literary merits of this citation, both in itself and in the position it occupies in the text of the Apologie. It is a very carefully written section, abounding in alliteration and assonance. The fourth line conjures up whole new areas of the unknown, with such conviction and feeling that it forms a climax to the citation. Rut its position in the French text is no less striking, for it immediately follows a long section of abstract writing, which contrasts strongly with its vivid imagery, and precedes a rather tedious list of theories about the nature of the soul. Ry its style, therefore, it is perfectly adapted to its new context. Many of</page><page sequence="5">NOTES ET DOCUMENTS 461 the citations which are isolated additions of share these features, which would seem to suggest that the choice is motivated more by literary than by philosophical considerations, especially in the period 1580-1588. A second device used in the Apologie, distinct from the quoting of anti-Lucretian passages of the De Rerum Natura, is the placing of the lines in a hostile context, in such a way that the reader can only feel scorn for the thought expressed by the Lucretius citation. Many examples of this stratagem occur in the discussion on the nature of the soul. One of the few quotations included in the A text was pre ceded by a most ironic paragraph : (a) Il faut que nostre belle sagesse se rende en cet endroit et quitte les armes. Au demeurant ils consideroient aussi, par la vanit? de l'humaine raison, que le meslange et soci?t? de deux pieces si diverses, comme est le mortel et l'immortel, est inimaginable : Quippe etenim mortale aeterno j?ngere, et una Consentire putare, et fungi mutua posse, Desipere est. Quid enim diversius esse putandum est, Aut magis inter se disjunctum discrepitansque, Quam mortale quod est, immortali at que perenni Junctum, in concilio saevas tolerare procellas ? Lucr. III. 800-805 ; TR 533. The argument of this quotation is destroyed in advance, by the fact of its position in Montaigne's text. Nevertheless it is a most eloquent, persuasive and lyrical passage, which does much to embellish its surroundings. Montaigne is implicitly driving a wedge between the content of Lucretius' poetry and the poetry itself, so that the reader, while condemning the ideas, can admire and enjoy the manner in which they are set forth. A similarly ironic introduction precedes another A quotation, but this time Montaigne exploits the basic ambiguity of the text to add further levels of irony to his essay : Par ainsin ils jugeoient que sa generation suyvoit la commune condition des choses humaines, comme aussi sa vie, par l'opinion d'Epicurus et de Democritus, qui a est? la plus receu?, suyvant ces belles apparences, qu'on la voyoit naistre ? mesme que le corps en estoit capable ; on voyoit eslever ses forces comme les corporelles ; on y reconnoissoit la foiblesse de son enfance, et, avec le temps, sa vigeur et sa maturit? ; et puis sa decli nation et sa vieillesse, et en fin sa decrepitude, gigni pariter cum corpore, et una Crescere sentimus, pariterque senescere mentem. Lucr. III. 445-446 ; TR 531. The lines merely repeat what has preceded them, the only difference being the "sentimus" which makes the sentence much more affirmative and more deeply felt. The ?&lt;we feel" contrasts with the detached "on y reconnaissait", and changes the whole tone of the argument. Mon taigne could have chosen an equally expressive pair of lines from the same passage of the De Rerum Natura: gigni pariter pariterque videmus Crescere.... Lucr. III. 457-458. which would have conveyed an almost identical notion, with the more objective "videmus" and a similarly concise and balanced construe</page><page sequence="6">462 NOTES ET DOCUMENTS tion. The determining factor in his choice was, I believe, the word "mentem" in the first couplet. This word unequivocally refers to the mind, while the words "animus" and "anima" were more vague, and could express meanings as different from each other as "mind", "soul", "spirit", all of which were somehow confused in Lucretius' thought.6 By the sixteenth century, however, the nuances of meaning had been strictly defined, and one did not need to be a learned theologian to know that the concepts of "mind" and "soul" were thoroughly distinct from each other. In choosing the lines which contain the word "mens", Montaigne has probably two distinct concerns. The first is that there can be no accusation of heresy, or of his denying the im mortality of the soul, since strictly speaking he is talking of the mind, which is only one of the faculties of the soul. He uses the ambiguity of Lucretius' terminology to advantage. Secondly the quotation, by a stroke of good fortune, seems very appropriate to the overall design of the Apologie, whose dominant theme is the weakness of the mind. And as it happens, the inaccuracy of the Lucretian terminology plays into Montaigne's hands. While apparently discussing theories of the mortality of the soul, Montaigne is here adding a further level of meaning to his essay, by making an apparently fortuitous reference to the weakness of the mind, and therefore of man's reason. His imme diate and superficial meaning coincides with the general message of the essay, even though he is, on another level, quoting a theory in which he manifestly does not believe. Such exploitation of the ambi guities of his own text is an essential ingredient of Montaigne's irony. A final example of this kind of redirection of our interpretation of a citation can be seen near the end of the Apologie at the climax of the argument on the unreliability of the senses. The quotation is sum marized in advance, but the phrase immediately preceding it is the one that determines our understanding of the lines : (a) L'incertitude de nos sens rend incertain tout ce qu'ils produisent : Denique ut in fabrica, si prava est regula prima Normaque si fallax rectis regionibus exit, Et libella aliqua si ex parte Claudicat hilum, Omnia mendose fieri atque obstipa necessum est, Prava, cubantia, prona, supina, atque absona tecta, Jam ruere ut quaedam videantur velie, ruantque Prodita judiciis fallacibus omnia primis. Hic igitur ratio tibi rerum prava necesse est Falsaque sit, falsis quaecumque a sensibus orta est. Lucr. IV. 513-521 ; TR 584. This is an excellent example of Lucretius' poetry at its best and most persuasive. But the fact that the argument is open to different con clusions allows Montaigne to quote it as a refutation of the Epicurean point of view. Thus by choosing some of the best passages of the De Rerum Natura he subtly imposes his own opinion, reinforcing it with the arguments and imagery of Lucretius. It is a simple device, but one which is consistently used, and sometimes with great skill, as in this case. Once again the impression the passage gives the reader is that Montaigne enjoyed the poetry of Lucretius but that he treated his ideas with a detached irony. 6 See C. A. Bailey's commentary on the De Rerum Natura, Oxford, 1947.</page><page sequence="7">NOTES ET DOCUMENTS 463 The very presence of so many Lucretian citations, and in particu lar the notorious "Tantum relligio potuit suadere malorum" has pro voked the suggestion that some of Montaigne's irony may have been directed against religious values. Although he does not form any explicit or definitive opinion on the subject, R. A. Say ce quotes this line as an example of what he calls "a device which may serve to convey hidden meanings," and suggests that Montaigne may have been subtly referring to contemporary France and its wars of religion.7 While some readers may, with the aid of hindsight, draw parallels of their own, I find it difficult to agree with this hypothesis concerning the quotation as it stands in the text. The first edition of the Essais includes a reference to Iphigenia and the sacrifice of Aulis (TR502). Lucretius tells the story in one of the most well-known sections of the De Rerum Natura, I. 80-101, and the A text of the Apologie quotes the lines which introduce the passage : saepius olim Relligio peperit scelerosa at que impia facta. Lucr. I. 82-83. The topic under discussion is Man and the Supernatural, and in particular, sacrifices to the gods in ages past. No hint of contempo rary France appears in the text. Had he wanted to, Montaigne could have adapted the citation as he so often does, to suit his purpose. The vital word "olim" could easily have been omitted, or changed to "ilia" which in fact is the reading of present-day editions, and which would have transformed the meaning of the quotation. Had he done so, we would be justified in drawing parallels.8 The second quotation of the passage was added in after the existing reference to Iphigenia, and it merely adds imagery and colour to the text. By so doing, it increases the sense of horror one feels at the senseless acts of man performed in the name of religion. The last of the citations, "Tantum relligio..." was only included after a long C passage. Perhaps the most frequently quoted line of the poem, it could be said to sum up for many sixteenth century readers the essence of Lucretius' argument, which is aimed at freeing men's minds from the shackles of religion. Montaigne certainly knew it when first composing the Apologie, but he did not quote it, although the line could easily have been adapted to suit the text. In the text where most of the Lucretius citations made their appearance, he still omitted it. Only in the final edition, and after listing a series of extremely distasteful human sacrifices carried out in the name of religion, did he see fit to include this notorious line. It would seem that after holding back for so long, and having applied the line to inhuman actions which could be seen by all his readers to merit their disappro val, Montaigne is most unlikely to have wished, even then, to pass subtle hints, or create innuendoes about French politics of the day. Besides, he rarely hesitates in his judgments of the religious wars. At the very beginning of the Apologie, for example, he tells us quite clearly why he disapproves of the "nouvelletetz de Luther", not because of doctrinal reasons, but because they create divisions in society. Hence he can say quite openly : "Nostre religion est faicte 7 The Essays of Montaigne: a critical exploration, London 1972, pp. 205-206. 8 We know that Montaigne possessed Lambinus' 1563 edition of the Lucretius poem, but he frequently introduces personal amendments.</page><page sequence="8">464 NOTES ET DOCUMENTS pour extirper les vices ; elle les couvre, les nourrit, les incite." (421). Any further insinuations about the evils of the wars of religion are surely superfluous. It had long been the practice of conventional commentators to create a distinction between Lucretius the philosopher and Lucretius the poet.9 The former was condemned, the latter praised and imitated. It was only Lambinus, in his edition of the De Rerum Natura in 1563 who tried to defend Lucretius the thinker, albeit in a roundabout way. In the preface he argues that Lucretius was wrong to deny the existence of a provident God and the immortality of the soul. But a modern reader knows that such ideas are false, and he can distinguish the good from the bad. Montaigne has no use for such arguments. His admira tion for Lucretius is such that he is impelled to quote his poetry in many unlikely contexts. Rather than encumbering his text with many apologies and explanations as to the falsity of Lucretius' ideas, he merely uses irony so that his own text converts the sense of the Lucretian lines into something totally different. At the same time he goes to great lengths to ensure that the citations are perfectly suited to their new context from a literary point of view. A few examples will show the detailed manner in which this was done. The following lines are quoted among a list of difficulties which face those who claim the senses are infallible : (a) et celle des Epicuriens, que le Soleil n'est non plus grand que ce que nostre veu? le juge, (b) Quicquid id est, nihilo fertur majore figura Quam nostris oculis quam cernimus, esse videtur. Lucr. V, 577-578 ; TR575. Rut in the De Rerum Natura these lines referred to the moon, although a similar couplet about the sun preceded them : Forma quoque hinc solis d?bet filumque videri Nil adeo ut possis plus aut minus addere, vere. Lucr. V, 572-573. It is clear that Montaigne deliberately chose the lines relating to the moon because they suited his text better than those which spoke of the sun. A comparison of the two couplets gives an idea of the factors which helped Montaigne make this choice. The first line of each pair contains alliteration with "forma.. .filiumque" in the first and "fer tur. . .figura" in the second. The alliteration is more striking in the second example, though, because of its dominating position, and because the two words are closer together, thus creating a sense of greater urgency. Added to this is the similarity of the first word of each line in the preferred example : "Quicquid. . .quam" and the fact that the two lines flow with much greater ease. The "sun" couplet has a more broken rhythm, as well as the unavoidably prosaic "plus aut minus addere", and it ends in the rather isolated and lame "vere". All of these drawbacks are apparent when the lines are compared to the "moon" couplet. There can be no doubt in this case that the motive for quoting Lucretius lies in the means of expression he uses, and scarcely at all in the content of the lines. This does not alter the fact that a critical tone is maintained in the French text with regard 9 See Hugo Friedrich, Montaigne, trans. Rovini, Paris, 1968, p. 59.</page><page sequence="9">NOTES ET DOCUMENTS 465 to the ideas expressed, and, by implication, the citation which is supposed to reinforce it becomes meaningless. A double disregard for the sense of the Latin lines is shown, both by the hostile context and the adaptation of Lucretius' lines to his own text. A second citation in this section shows another aspect of this search for harmonious fusing of Latin quotations to French context. The author, listing optical illusions, has given the example in the A text of elongated shapes which appear when one puts pressure on the eye. Perhaps animals, who have naturally elongated eyes always see things thus, and perhaps this the true shape of things rather than that furnished by our human vision. This suggestion may have appeared far-fetched to Montaigne on reediting his text, and he would have wished to add authority to it with a Lucretius citation, for even when a citation is quoted out of context, its mere presence adds weight to the French text. However, searching through the De Rerum Natura, book VI, he could only find lines referring to optical illusions which occur when one puts pressure beneath one eye. These lines impressed him so much that he included the whole example and the addition to his own text reads thus : (b) Si nous serrons l' il par dessoubs, les choses nous semblent doubles. Bina lucernarum florentia lumina flammis Et dupli ces hominum facies, et corpora bina. Lucr. IV, 450 and 452 ; TR582. Montaigne's fascination with the linguistic tricks of Lucretius is apparent in the two lines quoted, and in the fact that he omits line 451, in order to make the Latin more symmetrical. For he has "bina" as the first and last words of the couplet, the word meaning "double" and thereby dominating the citation. The first line has the alternation of "lu.. .fi.. .lu.. .fl" parallelling the double vision of the person looking. This is an excellent example of the opulence of Lucretian imagery. The quotation is chosen with such obvious care that the literary motive would seem to preclude all others. One senses Mon taigne's appreciation for the sheer beauty of the classical lines, together with his evident ear for word-play, a feature which grows in prominence through the successive editions. It would not be going too far to suggest that his love for Lucretius' poetry stimulated this aspect of his style. Another striking feature of the Lucretius quotations in the Apo logie is the number of times they appear in the context of a larger rhetorical device, such as the apostrophe. Two such cases appear in the discussion on man and the supernatural. The first is introduced by the phrase : "il faudrait luy dire de la part de la raison humaine :..." and consists of the reasonable man's hypothetical reply to those who think we can participate in the life of the supernatural. Lucretius is quoted five times in the course of two pages (TR498-500). and the nature of the citations is such that they contribute greatly to the persuasive qualities of the passage, not so much by their content as by their literary eloquence. Similarly in an apostrophe to man, intro duced by the rhetorical "Mets le cas, ? homme, que tu ayes peu remarquer icy quelques traces de ses effets :... " (TR504-505) Lucre tius is quoted four times, on the topic of the plurality of worlds, a topic in which the general ideas and the angle of vision of both writers seem, for once, to coincide. It would appear from these examples, and from all the others quoted above, that Montaigne associates the</page><page sequence="10">466 notes et documents De Rerum Natura with certain literary qualities, such as conciseness, persuasiveness, lyricism created by vivid imagery and ingenious word-play, and he uses it as a source for these qualities, rather than for specific philosophical or moral opinions. This is especially true of the 1588 edition. In quoting from some of the most didactic and dogmatic passages of the De Rerum Natura for reasons which appear to be purely literary as they exist in the final text of the Apologie, there is implicit in Montaigne's attitude a desire to create a distance between himself and the ideas of Lucretius. Furthermore, he appears to be also creating a distance between these two aspects of Lucretius : on the one hand his dogmatism, his rationalist theories and solutions to the problems of philosophy ; on the other hand his lyricism, his eloquent formulation of ideas which contradict those he is expounding and the contradictions inherent in his philosophy. Montaigne is thus satisfying the criterion for Socratic irony as defined by Bergson : "L'ironie qu'il prom?ne avec lui est destin?e ? ?carter les opinions qui n'ont pas subi l'?preuve de la r?flexion et ? leur faire honte, pour ainsi dire, en les mettant en contradiction avec elles-m?mes. " 10 But the Lucretius quotations go beyond this, and in the final version of the essay they impart a further dimension to the lyric qualities which have been too over looked in the Apologie in the past. Montaigne evidently wished this essay to deviate from the standard philosophical expos?, not only in its content, but also in its form. Lucretius was one of the best models for this kind of literature, and this is why he is quoted so often in the essay. It is no longer possible to claim that Montaigne borrowed some of the logical arguments of the De Rerum Natura to further the development of the Apologie. Nor ean one reasonably suggest that the many citations from Lucretius, by sheer weight of numbers, imply any subtle attack on religion. In so far as the Lucretius quota tions are evidence of a wider interpretation of the Apologie, the Armaingaud position looks more absurd than ever. Montaigne seems to be always careful to project an image of orthodoxy in matters of religion, and this image seems to reflect the true state of Montaigne's feelings, in so far as they are expressed in the Apologie de Raimond Sebond.
