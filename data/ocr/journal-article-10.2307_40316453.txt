<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARITIME ADAPTATIONS ON THE SOUTHERN NORTHWEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA JON M. ERLANDSON, MARK A. TVESKOV, and R. SCOTT BYRAM Abstract. The southern Washington, Oregon, and northern California coasts have long been peripheral to discussions of the development of Northwest Coast cultures. This marginality is challenged by recent studies that examine the dynamic cultures and en- vironments of this area in relation to important research issues applicable to a wide range of Pacific coast cultures. Here, we address three primary issues in the archaeol- ogy of the southern Northwest Coast: (1) the antiquity of maritime adaptations; (2) the economic significance of sea mammal hunting; and (3) the nature and importance of fishing and weir technologies. We conclude that the antiquity of widespread maritime adaptations in the area is unknown, that pinniped hunting is best understood as an in- tegrated part of broader subsistence adaptations, that coastal fishing was more diverse and eclectic than previously believed, and that the socioeconomic complexity of some southern Northwest Coast cultures was greater than previous models have suggested. Alsea culture was definitely peripheral. . . . The picture is one of a small nation in an isolated spot along the coast - an eddy in the swirling current of North Pacific culture. It seems that little of historical importance ever happened there, and it does not seem likely that anything ever would have hap- pened (Philip Drucker 1939:81). Culturally, linguistically, and ecologically di- verse, maritime peoples of the North Pacific were nonetheless united by their reliance on technolo- gies and lifestyles developed to effectively hunt, fish, and gather a similar suite of coastal resources. Although adapting to the exploitation of sea mam- mals, fish, shellfish, and birds led to certain paral- lels in technology, demography, and cultural com- plexity, significant differences also evolved due to local variations in marine and terrestrial environ- ments, migration or in situ development of dis- tinctive ethnic groups, interaction with neighbor- ing coastal and interior peoples, and other factors. Comparative analysis of these maritime societies is often inhibited by the varying amounts and acces- sibility of published data available for various areas. Although many political barriers to interna- tional scholarly exchange have disappeared, there are still major areas of the North Pacific where rel- atively few archaeological and paleoecological data are available. Until recently, one of these areas was the southern Northwest Coast of North America, encompassing the coastlines of southern Washington, Oregon, and northern California. Compared to adjacent coastal areas, the archaeol- ogy and ethnohistory of the southern Northwest Coast were relatively poorly understood, with much of the accomplished work unpublished, in- completely published, or hidden in technical re- ports with limited circulation (Lyman and Ross fon M. Erlandson, Mark A. Tveskov, and R. Scott Byram, Department of Anthropology University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403-1218 ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 35, No. 1, pp. 6-22, 1998</page><page sequence="2">Environmental Setting Cultural Setting Erlandson et ai: Southern Northwest Coast of North America 7 1988; Lyman 1991). Some of this gap is due to the fact that much of the area is distant from major population centers and large research institutions. Some archaeologists may also have been discour- aged from studying an area where "little of histori- cal importance" (Drucker 1939:81) was ever sup- posed to have happened and relatively little published ethnography was available. Statements such as Drucker's helped foster the misconception that the southern Northwest Coast was peripheral to the main currents of North Pacific cultural developments. Such views were facilitated by the dearth of detailed published ac- counts on the early history or ethnography of Na- tive cultures of the area. These tribes were also devastated by their contacts with Europeans: by epidemic diseases, attempts at outright extermina- tion, forced removal to reservations and decades of government neglect and assimilation. The "ethnic cleansing" of the southern Northwest Coast by Eu- roamericans (Hatfield 1996) dramatically changed many Native cultures before detailed ethnogra- phies were recorded and led to the loss of a vast reservoir of cultural knowledge. Nonetheless, a rich body of unpublished eth- nohistoric and ethnographic data has emerged that provides valuable information on the traditional cultures of the area. In the last decade or so a large body of published archaeological data has also filled some key gaps in the archaeology of the southern Northwest Coast (e.g., Byram 1998; Cole et al. 1996; Connolly 1992; Draper 1988; Erlandson and Moss 1996, 1997; Gard 1992; Hall 1995; Hilde- brandt 1984; Lyman 1991; Minor 1983; Minor and Grant 1996; Moss and Erlandson 1995, 1998a; Ross 1985, 1990; Wessen 1990). In this paper, we use the available archaeological and ethnographic data to examine some key issues in the archaeology of the Native cultures of the southern Northwest Coast: the antiquity of maritime adaptations; the importance of sea mammal hunting; and the sig- nificance and nature of fishing and weir technolo- gies. First, we provide some background data to frame our discussions. As we define it here, the southern Northwest Coast encompasses most of the western margins of Washington, Oregon, and northern California, from just south of Cape Alava1 on the north to Cape Mendocino on the south (Fig. 1). Like much of the Pacific Rim, this roughly 1000 km stretch of coast is rugged and mountainous, with relatively narrow coastal plains and continental shelves. This juxtaposition of mountains and the sea pro- vided coastal peoples with access to a wide variety of habitats and a diverse suite of marine, estuarine, freshwater, and terrestrial resources. Unlike the more convoluted coastlines to the north, the rela- tively linear southern Northwest Coast faces pre- dominantly west, with the outer coast exposed to the full force of North Pacific storm winds and waves. Much of the coast is also fronted by high sea cliffs, testaments to the erosional force of the Pacific Ocean. Long stretches of sandy beach line the outer coast, punctuated by rocky headlands and a series of large bays and estuaries. These em- bayments - Willapa Bay, the Columbia River mouth, Tillamook Bay, Coos Bay, Humboldt Bay, and many smaller examples - provided protected marine, estuarine, and freshwater habitats that supported large Native American populations until shortly after European contact. Along the coast, upwelling ocean currents supported rich marine food chains, including a wide variety of shellfish, fish, sea mammals, and sea birds. For much of the year, outer coast habi- tats are battered by surf that limited marine fish- ing, hunting, gathering, and boat travel. In bays and river mouths, however, rich marine and estu- arine habitats were accessible much of the year. Southern Northwest Coast landscapes are dominated by high rainfall and a series of rivers that flow into the sea. The larger rivers (Chehalis, Columbia, Umpqua, Rogue, Klamath, and Eel) cut through the Coast Ranges, providing trade and travel routes deep into the interior. Prior to com- mercial overexploitation, salmon, sturgeon, eels, trout, and other fish were abundant in coastal rivers, some seasonally and others year round. In the early 1900s, annual salmon runs appear to have numbered in the hundreds of thousands in several area rivers and several million in the Columbia River (Cobb 1930). On land, vegetation communities are com- prised primarily of coniferous rain forests, with the coast redwood forest zone dominant in north- ern California and the Sitka spruce zone to the north (Franklin and Dyrness 1988). The latter is dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and red cedar (Thuja plicata). Compared to more northern areas, plants with edible nuts, seeds, or berries are diverse, with acorns and root plants (e.g., camas and wapato) locally abundant. The most important large game in much of the area were deer and elk, but bears and a variety of medium and small mam- mals once were abundant. The Ethnographic Record The southern Northwest Coast was home to a diverse group of Indian societies at the time of European contact: the Chimakuan-speaking Quileute and Hoh of the southwestern Olympic</page><page sequence="3">8 Arctic An thropology 35:1 Figure 1. The southern Northwest Coast study area and the Cascadia Subduction Zone (see Atwater et al. 1995). Peninsula; Salish peoples such as the Quinault and Chehalis of southwest Washington and the Tillamook of northern Oregon; Penutian-speakers like Oregon's Lower Chinook, Alsea, Siuslaw, and Coos; Athapaskans like the Tututni and Tolowa of the Oregon/California border area, and the Algic- speaking Yurok and Wiyot of northern California (Thompson and Kinkade 1990). Despite this lin- guistic diversity, these peoples shared many adap- tations to similar marine, riverine, and terrestrial resources. Natives of the southern Northwest Coast are generally viewed as fishing peoples who relied heavily on salmon and other anadromous fish as</page><page sequence="4">The Antiquity of Coastal Adaptations Erlandson et al.: Southern Northwest Coast of North America 9 dietary staples. In fact, their subsistence was rela- tively eclectic and diverse, depending on the pro- ductivity and accessibility of resources in local group territories. Overall productivity and avail- ability of marine resources may have been some- what lower than for some areas to the north (Schalk 1981; Hildebrandt and Levulett 1997), but the diversity of aquatic and terrestrial foods avail- able was impressive. The overall richness of re- sources - especially around sizeable estuaries where a range of resources were available year round - fostered relatively dense, sedentary, tech- nologically sophisticated, and complex societies. The Archaeological Record The archaeological record of the southern North- west Coast spans at least 11,000 years and has been divided into different local and regional chronological sequences (Fig. 2). Because the rela- tionships between such sequences can be confus- ing, we rely primarily on a geological time scale. The presence of a few fluted points found on or near the coast suggests that Paleoindian peoples first settled the area between about 11,000 and 11,500 14C years ago (Erlandson and Moss 1996). We know virtually nothing about Paleoindian sub- sistence along the Pacific coast, but fish and water- fowl bones from a Clovis-age deposit in a northern California rocksheiter (CA-SIS-218) suggest that some interior Paleoindians harvested aquatic re- sources (Beaton 1991; Erlandson 1994:270). It is conceivable, therefore, that there was also an aquatic component to the subsistence of coastal Paleoindians. We know little more about Early Holocene (ca. 10,000 to 6700 RYBP) peoples of the southern Northwest Coast. Until about 10 years ago, no Early Holocene coastal sites were known from northern California, Oregon, or Washington, al- though sites of this age are fairly common from coastal areas to the north and south (Lightfoot 1993; Moss and Erlandson 1995). Over the past decade or so, four or five Early Holocene sites have been reported from the northern California and Oregon coasts (see below), but the number of early sites is still small. Middle Holocene sites (ca. 6700 to 3400 RYBP) are also relatively rare in our study area. This dearth of early coastal sites has led some archaeologists to propose that marine resources played a limited role in the early economies of the area, an issue we address in detail below. Only during the Late Holocene (ca. 3400 RYBP to present) is a full range of ar- chaeological sites represented along the southern Northwest Coast. By this time, a variety of site types (villages, campsites, fishing weirs, rock art, quarries, etc.) are documented in a variety of dif- ferent settings (outer coast, estuarine, riverine, ter- restrial, etc.). Compared to Late Holocene societies to the north, it is sometimes assumed that southern Northwest Coast cultures were substantially less complex and elaborated. At present, the evidence for this disparity is ambiguous. At the Palmrose site (35CLT47) on the northern Oregon coast, occu- pied primarily between about 2600 and 1700 RYBP, Connolly (1992) documented the existence of a relatively large (about 6 m x 18 m) rectangular house and an elaborate industry marked by zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, and other deco- rated objects rivaling early artistic assemblages to the north. Another Oregon coast site, the huge his- toric village of 35TI1 near Netarts, contains as many as 40 large rectangular housepits (Moss and Erlandson 1996) and also produced a rich artifact assemblage that includes objects elaborately carved in Northwest Coast styles (Newman 1959:26). The evidence for some very large village sites, large longhouses, and an elaborate material culture suggests that the socioeconomic complex- ity of some southern Northwest Coast societies may have rivalled that to the north. For some eth- nohistoric groups of the southern Northwest Coast, the appearance of lower cultural complexity may result from their early devastation by Old World diseases (Minor n.d.). As mentioned earlier, the dearth of early coastal sites led some archaeologists to propose that inten- sive coastal adaptations may not have developed on the southern Northwest Coast until after 5000 years ago (Schalk 1981; Ross 1985; Lyman 1991; Lightfoot 1993). Hildebrandt and Levulett (1997) argued that the higher productivity of elk and deer, riverine fish, and terrestrial plant foods led to a relatively late shift to coastal adaptations in the area. Reflecting a larger debate in archaeology, such models imply that the productivity of coastal resources was inferior to terrestrial alternatives until higher population densities, environmental changes, or both, made the diversification of human subsistence and the exploitation of aquatic resources advantageous. Others (e.g., Bickel 1978; Jones 1991; Minor and Grant 1996) attributed the dearth of early sites in the area to the limited work done or the effects of rising postglacial sea levels, tectonic subsi- dence, and coastal erosion. They assumed that southern Northwest Coast peoples, like coastal groups to the north and south, adapted to the sea relatively early but that evidence for such early maritime cultures has been destroyed, remains</page><page sequence="5">1 0 Arctic Anthropology 35:1 Figure 2. Some chronological sequences for the southern Northwest Coast. Sources: Matson and Coupland (1995), Ross (1990), Lyman (1991), Minor (n.d.), and Frederickson (1984). hidden, or has yet to be identified. Recent Oregon coast research by Moss and Erlandson (1996) sug- gests that limited research cannot explain the dearth of early coastal sites in this area. Of 246 14C dates compiled for 118 coastal sites on state lands, for instance, over 94% of the dates (and dated sites) were Late Holocene in age. Despite the relative youth of most southern Northwest Coast sites, models assuming that coastal environments would have been attractive to early peoples have been buoyed in recent years by the discovery of several Early or Middle Holo- cene sites on the northern California and Oregon coasts (see Minor and Toepel 1986; Schwaderer 1992; Erlandson 1994; Minor 1995; Moss and Er- landson 1998a). These include three Early Holocene coastal localities - the Tahkenitch Land- ing and Indian Sands sites in Oregon and Dun- can's Point Cave in northern California - that con- tain significant amounts of marine shell, vertebrate remains, or both. Shell Middens Minor and Toepel (1986) identified a site compo- nent (35DO130) at Tahkenitch Lake associated with an estuarine adaptation dated between about 5200 and 8000 RYBP. Adjacent to a freshwater lake</page><page sequence="6">Erlandson et al: Southern Northwest Coast of North America 1 1 formed when coastal dunes blocked Tahkenitch Creek, the site was located next to an estuary dur- ing the Early and Middle Holocene. Only seven ar- tifacts (1 scraper, 1 graver, 1 chopper, 1 abrader, and 3 hammerstones) and a few shells were found in the basal Tahkenitch component, but the bones of marine fish and aquatic birds were fairly abun- dant. Minor (1995) suggested that "the primary subsistence focus was on fishing for marine species, with hunting of marine birds, harbor seal, and mule deer." Moss and Erlandson (1995, 1998a) questioned the age of the earliest component at Tahkenitch, however, suggesting that artifacts and faunal remains from the basal level could be de- rived from an overlying and much denser Middle Holocene shell midden dated to about 5200 RYBP. So far, no further evidence for the Early Holocene age of the basal Tahkenitch materials has been pre- sented. At Indian Sands (35CU67) in a rugged outer coast setting, Moss and Erlandson (1995, 1998a) identified a small Early Holocene shell midden. Here, chipped stone tools and debris are scattered in dune blowouts for almost a kilometer along the coastal bluffs. In one large artifact cluster, a de- flated concentration of burned and unburned mus- sel (Mytilus californianus) shells encompasses a 25 m x 40 m area. Three 14C dates on mussel shells average about 8100 RYBP, but deflation makes any secure association of artifacts found with the shell midden difficult. Berreman col- lected over 200 artifacts at Indian Sands in the 1930s, however, including leaf-shaped bifaces similar to other early Pacific coast and interior specimens (Minor and Greenspan 1991:30). Other than expedient flake tools, the most abundant tools found on the site today are large flaked cob- bles (choppers, hammerstones, and cores) also common in many early Pacific coast assemblages, including Old Cordilleran or Pebble Tool assem- blages of the central Northwest Coast (see Matson and Coupland 1995). The site has also produced numerous small obsidian flakes that may indicate early trade with interior groups. Duncan's Point Cave (CA-SON-348/H), lo- cated near the Russian River mouth, contains a 2.6 m deep shell midden, the basal levels of which date to about 8200 to 8600 RYBP (Schwaderer 1992). A test pit dug through the early component produced abundant shellfish remains and lesser amounts of marine fish, sea birds and waterfowl, and land and sea mammal bone. Artifacts from the early levels include a Lake Mojave-type point, 20 utilized and retouched flakes, 5 cores, 2 core tools, 3 burins or burin spalls, and 2 drills or gravers (Fenenga 1992). Obsidian artifacts again suggest that the early occupants participated in long-dis- tance trade networks. Lithic Sites Like most Early Holocene sites to the north, some early southern Northwest Coast localities are "lithic" sites in which faunal remains are rare or absent. Ross (1985, 1990:554) proposed that Ore- gon coast lithic sites may have been used by ter- restrial groups during an early "pre-marine" phase. Lyman (1991) also related lithic sites to a "pre-littoral" phase when marine resources were not intensively utilized. Minor and Greenspan (1991:62) suggested that Oregon coast lithic sites include those where soil acidity destroyed most or all shell and bone, as well as lithic workshop areas functionally related to nearby midden deposits (see Gould 1966). Arguments about the nature and implications of southern Northwest Coast lithic sites are inter- esting since few scholars have questioned the partly coastal orientation represented by similar sites in British Columbia and southeast Alaska (see Carlson 1995; Matson and Coupland 1995:81). Many of these northern sites are found on islands or in other environments where terrestrial re- sources are relatively scarce. On the southern Northwest Coast, where terrestrial and riverine re- sources were more diverse and abundant (Hilde- brandt and Levulett 1997), it is at least possible that early lithic sites were used by people who largely ignored coastal habitats. On the other hand, some lithic sites are located on prominent coastal headlands - above rocky shores rich in shellfish, fish, and other marine resources - where access to large terrestrial game would seem to have been more limited. Shell and bone do not preserve well in generally acidic southern Northwest Coast soils, especially where large amounts of shell refuse have not been deposited. Logically, there- fore, the lack of marine shells or bones in lithic sites does not imply a lack of coastal subsistence unless the lack of any bone means the site occu- pants were vegetarians (Erlandson and Moss 1997). It would be equally questionable, however, to propose a fully coastal adaptation for the occu- pants of lithic sites lacking the remains of marine fauna or distinctive maritime technology. Other Factors Affecting the Archaeological Record Like most areas around the Pacific, the early ar- chaeological record of the southern Northwest Coast is difficult to reconstruct due to the dramatic geomorphological changes of the past 15,000 years. The area lies south of the margins of the Cordilleran ice sheet that covered much of the northern Northwest Coast during the last glacial, so isostatic changes in land and sea levels have been limited. Nonetheless, rising postglacial sea levels flooded large areas of coastal plain and</page><page sequence="7">Sea Mammal Hunting on the Southern Northwest Coast 1 2 Arctic Anthropology 35:1 drowned the mouths of most coastal drainages until sea level rise slowed after 6000 years ago. Subsequently, the modern geography of the region gradually took shape, with the formation of nu- merous shallow- water estuaries, sandspits at the mouths of coastal rivers, localized dune building, and accelerated coastal erosion. Some sites for- merly located in coastal settings are now found kilometers from the sea due to rapidly accreting sand dunes and hydrological changes (e.g., Minor and Toepel 1986; Connolly 1995). Recent geological research has also shown that the southern Northwest Coast is susceptible to massive earthquakes, tsunamis, and rapid coastal subsidence generated by crustal plate movements along the Cascadia Subduction Zone at roughly 400 to 600 year intervals (see Atwater et al. 1995). The effects of such processes on the archaeological record are only beginning to be understood (e.g., Woodward et al. 1990; Connolly 1992; Cole et al. 1996; Minor and Grant 1996). Large subsidence earthquakes, in particular, could have triggered numerous landslides and greatly accelerated coastal erosion and the destruction of early coastal sites. Such processes may help explain the dearth of Early and Middle Holocene sites along those portions of the Pacific coast adjacent to the Casca- dia Subduction Zone. The effects of regional taphonomic processes - from sea level rise to soil acidity, subsidence, and erosion - are cumulative and can be expected to have had a significantly greater effect on Early and Middle Holocene sites of the southern Northwest Coast. While the existence of such processes should not lead to a priori assumptions that the evidence for early maritime adaptations has been lost, those studying the antiquity of maritime adaptations in the area cannot ignore such pro- cesses and assume that existing data are represen- tative of the entire Holocene. Recently, archaeologists have debated the nature and significance of sea mammal hunting along the southern Northwest Coast and California (e.g., Hildebrandt 1981, 1984; Lyman 1988, 1995; Hilde- brandt and Jones 1992; Jones and Hildebrandt 1995). The debate has focused on the biology and behavior of Pacific coast pinnipeds and sea otters - especially fur seals and sea lions that es- tablish onshore rookeries where they are season- ally vulnerable to prédation vs. harbor seals and sea otters which do not form rookeries and must generally be hunted at sea - as well as problems in analyzing and interpreting zooarchaeological assemblages. Basically, Hildebrandt and Jones argued that early coastal groups focused on hunting for seals and sea lions in mainland rookeries, which were quickly overexploited in a prehistoric "tragedy of the commons." This led to intensified pinniped hunting and the development of an ocean-going canoe/harpoon complex where offshore rookeries were present, facilitating sociopolitical differentia- tion as wealthy individuals were required to fi- nance construction of large canoes. Lyman (1991, 1995) countered that Hildebrandt and Jones' data did not allow them to distinguish between pin- nipeds taken on land or at sea, that significant numbers of fur seal and sea lion bones have been found in several coastal sites lacking offshore rookeries, and that the modern restriction of pin- nipeds largely to offshore rookeries is a relatively recent phenomenon due to commercial overhunt- ing. Lyman also suggested that sophisticated boats were not necessarily required for pinniped hunt- ing and that increased sociopolitical complexity resulted from a need to manage the redistribution of a variety of storable resources acquired through hunting sea and land mammals, communal weir fishing, and shellfish gathering. In this debate, and especially in the Hildebrandt and Jones model, marine mammal hunting takes center stage in the development of coastal adaptations along the southern Northwest Coast. Neither side in this debate recognized two key facts. The first is that sea level rise, subsidence earthquakes, and the severe coastal erosion typical of outer coast habitats have dramatically changed Pacific coast geography. Such changes have almost certainly affected the distribution of rookeries through time, causing suitable offshore landforms to appear and disappear in some areas at various times. Second, both models overlook the fact that humans were not the only terrestrial predators along the Pacific coast. Accessible mainland rook- eries probably always were rare due to the vulner- ability of pups to grizzly bears and other large predators. Two other issues also remain unre- solved: the overall contribution of sea mammal hunting to Native subsistence on the southern Northwest Coast, and the social roles conditioned by participation in or control of sea mammal hunt- ing. Recent archaeological research has begun to address the first issue and a careful review of early historic accounts and oral traditions recorded by early ethnographers provides insight into the latter. Ethnographic and Ethnohistoric Evidence There are numerous ethnohistoric and ethno- graphic references to sea mammal use along the southern Northwest Coast. Only the northernmost tribes - Quinault, Quileute, and Hoh - regularly hunted whales, but others scavenged whale car-</page><page sequence="8">Erlandson et al.: Southern Northwest Coast of North America 13 casses found on the beach or at sea2 (Waterman 1921:110; Barnett 1934:10). In most accounts, the oil rendered from blubber seems to have been the most valued part of a whale. In 1806, Lewis and Clark described the butchering of a whale at Tillamook Head, south of the Columbia River: ... we met 14 Indian men and women loaded with the Oil and Blubber of the whale. . . . pillaged of every Valuable part by the Kilamox [Tillamook] Inds in the Vecenity of whose Village's it lay on the Strand where the waves and tide had driven up &amp; left it. ... I returned to the Village of 5 Cab- ins on the creek, found the nativs busily engaged boiling the blubber, which they performed in a large Squar wooden trough by means of hot stones. . . . The Kilamox although they possessed large quantities of this blubber and oil were so penurious that they disposed of it with great reluc- tance (DeVoto 1953:305-307). Whole households or villages often communally butchered a whale carcass. To the south, blubber and meat were often distributed by the wealthy man or household that owned the beach the whale was found on (Waterman 1921:110; Barnett 1934:10). Among northern groups, however, a whale carcass generally was owned by the finder or by those from the nearest village. Unlike whales, pinnipeds and sea otters were hunted all along the southern Northwest Coast. They were harpooned or clubbed on offshore rocks, in nearshore waters along the outer coast and estuaries, or at onshore haulouts (e.g., Drucker 1937:234; Olson 1936:48-49; Kroeber and Barrett 1960:Chapter XI). Again, blubber to render into oil was the primary goal of pinniped hunting, but meat, skins, and furs were used locally or traded, and bladders and stomachs were also used for containers. Rookeries do not seem to have been owned, but pinniped hunts at rookeries were con- trolled by the wealthy owners of large ocean-going canoes (Gibbs 1857:4; Frachtenburg 1920:167-169; Barnett 1934:10; Kroeber and Barrett 1960:115). Some accounts suggest that sea mammals were highly valued for prestige gained by control- ling access to whale carcasses or leading hunting parties to offshore rookeries. Drucker (1937:235) noted the successful Tolowa hunter "gave away more meat than he kept" and that "the wealthy owner of many 'pieces' of whale meat, who would fight to the last breath another owner who cut an inch or two too wide, usually gave away most of the meat, keeping but little for himself." Does such testimony accurately represent the importance of sea mammal hunting prior to Euro- pean contact, especially since most accounts were collected well after Native peoples were deci- mated by such contacts? As the fur trade devel- oped in the early 1800s, successful hunters con- trolled greater wealth through access to European goods and obtained increasing status in Native so- ciety (Hajda 1984; Gibson 1992). Thus, ethno- graphic accounts may overemphasize the impor- tance of sea mammal hunting prior to contact, especially the wealth, status, and prestige of suc- cessful hunters. In fact, oral histories suggest that sea mammals were not the focus of traditional sub- sistence for most southern Northwest Coast groups, describing the mechanics of fishing or deer and elk hunting in far greater detail. In such cases, archaeological data can be used to test ethnographic models. Archaeological Evidence There is little evidence of sea mammal use on the southern Northwest Coast prior to 4000 years ago, but archaeological data can be used to evaluate the economic significance of sea mammal hunting for Late Holocene societies. Such an analysis requires consideration of the full range of faunal remains found in archaeological sites and of the role vari- ous sites played in larger settlement systems. Until recently, zooarchaeological studies for the area fo- cused primarily on mammal bones because many early excavators collected faunal remains ex- tremely selectively, either without screening site deposits or screening only over coarse mesh (Hildebrandt 1981:139-144; Lyman 1991:103, 178). Losey (1996) showed that over 90% offish remains may be lost in 1/4 -inch screening of Ore- gon coast shell middens and even 1/8 -inch screens can result in loss of up to 90% of the bones of small fish. Such sampling problems are illustrated by Cressman's 1952 excavation of protohistoric housepits at the Bandon Sandspit site (35CS5) at the mouth of the Coquille River. At 35CS5, 1/4- inch screens were used to process the excavated deposits and, not surprisingly, Cressman (1953: 297) concluded that the occupants relied heavily on hunting sea mammals and elk. Recent analysis of 2857 recovered faunal specimens identified a range of mammal bones: deer, elk, whale, harbor seal, sea lion, elephant seal, and sea otter (Tveskov n.d.), suggesting that mammal hunting was impor- tant at 35CS5. However, fish, bird, and shellfish remains - frequently mentioned in field notes - rarely were collected. Two small bags of fish re- mains that were collected yielded over 1600 fish bones, over 56% of the total number of identified specimens. Bone tools (harpoons, fishing gear, whale bone platters, etc.) are abundant in the as- semblage, however, and the dietary importance of land mammals may be exaggerated by the abun- dance of long bone diaphysis fragments with flake scars, impact points, and "v-shaped" fractures typ- ical of tool-making debris (see Lyman 1994). Until recently most sizeable faunal assem-</page><page sequence="9">Fishing and Complexity on the Northwest Coast 1 4 Arctic Anthropology 35:1 blages also came from large outer coast sites lo- cated in habitats generally well suited to pinniped hunting (e.g., Gould 1966; Hildebrandt 1981; Lyman 1991; Minor 1991a). Less attention was paid to estuarine villages and more specialized fishing and hunting camps or fishing weirs. Recent work has focused on a wider variety of southern Northwest Coast sites in a number of different habitats using modern analytical methods. Sites such as 45PC101 on Willapa Bay (DePuydt 1994), the Palmrose and Avenue Q sites (Connolly 1992) and the Nehalem Bay Dune site (Minor 1991b) on the northern Oregon coast, Yaquina Head on the central Oregon coast (Minor 1991a), and southern Oregon coast sites (e.g., Losey 1996; Minor and Greenspan 1995; Greenspan 1996) have produced the remains of numerous shellfish, fish, land mammal, and waterfowl taxa - as well as sea mammals. Shellfish or fish remains (or both) usu- ally dominate these assemblages, as measured by numbers of individual specimens in fine-screened samples. Such studies also show how midden con- stituents vary by site location. Tveskov (n.d.) in- vestigated a variety of sites (villages, camps, fish- ing weirs, etc.) in the Coos Bay and Coquille River areas of the Oregon coast. He sampled several shell middens dating to the last 1000 years: the Graveyard Point site (35CS142), a small fishing camp on Coos Bay; the Bullards Beach village site (35CS2/3) on the Coquille River estuary; the Whiskey Run site (35CS62), a village/summer camp located on the outer coast between Coos Bay and the Coquille River; the small Samuels site (35CS138) on the rocky outer coast near Cape Arago; and the small outer coast Coquille Point site (35CS136) located adjacent to a small chert source just south of the Coquille River mouth (Tveskov et al. 1996). At each site, mammal bones were recovered from 1/8-inch screening of all excavated soils and 1/16-inch screening of 3.8 liter bulk samples. Land vs. sea mammal bone fragments were difficult to differentiate because of heavy fragmentation. Using shell- and bone-to-meat ratios for various faunal taxa, gross weights of shell, fish bone, and mammal bones were converted into estimated meat yields (Table 1). Like other dietary recon- struction techniques, this "weight method" has several problems (see Erlandson 1994:15-16). Nonetheless, meat weight conversions are a valu- able tool for assessing variation in the relative di- etary importance of faunal classes at different sites in a region, especially in shell middens rich in highly fragmented faunal remains. The dietary reconstructions suggest that mammals provided relatively little of the meat represented by the faunal samples from the five sites. Except for the village site 35CS2/3, which like 35CS5 contained numerous mammal diaph- ysis fragments, shellfish and fish dominated the estimated dietary yields. Site location and type also influence the midden constituents at each site. 35CS2/3 produced a diverse artifact assem- blage, house remains, and an even distribution of faunal taxa including land and sea mammals and a variety offish (Losey 1996; Tveskov n.d.). In these respects, the site is similar to large estuarine vil- lage sites such as Umpqua-Eden (Lyman 1991) and Palmrose (Connolly 1992). The Whiskey Run site (35CS62), which also produced a rich assemblage of artifacts, possible housepits, and a fairly even distribution of faunal remains (deer, elk, pin- nipeds, fish, and shellfish) seems similar to other outer coast villages in the region (see Gould 1966; Minor 1991a). The smaller shell middens contain more spe- cialized assemblages and may be locations where fewer tasks were performed. The Graveyard Point site (35CS142) is dominated by estuarine shellfish and fish, and may have been a temporary or sea- sonal fishing camp. The Samuels site (35CS138), with extremely low artifact densities, seems to have been an outer coast camp dedicated primar- ily to mussel harvesting. The Coquille Point site (35CS136), which produced numerous bifaces, abundant lithic reduction debris, but only a small midden deposit dominated by mussel shells, may have been a quarry and camp (Tveskov et al. 1996). These five sites represent only a few of many sites along Coos Bay and the Coquille River, just two of the many drainages found along the south- ern Northwest Coast. Yet even this small sample is enough to suggest that the Late Holocene subsis- tence of the Native peoples of the area was eclectic and complex, harvesting a variety of habitats and resources. Sea mammals appear to have been just one component of a diversified diet that also in- cluded shellfish, fish, land mammals, birds, and a variety of plant foods. While pinnipeds may have played a central economic role at some sites lo- cated near major rookeries or haulouts, ethno- graphic accounts and faunal studies at several Oregon coast sites suggest that their overall impor- tance in many precontact economies of the south- ern Northwest Coast has been exaggerated. Even more than sea mammal hunting, the develop- ment of intensive salmon fishing and storage- based economies has played a central role in mod- els explaining the rise of cultural complexity on the Northwest Coast (see Moss and Erlandson 1995). To varying degrees, most explanatory mod- els view salmon fishing, processing, and storage as</page><page sequence="10">Erlandson et al.: Southern Northwest Coast of North America 15 co tì 0 y Ë i- H 13 co C/3 ca â o DO 0 «a 1 co cd co S T3 e co 0 ■s • p-H «4-1 CO 0 •i- i 0 S 1 a - . qq co «H S G ed cd d 0 G o o *l 2 ^ 2 ao S3 'S ä SÄ r- ( rH co ^ II -M ■sa P CO pu .2 " • pH Ü ■M P 2 S B g 2 • - ^3 o • Ss • r&gt; 0 co o G 2^ u G co 0 O $5 n pu o -s «s 0 p£j a; K eß in B 0 O5 ^ $ I g !"§ co * W cü Ö .. •SJ i CD *£ CM 5^ ^ ed e E u e S g u .5 a S S cd p2gS Ml 1 S» M OU critical to the development of ranking in North- west Coast societies. The organization of labor in- volved in constructing large fishing weirs and pro- cessing the large catches they provided has been seen as key to the rise of complexity. Economic management models hold that complexity devel- oped due to the adaptive value of elites as man- agers of large and complex labor forces needed to build weirs, harvest and process massive amounts of salmon, and maintain and distribute large food stores (see Schalk 1977:236). Some also propose that efficient labor management prevented overex- ploitation of salmon and other animal populations (e.g., Johnson and Earle 1987:168). Resource con- trol models generally assert that complexity arose as a result of groups actively controlling access to an abundant, localized, and reliable resource, such as salmon harvested at large riverine weirs (see Coupland 1985). Resource control - maintained by formal ownership, by investing in the construc- tion of a weir or other structure, or by living at or near the weir - allowed a group to raise their status by granting others access to the resource or by amassing a surplus (wealth) for exchange or redistribution. Little is known about early fishing strategies on the Northwest Coast or the antiquity of many technologies related to intensive fish harvests. Be- cause they can be dated relatively precisely, how- ever, a key to understanding such developments is the study of wood stake weirs and traps found in the anaerobic sediments of Northwest Coast estu- aries. Study of such weirs has accelerated in the past decade, with several northern Northwest Coast examples dated to between 3000 and 4500 years ago (Moss et al. 1990; Moss and Erlandson 1998b). On the southern Northwest Coast, little re- search has been done on northern California and southern Washington weirs, but Oregon has be- come a center of such research. Estuarine Fishing on the Southern Northwest Coast Along the Oregon coast, we have recorded more than 50 wood stake weir sites in six estuaries. About 30 of these sites have been dated via 14C or the presence of milled lumber elements. So far, the oldest Oregon coast weir dates to about 2400 RYBP and the most recent probably was used into the 1920s (Byram 1998; Moss and Erlandson 1998b). Most of the dated weirs were built in the last 400 years, but the dearth of older weirs may be due primarily to coastal subsidence, estuarine sed- imentation, and the generally smaller tidal range that governs the exposure of intertidal weirs of the southern Northwest Coast. Oregon coast weirs consist of fence-like lines of closely spaced wooden stakes driven vertically 4-&gt; cd 0 CO CM O CO CO . . . &lt;tf rH r* r-t £~ p-hOO COtfDCOrHin tH 2^ OO^^CDCM CD H Cd CM r* ^ r* O g g S H CM g cd S ■£ IO CO CD CT&gt; IN rH g t^ CM CM rH cd 2 r-l Tf rH O rH IN C CM CO CO *H CO 'S "an ^h 02r CDCT5OOO T-* P* ■£ CO O5 -^ CD CO ì? co in o o cm co ^ tH CM CM CD S eCDCONOCO 00 N M IOO3 O) CD CO O^ 13 rs &gt;ijy N CO H ^CSI ^ _£ ZZ O5 CD# rH ^ CD 00 _£ CO "S HO CM* rH Tf O ^2 *"* CO'dÒ COrHCDO^ t^ M CM rH ^ rt io IS. ^ CO rH CÔ CM* K K -4- &gt; - t- &gt; -4- &gt; CO CO CO cd cd cd o o o CJO &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; U U CJ .9 1 1 S3 S3 S3 .'S 0 CO CO P P ^ &gt;*» 00 H Oh 00 GO Ph Ph ä ila 11 co U &gt; &gt; U U 5 co S_ ^^ £p2 i«£L^i£S ^ Ü&amp; CMco^CDOO £S CdS ^v.

Weir stakes consist primarily of cut branches or staves split off larger logs, with both stake types being found in many weir features. In many cases, lines of weir stakes seem to have been used to funnel fish into basketry traps or other capture devices (Byram 1998). The overall struc- ture of most estuarine weirs is obscured by erosion or sedimentation, but most seem to have been built across shallow tidal slough channels that flowed through salt marshes. During high tide, water levels rose above the weir allowing fish to swim over the structure. As the tide dropped the weir emerged, stranding fish on the tideflats, fun- neling them into woven traps, or corralling them in small pools where they could be netted or speared. A second type of tidal weir, consisting of long arcing lines of stakes built atop mudflats, seems to have worked in a similar fashion but was not directly associated with tidal channels. At six Oregon coast sites, 19 pieces of woven split- wood latticework have been identified (Fig. 3). Most are too small to determine whether they were sections of basket traps or semi-rigid weir panels, but four large fragments found to- gether at the Osprey site on the Coquille River seem to be remnants of panels attached to weir stakes (Byram and Erlandson 1996:39). The size (gauge) of the woven mesh is very small for these fragments, with only one averaging larger than 1 cm. The dominance of small-gauge lattice sug- gests that many Oregon coast weirs were designed to capture small fish as well as large. In contrast, at Little Qualicum in British Columbia the gauge of lattice averaged 2.1 cm (Bernick 1983:289), while at Biederbost in Washington lattice gauges averaged about 6 cm (Nordquist 1976:198). These larger gauges are similar to ethnohistorically de- scribed latticework used in weir panels or basket traps built to catch salmon (Olson 1936:28; Jewitt 1987:107). A variety offish (i.e., salmon, steelhead, smelt, herring, perch, tomcod, anchovy, sculpin, flounder, sturgeon) are abundant in southern Northwest Coast estuaries, many of which inhabit intertidal shallows where weirs were built. Some species are available most or all of the year, while others inhabit estuaries for a few weeks or months during spawning runs, which occurred during all seasons (Monaco et al. 1990). Recent excavations at estuarine residential sites show that several dif- ferent estuarine fishes were economically impor- tant to Native peoples of the region (e.g., Losey 1996; Greenspan 1996; Tveskov n.d.).3 Both ar- chaeological and ethnographic data suggest that the subsistence of groups living around southern Northwest Coast estuaries involved broad-spec- trum fish harvests. Oregon coast estuarine weirs were built and operated very differently than the large riverine weirs described ethnographically (see Kroeber and Barrett 1960:13; Stewart 1977:99-106). None of the estuarine weirs we have identified, for exam- ple, appear to have been built across main river channels. So far, observed stake diameters indicate that larger support posts were not incorporated into estuarine weirs, suggesting that scaffolding or catwalks were not built atop the weirs. In general, estuarine weirs seem to have been considerably smaller and less elaborate than their riverine coun- terparts. Unlike large riverine weirs, which essen- tially blocked anadromous fish runs, estuarine weirs worked daily with the tides and may have been used for much of the year to catch a wide variety offish species (Jacobs 1932-34:96-22; Drucker 1939; Hewes 1940:22). At the height of some fish runs, the yield of estuarine weirs may have been substantial, but in general yields were probably more moderate and a less complex orga- nization of labor may have been required to har- vest and process the catch. Fish Weirs, Mass Harvests, and Social Ranking Along the southern Northwest Coast, archaeologi- cal and ethnohistorical research on estuarine weir fishing raises questions about explanatory models in which weirs and mass fish harvests are central to the development of social ranking. To a signifi- cant degree, both economic management and re- source control models are predicated on the no- tion that large fish runs were centrally located and temporally restricted. This may be true of large riverine weirs farther from the coast, but in the large estuaries of the southern Northwest Coast a much wider range of fish species was available much of the year and weir fishing seems to have been much more dispersed. Oregon coast weirs, at least, seem to have been smaller and simpler struc- tures, the construction and use of which may have been much more manageable by individuals or family groups. Estuarine fishing also appears to have been more eclectic and diversified - with anadromous spawning runs occurring during all seasons - and day-to-day harvest of resident fish species may have provided a substantial portion of annual weir harvests. Under such circumstances, elite resource management in harvesting, processing, and redis- tributing food stores may have been unnecessary. With a wider range of resources available for a greater part of the year, the importance of elite control of labor, stored goods, and redistribution also may have been reduced. Because tidal weirs were more easily built and used, more numerous and widely dispersed, and used for a much greater portion of the year, control of weir access would</page><page sequence="12">Erlandson et ah: Southern Northwest Coast of North America 1 7 Figure 3. Woven lattice panel from the Osprey site (35CS130), Oregon Coast (drawing by Eric Carlson; adapted from Connolly and Byram 1998). also have been considerably more difficult. Al- though the population base and resource abun- dance necessary to sustain social hierarchies seem to have been present on the southern Northwest Coast, the mechanisms that led to such complexity remain in question. Summary and Conclusions Since Paleoindian times, Native American peoples have lived along the southern Northwest Coast. The nature of the earliest adaptations to the coast, especially those predating about 5000 years ago,</page><page sequence="13">End Notes 1 8 Arctic Anthropology 35:1 remains largely unknown. The first firm evidence for the use of shellfish in the area now dates to about 8200 RYBP, but the record of Early and Mid- dle Holocene occupation of the coast remains spotty. It is currently unclear if the dearth of early coastal shell middens is due to regional geological forces (sea level changes, coastal erosion, earth- quake-induced landslides, site burial, etc.), to dif- ferential preservation of faunal remains in acidic soils, or to the relatively late development of in- tensive coastal adaptations. It seems likely, how- ever, that all three explanations play a role in shaping the archaeological record of the southern Northwest Coast. Until more Early and Middle Holocene coastal sites are identified and investigated, dis- cussions of the development of marine hunting, fishing, and gathering will be limited in their time depth. By the Late Holocene, the record of coastal adaptations is much improved, with more sites and site types distributed in a variety of habitats. As data have become available from a wider vari- ety of sites, our understanding of the complexity and diversity of human adaptations in the area has expanded. These archaeological data are also be- ginning to be more effectively compared to, and illuminated by, a wealth of unpublished ethno- historic and ethnographic accounts for southern Northwest Coast tribes. Both ethnohistorical and archaeological data from the region suggest, for instance, that the eco- nomic importance of sea mammals has been overemphasized in recent discussions about the development of Pacific coast societies. Zooarchae- ological data from the Oregon coast, including in- tegrated dietary reconstructions for several estuar- ine and outer coast sites, suggest that pinnipeds contributed relatively little to the diet of most coastal groups. Like the Native hunters before them, archaeologists studying southern Northwest Coast cultures seem to have been drawn to sea mammal hunting more for its dramatic visibility and inherent prestige value than for its importance in the subsistence quest. Regarding the role of fishing in the rise of cultural complexity, too much emphasis has also been placed on salmon fishing, especially on the use of the large riverine weirs emphasized in ethnographic accounts. In general, estuarine weirs seem to have taken less effort to construct and maintain, to have been used for a greater part of the year (possibly year round), and to have cap- tured a wider range of species. Ethnographic ac- counts suggest that some coastal groups used weirs communally, but the smaller and simpler es- tuarine weirs may have been more amenable to in- dividual or family use. On the southern Northwest Coast, the assumption that the mere presence of fishing weirs implies communal or corporate be- havior requiring elite management or control seems to be unfounded. Nonetheless, we take issue with the notion that southern Northwest Coast cultures were somehow marginal or peripheral to the "classic" Northwest Coast cultures to the north. The north- ern cultures are better documented ethnographi- cally and archaeologically, but whether they at- tained significantly higher levels of sociopolitical, economic, and technological complexity remains to be seen. The coasts of Washington, Oregon, and northern California clearly supported relatively large, sedentary, and culturally complex Native American populations, especially around the large sheltered bays or estuaries that punctuated the coast at regular intervals. In our opinion, the foun- dation of those large populations and complexity was not any single resource (i.e., salmon) or suite of related resources (i.e., sea mammals), but a di- versified and relatively eclectic adaptation to a va- riety of productive marine, estuarine, riverine, and terrestrial resources. 1. Here we exclude the Makah, who in many ways are more closely aligned with Native cultures to the north. 2. We know of only two accounts of Native whale hunting south of the Quinault. In 1851, Nathan Schofield described an unsuccessful whale hunt in the Siuslaw River estuary, where men attempted to shoot and lance a whale. Gibbs (1857:4) stated that the Alsea and Yaquina went to sea in large ca- noes "and do not hesitate to fasten to the whale and kill him." We found no other accounts that confirm this practice. 3. Some ethnographically important species are underrepresented in Oregon coast faunal assem- blages. Though intensively harvested and stored historically, Pacific lamprey [Lampetra sp.) skele- tons are cartilaginous and unlikely to be preserved archaeologically. Ethnographic accounts also sug- gest that smaller fishes (i.e., sardines, anchovies, and smelts) were often cooked and consumed whole. Acknowledgments.
