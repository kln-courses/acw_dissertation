<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ali A. MAZRUI and Teshome WAG AW The Case of Education and Culture Conflict in Eastern Africa I. INTRODUCTION. A persistent and obstinate question in Africa since European colonization is whether modernization is feasible without Wester nization. Can the new universe of technology and the Nation State, the new realities of participation in the world economy, the new languages of international communication and State craft, the new toys and gadgets ranging from the transistor radio to the dish-washer, ever be adopted increasingly in Africa without a concurrent deepening of acculturation ? Can the corpus of Western science and technology be embraced without an African capitulation to Western culture ? These questions have, of course, been confronted before in other parts of the world. The most dramatic confrontation was, on the one hand, Japan after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 and, on the other hand, Turkey in the wake of the Ata turk Revolution after the First Word War. The Japanese en gaged in purposeful cultural selectivity, captured in their slogan « Western Technique, Japanese Spirit » ! They planned to pick and choose from among the different elements of the Western heritage. They were particularly interested in technique but as pired to preserve enough of the Japanese soul to render their society authentically itself. Turkey under Kemal Ataturk decided that a modern body could not thrive with a traditionalist soul and that Western techniques could not effectively be utilized without adopting Western culture. The Ataturk régime went to the extremes of promoting Western dress, adopting European words into Turkish in exchange for Arabic loan words and forcing the pace of popular secularization even to the extent of being anti</page><page sequence="2">210 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE religious. Ataturk decided that Westernization was the only route to modernity. The Japanese, on the contrary, decided that there were different roads to the culture of modernism. Purely on the basis of performance by the two countries, it would seem that the Japanese were right. Even before their second economic miracle following Word War II, they demons trated that they could match the West in its technological game without accepting too much of Western culture. And yet there are other differences between Japan and Turkey which might lead towards explaining comparative performance between the two societies. It becomes important, therefore, for every other non-Western society to explore this dilemma between modernity and Westernism. This paper limits itself to the field of education, perhaps in many ways the most important arena of culture-conflict in Africa. What educational traditions already existed in Eastern Africa when the European imperial powers arrived ? What were the basic ends and purposes of those educational traditions ? What changes have now taken place as a result of the European model of education ? These are some of the issues that we are proposing to confront in this analysis. Three traditions of education in Eastern Africa antedate the European impact. We might call these the indigenous, the Afro-Christian and the Afro-Islamic. What we have, therefore, is a triple heritage in Eastern Africa before Westernization got under way. The indigenous tradition in our sense refers to the educational methods and customs traditionally observed by the different ethnic groups. Communities like the Baganda, the Kikuyu, the Samburu, the Somali and the Chaga, all had their own ethnic systems of transmitting skills, values and ideas. These different ethnic systems add up to our categories of the indi genous tradition. The Afro-Christian tradition refers especially to Ethiopia, but not exclusively. Most parts of Eastern Africa received their Christianity from Western missionaries and teachers. The religion and culture of Jesus came with the label « imported from Eu rope ». But Ethiopia is a striking exception in Black Africa. Christianity first arrived in Ethiopia in the fourth century after Christ, when much of Europe was not as yet Christianized. Over the centuries, the local cultures in Ethiopia were, in an important sense, Christianized ; but, on the other hand, Chris tianity in Ethiopia also became substantially indigenized. Edu cation through the Coptic Church of Ethiopia was therefore a striking amalgam of tradition and was very different from education through schools built by European missionaries.</page><page sequence="3">1" PRÉ-COLLOQUE (1ST PRE-COLLOQUIUM) 211 The third tradition which existed in Eastern Africa before Europe intruded was the Afro-Islamic trend. This included the Qur'anic schools throughout the sub-region. The influence of the Arabs both from the Nile Valley and from Southern and Eastern Arabia was an important element in this tradition, but indigenous Muslim leaders were also part of the cultural and educational scene. This then was the triple heritage of pre-colonial Eastern Africa — and then, in the last third of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth, Europe established a decisive presence in this part of the world. With that intrusion came a fourth model of education; Before long, the great dilem ma which had agitated the Japanese after the Meiji Restoration, and the Turks, especially after the First World War, began to rear its head on the African horizon. Were African cultures backward and anachronistic ? If so, could they be brought up to date without being totally replaced by Western culture ? Was selective modernization a contradiction in terms ? The colonial powers themselves differed in their own ap proaches to this problem. The British were more like the Japa nese : they believed that selective modernization was feasible and that the heritage of the West need not entirely destroy the tradition of the colonized. British political culture itself at home had all along found selective modernization congenial. England led Europe in the Industrial Revolution while still maintaining monarchical and aristocratic institutions. At least for a while England became both the workshop of the world and the paradigm of modernized feudalism. The House of Lords sat in session discussing policies on industrialization, ready at times to block the ideas of the House of Commons. Both Britain and Japan had, in fact, succeeded for a while in mobi lizing a semi-feudal class structure into an instrument of indus trialization. Both of them had tapped the culture of deference and transformed deference into discipline. The Japanese genius of synthesis has lasted longer than that of the British. What is clear is that the latter invoked the same genius in aspects of their colonial policy. The doctrine of Indirect Rule utilized in their African colonial policies amounted to a commitment to exploit local institutions and culture rather than destroy them. The British made use of Ugandan kings and Nigerian princes ; they respected many local customs and encouraged the utilization of local languages in education, at least at the elemen tary level. In contrast, the French were closer to Ataturk and the Tur kish Revolution than to the Japanese and the Meiji Restoration. Like Ataturk, French colonial policy believed that there was only</page><page sequence="4">212 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE one dependable road to modernity and civilization — the Western road. Perhaps the French vision was even narrower — emphasiz ing the French road. At any rate, a whole colonial doctrine of assimiliation was worked out in Paris, designed ultimately to turn Africans into approximations of the French themselves. Educationally, this doctrine meant considerable integration bet ween colonial schools and the metropolitan system of education. The doctrine also meant no compromise with local African lan guages as media of instruction. While children in English speaking Africa did not have to learn geography in the English language until their third or fourth year of school, children in French-speaking Africa plunged into the intricacies of the French language in the very first grade. Nor did cultural relativism greatly moderate the curriculum in a colonial institution. The idea was to expose the colonized as rapidly as possible to real genuine French educational culture. If Turkey had fallen under French colonial rule, Ataturk would have fully sympathized with the French mission. But although there were, indeed, real differences among the colonial powers, these differences were only a matter of degree. Under colonial and neo-colonial control, regardless of the impe rial power, Africa found itself being modernized through the process of Westernization. The schools which were established under colonial and missionary sponsorship were modelled in European images of educational institutions. To the present day, these schools are Euro-Modern in conception and have yet to evolve into Afro-Modern educational media. These, then, are the four traditions which will concern us in this paper but they will be related to four different, though sometimes overlapping, foci of education. Firstly, does the edu cational system implicitly and objectively focus on serving so ciety ? If so, the ultimate purposes of the educational system are sociocentric. Does the educational system aim mainly at serving God ? Is the religious purpose of an Islamic Qur'anic school, or a church school in Ethiopia, so powerful that it constitutes almost the raison d'être of the enterprise ? If so, the orientation of the educational system is theocentric. Does the educational system cultivate and promote a broader understanding of Nature and the universe independently of service to either society or God ? Does it encourage curiosity about things which range from the mating patterns of beetles to the movement of stars in the cosmos ? If so, those sections of the educational system are (at least to some extent) ecocentric. Is the educational system ultimately committed to the business of enabling every individual to fulfil himself or herself and</page><page sequence="5">1« PRÉ-COLLOQUE (1ST PRE-COLLOQUIUM) 213 release individuality and creative energies from person to person ? If the philosophy of the educational system includes this commit ment to the ideal of individuality, the orientation is to some extent egocentric (but using the world « ego » without its pe jorative connotations). In addition to the four traditions of education (indigenous, Afro-Christian, Afro-Islamic and Euro-Modern) and the four foci of education (sociocentric, theocentric, ecocentric and ego centric) this paper is also concerned with the three functions performed by education in Eastern Africa : training, socializa tion and acculturation. « Training », in our sense, is about the transmission of skills. « Socialization » is about the transmission of values, perspectives and a sense of identity in relation to the wider society. « Acculturation » involves cross-cultural trans fers, the impingement of one system of values upon another — at times, an interaction between whole civilizations. Let us now relate these three functions of education and the four foci to the four traditions of educational experience in Eastern Africa. II. THE INDIGENOUS TRADITION One characteristic about indigenous (« tribal ») education in Eastern Africa is that it is functionally versatile. The educational systems of the different communities have traditionally sought to transmit a variety of skills in the context of traditional culture, ranging from such economic skills as crop cultivation and animal husbandry to the military skills of warriorhood. In many tradi tional communities, warriorhood was an important rite de passage for every male child. So might the skills of making a livelihood also be important preconditions for initiation into adulthood. Traditional education also quite often included sex education. Usually, the transmission agents were neither dispassionate teach ers distant from the family nor were they the parents of the children. Sex education was ideally transmitted by uncles, aunts, or grandparents — partly depending on the customs of the different communities. Sex education was, of course, important for both boys and girls but other aspects of domestic preparation could be gender specific. In some societies, the cultivation of land was part of the preparation of women, while control over the animals was a prerogative of the men. But, in addition, women were called upon to acquire the traditional skills of housekeeping, ranging from rearing children to cooking.</page><page sequence="6">214 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE This functional versatility also carried with it non-formality. We prefer the world « non-formality » to « informality » since the latter has acquired connotations of casualness and lack of structure. Important areas of traditional education included structure, sometimes highly elaborate. Nor is casualness a proper attribute for many methods of socialization and training in traditional societies. There were elaborate rules for the trans mission of knowledge, skills and values. Joking relationships in a particular culture could be a subtle and complex pattern of interaction, with taboos and incentives which required skill to master. But traditional education is not formal in a Euro-Modern sense either. There need not be special classrooms for children to be trained in ; no special hours for mathematics as against geography ; no elaborate grading systems to measure performance and progress. Because indigenous education is not as formal as this, we might rightly distinguish it from the schematic framework of Western education. This brings us to the third dimension : the fact that there is no sharp distinction between education and socialization, between school and family. The transmission of both skills, on the one hand, and general values, on the other, might well be done by the extended family in the first instance, without the mediating rôle of a neutral school system. The processes of training and socialization also merge. The transmission of skills in handling cattle, or of a warrior in combat, and the transmission of values of masculine responsi bilities, are often part of the same process of both training and socialization. As for the balance between focus on society (sociocentrism) and focus on individuals (egocentrism), indigenous education scores high on the former and relatively low on the latter. The idea of these native systems is not to release the intellectual independence of the individual and lay the foundations of individual self-fulfilment but to prepare the individual for an honorable and constructive rôle in society. What should be remembered is that there are some variations among the different « tribal » cultures. For example, it is ar guable that the Kikuyu in Kenya encourage greater individualism than do the Banyoro of Uganda. A spirit of entrepreneurship is often stronger among the Kikuyu than among the Banyoro. It has also often been suggested that the Ibos in Nigeria encourage greater individualism in their culture than do the Hausa. This difference might itself have been one of the major contributory factors behind the Hausa uprising against the pros perous Ibos in 1966 in which thousands of the latter were killed.</page><page sequence="7">1" PRÉ-COLLOQUE (1ST PRE-COLLOQUIUM) 215 The riots themselves were part of the background to the Nigerian Civil War. But while the balance between sociocentrism and egocentrism does, indeed, vary from one traditional indigenous society to another, on balance it would still be true to say that most African educational traditions lean towards collectivist socializa tion rather than individualist orientation. Yet another characteristic of most indigenous systems of edu cation is that they are based on the oral tradition rather than on the written one. This is not to suggest that the written tra dition has been entirely absent. On the contrary, both the Amha ric literary culture and the Kiswahili literary culture are centuries old but most « tribal » educational systems in Eastern Africa operated on the basis of the supremacy of the oral tradition, with only a minor rôle for the written world, until very recently. The sixth characteristic of indigenous education is that it is, on the whole, unicultural. It is concerned with the transmission of a particular system of values and functions, a particular cultural universe. This contrasts with the Afro-Islamic and Afro Christian traditions which are, on the whole, bicultural, involving a Middle Eastern religion and local normative ways. As for the Euro-Modern systems of education, these are ultimately multicul tural. This is both because, across the centuries, European civilizations have borrowed and absorbed elements from diverse civilizations such as the Judeo-Christian, Greco-Roman, Indian, Islamic, Chinese and the like. The sources of European civili zation are thus diverse. Secondly, the fact that European civili zation is the vanguard of modernity has itself made it trans cultural in scope in the contemporary world. It has, in fact, been conquering one culture after another. But indigenous approaches to training and socialization among, say, the Karomojong of Uganda or the Masai of Kenya and Tanzania, are almost ideal types of unicultufalism. They have tended to resist the influence of other cultures and have not attempted in turn to conquer other cultures either. In reality, no culture is ever an island unto itself. We are talking here about degrees of cultural separateness. Of the three functions of education (training, socialization and acculturation) the last is least relevant when we examine indigenous systems, except insofar as these systems are now increasingly threatened by the conquering power of either Western or Islamic civili zation. What about the focus of ecocentrism in indigenous educational approaches ? To what extent is man's relation with Nature a central interest in traditional training systems ? Again, there would be some variation between one ethnic</page><page sequence="8">216 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE community and another but, in any case, we must distinguish here between ecological curiosity and ecological concern. Ecolo gical curiosity is that framework of intellectual agitation which seeks to explore and discover new factors about Nature. The impulse behind it is, quite simply, the excitement of thirst for knowledge without reference to function. Certain forms of this curiosity are very selective, as individuals sit for hours studying birds and their habits just for the sheer enjoyment of observa tion. Other individuals develop appetites for underwater explo ration, studying shells, fish and geological formations beneath the sea. Such extra-curricular interests are much more part of Western civilization than of African. Ecological concern, on the other hand, goes beyond mere fascination with the environment. It implies a commitment to conserve and enrich, and sometimes a capacity in man to empa thize with Nature. It implies a readiness on the part of human beings to see a little of themselves in their surroundings. Eco logical concern requires a totemic frame of reference. To that extent, it is much more deeply interlinked with fundamental aspects of African belief systems than it is with European ones. Ecological curiosity is an aspect of science in its quest for explanation and comprehension ; ecological concern is an aspect of morality in its quest for empathy. Africa's record in the field of ecological concern is more impressive than that of Eu rope's : Europe's record in ecological curiosity is more dazzling than that of Africa's. Historically, Europe's ecological curiosity was linked to both science and commerce. The sources of funds for exploration (both seafaring and overland) were varied. Bodies like the Royal Geographical Society (important in the exploration of Africa) were primarily motivated by scientific considerations. On the other hand, much of the vigorous exploration to find sea routes to the Orient was inspired by considerations of trade and diplo matic rivalry among the European powers. European ecological curiosity did not limit itself to parts of the world which were habitable or commercially exploitable. The same spirit which made many a European adventurer seek to conquer Mount Everest simply because it was there, also made him explore other unknown areas of the human environ ment, including the Arctic and the Antarctic, often at consider able physical peril. There is little doubt that Europe's record in this field is second to none in human history and with that record her technological and scientific edge over the rest of the world began to widen. With regard to ecological concern, many African societies went to the extent of identifying themselves with specific animals</page><page sequence="9">I" PRÉ-COLLOQUE (1ST PRE-COLLOQUIUM) 217 as totems. Clans among communities like the Baganda adopted totemic symbols which established a sense of continuity between Nature and man. Indeed, many African belief systems still include animistic tendencies, which blur the distinction between man and Nature, the living and the dead, the divine and the human. These systems did not assert a monopoly on the soul for the human species alone. Could a tree have a soul ? Could a mountain have a soul ? Could a river, in spite of its flow, retain a soul ? Again, it took poets in Europe to appreciate the belief systems of societies such as those of Africa and the native Americans before the ecological curiosity of Europe hit them hard. Alexander Pope, in spite of himself and his desire to be proper in Christian terms, nevertheless felt his muse drawn to the world-view of the so-called « savage » : « (...) whose untutored mind Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind ; His soul proud Science never taught to stray Far as the solar walk or Milky Way ; Yet simple Nature to his hope was given, Behind the cold-topt hill, an humbler Heaven (...) » (1). Pope himself moved then to a pantheistic interpretation of the relationship between man. Nature and divinity. Carried away beyond his orthodox Christianity, the poet asserted that « All are but parts of one stupendous whole, Whose body Nature is, and God the soul ; That change through all, and yet in all the same, Great in the earth as in the etherial frame, Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze, Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees (...) » (2). What all this means from the point of view of this paper is that African educational systems at the indigenous level encouraged a moral concern about animals and rivers and hills and trees, but did not encourage an intellectual curiosity into the essence of their nature and the dynamics of their existence. African educational traditions did, indeed, produce cultures which were capable of treating leopards, hyenas, monkeys, and even snakes, as brothers, sisters and cousins, sharing a world. This (1) Alexander Pope : An Essay on Man [edited by A. Hamilton Thomp son] (Cambridge University Press, 1913). Also edited by Mark Pattison (Oxford University Press, 1887). (2) Ibid.</page><page sequence="10">218 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE could at times be a morality of ecological universal brotherhood. But those same African cultures fell short of developing physics, chemistry, zoology, botany and mathematics. Ecological ethics was not accompanied by ecological science. But the nature of ecological concern in African culture cannot always be distinguished from issues of divinity and religion : « All are but parts of one stupendous whole, Whose body Nature is, and God the soul (...) All Nature is but Art unknown to thee ; All Chance, Direction, which thou canst not see : All partial Evil, universal Good » (3). Drioerg defines the Nilotic concept of Jok in terms which see it once again as the force which unifies the whole of Nature : « Jok, like the wind or air, is omnipresent, and like the wind, though its presence may be heard and appreciated, Jok has never been seen by anyone (...) His dwelling is everywhere ; in trees it may be, or in rocks and hills, in some springs and pools (...) or vaguely in the air » (4). It was a Kenyan Nilote, B.A. Ogot, who helped to confirm this interpretation of a force permeating all things : « The spiritual part of man, the only part which survives death, is Jok, and it is the same power which is responsible for conception as well as for fortunes and misfortunes. Thanks to the Nilote, Jok is not an impartial universal power; it is the essence of every being, the force which makes everything what it is, and God Himself, "the greatest Jok" is life force in itself » (5). What emerges from all this is that ecocentrism in many African societies is virtually indistinguishable from theocentrism, a concern about Nature inseparable from a concern about God and the supernatural. Indeed, the triangle in many African societies consists of God, man and Nature permeating each other. Religion, sociology and the natural sciences are thus interfused. But at least in one part of Eastern Africa this fusion began to be undone centuries before the colonization of the sub-region. Christianity arrived in Ethiopia and in time the relationship between ecological concerns and divine purpose became compli (3) Ibid. (4) J.H. Driberg : The Lango.

It is to this Afro-Christian phenomenon in Ethiopia that we should now turn. III. AN AFRO-CHRISTIAN LEGACY. From the 4th century of the Christian era, the Ethiopian church, with the active moral, political and material support of the reigning monarchs, nobility and other people of power, assumed the responsibility of educating functionaries of the church and high-ranking civil and military leaders. The focus on serving God through educational institutions and the focus of serving society through those same institutions were unmis takeable from early times. The church assumed full responsi bility for training priests, debtra (deacons), monks and scholars. The church schools were not proselytizing institutions as were the later church schools of Roman Catholicism and the dif ferent schools of European Protestantism operating in Africa. On the contrary, the Ethiopian church schools were designed to produce religious and secular leaders and tended therefore to attract students from among the converted. There was a built-in élitist bias in the educational system in contrast to the other forms of indigenous educational traditions which sought to initiate every young person into the ways of society. Interest in developing the individual and enhancing his capa city for personal self-fulfilment was very low from the beginning. In other words, almost no part of Ethiopian traditional education sought to emphasize ego-related areas of vindication and accom plishment. But the training and socialization for God and society were, for a while, quite strong and productive. The Ethiopian system sought to assume the triple responsibility of enriching the culture, transmitting it and conserving it from generation to generation. The ultimate custodians of the culture and traditions of the Ethiopian (Abyssinian) State were thus the Ethiopian church and the nobility. But although the church itself was now an amalgam of at least two civilizations (the indigenous and the Christian) the country entered into a long period of isolation. The country was almost insulated from international intercourse from the 7th century to the 17th. This sense of withdrawal denied Ethiopian society an adequate stimulus for creative change. This was aggravated by a series of national turmoils. The pro ductive forces that had been the catalyst in the creation and</page><page sequence="12">220 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE advancement of one of the most advanced civilizations that Africa has produced, became increasingly stagnant to the point of ossification. The system of education did continue to engage in some kind of training and was of course still involved in maintaining a system of socialization. But acculturation as a channel of cross-cultural fertilization seemed to be drying up. It was in the 19th century that the intellectual impoverish ment of Ethiopia began to be understood by Ethiopian reformers themselves as contact with the more aggressive European civi lization revealed differences in power and sophistication. And yet, Ethiopia in the same period also demonstrated the resilience of its own legacy following a series of military successes against major European powers. As the country began to interact once again with the outside world, it found itself lacking in the vital areas of modern statecraft, industry, diplo macy and commerce. Instead of trying to reform the existing educational structure, Emperor Menelik II decided to import a foreign model of schooling from Europe. As might have been expected, this move aroused the indignation of church leaders and a period of sustained resistance ensued. After Menelik's death, the country was plunged into turmoil once again, this time to be rescued by Haile Selassie I who captured the throne. He was himself a product of one of Menelik's schools and following in his footsteps he sought actively to expand the new educational system and to control it, while at the same time maintaining imperial influence on the more traditional schools as well. The new Emperor was convinced that the modernization of society required the modernization of the educational system and the production of better educated manpower. But Haile Selassie also believed that these newly-educated products could be manipulated and brought to conform to the requirements of traditional sources of authority and power. He believed Ethiopia could be modernized without being destabilized. He thought he could risk exposing the imperial system to the scru tiny of the educated. This contrasts with traditional Ethiopian attitudes towards scrutinizing the majesty of God Almighty. The traditional edu cational culture of the church emphasized communication with God rather than interpretation of God. It was deemed to be sinfully arrogant to attempt to understand God. This included discouragement of the study of such branches of knowledge as astronomy. One consequence of this attitude was a discour agement of the natural sciences. After all, the rise of the study of science both in Islamic civilization in the first eight centuries after Muhammad, and among Puritan scholars in Britain and</page><page sequence="13">1" PRÉ-COLLOQUE (1ST PRE-COLLOQUIUM) 221 America in the 18th and 19th centuries, was partly due to the religious motive of trying of understand the ultimate glories of God. Thus, ecocentrism in science was, in reality, derived from a theocentric effort to praise God by demonstrating His genius in Nature. But, in Ethiopian tradition, there was a curtain of mystery that was part of the majesty of God. For a mere mortal to seek to open the curtain was presumption of the worst kind. That ecological curiosity which had inspired European science was effectively restrained by Ethiopia's insistence on respecting God's privacy and maintaining divine mystery. Far from theo centrism leading to ecocentrism (as it had done among Muslims in the Middle Ages and the Protestant Revolution in more recent times), Ethiopian tradition made worshippers retreat in modest embarrassment from the majesty of the Lord. It was like avoiding looking at the Emperor in the eye. Casting one's eyes down in the presence of the human Emperor had its equi valent in man's relationship with God. Ethiopian educational traditions also discouraged the achieve ment motive within individuals. No man was in control of his own destiny, except perhaps the Emperor, and if a particular individual appeared to triumph against all odds and accomplish something momentous, tradition assumed that he was possessed by divine power. This certainly applies to the great Ethiopian musical genius of the 6th century, St. Yared, who invented musical notations and composed music which seemed truly inspired. The church took the word « inspired » in its old theolo gical meaning of divine intervention. Subsequently, the musical composer was canonized. Such brilliance in an individual could only be accounted for by divine intervention. In battles, great acts of heroism by individuals were often attributed either to God or to the Emperor. So limited was the room for individual achievement that it seemed a wonder that Ethiopia fought with such distinction in the 19th century and created such an interesting civilization from the 4th century onwards. The achievements of the Falasha Jews appeared more para doxical to the Christian Ethiopians. On the one hand, they were kept at a distance socially and in many ways treated as an outcast group. Theologically, since they were not believers, one would have expected them to be distant from God's grace as interpreted by the church. Yet clearly the Falasha were gifted in certain skills such as pottery, weaving and smithery and in the production of plowshares arid sickles, all necessary to farmers. In these areas of work, the Falasha often outskilled any Chris tian imitator.</page><page sequence="14">222 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE Well ? Had there been divine intervention to make the Falasha more skilled in spite of the fact that, as non-believers, they were theologically damned ? Popular opinion among Christians was not consistent on this issue. There was an assumption that the Jews, indeed, possessed special skills, but this did not reduce the social distance which had been created by the former to keep the latter in their place. On balance, it remained true that the original church forms of instruction discouraged the achievement motive in the individual and was therefore a denial of egocentrism. Those forms of instruction, as we have indicated, also discouraged curiosity about general ecology. Only theocratic and sociocentric tendencies were empha sized, supported and encouraged to flourish. * * * Haile Selassie I attempted to introduce changes. But did he still want the majesty of the Emperor to retain its mystery, and thus maintain its legitimacy ? Was he hoping that the newly-educated would continue to cast their eyes down, fearful of the dazzle of the imperial presence ? Could he promote modern education and still save the old traditional and monar chical order from critical scrutiny ? As it turned out, it was precisely because of the creation of a modern secular educational system that the glaring anomalies of society were progressively exposed. The dazzle of the Emperor was not enough. Students at the University in Addis Ababa were getting increasingly radicalized. The newly-arrived trainees from abroad had also been exposed to alternative paradigms of social and political order. The stage was set for the 1974 Revolution which overthrew the Emperor and fundamentally, perhaps even permanently, changed the course of Ethiopia's recorded history of thirty centuries. With the disruption of the old social order and an attempt to create a new national ideology, the school system is changing. Because the new ideology is socialistic, it can be presumed that egocentrism will continue to be discouraged in the new era. Because the current régime is Marxist, it is to be expected that theocentrism (a preoccupation with God) will be diluted in the educational system if not eliminated. Because socialism is pre occupied with creating a new class order, it is to be expected that sociocentrism will reign supreme for the time being in the new educational philosophy. And because socialism claims to be a science, and asserts its linkage with other branches of human knowledge, curiosity about ecology may well rise to a</page><page sequence="15">1" PRÉ-COLLOQUE (1ST PRE-COLLOQUIUM) 223 new level in the years ahead. Ethiopia might at last produce an adequate number of physicists, chemists and biologists of international caliber, as it has in the areas of literature, painting, philosophy and traditional medicine. But, under the new régime, is the system still Afro-Christian ? The Christian culture of Ethiopia could not be abolished over night by the intervention of soldiers from the barracks, nor could the African foundations of its culture (whether recognized as such by the establishment or not) be destroyed in a single decade of political turbulence. What is clear is an attempt to move from Afro-Christian institutions to Euro-Modern institutions (but patterned after the models of Eastern Europe rather than Western). Ethiopia might well be in transition from Afro-Christianity to Euro-Modernity of the Marxist kind but the transition may take much longer than the reformers currently realize. It may be necessary for them to innovate and create not a European form of modernity but an African approach towards similar goals. The period of innovation in Ethiopia lies in the future, the period of imitation and experimentation is now at hand. Christianity, of course, is not the only religion from the Middle East that has profoundly affected institutions of training and socialization in Africa. Islam has also played a comparable rôle in different parts of the continent, including parts of Ethio pia itself. Indeed, there is a tradition among Muslims that Islam's first contact with the African continent was, in fact, throught Ethiopia. This happened when the Prophet Muhammad was being persecuted in Mecca. Some of his followers (so it is suggested) were forced to cross the Red Sea in search of refuge among the Habash. The Prophet himself also subsequently fled, in the direction of the city of Medina. He lived to fight another day and established his own political control over those who had once persecuted him. It is to the impact of Muhammad's religion on African educational systems that we must now turn. IV. THE AFRO-ISLAMIC HERITAGE. Although Islam's first contact with Africa might have been via the Horn, its first conquests took place further North. Soon after the Prophet died, the new leaders in Arabia decided to take on two major empires of the ancient world — those of</page><page sequence="16">224 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE Byzantium and Persia. Against all odds, this presumption paid off and Arabs entered the main stage of world history. Persia was subjugated and Egypt was detached from Byzantine suze rainty. We define Islamization as the process of converting people religiously and Arabization as a process of assimilating people linguistically. North Africa underwent both processes. Elsewhere in Africa, where Islam has established a presence, what have emerged are communities who profess the faith of Islam rather than communities for whom Arabic is the mother tongue. For our purposes, let us regard Northern Sudan as part of North Africa because both Islamization and Arabization triumphed there. But in places like Senegal, Mali, Northern Nigeria, Tanzania and much of the Horn of Africa, the triumph has been religious rather than linguistic. And yet, though Arabic has not become the mother tongue of Muslims like the Fulani or the Somali, some level of Arabic has always accompanied Islam. This is partly because prayers require a good deal of recitation from the Qur'an and there are five compulsory prayers a day for Sunni Muslims. Muslims are also encouraged to read or recite the Qur'an in other contexts outside formal prayers — ranging from weddings to mourning ceremonies, from celebrations of the birthday of the Prophet (Meelad) to learned conversations among the literati. Inevitably, therefore, there began to develop in the Islamized parts of Eastern Africa a special institution for the teaching of the Qur'an. In some cases, there was co-education in such institutions but this was rare. Most Qur'anic schools in Eastern Africa were for boys though girls were taught to recite the Qur'an in private homes. Occasionally, special schools for girls were established. The three relevant R's in these schools were not « Reading, Writing and Arithmetic » but tended to be « Reading, Reciting and Ritual ». Indeed, one of the striking things about these particular small educational institutions was the sharp differen tiation between reading and writing. Far more emphasis was put on reading than on writing and some schools assigned next to no writing exercices to pupils. Part of the problem was due to the perception of Muhammad himself as a man without the skills of literacy. The Qur'an itself is regarded as a miracle precisely because the Prophet (who uttered all the verses under inspiration) was illiterate. The first verse to be revealed concerned issues of reading and reciting. Muhammad used to retreat to the Hill of Hira near Mecca and contemplate in isolation. This was before he sensed he had a divine mission. One day, when he was sitting on this hill near sunset, he suddenly saw a being who later introdu</page><page sequence="17">1" PRÉ-COLLOQUE (1ST PRE-COLLOQUIUM) 225 ced himself as the Angel Gabriel. Gabriel said to that fright ened and lonely man : « Read and recite ! » Muhammad was more bewildered than ever. He protested that he was not among the literate. Then Gabriel uttered the first verses of what later became Islam's Holy Book : « Read and recite in the name of God who created man (...) and who taught man what he did not know before ». Many Muslims in different parts of the world have concluded that the imperative of literacy is one of God's priorities but what constitutes literacy has turned out to be culturally relative. Popular opinion in East Africa (at least before the impact of the more aggressively literary Western civilization) was modest in its aspirations. The ability to read the Qur'an, without neces sarily understanding it, was often deemed to be adequate. Many young East Africans can pronounce Arabic sounds remarkably well and can read the printed page of the Qur'an with smooth facility. And yet if one singles out any particular phrase and asks the reader to say what it means, it is not at all certain that he would rise to the occasion. The Qur'an is sometimes read in a manner comparable to an American opera singer singing Verdi in the original Italian. The singer need not under stand every world or every phrase of a particular song though he or she must at least capture its mood. Qur'anic schools are definitely not élitist. Most parents until recently made provision for their children to learn the rudiments of Islam and the skills of recitation but, in addition, there were sometimes evening classes in mosques in parts of Eastern Africa. These were often more sophisticated and taught by instructors who were much more learned. At times, even grown ups attended. Some of these classes concerned verse by verse interpretation but more often they addressed themselves to the broad ethics and theology of Islam, ranging from the nature of prayer to the precise rituals of the pilgrimage to Mecca, from stories about the childhood of the Prophet to aspects of the laws of marriage and divorce. Certain classes also addressed themselves to sex education from an Islamic point of view. Sexuality was discussed in very explicit terms, sometimes using Arabic words for « penis » and « vagina » as euphemisms to avoid using local sexual vocabulary. But, on the whole, these classes were frank and explicit about conception, the rules of intercourse and the necessary conditions for cleanliness according to Muslim precepts. Evening classes were opened to anyone who cared to attend and there were no fees charged (unlike day classes) wnere some contributions were expected to help the Mwalimu's (teacher's) livelihood.</page><page sequence="18">226 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE Adult education classes were concerned with more advanced interpretations of the Qur'an or more advanced lessons in Islamic law, theology and ethics. These were normally held once or twice a week. There are also seasonal classes. This is particularly true of the month of Ramadhan during which Muslims are required to fast from before dawn to dusk. Almost every afternoon, in carefully selected and centrally located mosques, special darsas (lessons in Islamics) are held. Particularly popular are those concerned with elaborate literary, contextual, and historic inter pretations of Qur'anic verses and sometimes a whole afternoon is spent discussing one single verse. The Sheikh (or professor) discusses the Qur'an in the local language after translating it from the Arabic. He refers to the verse's revelation, the circums tances which led to God's intervention in this way, the impli cations of the verse, its relationship to other verses, its impact on Islamic law and so on. Some of these Sheikhs are immensely learned and local people who do not normally go to darsas turn up in large numbers during Ramadhan. The fifth level of Islamic education was truly elitist and was the equivalent of going to a University. Only a few places in Eastern Africa commanded that degree of scholarly respec tability. The most widely acclaimed was the Riyadha in Lamu on the Kenya coast. Lamu is a small town which still has an air which is almost Biblical and has been protected from tourist invasions by its relative inaccessibility for a substantial part of the year when the road leading to it is virtually washed away by the rains. But the mosque of Riyadha, and the learned Islamic community of scholars there, were for a long time widely accepted as the pinnacle of Islamic scholarship in East Africa. A select cadre of students from other parts of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda found their wey there to learn at the feet of the great teachers. Many of the latter were supposed to be masharifu, or descendants of the Prophet. Arabs had been coming to the coastal parts of Kenya and Tanzania with the monsoons for centuries, and some of them had intermarried with local people. The masharifu of Lamu, especially if they were very learned, commanded considerable reverence and admi ration. There were also other major centres of Islamic learning in Eastern Africa. These included Zanzibar (before the Revolution of 1964), Mogadishu in Somalia and Kobokoni in Mombasa. There were also learned scholars scattered from Tanga in main land Tanzania to Kibuli in Kampala. Islam in Ethiopia was overshadowed most of the time by theocratic Afro-Christianity. Indeed, it was not until the radical</page><page sequence="19">1" PRÉ-COLLOQUE (1ST PRE-COLLOQUIUM) 227 socialist revolution of 1974 that Islam received theoretical parity with Christianity in the country. * * * Throughout Eastern Africa, Islamic education was primarily theocentric and, to a lesser extent, sociocentric and the aim of cultivating individuality was often remote. It sought to promote either conformity with the will of God or conformity with the customs of society. The achievement motive in the individual was seldom encouraged except to the extent to which it signified excellence either in piety or in social conformity. As for concern with the ecology, this was more charac teristic of Islam in parts of Saudi Arabia than in Eastern Africa. The harshness of climatic conditions in the Arabian peninsula sometimes created strong bonds between human beings and ani mals and a strong sense of identification with the elements. The image of a lonely camel-driver in the midst of a wilderness carries with it the metaphor of fusion of man, animal and the desolate environment. The nomadism of certain Somalis creates similar bonds but elsewhere Islam has been relatively insensitive to ecological issues. Where African Muslims have identified with animals or trees or hills, it has been in spite of Islam rather than because of it. After all, many combine in their belief systems and values, elements from both their own indigenous religious culture and the new imperatives of the minaret. On balance, ecological sensitivity has tended to be more characteristic of the indigenous heritage. As for the balance between training, socialization and accul turation, the training part in Eastern Africa has been the weak est. Islamic education has not really been designed to transmit functional skills. The emphasis on « Reading, Reciting and Ri tual » has not exactly been a quest for skilful utilitarianism. Islamic education has, however, included a marked preoc cupation with pious socialization. Much of the effort in the mosque evening classes has been devoted to the task of producing knowledgeable citizens sophisticated in the ways of their religion and culture and able to respond to the rules of social life and to the imperatives of religious life in areas of experience which range from prayer to sexuality. As for the functions of accul turation, this is clearly implicit in this sub-region where Islam is an outside civilization interacting with cultures of the locality and producing distinctive combinations of values, perspectives and beliefs. To that extent, Islam in Eastern Africa is, almost</page><page sequence="20">228 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE by definition, a cross-cultural phenomenon. Normative transfers and normative exchanges are part of the natural order of inter action in such a situation. The spread of Islam as a religion in the sub-region was, to some extent, arrested by European colonization. This is in contrast to the West African situation where Islam continued to spread and conquer in spite of European imperialism. But, since independence, East Africa has witnessed a revival of the confidence of Muslims. This is part of the global pheno menon of the Islamic resurgence. In reality, theology has declined in influence but Islam has begun to reassert itself politically. This is partly connected with the rise of oil power because the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is overwhelmingly a Muslim institution. This has made even those parts of Eastern Africa that are primarily Christian respond more seriously to the views and aspirations of the Muslim world and cultivate more self-consciously the loyalties of their own Muslim minor ities. With this theological decline, Muslim educational institutions have also been on the wane. The old Qur'anic schools have been disappearing as more and more children go to secular schools, often based on principles of Euro-Modernity. Theolo gically, the crescent over Eastern Africa is the dying crescent of the 21st day of the lunar month but, politically, the crescent is the younger crescent of the new moon. Educational patterns in the sub-region are a reflection of this interplay between the young political crescent on the ascent and the old theological crescent in decline. V. THE EURO-MODERN CHALLENGE. The most ascending of all cultural trends in Eastern Africa is the rise of Western civilization. All other educational institu tions have been on the defensive as a result of the staggering conquering power of Western values and perspectives. Western motives in promoting education have fluctuated between utilitarian cynicism and idealistic missionary commitment. The former included the desire for administrative functionaries drawn from the native population to consolidate European rule or control. The latter, on the other hand, combined both the pursuit of the good life for the natives in this world and the pursuit of salvation in the hereafter. In the earlier phases of colonial rule, the missionary factor was more pronounced. The</page><page sequence="21">1" PRÉ-COLLOQUE (1ST PRE-COLLOQUIUM) 229 colonial powers, hampered by other political considerations, succumbed to the temptations of convenience. Part of their burden as trustees of the colonial territories could be borne by religious and philanthropic institutions from their own part of the world. To such institutions, Africa was regarded as a new moral horizon in need of redemption. It was a rugged ethical frontier, requiring the moral adventurism of the Gospel in adversity. The Bible left Europe in search for the soul of Africa. The missionary school was part of that search. As the colonial political presence became more consolidated, the State took greater responsibility for the social services gener ally and sought to exercise greater control over those provided by private philanthropic and religious organizations. As it turned out, the schools and colleges established by European missionaries and colonial governments were the greatest instruments of acculturation in Eastern Africa. Curiously enough, the main instrument of acculturation was not religion but lan guage. We have noted that, in the case of the Islamic impact on Africa South of the Sahara, religion was the major founda tion of culture transfers and normative convergence. But with regard to the Western impact, it was Western languages rather than Christianity which, in the end, turned out to be the most important transmission belt of values and ideas. This was so in spite of the fact that, very often, these languages were being taught by missionaries. The stratification system of the sub-region has undergone dramatic modification as a result of this linguistic influence. In one African society after another, the élite has, in part, been defined in terms of mastery of the imperial language. Competence in either English or French or Portuguese (depen ding upon who was the imperial power) constituted credentials for leadership and the basis for influence. Qualifications for election to the national legislature rested in part on command of the relevant language and participation in the executive branch of government similarly assumed such competence. In the majority of African countries today, it is inconceivable that the President should be a person who knows only native languages and is not at the same time a pretender to European linguistic competence. What all this means is that a marked power of acculturation is the most distinctive aspect of the Euro-Modern tradition of education. But is this education also a form of socialization ? In some senses, it might be so described but it is perhaps at least as arguable that Euro-Modern education has been a process of deserialization. It has tended to divorce children from the norms and values of their parents. It has been inclined to dis</page><page sequence="22">230 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE Africanize the Africans — moving in the direction of assimila ting them to the conquering paradigm of the European world view. In Eastern Africa, it has often constituted a cultural magnet, attracting local populations irresistably towards it. Parents have sent their children unhesitatingly to missionary schools in quest of supposed skills which, in fact, amounted to cultural impe rialism. One result today is that most Africans refer to whole sub-regions as English-speaking, French-speaking and Portuguese speaking. We hardly ever refer to French-speaking Asia or English-speaking Asia. The identities of Asian countries seem less tied up with the linguistic heritage of their former imperial masters. In addition, the intrusion of European perspectives has shar pened two foci which, on balance, have been weak in Afro Christian and Afro-Islamic trends and, to some extent, in indi genous traditions. These distinctively Western emphases have been the focus on individualism and the focus on ecological curiosity. Education as the purposeful cultivation of individual genius is, from our point of view, a strikingly innovative intrusion into the complexities of the African cultural scene. The idea that educational processes were designed to release the individual from the constraints of religious dogma or social conformity was clearly a wind of change. Individualism in Western-style schools had three main sources. One was liberalism which, politically, had been developing in the direction of maximizing individual choice in the electoral system and individual autonomy in the wider political system. The second major ingredient was the principle of individual accountability in the Protestant ethic : the individual stood in terms of direct answerability to his or her Maker. The third source was the new secular orientation of the natural sciences with a commitment to original thinking and independent scien tific methods in relatively objective conditions. In the system, individualism took a variety of forms. In examinations it was regarded as unethical to copy from other students or share their insights directly. Plagiarism was regarded as the supreme sin. Each student or pupil had to struggle under his or her own steam. Copying from others could, in some Western schools, result in expulsion. Many Westerners had for gotten that great geniuses like William Shakespeare plagiarized right, left and centre from other playwrights or artists. The idea of virtually treating the work of somebody else as a pro portion of one's own collective heritage was, in Western civi</page><page sequence="23">1" PRÉ-COLLOQUE (1ST PRE-COLLOQUIUM) 231 lization, strictly circumscribed by considerations of individual achievement and accountability. As students towards the end of their career embarked upon Ph. D. programmes either in African Universities or in their Western equivalents, the focus lay disproportionately on the originality of the candidate. To this extent, the Euro-Modern tradition has often been strikingly egocentric. Ecocentrism has also played an above average rôle in the Euro-Modern tradition. Being curious about Nature to the extent of investing a whole lifetime in it was something distant from many African cultures. As we have indicated, many inhabitants around Mt. Kilamanjaro never bothered to conquer the mountain simply because it was there. It took the culture of white people to develop elaborate systems of encouraging young men and women to climb it simply as an experience in personal indi vidual achievement or sometimes as collective teamwork. Theocentrism has made a medium contribution in recent times rather than an especially striking one. The missionary schools did indeed proselytize (unlike the schools of the church of Ethiopia) but, on balance, after World War II, the actual focus on God and His miracles in Western schools in Eastern Africa was considerably weakened. What all this means is that the Western tradition scored high in three functions : it scored high in promoting individua lism (egocentrism) ; it scored high in cultivating a concern and curiosity about the environment (ecocentrism) ; it scored high on releasing the individual and reinforcing his or her creative energies without necessarily promoting either submission to the will of God or conformity with the ways of man. The rôle of Western education in training has also been relatively striking. In reality, there were important differences among the colonial powers. For example, Belgium tried to encourage vocational training and to relate education more sys tematically to functional utilitarianism in what was then called the « Belgian Congo ». It seemed to work for a while but when politics overwhelmed administrative policy and the Congo had to become independent sooner than envisaged, the whole system collapsed in the face of educational and training defi ciencies. Britain and France, on the other hand, were less oriented towards practically relevant forms of training. At first glance, this should have meant disaster at the time of independence and, in some cases, it has indeed meant disaster but, on balance, the former French and British colonies are much better off from the point of view of educated manpower than Zaïre can claim to be.</page><page sequence="24">232 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE On the whole, the Euro-Modern educational systems have paid more attention to the needs of training and to the trans mission of functional skills than most indigenous, Afro-Christian or Afro-Islamic systems. But, underlying the whole impact of European education on African patterns of socialization and training, is the deep seated spectre of dependency as a kind of cultural imprisonment for yet another generation of bewildered Blacks on the African continent... VI. TOWARDS AN AFRO-MODERNITY. Is there a way of escaping from this cage of cultural and educational dependency ? Is there a way of fully releasing the energies of the African peoples without enticing them towards imitation and emulation ? Part of the answer depends upon the accepted definition of « development ». For our purposes, development equals moder nization minus dependency. But what is modernization ? We state that it is change which is compatible with the present stage of human knowledge and does justice to the potentialities of man as a social and inno vative being. This definition encompasses three imperatives : modernization includes the imperative of action informed by know-how ; it includes the imperative of action based on expan ding social horizons ; it includes action based on the facilitation of innovation. But what is dependency ? Again, this could mean either surplus need or deficit control. Country B is dependent on Country A if Country B has greater need for Country A than A has for B. Surplus need is on the part of Country B. Deficit control occurs when Country B is dependent on Country A if Country B has less control over the relations between the two countries than Country A has. These two principles need not always pull the same way. For example, until recently, the Western Powers needed Saudi Arabia more than she needed them. It might therefore be argued that the latter were the dependencies of Saudi Arabia since they were in the torment of surplus need but they really con trolled Saudi Arabia and she therefore had deficit control over her relationship with the consumers of her own oil. These two principles therefore need to be weighed in relation to particular case-studies. For our purposes, it is sufficient to</page><page sequence="25">1» PRÉ-COLLOQUE (1ST PRE-COLLOQUIUM) 233 note that modernization is identical with Westernization for as long as the modernization process includes heavy dependency upon the West but it begins to be divorced from Westerniz ation if there is a systematic attempt to reduce dependency and imitation. As for the essence of modernization, we have indicated that it postulates action informed by genuine know-how, familiarity with the science of cause and effect and training in calculating ends in relation to means. Modernization also requires expanding social horizons, moving away from an obsession with clans and tribes to an interest in the wider national environment and an ultimate commitment to planetary solidarity. Thirdly, modernization is a readiness to accept innovation, to submit to the imperatives of reform where this seems jus tifiable, to respond to a basic readiness to try out the new or even put the old to eternal rest. The achievement motive in modernized conditions sometimes requires the imperatives of innovation. Eastern Africa is caught up in these dialectics and dilemmas. Sociocentrism and theocentrism have tended quite often to be the greatest bulwarks of tradition and continuity, the pointers to conformity. God and society in Eastern Africa in the 20th century have been the joint magnates of divine submission and social cohesion. « For God and Country » — that was the fusion of piety and patriotism. But at the level of modernization, egocentrism and theocen trism might provide a more strikingly relevant alliance. Ego centrism includes, in this case, a commitment to independent thought and individual experimentation, an abode of creative autonomous thought. Egocentrism could be an infrastructure for producing individual geniuses like Darwin and Einstein. Yet these very examples in turn illustrate the potentialities of ecocentrism. Isaac Newton stood there wondering why the apple fell downwards instead of upwards. The laws of gravi tation were conceptualized as a result of that exercise in musing. The environment was posing puzzles, teasing the intellect. Great Western minds proceeded to seek answers to those puzzles. The stage was set at the highest level for invention but also at a lower level for experimentation and innovation. The quest for Afro-Modernity must continue beyond this cen tury. Once again, such modernity should be weighed against the dictates of genuine development which is, indeed, the process of modernization minus dependency. Indigenous systems of education might seek to protect them selves against excessive dependency simply by attempting to</page><page sequence="26">234 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE discover levels of authenticity and investigate their compatibility with the dictates of modernization. The Afro-Christian heritage in Ethiopia has, in any case, suffered severe strains in the aftermath of radical socialist revolutionary change. Dependency upon Eastern Europe and its culture would still prevent modernization in Ethiopia from being a genuine development since it would still include dependency. But at least a trend is under way in both Ethiopia and Somalia, a trend to reconcile imported ideologies with local realities, alien paradigms with cultural flows. The Afro-Islamic tradition also needs to come to terms with modernity. In Kenya, the colonial authorities set up in the 1940's and 1950's the Mombasa Institute of Muslim Edu cation for the peoples of Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Zanzibar and Somalia. The great majority of instructors were European and the students were exclusively Muslim. Was the curriculum the Qur'an ? Of course not. The curriculum consisted of mecha nical and electrical engineering, the nautical sciences, chemistry, mathematics and even carpentry and woodcarving. The Governor of Kenya, Sir Philip Mitchell, decided that the Muslims of Eastern Africa needed, above all, a major initiation into the technological aspects of Western civilization. He thought he could help to realize this through promoting an interterritorial college of technical education. He succeeded in persuading His Highness the Aga Khan and the then Sultan of Zanzibar to commit some of their own resources to its establishment. The dream came to fruition and young Somalis, Zanzibaris, Ugan dans, Kenyans and Tanganyikans found their way to Mombasa. Islam was in the process of being married to a new techno logical civilization. The level was quite modest but the Insti tute was symbolic of the conquering power of Western educa tional systems, even when they are sympathetic to non-Western ways. Similarly, African cultures are challenged by Westernization. It still remains to be seen whether dependency can be transcended and Afro-Modernity at last achieved for better or for worse. In the final analysis, the educational struggle in Eastern Africa has three aims : the elimination of Euro-Modernity, the creation of Afro-Modernity and the gradual integration of the indigenous, the Afro-Islamic and the Afro-Christian traditions of education under the broader umbrella of Afro-Moderni zation. This triple process of eliminating the European paradigm, creating a new African one and integrating African traditions in the context of the newer indigenous paradigm, would require a new balance between and among society, the individual, the environment and the realm of the spiritual.</page><page sequence="27">1er PRÉ-COLLOQUE (1ST PRE-COLLOQUIUM) 235 ♦ * * Another area of re-definition concerns the balance between ecocentricsm and theocentricsm. We mentioned earlier that African traditions tended to lean towards ecological concern — a moral identification with the wider environment — while Western traditions tended to lean towards ecological curiosity — a scientific enquiry into Nature. Ecological curiosity in the West, unaccompanied by ecological concern, has led to pol lution, depletion of resources, a threat to the ozone layer and a reckless insensitivity to the delicate balances in Nature. On the other hand, mere ecological concern among African people without adequate sophistication and inquisitiveness has led to moral empathy with animals but devoid of a scientific under standing of their needs. In the religions of the Western world (especially Christianity and Judaism) sacredness tended to be monopolized by the human species. Man was created in the image of God and the hereafter was conceived in anthropomorphic terms. Cats, snakes, trees and lakes, on the other hand, had no soul in this Judeo Christian cosmology. In contrast, African religions tended to give a sacred nature to rocks and mountains and identified sacredness in at least some of the animals with whom Africans shared the wider environment. By making a sharp distinction between God and Nature, the West fostered scientific curiosity about the latter without marrying that curiosity to a moral concern about the environ ment. African cultures, on the other hand, refused to concede any sharp distinction between God and Nature. Ecological con cern was deepened but ecological curiosity, even under the Afro-Christianity of Ethiopia, was basically minimal. The challenge of modernization without Westernization from this point of view is a genuine marriage between the traditional ecological concerns of African societies and the new ecological curiosity of Western civilization. Educational curricula in Africa should reflect this basic fusion. In addition, there is the need to balance ecology not only with God but also wifh society. This, in our view, would be a quest for an area of accommodation between ecocentrism and sociocentricsm. Again, African societies have drawn no sharp distinction between the social world of animals and the social world of human beings. Totemism involved clans of a society identifying with different animals in the environment. The bond between a clan and its symbolic animal often involved a vow never to harm the animal and certainly never 10 eat it. The</page><page sequence="28">236 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE clan of the goat would not eat goat meat ; the clan of the snake would not kill a snake. The boundaries between human beings and other animals were blurred. Modernization without Westernization also requires taking advantage of this blurring. African educational institutions should reflect precisely these anthropological and ecological aspects of our societies. Schools should address themselves to the dilemmas existing between ecological conservation and social and economic development. Much of the worst harm to the environment has been perpetrated by the more advanced societies but African countries should be aware of their own heritage of linkage between ecology and society : while they are struggling for economic and social development, they should marry those imper atives to the inheritance of their own past. Curricula in schools should be sensitive to the world of wild animals, to the realities of our mineral resources, to the dangers of soil erosion and desertification and to the dynamic relationship between population growth, social distribution and ecological balance. The precise equation could mean the difference between Westernization and autonomous modernization. Then there is the question of balance between egocentrism and sociocentrism. African cultures tended, before the European impact, to be heavily sociocentric while Western systems tended to reveal a propensity towards egocentrism. Educational institutions in Eastern Africa are already explor ing the possibilities of where to draw the line between the promotion of individualism and the cultivation of social commit ment. Tanzania has found one solution in creating a national service for its youth. Those who obtain opportunities in educa tional institutions are also called upon to serve (for modest returns) in major areas of national need as technicians, assistants or professional types. National service could mean military service but, in the final analysis, policy lies in the direction of develop ment. The educated are deemed to have extra responsibilities towards the wider society. Another aspect of the Tanzanian experiment is the revised system of admission to the University of Dar es Salaam. Intel lectual performance in pre-University examinations is not the only determinant of who goes there. Some sociocentric creden tials, including service to the ruling party, are now required. These political criteria may sometimes shock Western observers but they are part of the effort to moderate individualist intel lectual performance by considerations of wider social loyalty. Another part of the experimentation in marrying individualism to social commitment includes courses which are devised to at tract all students, regardless of their discipline. Again, Dar</page><page sequence="29">1" PRÉ-COLLOQUE (1ST PRE-COLLOQUIUM) 237 es Salaam has experimented with a course about society and development and Makerere University has devised a course on development designed to expose not only students in the huma nities and social sciences, but also students in medicine, the natural sciences and engineering, to the wider imperatives of social need and economic concern. Once again, this seems to be one route of modernization which is not necessarily a process of Westernization. As for the precise balances between the individual and God, or the individual and Nature (egocentrism, ecocentrism and sociocentrism) these would be allowed to work themselves out in the process of historical change. The transition from dependent Westernization to autonomous modernization will not resolve all the dilemmas of interaction between man, Nature and the ultimate. ♦ * ♦ Under the African sun, both Kamal Ataturk and the Meiji Restoration have cast their shadow. As of now, Africa is leaning towards Ataturk — tending to accept Westernization as the only road to modernity. But both Ataturk and Africa may be wrong.
