Keeper of Irish Antiquities, National Museum of Ireland (Communicated by G. Eogan, m.r.i.a.) [Received 20 November 1989. Read 4 October 1990. Published 21 December 1990.] ABSTRACT This paper surveys the formal relationships of the early medieval eucharistic chalices of Ireland and Britain. The structural complexify of the Ardagh and Derrynaflan chalices is discussed, together with the question of the uses to which chalices of varying size were put. It is argued?following Elbern?that the surviving insular chalices share a sufficient number of common traits to form a distinctive group. They stem,' with other metal chalices, from a common late Roman ancestry although they may have been influenced by vessels in other media such as glass or semi-precious stone. Much of the distinctiveness of the great Irish silver chalices comes from adapting local traditions of bowl-making and technology to the task of producing imposing communion plate. The domed foot with pronounced foot ring is common to five of the seven insular vessels, while all are relatively broad and have large cups. The hypothesis of a direct connection with Byzantine chalices of the sixth century is considered and found to be unsatisfactory. 1. Introduction The discovery of the Derrynaflan hoard in 1980 prompted a number of recon siderations of the metalwork of early medieval Ireland. Attention was once again devoted to the form of the Irish and related eucharistic vessels, with de Paor (1980), Harbison (1981, 237) and the writer (Ryan 1983a, 15; 1984a; 1984b, 144?6) giving renewed life to the proposition that the Ardagh chalice embodied influences from the Byzantine world as exemplified in the hoards of ecclesiastical silver from Syria (Mundell Mango 1986). Such a notion had been given currency by Conway (1923) and Gogan (1932, 10-11) and chimed with the assumption of substantial and direct oriental influence in the arts of Ireland (see Raftery 1965). A great deal of work has been published on the chalices of early medieval Europe in modern times (Haseloff 1951; Wilson in Wilson and Blunt 1961; Elbern 1963; 1965a; 1965b), but the focus of attention for Irish-based scholars writing on the Ardagh chalice was its magnificent ornament, its dating and, for a time, the question of its place of manufacture. The discussion of the Ardagh chalice was, however, taken to a new level with the publication of Organ's (1973) analysis which, together with Wilson's (in Wilson and Blunt 1961) examination of the Trewhiddle and Bona's (1966) of the Petohaza ('Cunpald') chalices, provides the starting-point for any discussion of the formal relationships of early medieval communion cups. Elbern's (1965b) paper on insular chalices attempted to place the Irish and Anglo-Saxon vessels then known in a wider European context. It is surprising that his paper has had so little influence in Ireland. The corpus of information on Byzantine comparanda was brought together conveniently in works by Dodd on silver stamps (1961; 1973), now re-examined The subvention granted by the National Museum of Ireland towards the cost of publication of this paper is gratefully acknowledged by the Royal Irish Academy.

The finding of the Water Newton hoard (Painter 1977) has revived interest in the earliest liturgical vessels. It seems appropriate therefore to attempt once again to place the Irish and other insular chalices in their wider context in the light of the information now available. This paper concerns itself with the formal characteristics of the chalices and does not consider ornament or liturgical function in any detail?these will be treated of in the forthcoming publication of the Derrynaflan chalice prepared by the writer. 2. Outline survey In his fundamental survey of the eucharistic chalice in early medieval Europe Elbern (1963) listed 37 examples ranging in date from the fifth to the early twelfth century. The chalices are, with two exceptions, of metal?the exceptions being the chalice of Dona Urraca at Leon (no. 19), composed of two antique agate dishes fastened together, and the Lebuinus chalice in Utrecht (no 35) which is made of ivory. Appendix 1 lists chalices of European provenance in the period to the Romanesque-Gothic transition after Elbern's (1963) appendix, together with a supplement to include recently discovered relevant vessels. Elbern's list did not include certain exotic composite hardstone vessels such as the 'Coupe des Ptolomees' (Cabinet des Medailles, Paris) and the 'Heinrichskelch' (Residenz Schatzkammer, Munich), although such chalices are considered by him in his discussion. Since he published his survey a number of important discoveries have been made, especially the Galognano (Von Hessen et al. 1977) (nos 38-41) and Derrynaflan (no. 42) hoards. The list, excluding the Water Newton cup which is Roman in date (Painter 1977), now stands at 53. In a sense, this is an artificial figure as the continuity of chalice traditions in the western church throughout the Middle Ages is self-evident and it could readily be enlarged to include later examples. The cut-off point in the early twelfth century has some particular validity for a study based on insular chalices because of the great changes which took place in Ireland during the reform of the native church and later with the Anglo-Norman invasion. Changes were also taking place in the liturgy throughout the west as the communion cup was withdrawn from the faithful and other practices?such as elevation of the chalice?developed. Of the total, therefore, listed here, eight are insular finds. Two other eucharis tic vessels?the Water Newton cup already mentioned and the grave chalice from Mellifont, Co. Louth (de Paor 1969, 138-9)?are not included in these figures: the former is discussed in relation to the origins of chalices while the latter, being of thirteenth-century date, lies outside the scope of this paper. The Hazelton cup (no. 37) is not thought by Elbern to have been of insular workmanship. This cannot be decided either way as the vessel is known only from an illustration but it seems to have belonged to the Continental series of grave chalices. Its simplicity makes dating extremely difficult. Of the 53 chalices listed, 30 were found in graves and nine (Ardagh (nos 7 and 8), Trewhiddle (no. 20), Gourdon (no. 23), Galognano (nos 38-41), Derrynaflan (no. 42) and Lough Kinale (no. 45)) were discovered in hoards. A small number (Braga, the Menendus Gundisalvi chalice (no. 4); Essen-Werden, the Luidger chalice (no. 9); Kremsmunster, the Tassilo chalice (no. 17); Leon, Dona Urraca's chalice (no. 19); Nancy, the Gauzelin chalice (no. 22); Utrecht, the Lebuinus chalice (no. 35); and Washington D.C., the Grimfridus chalice (no. 36)) were</page><page sequence="3">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 283 preserved as founder's donations, votive offerings or relics from ancient times although not always in the churches to which they had been first presented (e.g. nos 9 and 22), and some had a chequered history (no. 36). Of the insular chalices, five were found in hoards (nos 7, 8, 20, 42 and 45), one in a grave (the Hexham chalice, no. 10), and the provenance and find circumstances of one are unknown (the Ulster Museum vessel, no. 46). Of the metal chalices listed by Elbern and in the supplement, 36 are of silver, eight are of copper alloy, five are of gold (the Gauzelin (no. 22), Gourdon (no. 23), Trier (nos 33 and 34) and Tyniec (no. 43) chalices), and two are of lead. Of the grave chalices, 26 are of silver, three are of gold (two from Trier (nos 33 and 34) and one from Tyniec (no. 43)), one is of copper alloy and one of lead. Five of the grave chalices are less than 6cm in height, eight between 6cm and 7cm, three between 7cm and 8cm, eight between 8cm and 9cm, two between 9cm and 10cm, and four between 10cm and 11cm. Cup diameters range from the 2.96cm of no. 53 to the 7.7cm of no. 26 (Siegburg). Nineteen of them have rim diameters of between 3.5cm and 6cm; the diameters of five (nos 10, 24, 43, 48 and 52) are in excess of this while the values of four others are unknown to the writer. The vessels placed in graves share with travelling chalices the obvious characteristic of small size. In form they correspond closely to their larger counterparts as they do also in choice of raw materials. Only one is a purely votive object made of lead?the context of the Hazelton lead chalice is unknown. It is clearly misleading to claim that base metal was especially appropriate material for funerary chalices, although there is evidence of a high medieval tradition that chalices of base metal were made for such purposes (Roland-Krahl 1967, 278, note 26). The larger chalices listed vary greatly in size and capacity. This is clearly related to function?to the use of the chalice to contain the wine consecrated by the celebrant or to contain larger quantities for administering the Eucharist in the form of wine to the congregation. Of the surviving chalices?including grave chalices?listed, the overwhelming majority are of silver. Many of these may well have been gilded but only five are recorded as certainly gilt or partly gilt while seven of copper alloy are so treated. This is clearly a reflection of the liturgical tradition which gradually gained full acceptance that silver and gold were appro priate to chalices and, presumably, copper alloy required gilding to make it suitable. Braun (1932, 43) noted that chalices of silver and gold became common, if not the rule, in inventories from the ninth and tenth centuries onwards. Fifteen chalices bear decoration, some of them several varieties of ornament, and six carry filigree, eight metal vessels bear inscriptions and four engraved ornament; five are jewelled or enamelled and two are inlaid with niello and silver, and two further with niello alone. Forty-two metal chalices bear knops at or near the junction between the stem and bowl while two, the 'Menendus Gundisalvi' chalice at Braga (no. 4) and the Santa Domingo do Silos chalice at Burgos (no. 27), have low swellings in mid stem. A very small number of metal chalices (five in all) are equipped with handles?the Ardagh silver chalice (no. 7), Gauzelin (no. 22), Gourdon (no. 23), Rheims, the chalice of Archbishop Gervasius (no. 24), and the Derrynaflan chalice (no. 42). Of these, two (nos 7 and 42) are insular and one, the chalice of Gervasius (no. 24), is from a grave. A substantial number of early Byzantine chalices?mostly of silver?exist and those known to the writer are listed in Appendix 2. Of the 23 vessels listed, one is of copper alloy and the remainder are silver. They were found in the main in Syria with three examples from modern Turkey and one from an unknown locality. A</page><page sequence="4">284 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy number of other metal vessels of possible relevance to the discussion of chalices are listed in Appendix 3. In addition to these, a substantial corpus of composite chalices with cups of semi-precious stone is preserved in the treasury of San Marco in Venice?these appear to be mainly of tenth-century and later date, and they are discussed here as exemplars of those chalices combining hardstone cups with metal mounts which are known from documents to have existed at an earlier period. Some hardstone vessels survive from early medieval western Europe and these are added to the discussion where appropriate. Pl.

In what follows, the insular chalices are described and illustrated, followed by a discussion and comparison of the surviving Continental examples.

Insular chalices The term 'insular' here denotes objects of early medieval date found in Ireland and Britain; where the terms 'Irish' or 'English' are used, a geographical connota tion is intended. Seven early medieval chalices of undoubted insular workmanship survive (Appendix 1, nos 7, 8, 10, 20, 42, 45 and 46)?the great two-handled silver chalices from Ardagh (PI. I) and Derrynaflan (PI. II) respectively; the copper alloy chalice</page><page sequence="6">286 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 3cm Fig. 1?Chalice from Lough Kinale. from Ardagh (Pl. Ill; Coffev 1909, 37, 39; Gogan 1932, 18, 56; Elbern 1963, 68; Mitchell 1977, 138-9, no. 34; Ryan 1983c, 125, no. 51b); an unpublished bronze cup in the Ulster Museum (Bourke 1989) (Pl. IV); the silver chalice from the Trewhiddle hoard, Cornwall (Pl. V; Wilson and Blunt 1961, 81-2); the unpub lished chalice found with a paten at Lough Kinale, now in the National Museum of Ireland (Fig. 1); and the Hexham vessef (Pl. VI; Wilson and Blunt 1961, 90; Elbern 1963, 51, pl. 63, 69, no. 10; Bailey 1974, 150-5). A lead chalice of uncertain origin from Hazelton, Gloucestershire, now missing, was exhibited at the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1942 (Wilson and Blunt 1961, 90; Elbern 1963, 51, pl.</page><page sequence="7">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 287 64, 76, no. 37). The Water Newton cup, which clearly belongs to a different cultural and chronological context, is not included in the discussion here. Likewise, cups from other Roman silver treasures found in Britain (survey in Toynbee 1964, 301-15) are excluded because the later ones have no specifically liturgical significance while the earlier belong to a non-Christian context. A claim that the shallow silver bowls from the St Ninian's Isle treasure are chalices (MacRoberts 1961) has been convincingly dismissed by Wilson (1973, 106-7). Dr Peter Harbison has drawn my attention to handled, chalice-like vessels repre sented on some Irish high crosses (e.g. Muiredach's Cross, Monasterboice, Pilate washing his hands: vessel to the right of Pilate's knee, end of arm, south side (Roe 1981, 35, pl. viib; Harbison 1986, 56, pl. III)). In both cases the vessels have roughly hemispherical bowls and lugs or handles at rim level. The vessel in the Pilate scene has no particular eucharistic function. A chalice appears between the figures of SS Paul and Anthony on the gable end of the house-shaped finial of Muiredach's Cross, and a comparable scene occurs on the Market Cross at Kells (Roe 1981, 21). The story of these saints, sustained by bread brought by a raven, has strong eucharistic connotations (O Carragain 1988). A stylised depiction of a chalice was identified by Henry on slab D at Caher Island (Henry 1947, 37 and pl. 8, no. 4) and at Cloonlaur, Co. Mayo (ibid., 35 and fig. 8). The sculptures are simple, very attenuated and, if meant as chalices, they would have been vessels without handles. The stone carvings of chalices or possible chalices are of little help in documenting eucharistic vessel types in Ireland. Likewise, the alleged glass chalices in the Book of Kells (f. 33v) (see below) shed little light on Irish liturgical vessels because they may have been copied from exotic sources together with other details of the painting where they occur.

One hemispherical mount from Naerb0, Rogaland, Norway (Warners 1983, 282), is added to Appendix 1 (no. 54) as a possible chalice foot. Stone lamps, often described as chalices in nineteenth-century literature, have been ignored. Most attention in dealing with insular chalices has focussed on the great silver vessel from the Ardagh, Co. Limerick, hoard (Dunraven 1874) which has been analysed structurally by Organ (1973). This complex object consists of a large, beaten, lathe-polished silver cup and a large foot with a pronounced foot-ring, likewise of hammered and lathe-polished silver. The gilt stem is of copper alloy cast in three parts (PI. VII)?an upper ring seating the bowl, a cylindrical section and a lower ring placed on the foot. Bowl and stem are united by a large copper alloy pin which passed through the stem and was intended to lock by means of split leaves on a catchplate on the underside. The structure proved unsound because the pin had been made too short to provide effective locking and so, in antiquity, a plug of molten lead was poured into the hollow of the stem in an effort to stabilise it. The chalice was provided with a pair of small handles scarcely large enough to admit two fingers. These spring from decorated escutcheons riveted to the bowl and are fastened at the rim. A band of filigree panels and enamel studs bounded by applied half-round mouldings girdles the bowl and passes through the handles. On each side the bowl bears a medallion in the form of a cross of arcs in a circle with filigree and enamels. The rim of the vessel is an applied roll-moulding and Organ has shown that it covers a thin flaring lip (Fig. 2). Other decorative features include ornaments and mouldings applied to</page><page sequence="9">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 289 ^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_Bl#?? &gt; * &lt;A^Lc^y^^s__^_^_^_^_^_^_HH_l_l_H_B Pl. VII?The Ardagh chalice, exploded view (photo: British Museum). the upper and lower sides of the foot and the catchplate as well as an incised band below the bowl girdle with the names of the Apostles lightly engraved, together with zoomorphic, anthropomorphic and abstract ornament. It is not the purpose of this paper to examine the minutiae of the decoration of the Ardagh chalice?opinion differs in detail about the date of the piece (see inter alia Ryan 1987a and Rynne 1987) but all are agreed that it belongs to the eighth-century heyday of Irish metalwork. The present writer favours a date roughly in the mid to later eighth if not the early ninth century7 in view of the vine-scroll derivative ornaments which it shares in part with the closely related Derrynaflan paten. It is enough to note here that it is a complex assembly with a beaten, hemispherical bowl, a large domed foot with a broad foot-ring, and cast tripartite stem, all held by a large pin. Its ornaments are applied as discrete panels in the case of filigree and as cast enamel (strictly speaking, glass) studs gem-set together with stamped foils and knitted wires. The Ardagh chalice is closely matched by that found in the hoard of ecclesiasti cal metalwork at Derrynaflan, Co. Tipperary, in 1980 (Ryan 1980, 18-20; 1983a; 1984b) although the latter lacks the applied rim and the two applied medallions (Fig. 3). A copper alloy pin passing through the tripartite stem unites the bowl and foot. The stem is hollow and evidently the structure of the chalice is sound?the joints of the stem have been supplemented with riveting and unlike the Ardagh</page><page sequence="10">290 Proceedings of the Royal Irish A cademy ^-1 85--&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ? /^^^^^^^^^ Dimensions in mm Fig. 2?Profile of the Ardagh chalice (after Organ 1973). chalice there was no need to plug it with lead. X-ray examination does not reveal split leaves fastening on the catchplate. The end of the pin must therefore have been turned out neatly and economically to fasten it on the plate, but this is not clear on the X-ray photographs. The upper ring of the stem has a pronounced decorative downward-projecting flange. The foot of the chalice is not domed like Ardagh; instead it is more conical in form and has a hammered-up moulding designed to seat the lower ring of the stem. The rim of the bowl is flared; the foot ring is broad and carries applied ornaments on its upper surface only, as well as riveted mouldings bordering the decorative applique. Like the Ardagh chalice, the Derrynaflan chalice's bowl bears a girdle of filigree panels between half-round mouldings. Where enamel occurs on the Ardagh chalice, amber is used lavishly in the equivalent settings of the Derrynaflan vessel?there are 57 large amber studs. Stylistic arguments are not part of the present study; suffice it to say that in many respects the ornaments of the Derrynaflan chalice relate it to objects of the ninth century such as large annular ('pseudo-penannular') brooches (Ryan 1983a; 1987a, 68-71). The copper alloy chalice from the Ardagh hoard was damaged at the time of discovery. It is a plain, lathe-polished cup raised by hammering. It has a flared rim and below it there is a pronounced horizontal groove. The cup is otherwise almost hemispherical in form. The foot of the vessel is hollow, flared and also raised from sheet bronze?there is no seam. Its widely splayed rim forms an almost flat foot. The precise shape of the stem is unknown. In its present reconstruction?a perspex rod replacing a nineteenth-century wooden dowel?the chalice stands 11.8cm high. The rim diameter is 13.8cm and the maximum depth of the bowl is c. 6.74cm. Gogan (1932, 44) tentatively compared the cup with the insular</page><page sequence="11">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 291 -^-=^?==?=^=^== 10 cm Fig. 3?Profile of the Derrynaflan chalice. hanging-bowl tradition (Henry 1936). Its shape is remarkably similar to that of both the larger Ardagh and the Derrynaflan chalices. Because of its simplicity and lack of ornament its dating remains a problem. The deposition of the hoard, to judge by the inclusion in it of a thistle brooch, probably took place in the later ninth or tenth century and this provides an approximate terminus ante quern for the manufacture of the chalice. A copper alloy vessel in the collections of the Ulster Museum, Belfast, is also closely similar to the smaller Ardagh chalice in many respects (PL IV) (Bourke 1989). Its bowl is not quite hemispherical and its profile is very like that of the Ardagh and Derrynaflan chalices. It is silvered or perhaps tinned externally. Its stem is of solid cast-copper alloy and resembles that of the Trewhiddle chalice (see below). Its foot is a disc of copper alloy and it has an applied edge-moulding, now partly missing. On its surface is a complex but relatively crudely executed composi tion of three spirals and trumpet scrolls reserved against the untinned background (PI. XVI). The disc is now much distorted. On the body of the bowl are two small drilled holes c. 5cm apart. There is no evidence from the patination to show that they were ever used in the attachment of an additional component such as a handle or medallion. The bowl is 11cm in diameter, its maximum depth is 4.2cm and its height is 6.05cm. Its find circumstances are unknown. It came to the Ulster Museum from the Gracey Collection, Kilrea, Co. Derry. Its form demands its</page><page sequence="12">292 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy inclusion in the corpus of Irish chalices but there is admittedly no other evidence to regard it as liturgical. The ornament of its foot is a humbler version of engraved Ultimate La Tene ornament on plated bronze, familiar on eighth- and ninth century Irish and Pictish work. The silver chalice (Pl. V) from Trewhiddle, Cornwall, was found with decorated metalwork and coins which establish a date of deposition in the later ninth century A.D. (Wilson and Blunt 1961, 109-17), now revised to around A.D. 868 (Blackburn and Pagan 1986, 294, no. 59). The hoard was discovered in a heap of loose stones?perhaps an old mine-working?in 1774 and a number of pieces were dispersed during its haphazard collection. The hoard also contained decora tive mounts, a trichonopoly-work scourge and a penannular brooch. The chalice is reconstructed from various fragments and now stands 12.6cm high. Its cup is 11.6cm and its foot-ring 8.6cm in diameter. The cup is half egg-shaped in form and its rim is flanged. About 3mm below the rim is a row of holes in which the shanks of rivets still remain. Below these is a band of gilding 3mm wide. Within this band are further rivets. There is a scratched line 1.4cm below the rim and between it and the gilded band are traces of solder. The stem of the chalice is cast and hammered from one piece into the form of an oval knop placed between two truncated conical elements. The foot is a segment of a sphere with the rim turned over to form a flange or foot-ring. The top is shaped?like the Derrynaflan chalice?to receive the stem. Three rivet-holes occur on the foot (Wilson and Blunt 1961, 81-2). A missing element, a collar, may have been attached between the stem and the base (Wilson and Blunt 1961, 91). A large rivet would, therefore, have united the components of the chalice while two smaller ones connected the collar to the foot. The lines of rivet-holes in the cup may indicate the former presence of applied bands (Wilson and Blunt 1961, 92) but the gap between the lip and the gilded band may also indicate that an applied rim had existed. The chalice is at present undergoing restoration in the British Museum and Mrs Leslie Webster kindly showed me traces of incised interlace on the surface of the cup below the gilded band which were previously undetected. If the small mount from Naerb0 (diameter 5.5cm) is accepted as the foot of a chalice then it, too, like the Trewhiddle chalice had more than one pin connecting the bowl to its base. A small chalice of beaten silver found with a fragmentary copper alloy paten resting on its lip, concealed in a shallow pit in the body of a crannog at Lough Kinale, Co. Longford, provides a remarkably close parallel for the Trewhiddle vessel (Fig. 1). A deep cup, slightly greater than hemispherical, a one-piece hollow stem with a central swelling, and a domed foot with a pronounced but sloping foot-ring are connected by a large pin, the domed head of which appears in the base of the cup. On the underside it is turned over and tightened by a washer of somewhat crudely cut silver. The rim is vertical and capped by an applied copper alloy lip of which a short length survives. This was held in position by three tags, also of copper alloy, lapped over and riveted through the body of the cup. There is a band of gilding on the external surface just below the rim. The foot is shaped to receive the lower edge of the stem. The chalice is 7.6cm in height; the diameter of the cup is 6.5cm and the foot is 4.89cm in diameter. The paten is a small circular plate formerly mounted on a domed foot of beaten metal of precisely the same form as that of the chalice. As there is no independent dating evidence for these vessels we are forced to rely on typological considerations, which suggest that the chalice is of roughly the same date as that from Trewhiddle.</page><page sequence="13">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 293 The chalice from Hexham Abbey (PI. VI) (Wilson and Blunt 1961, 88) was found in the transept (Bailey 1974, 153). It is now preserved at the Priory Church, Hexham. It varies between 6.2cm and 6.7cm in height and its cup is 6.2cm in diameter. It is made of gilt copper alloy. Its bowl is a segment of a sphere, and its foot is similar in shape to that of the Trewhiddle chalice. It has an almost barrel shaped knop and a beaded ring-moulding at the stem-cup junction. The three elements are united by a single rivet. It is regarded as eleventh-century in date by Elbern (1963, 48) who compares it to a chalice held by 'Ecclesia' on a tenth century illumination from Fulda, and to the chalice of Bishop Hezilo from Hildesheim (ob. 1079; Appendix 1, no. 13), a suggestion agreed with by Bailey (1974, 155), but there are no firmer indications of date. The Hazelton lead chalice (no. 37)?dimensions unknown?had a hemispher ical cup, a conical foot and, apparently, a squat, bulging knop. Wilson and Blunt ascribed it to the Anglo-Saxon period (Wilson and Blunt 1961, 90). Elbern felt that it should be dated to the first half of the eleventh century and saw Ottonian elements in its form (Elbern 1963, 73), and a Continental origin cannot be excluded. From illustrations it appears to be in marked contrast to the other insular chalices and must, at the very least, be considered a representative of a different type. In summary, the surviving complete chalices of undoubted insular workman ship have the following characteristics. Form 1. Bowl form: large, hemispherical, with flaring rim in the hanging-bowl tradition?four examples; half-ovoid?two examples; segment of a sphere?one example. 2. Foot form: hemispherical/sub-conical with a pronounced foot-ring?five examples; disc-shaped?one example; funnel-shaped?one example. With applied mouldings?three examples. With applied decorative plates?two examples. 3. Applied rim?two examples plus one possible. 4. Stem form: cylindrical?two examples; knopped?four examples; unknown, probably unknopped?one example. Structure 5. Complex structure united by pins?five examples. 6. Cast stems: tripartite?two examples; one piece?four examples. 7. Materials: silver?four examples; copper alloy?three examples. 8. Decoration: applied?two examples, one possible; engraved?three examples. 4. Western European chalices Western European chalices have attracted a considerable amount of attention in recent scholarship. Rohault de Fleury's (1883-9, 45-153) and Braun's (1932) studies represent early attempts to bring together systematically all the informa tion about known chalices. They have been superseded for Europe by Elbern's (1963) corpus of early medieval eucharistic chalices: his list forms the basis of Appendix 1. Important survey articles are Elbern's (1965a) general examination of Carolingian liturgical instruments and Haseloffs (1951) study of the Tassilo chalice which, although concentrated on one piece, has a major discussion of the</page><page sequence="14">294 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy dating, origin and analogues of the object, which he has more recently reviewed with particular reference to the ornament of the vessel (Haseloff 1977). An important paper on the status of the early insular chalices in relation to contempo rary European vessels was published by Elbern (1965b). Metal chalices with handles The earliest surviving cup associated with liturgical objects is the plain two handled vessel of cantharus form (Johns 1977, 13) from the hoard of early Christian silver found at Water Newton, near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, within the ancient Roman city of Durobrivae (Painter 1977). The cup is equipped with two ogival, looped, flat-sectioned handles which were detached when found. The body consists of a lower globular portion and a frustrate upper part. The foot is conical and is connected to the cup by a square-ended rivet. A slight knop occurs between the foot and the base. The rims of the cup and foot are thickened. The cup stands 12.5cm high and is 11.0cm in maximum diameter. It was associated with eight other vessels of silver including a liturgical strainer and nineteen votive plaques. Chi-Rho monograms occur on a number of the vessels and plaques, and two of the bowls or cups and one plaque bear votive inscriptions. The precise date of deposition of the hoard is uncertain: sometime in the fourth century A.D., and perhaps the earlier part of that century, seems probable. The argument for this is that while the hoard includes fourth-century types it does not contain any of the sort of vessel represented in the Mildenhall, Kaiseraugst, Carthage and Esquiline Hill caches deposited later in that century (Painter 1977, 21). As the vessels contain no marks of ownership, Painter (1977, 23) has argued that they were the property of a Christian community. Jungmann quotes an inventory of the contents of the house of such a community in Cirta, North Africa, suppressed during the persecution of Diocletian (A.D. 303-12)?they included two golden chalices, six silver chalices, torches, candelabra, an oil lamp and a library of books. The house also included quarters for the clergy (Jungmann 1959, 15-16; also Mundell Mango 1986, 263-4 for this and other early inventories). The precise liturgical use of the Water Newton cup is problematical?a eucharistic purpose is likely, particularly given the inclusion in the hoard of a strainer decorated with the Chi-Rho monogram. However, the cup need not have been exclusively devoted to that purpose, as Painter has shown that in the earlier fourth century eucharistic vessels 'acquired their character from the authority of the person using them' (Painter 1977, 22). St Ambrose refers to people bringing chalices to the tombs of the martyrs but in the evening drinking from the same vessels (Babington 1875, 735). The 'Apostolic Canons'?in effect an early sixth century corpus of law attributed to Dionysius Exiguus and compiled at Rome?and the canons formulated by John of Antioch (ob. A.D. 441), still in force in the eastern church, are the earliest certain references to the consecration of gold or silver vessels or linen for ritual use (Shaw 1875, 113). The Water Newton vessel seems certain on grounds of association to have been used either in the Eucharist or in the closely related ritual meal agape, often celebrated in the early church, or in both. Its relevance to the subsequent history of chalices is unquestionable. The earliest handled chalice to survive from medieval western Europe is the diminutive golden chalice (Pl. VIII) found with a small rectangular paten (19.5cm X 12.5cm) and an early sixth-century hoard of coins at Gourdon near Chalon-sur Saone (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 72-4; Braun 1932, 58; Haseloff 1951, 10; Lafaurie 1958; Elbern 1963, 23-4, pl. 17, 72, no. 23.) It is preserved in the Cabinet</page><page sequence="15">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 295 Pi.. VIII?The Gourdon chalice (photo: Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris). des Medailles, Paris. The chalice is 7.5cm high and its cup is 4.4cm in diameter. The cup is biconical, consisting of a globular, gadrooned lower portion and a slightly flared upper section. The handles are zoomorphic. The foot is conical and fluted. A knop and a beaded ring separate the stem and cup. The upper part of the body bears a broad band of filigree ornament in scrolls enclosing roughly leaf shaped settings alternately above and below the line. The settings contain an inlay of turquoise. A chalice now lost, but formerly preserved in the Cathedral Treasury of Monza, was apparently very similar to the Gourdon vessel (Rohault de Fleury7 1883-9, 51, chart, upper right). It had an applied cross on the cup. The rectangular dish associated with the Gourdon chalice may be regarded most conveniently as a small paten which stands on a low, openwork pedestal. It bears rim decoration of step-sided panels forming settings for inlays. On the inside of the base is an inlaid cross and in the corners are leaf-shaped settings for inlays similar to those on the chalice. Lasko (1971, 34) regards the Gourdon pieces as showing '. . . clearly a synthesis of Roman forms and the orientalizing barbaric taste for rich and colourful decoration similar to that observed in Childeric's grave goods'. No other two-handled metal chalices of indigenous manufacture survive in western Europe from the period before the tenth century with the exception of those from Ireland. Of the later examples, the so-called Gauzelin chalice, now in the treasury of Nancv Cathedral (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 108-9; Braun 1932, 59; Elbern 1963, 34, 37, pi. 36, 72, no. 22; Lasko 1972, 85 and pi. 78), is the most interesting in the present discussion. It is attributed by tradition to Gauzelin, bishop of Toul (oh. 962). The chalice is made of beaten gold and is decorated with precious stones, enamels and filigree (Fig. 4). It is 13.2cm high and the cup is 11cm in diameter. The cup is hemispherical in shape and is equipped with a pair of small S-profile handles extending from the rim a short distance down the sides. The foot is conical with a slightly convex profile. It has a broad, flat, jewelled rim and four applied, decorative, vertically disposed bands. Between the foot and the</page><page sequence="16">296 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Fig. 4?The Gau/.elin chalice, Nancy (not to scale). cup is a squat knop, with beaded mouldings above and below. The rim of the cup bears a broad band also within beaded mouldings, decorated with filigree, enamels and gems. Centrally located between the two handles, on the body of the bowl, is a pair of diametrically opposed, applied, rectangular, jewelled plaques. The chalice was made en suite With a jewelled paten. Rheims Cathedral treasury preserves a similar chalice of silver partly gilt from the grave of Archbishop Gervasius (ob. 1067) (Elbern 1963, 35, 38, pl. 37, 72-3, no. 24). The funnel-shaped foot has a broad, flat flange or foot-ring. The cup is equipped with two S-shaped handles. The large knop is bordered above and below by beaded mouldings. The chalice is 9cm high and the cup is 5.7cm in diameter. A paten 8.5cm in diameter made en suite with it survives. The practice of making handled chalices in metal continued into the high Middle Ages in western Europe. Of these, four are illustrated by Braun (1932, pl. 4, no. 10; pl. 5, no. 14; pl. 7, no. 20; and pl. 8, no. 21?respectively the chalices of Marienstern Cistercian Abbey, Cividale Cathedral, Wilten Abbey, and St Peter's, Salzburg). Surviving examples are, and may have been, somewhat unusual for their time. Chalices of semi-precious stone with handles Four other relevant vessels with handles from the medieval period survive in western Europe. They are not, however, of metal and they are not primarily of native manufacture, being adaptations of older and exotic vessels of semi-precious stone. The so-called 'Coupe des Ptolemees', now in the Cabinet des Medailles, Paris, was once preserved in the treasury of the abbey of St Denis (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 98-9; Elbern 1963, 10, 25, pl. 18; 1965a, 164; Buhler 1973, 45-7, no. 18; de Montesquiou-Fezensac and Gaborit-Chopin 1977, 54-6 and pis 36-8). It is an antique Alexandrian sardonyx cup of the first century A.D., carved with Bacchanalian scenes. The handles are caned in one piece with the vessel. It was mounted on a decorative metal foot, perhaps in Carolingian times for use as a</page><page sequence="17">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 297 __(_P'^^s^___^y__B9PI^5 ^^^^^- ? - m^M ^ \j_lt^_k\ Y?^_^_li_^ %^_pRu_^^F^^HI jpM%^^^^^H^''^^B^^^^^HH^E^^v AX:sj/l^^^r % ^^HR ?^ '?

The mountings were restored by Abbot Suger (o/;. 1151) (Gaborit-Chopin 1986, 283) who is thought to have added (or restored) the dedicatory inscription HOC VAS, CHRISTE, TIBI (DEVOTA) MENTE DICAVIT TERTIUS IN FRANCOS SUBLIMA REGIME KARLUS'. The inscribed foot is now missing? the vessel was stolen in the early nineteenth century and the foot-mountings torn off before it was recovered; they are known from a plate published by Felibien in 1706 in his Histoire de I Abbaye de Saint-Denys (Fig. 5). A second, much later chalice, formerly also in the treasury of St Denis (Braun 1932, 60 and pi. 3, no. 8; de Montesquiou-Fezensac and Gaborit-Chopin 1977, 57-9 and pis 41-3; Wixom 1981, 108-11), is now preserved in the National Gallery, Washington. It consists of a deep, fluted, antique sardonyx cup equipped with a conical metal foot and knop, a jewelled band around the rim and a pair of metal handles. It was mounted at the behest of Abbot Suger in the twelfth century. A chalice-shaped reliquary is preserved in the Statens Historiska Museum in Stockholm. It was taken as booty by the Swedish forces in Germany during the Thirty Years' War and sent to Stockholm in 1631 (Braun 1932, 60; Weixelgartner 1954). It is a large shallow agate cup provided with metal mounts at first about</page><page sequence="18">298 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 1000 and later, in the thirteenth century, converted into a reliquary with a lid and a crown. Its original use as a chalice is not established although it is a strong possi bility. There is evidence to suggest that it was associated at one time with the thirteenth-century St Elizabeth of Marburg. A chalice of crystal, formerly in Bamberg Cathedral and now in the treasury of the Royal Chapel, in the Residenz, Munich (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 118-19; Braun 1932, 47, 60, pl. 2, no. 7; Brunner 1977, 5, no. 7), is also of interest. It is the so-called 'Heinrichskelch', consisting of a bowl of Fatimid workmanship carved from rock crystal. It has a single crystal ring-handle with thumb-plate. A matching silver handle is provided. A crystal ball as a knop and a jewelled silver foot with a broad flat rim are added. The cup is embellished with a silver band around the rim. The cup, knop and foot are bound together by means of vertical metal bands. The chalice in its present form dates to the early eleventh century. It stands 12.8cm high and the cup is 9.6cm in diameter. What had been, apparently, a Fatimid flask of crystal was adapted to make a handled chalice for the abbey of St Denis (de Montesquiou-Fezensac and Gaborit-Chopin 1977, 51-2, pl. 34). Known only from watercolours and drawings, it is now lost. The two-handled chalices made up of imported cups of semi-precious stone fitted with metal mounts are clearly in a separate category from those made entirely from metal, in that to a large extent their design is pre-determined by the shape of the cups which they incorporate and by the technical requirements of the binding strips needed to fasten metal handles and stems to the vessels. It may also be that the existence of carved handles on the recycled vessels?as on the 'Coupe des Ptolemees' and the 'Heinrichskelch'?may have determined that the finished products be chalices with handles when the local requirements, preferences or traditions would have prescribed otherwise. Although the majority of the examples cited may lie outside our period, they seem to provide evidence of a practice which had begun earlier. Excluding the Irish examples, western Europe has produced examples of only three metal chalices with handles of native manufacture from the earlier Middle Ages. This relative scarcity can to a limited extent be supplemented by illustrations in early manuscripts and other works of art and by occasional references in historical sources. Elbern (1963, 58) has shown that the type of vessel represented by the Gourdon chalice was persistent in early medieval Europe?a closely similar cup is illustrated in the Last Supper scene of the early eleventh-century antepen dium of Aachen Cathedral (Lasko 1972, pl. 131). It has a similarly gadrooned bulbous lower section of the cup, a knop, funnel-shaped foot and pair of S-scroll handles. The chalice illustrated on an Ottoman ivory diptych (Fig. 6; Pl. XXIV) formerly in the Stadtbibliothek Frankfurt/Main and now in the Liebighaus (Elbern 1963, 35, pl. 32) is also of this type, A variant of this chalice form occurs in spandrels of the arcades of the canon tables of the British Museum Gospels, Harl. 2788 (Kohler 1958, pl. 48). Chalices with two handles and knops are among a number of objects shown suspended in arches of f. 327v of the Vivian Bible in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris (Kohler 1930, pl. 84). The Sacramentary of Drogo also illustrates a somewhat similar chalice on an altar which Elbern regards as a further type of handled chalice?the 'amphora form' (Elbern 1963, 28-9, pl. 21). The manuscript drawings are not always entirely satisfactory as documentary sources, given the occasional variations in quality of draughtsmanship and scale and the problem of identifying the models on which the painters may have drawn. It would be reading too much into them to base detailed classifications on them.</page><page sequence="19">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 299 Flu 6?Detail of Ottonian ivory, Liebighaus, Frankfurt. i^^jP^r?_^_^_^_^_|_m. **'^% &lt;m i_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_B_9_H^_^_^_^_H *i** _kj^^^^B| ':^fll^^^^^B^^^^^^M_V^I^_^_H Pi.. IX?The Gold Altar of San Ambrogio, Milan: detail showing the celebration of Mass. Note the two handled chalice held by the deacon to the celebrant's left (photo courtesv of the administra tion of San Ambrogio). An altogether more satisfactory illustration, matching the Frankfurt ivory in quality of detail, is the scene of the mass on the San Ambrogio Gold Altar, Milan, where a large, two-handled chalice is being held before St Ambrose by a deacon (Pl. IX). The chalice has a biconical cup with a pronounced groove at the shoulder, perhaps intended for a decorative band. The rim is rolled. The foot is funnel-shaped and banded. While it is clear that the chalice bears two handles, from the position of the deacon's hands these must have been too small to admit a full grasp of the fingers (Elbern 1963, 28, pl. 20). The altar dates to c. 850, having been commissioned, as an inscription on it states, by Archbishop Angilbert II whose tenure lasted from 824 until 859 (Lasko 1972, 50). The two-handled chalice was, therefore, well known on the Continent in early medieval times. There is no real reason to believe that it was considerably less</page><page sequence="20">300 Proceedings of the Royal Irish A cademy common than vessels without handles. There are some early historical references to two-handled chalices but not many, a fact taken by Braun (1932, 53) to mean that they were so common as to be unremarkable. The relative paucity of surviving examples could be due to a number of factors. Amongst the gifts bestowed on the churches of Rome by Charlemagne at his coronation on Christmas Day 800 was a large, two-handled jewelled chalice weighing 68 pounds (Duchesne 1892; Elbern 1965a, 116-17). The pope customarily consecrated the wine in a two-handled chalice (Braun 1932, 53-4) and a ritual existed in the Ordo Romanus I of the winding of the offertory veil through its handles by the archdeacon at solemn masses (Andrieu 1948, 94) but such chalices were not restricted to papal use. Braun (1932, 53) and Kurze (1977, 39) quote the testament of Aredius, abbot of Attanum (Saint Irieux, Haute-Vienne) in the time of Gregory of Tours, which appears to lay down the minimum of liturgical equipment appropriate to each church. Included in the list are four chalices of silver, the two largest of which have handles. The document may have been composed in the eighth century and reflect the circumstances of that period rather than the age of Aredius (Knogel 1936, 181, no. 843). A crater, which should by definition have been a two-handled vessel, was presented to Archbishop Felix of Ravenna (ob. 723) by the Byzantine Emperor Phillippicus (711-16) (Braun 1932, 53). The same author also inclines to the view that the heavy scyphi called consecration chalices mentioned in the Liber Pontificalis for the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries must have been equipped with handles because otherwise they would have been quite unmanageable (Braun 1932, 53). However, the use of the term scyphus might also imply a form related to the somewhat squat bucket-shaped vessels of the same name in the antique world (Hilgers 1969, 76-7). In the Ordo Romanus I, the congregation receives wine from the sciffus?evidently a large vessel (Andrieu 1948, 102)?and the sciffus is mentioned among the liturgical objects brought in solemn procession from the Lateran to the church where stational mass was to be celebrated (Andrieu 1948, 73). References in post-Carolingian times become somewhat more frequent. Braun (1932, 54) notes, for example, that Theophilus in the twelfth century gives instructions for the manufacture of a two-handled chalice (Hawthorne and Smith 1979, 105-6). Chalices without handles Surviving early examples of chalices without handles are more numerous than those with handles. Vessels of pre-Carolingian date are, however, rare. Thus the discovery in 1963, at Galognano near Pian de'Campi (Province Siena), Italy, of a hoard consisting of four silver chalices, a silver paten and a liturgical spoon, one of the chalices and the paten bearing dedicatory inscriptions, is of particular interest (Von Hessen et al. 1977). The vessels were published in detail by Von Hessen (1977) and recently reviewed by Mundell Mango (1986, 250-4). The four chalices varied in size but were closely related technically and probably produced in the same workshop (Von Hessen 1977, 24). The chalices are all made of beaten silver, the feet and cups having been made separately. Cups and feet are joined in the same manner on each chalice?a large, broad rivet was attached to the base of the cup, the perforated top of the foot portion was passed over it, and the rivet was then hammered from inside the foot to cause it to spread and unite the two parts. The two portions were then secured by means of silver solder applied externally to</page><page sequence="21">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 301 Fig. 7?The Galognano chalices (after Von Hessen et al. 1977). the joint, which also concealed any unevenness created by the method of assembly. All the chalices have funnel-shaped feet and lack knops. Chalice 1, the largest, stands 24.3cm high (Fig. 7a). Its cup, 16.5cm in diameter, is roughly egg-shaped with a slightly thickened and outward-pointing rim. It is decorated with a number of lightly incised, horizontal lines below the rim. The foot has a slightly concave profile. The rim of the foot is flattened into a broad flange, or ring. The chalice is 2070cc in capacity and weighs 780g (Von Hessen 1977, 11-12).'</page><page sequence="22">302 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Chalice 2 stands 16.3cm high (Fig. 7b). The rim diameter of the cup is 11cm. The cup is 750cc in volume and weighs 350g. The cup of chalice 2 is deeper than that of chalice 1. The upper three-quarters of its body are almost cylindrical in form while the lower portion is rounded. Its foot is also funnel-shaped with a slightly concave profile. It is decorated with incised horizontal lines on both the body and the foot. Chalice 3 has a fat egg-shaped cup and funnel-shaped foot with foot-ring (Fig. 7c). It stands 13cm high and the rim diameter of its cup is 11.7cm. Between lightly incised, horizontal lines below the rim is the dotted inscription + HUNC CALICE PUSUET HIMNIGILDA AECLISIAE GALLUNIANL The cup is 600cc in volume. The vessel weighs 330g. The fourth chalice, although badly damaged at the time of discovery, can be reconstructed as very similar to no. 3 (Fig. 7d). It stands c. 14cm high; its cup is c. 8cm in diameter and c. 200cc in capacity. It weighs 200g. The paten is of a type common in Byzantine silver hoards. It is a dish 20.3cm in diameter and 1.8cm deep. It has an outwardly inclined wall and a broad flat rim which bears the inscription, formerly nielloed, + SIVEGERNA PRO ANIMAM SUAM FECIT. The spoon, too, is of familiar Late Antique and Early Christian type?it has an oval bowl, united to a long shank by a disc of metal which bears a Chi-Rho. The objects from the hoard can be associated with Galognano?the 'Galluniani' of the inscription?a church 2.5km distant from the find-spot. Von Hessen (1977, 29) argues that the Galognano objects are products of an Italian workshop, firstly because of differences between the chalices and those of genuine Byzantine type, and secondly because of the use of Latin and not Greek in the inscriptions. The inscription on the paten he relates closely in style to that on the large, damaged example from the Canoscio hoard (Von Hessen 1977, 26?for the Canoscio paten see Giovangoli 1940, 6-7, no. 6) and the 'Ursus' chalice (Braun 1932, 70; Elbern 1963, 71, no. 18; 1965a, 130) which was previously regarded by some authorities as perhaps Carolingian in date. The Galognano hoard is dated by Von Hessen (1977, 29-30) to the sixth century on the basis of comparisons with the Canoscio inscription, the resemblance of the form of the feet of the chalices to that of the 'Symeonios' chalice from the Hama hoard (Appendix 2, no. 2) and the probability that the names on the dedicatory inscriptions are Gothic rather than Langobardic. It seems likely in the light of the Galognano find that the 'Ursus' chalice, preserved in the parish church of Lamon, near Feltre, not far from Trent in northern Italy, is also of sixth-century date (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 71-2; Braun 1932, 70; Haseloff 1951, 10). It is a large silver chalice, the cup of which is similar in form to the Galognano chalice no. 2. Its foot is funnel-shaped, with a broad flange or foot-ring, and a round knop which is separated from the cup by a short, cylindrical length of stem. Around the rim, within engraved lines, is the inscription DE DONIS DEI VRSVS DIACONVS SANCTO PETRO ET SANCTO PAVLO OPTVLIT. The chalice is 19.5cm high; the cup is 13.5cm in diameter and 11.5cm deep. It has a capacity of c. 1500cc. It was found during the later nineteenth century in a cave.</page><page sequence="23">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 303 __^__^_H%Kp?^%^ ^;%^^^^H^__^__B __^__^__H^'-^-V-'":-'i"-3_i^?^-*v' - ^^^^B __^__^__^___H|.'

X?The Tassilo chalice, Stift Kremsmiinster (photo: the Landesregierung of Upper Austria). The dedicatory formula DE DON IS DEI ... is used on the Canoscio paten mentioned above. The most famous of the series is the chalice presented to the monastery of Kremsmiinster, Austria, by Duke Tassilo of Bavaria and his wife in the eighth century (Pl. X). The chalice has been described in detail by Haseloff (1951 with refs.) and recently well illustrated in Stollenmayer and Widder (1976). It is made of gilt copper and consists of two principal parts, a large egg-shaped cup and a knop and flared foot made in one piece. A beaded moulding is attached between the knop and the cup. The cup is often stated to have been cast while the foot and knop were hammered from a single piece (but see Bona (1966, 285) who regards all the components as cast). The cup is heavily decorated with animal and plant ornament of engraved appearance. The ornament is largely insular in inspiration (Haseloff 1977). In addition, figures play a prominent role in oval medallions on the cup: Christ and the Evangelists with their symbols and, on the foot, male and female saints in silver and niello inlay occur. The figured scenes are more Mediterranean in taste. In a band around the edge of the foot is the inscription + TASSILO DVX FORTIS+LIVTPIRC VIRGA REGALIS. The chalice stands 25.5cm high without its inner lining cup, which is thought to be a replacement for an original one; it is 15.7cm in diameter. The capacity of the outer cup is c. 1730cc.</page><page sequence="24">304 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Fig. 8?The Cunpald chalice, scale 1:1 (after Bona 1966). The vessel is first mentioned in an inventory of the abbey of Kremsmunster in 1697 as the founder's chalice (Haseloff 1977, 235). The inscription on it refers to Tassilo, duke of Bavaria, who was deposed in 788. His wife, Luitpirc (Liudberga), was a Langobardic princess whom he married in 768/9. The chalice therefore belongs to the later eighth century. Closely related to the Tassilo chalice is the Cunpald chalice (Fig. 8), a vessel of beaten copper-gilt from Petohaza, Hungary, found in 1879 during construction work (Elbern 1963, 15 and 74, no. 30; Bona 1966; Werner 1966). The cup is almost hemispherical although now slightly deformed; the foot is funnel-shaped and formed in one piece with the round knop. The gilding is by the mercury amalgam method. A cast, beaded moulding occurs between the cup and foot. The two parts are united by means of four rivets projecting downwards from the base of the cup and passing through corresponding holes in the knop. These were then hammered from the underside to flatten them into rivet heads. However, this apparently did not prove satisfactory, so, as in the case of the Ardagh chalice, lead was poured in to secure the fastening (Bona 1966, 284). A band of not very accomplished interlace borders the rim of the cup and foot, which Werner has related not to insular sources but to late eighth-century manuscript decoration associated with Mondsee and Kremsmunster. At two points on each band, triquetra-like extensions with foliate elements occur. Around the knop is the inscription '+ CUNPALD FECIT' (Bona 1966, 286). Three secondary rivets occur on the rim of the cup, perhaps for the attachment of ornaments or an applied moulding. The original height of the chalice was 11.8cm; the diameter of the cup varied from 8.05cm to 9.10cm. A number of writers have connected the form of the Cunpald and Tassilo chalices closely (Braun 1932, 71; Haseloff 1951, 10-11; 1977, 221; Elbern 1963, 15), although Bona attempted to show that their methods of assembly and manufacture were different. While Bona looked to Anglo-Saxon sources for the inscription, the consensus now appears to be that the Cunpald chalice was made in upper Austria, probably in the late eighth century7, in a milieu heavily influenced by insular traditions (Haseloff 1977, 221). Another important surviving chalice is the so-called Grimfridus chalice now in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection in Washington D.C. (PI. XI).

Inlaid silver decoration occurs on the foot and cup. An inscription on the cup reads NOMINE DNI OMNIPOTENTIS GRIMFRIDUS PRBI . . . and around the foot ... A FIERI ROGAV . . . It is 15.4cm in height and its cup is 9cm in diameter (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 91-2; Braun 1932/70-1; Haseloff 1951, 11; Elbern 1963, 15-16 and 75-6, no. 36; Ross 1965, 131-2 with refs.). The chalice belonged originally to the church of St Martin-des-Champs. Its inscription and decoration suggest a date in the later eighth or early ninth century (Elbern 1963, 75-6). Both Elbern (1965a, 26) and Haseloff (1951, 11) remark on the divergence of the design of the Grimfridus chalice from the normal Carolingian form in its sharp divisions between the various components compared with the flowing lines of vessels such as the Tassilo chalice. Something of this is also to be seen in the Liudger chalice preserved in Essen Werden in the treasury of the Propsteikirche (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 99; Braun 1932, 71-2 and pi. 1; Haseloff 1951, 11; Elbern 1963, 3-12). This small chalice is of gilt copper alloy. Its cup is egg-shaped, its foot flared with a concave profile. It has a somewhat squat knop, sharply differentiated from the foot and cup. Around the rim of the cup is the inscription AGITVR HEC SVMMVS P(ER) POCIA TRIVMPHVS and around the foot HIC CALIX SANGVINIS DNI NRI IHV XPI</page><page sequence="26">306 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Pl. XII?The Lebuinus chalice, formerly at Deventer, Netherlands (photo: Kijksmuseum Het Catharijneconvent, Utrecht). (Elbern 1963, 4). Formerly preserved at Helmstedt, it was associated traditionally with St Liudger. Its height is 12.2cm and its cup is 7cm in diameter. Elbern has argued for a later ninth- or tenth-century date for it (Elbern 1963, 63-6). The ivory 'St Lebuinus chalice' from Deventer, Netherlands, now preserved in the Rijksmuseum Het Cathrijneconvent Utrecht, is of particular interest (PI. XII). Thought to be a Christianised antique vessel by Rohault de Fleury (1883-9, 112) and a twelfth-century product by Braun (1932, 45), it is now firmly established as a Carolingian object (Elbern 1963, 7 and 20 with refs.) following Meyer-Barkhausen (1931), who demonstrated the close relationship of its decoration to the ornament of the bronze railings of the upper story of the Palace Chapel of Aachen. The chalice was provided with an additional metal foot, mounts and inner cup in the fourteenth century, perhaps to enshrine it or to enable it to be reused. The ivory part stands 11.8cm in height. Its cup is 9cm in diameter. It is carved from a single piece and originally probably had a lining cup of metal. It is lavishly decorated with vegetal motifs. The cup is a fat half-egg shape with two broad bands of decora tion. The stem is cylindrical with deep, broad horizontal grooves which give a knopped effect. It narrows sharply in diameter about half-way along its length from the cup. The foot is low, slightly domed, and at the junction with the stem there is a pronounced decorative lip. It has been compared to the base of a pillar. Elbern has seen this chalice as an extremely important guide to the symbolic inter pretation of chalices in general in early medieval Europe (Elbern 1963, 128 ff; 1965a, 131-2). These vessels comprise the total of western European pre-Carolingian and Carolingian chalices of the type to survive. The record of their development is to some extent filled out by contemporary7 and later illustration. One very important chalice survived until the eighteenth century?the so-called Eligius chalice of Chelles which, according to tradition, was made by Eligius (St Eloi) who died in 659 (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 83-4; Braun 1932, 70; Elbern 1963, 25). The chalice was destroyed in 1792. It had been drawn in detail and recorded in 1651 by</page><page sequence="27">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 307 Fk.. 9?The Chelles (Eligius) chalice (after du Saussay). du Saussay (Fig. 9) (Vierck 1974, 312-13, fig. 1). The chalice was made of gold. It stood 26cm high, the cup being 14.1cm in depth. The cup was almost entirely encrusted with cells for inlays?probably cloisonne-garnet?and cabochon stones are also clearly shown. A beaded moulding occurred above and below the knop. A band of cells divided the knop in two. An ornamental double zigzag of uncertain nature decorated the foot (Elbern 1963, 25, pl. 19; Vierck 1974, 310-11, fig. 1). The recorded decoration and style of the chalice are consistent with a date of manufacture during the lifetime of Eligius. A good number of contemporary illustrations of chalices survive in Carolingian and later MSS. Rohault de Fleury (1883-9, pl. 295) and Elbern (1963, 29-34, pis 22-31) have dealt with the most significant of these. Knopped chalices with flared feet are common. A small number are shown as decorated, e.g. in the Alcuin Bible, Bamberg (f. 339v), and in the Stuttgart Psalter (f. 27) in the Wurttembergisches Landesbibliothek (Elbern 1963, 32, pis 28-9). Others are shown as having fluted cups or bowls, e.g. in the Ragnaldus Sacramentary (f. 8v) in the Autun library (Elbern 1963, 30, pl. 25). A chalice with a moulding between its knop and cup is depicted on an Anglo-Saxon ivory pyx of the later tenth century, one of two now in the Victoria and Albert Museum (Webster 1984, 116).</page><page sequence="28">308 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Before briefly considering later chalices without handles, it is worthwhile reviewing here the formal development of the earlier series insofar as it can be divined. The funnel-shaped foot, usually of concave profile, is commonest. Of surviving vessels, only the ivory Lebuinus chalice lacks it. In manuscript illustra tions it is universal. Knops are also standard?only the very early Galognano vessels are without them. The Ursus chalice, which may be approximately contemporary with the Galognano vessels, is knopped and the feature is therefore an early one in western Europe as the two-handled Gourdon chalice confirms. Flanging and flattening of the rim of the foot to make a more stable base is present on the Galognano vessels, the Ursus chalice and, most markedly, on the Grimfridus chalice where it is very prominent. The division of the stem by the knop into a lower, funnel-shaped or flared portion and an upper, more-or-less cylindrical section is present on the Ursus chalice?it is a trait which is paralleled on Byzantine vessels. (Two later Iberian chalices have knops dividing their stems into short cylindrical lengths.) Cups are generally half-egg-shaped (Tassilo, Liudger and Grimfridus chalices), but near hemispherical (Cunpald chalice) and deep vessels with near-cylindrical bodies and rounded bases (Galognano no. 2) are known. A beaded ring at the knop-cup junction occurs on the Tassilo and Cunpald chalices and at the cup-knop and knop-foot joints on the Grimfridus chalice. Cups tend to be large in relation to the height of the vessels. With few exceptions the curve of foot, knop and cup is visually continuous. Sharp differentiations between the elements are rare. Generally speaking, as Rosenberg (1924, 80) remarked, the Carolingian chalices show a fair degree of uniformity of design despite their wide distribution and the paucity of surviving examples. Size?presumably determined by function?varies greatly. One characteristic is clear: the bowls of the earlier chalices tend to be deeper than their feet (including knops) are high (Elbern 1963, 26-7). A few chalices bear decoration?engraving or cast imitation engraving on the body (the Tassilo, Cunpald, Grimfridus and Lebuinus chalices). Animal and vegetal ornament together with figures occur on the Tassilo chalice, interlace of a sort on the Cunpald chalice, vegetal and geometric motifs on the Lebuinus vessel and geometric and simple knotwork on the Grimfridus cup. Copper alloy and silver are the most frequently used material. Gilding, silver and niello inlays are all attested. Within the range of surviving vessels a certain amount of variety exists. Byzantine influence is thought to be present in the development of the metal chalices?especially of the Tassilo chalice and those like it (Haseloff 1951, 1; Elbern 1963, 26). Chalices were often very sumptuous objects. Gold and silver chalices, including jewelled examples, are mentioned by Gregory of Tours (Weidemann 1982, vol. 2, 217). The abbey of St Wandrille possessed an engraved silver chalice and paten of wonderful workmanship. The silver offertorium associated with that chalice bore figured scenes (Elbern 1965a, 133). The will of Eberhard, margrave of Friuli, dating to 867 speaks of gold and ivory chalices and patens in his chapel. A number of church inventories of the Carolingian and later period survive and from them we can glean a great deal of information about the decoration and materials of chalices and associated equipment (Bischoff 1967, passim). The church of Bergkirchen in the mid ninth century owned two chalice and paten sets, one decorated in gold, the other made of tin. Erstein in the tenth century had inter alia a gold chalice, paten and strainer. The abbey of St Bavo in Ghent, according to a palimpsest inventory of about 800, possessed a silver chalice decorated with niello,</page><page sequence="29">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 309 Pl. XIII?Monaster)- of Santo Domingo of Silos, chalice of Abbot Dominico (photo: Monastery- of Santo Domingo). another chalice together with a paten gilded and jewelled, and apparently also four gold chalices. After the Viking raid of 851 a further inventory records that one gold chalice with paten, a gold chalice with gilded paten, a chalice of crystal and seven chalices of silver with eight patens remained there. Not all the churches were so well endowed?Mauern bei Friesing in the time of Bishop Waldo of Friesing (883-903) had a chalice of silver and another of lead. Of two patens recorded there one was silver, the other copper. In an inventory of the goods of the church of Mil/ at the time of its handing over to Fulda in the late eighth century, four silver and three copper chalices together with their patens are listed. An inventory of the possessions of Saint-Trond, made for the bishop of Metz in 870, listed nineteen silver chalices with patens 'inter maiores et minores' and a gold chalice with a silver paten. The treasury also contained four silver and two copper scyphi. Reichenau possessed a rich treasury in the middle of the ninth century with a number of chalices and their en suite patens. The distinction between maiores and minores is recorded there also. An inventory of Staffelsee of 81 1 records a small number of chalices but, remarkably, 170 calami (fistulae). This noteworthy reference suggests the extensive use of metal tubes to serve the congre gation. Thus the Continental literary references show that wealthy churches acquired large collections of sacred vessels, probably often in excess of what would have been required for practical use; that a variety of metals were used in the manufac ture of chalices; and that patens were regularly made to match their associated chalices. The evidence from Anglo-Saxon England reflects this pattern with refer</page><page sequence="30">310 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Pi.. XIY?Braga, chalice of Menendus Gundisalvi (photo courtesy of Professor Y. H. Klbern). ences to sumptuous chalices (Dodwell 1982, 205-8). Unfortunately the sources are silent on details. Later chalices Elbern (1963) provides a full survey of later, pre-Gothic chalices to which some more recent finds may be added. The majority of these were preserved in the graves of bishops in various cathedrals and, being funerary vessels, tend to be small. In general they are knopped and the range of forms may be regarded as transitional between the earlier vessels and the great Gothic series in which the fashion for small-cupped consecration chalices became dominant as liturgical fashion changed (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 151, chronological table). Three of the later vessels listed by Elbern are important for the discussion of insular chalices. They are the chalices of Menendus Gundisalvi (Braga Cathedral, Portugal), of Dona liraca (Royal College of St Isidore, Leon, Spain) and of the abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos (Burgos, Spain). The Silos chalice (PI. XIII) is made of gilt silver richly decorated with filigree (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 116; Braun 1932, 73-4; Elbern 1963, 73). It stands 30cm high and its almost hemispherical cup is 19cm in diameter, its capacity being c. 15()()cc. The foot is almost the si.me size and shape as the cup but with a marked foot-ring. The stem of the chalice is cylindrical with a knop dividing it into two elements. The foot decoration?principally filigree arcades?echoes that of the cup. On the underside of the foot is the inscription + IN NOMINE DOMINI OB HONOREM SCI SABASTIANI DOMINICO ABBAS FECIT. Abbot Dominico died in 1073. The chalice of Braga (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 127; Braun 1932, 74-5) is also of gilt silver with niello decoration. It is 10.5cm high and 7cm in diameter (PI. XIV). The cup is half-egg-shaped; the stem is openwork and almost cylindrical in outline with a slight swelling in the middle. The foot is a flat, circular plate</page><page sequence="31">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 311 Fi(?. 10?The chalice of Doha Urraca, Leon. 7.4cm in diameter. The cup bears a vegetal scroll, in the folds of which are crudely chased fabulous beasts, while the stem and knop carry similarly executed decora tion. An inscription on the base reads IN NOMINE DOMINI MENENDUS GUNDISALVS ET TUDA DOMNA SVM (Elbern 1963, 67, no. 4 and 44, pl. 52). Braun thought it to have been made originally as a secular cup because of its animal ornament but this seems unlikely. The chalice preserved in Leon (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 116; Braun 1932, 75; Elbern 1963, 71, no. 19; de Palol and Hirmer 1967, 92, 479) stands 18.5cm high (Fig. 10). Its cup is 11cm in diameter. The vessel is made of two antique, agate footed dishes, fastened base to base?a shallow one forming the stem and a deeper one, equipped with a gilt-silver lining, the cup. They are held together with gold mountings decorated with filigree, cabochon stones and antique carved gems. An elegant openwork gold arcade on the rim of the foot, a jewelled knop with alternating quadrangular and round settings, and a jewelled band are the principal ornaments. An inscription on it reads IN NOMINE DNI VRRACA FREDINADI. Both Elbern and de Palol and Hirmer agree in assigning the cup to the eleventh century, the latter identifying the patroness as the daughter of Ferdinand I of</page><page sequence="32">312 Proceedings of the Royal Irish A cademy Leon who died in 1101. Braun (1932, 75) preferred a twelfth-century date for it, identifying the Urraca as the wife of Ferdinand II of Leon (reigned 1157-88). Discussion Comparisons of the structure and technique of manufacture of Continental and insular chalices are difficult because of the lack of published, detailed technical descriptions of the vessels from the European mainland. Satisfactory accounts of the manufacture of early chalices are confined to those by Bona (1966) of the Cunpald or Petohaza vessel and by Von Hessen (1977) of the Galognano find. Insular chalices are much better served with Wilson's (in Wilson and Blunt 1961) examination of the Trewhiddle chalice and the exemplary analysis by Organ (1973) of the Ardagh chalice. The published accounts of the Tassilo chalice have given rise to some confusion about the methods used in forming it. Haseloff (1951, 1-2) describes the cup as being cast while the foot and knop are hammered from one piece. Braun (1932, 71) states that it is entirely of cast copper. Bona, from an examination of published photographs only, is satisfied that it was made of cast components (Bona 1966, 285). If the cup was cast, then it is likely that the plant and abstract ornament are also in low-relief, imitation kerbschnitt casting in the insular fashion and, equally likely, subjected to extensive post-casting treatment. If this is so, the decoration of the foot would almost certainly have been produced in the same manner. No published account gives details of the thickness of metal in the foot but it seems to be of a heavy gauge to judge from the photograph of the underside in Stollenmeyer and Widder (1976, 85b). This would have rendered more difficult (but by no means have precluded the possibility of) forming the knop and foot in one by hammering. The photograph cited does not finally decide the question either way?the marks evident on the surface of the underside could derive from post-casting treatment or could be raising-marks incompletely planished. Superficial inspection of the chalice at Kremsmiinster is quite insufficient to resolve this point and a technical examination of the ornament and structure is required. The Galognano vessels were raised. The closely comparable Ursus chalice is nowhere described technically in the modern literature?Bona (1966, 295) assumes it to be cast but whether wholly or partly he does not say. Wilson (Wilson and Blunt 1961, 92) refers to the manufacture of chalices by 'the casting technique used so often on the Continent . . .'. The components of the Grimfridus chalice are described by Ross (1965, 132) as 'cast in parts'. The Gauzelin chalice can be clearly seen in published photographs (e.g. Lasko 1972, pl. 78) to be of beaten gold. Bona (1966, 295) attempted to divide the early European chalices into two broad groupings, viz., firstly, bronze or silver cast ceremonial chalices?he instances the Tassilo, Grimfridus and Ursus chalices?and, secondly, raised copper vessels for daily use, smaller in size (normally about 12cm high). Examples are the Liudger and Cunpald chalices. The distinction in size is legitimate but probably reflects the use to which the chalices were put?consecration or administration of the Eucharist?as much as their reservation for particular days or ceremonies. However, there is insufficient published, reliable modern information to establish a clear connection between technology of manufacture and use. Theophilus in the twelfth century, in describing the making of two chalices, laid down that the smaller should be made by raising while the larger, handled chalice was to be manufactured by a combination of casting and hammering (Hawthorne and Smith 1979, 97-104).</page><page sequence="33">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 313 Wilson's (Wilson and Blunt 1961, 91-2) contrasting of the techniques of manufacture of the Trewhiddle chalice and contemporary Continental chalices was taken up by the present writer and applied more generally in relation to insular examples (Ryan 1984b, 141). The Trewhiddle chalice was raised in three parts, the stem being partly cast. The cups of the smaller Ardagh chalice and the Ulster Museum vessel were raised. The bowls and feet of the Derrynaflan, Ardagh, Lough Kinale and Trewhiddle chalices were also formed by raising. The stems of the Ardagh and Derrynaflan chalices?like that of the Ulster Museum vessel?were cast, as were some of their ornaments. The stem of the smaller Ardagh chalice was also formed from hammered metal. There is, however, no general consistent contrast between them and contemporary Continental analogues in method of manufacture except that the bowls at least of some European chalices were occasionally cast. All one can say of the insular chalices is that their principal components?bowls and feet?are uniformly of hammered metal. Large-scale casting seems to have been uncommon in Ireland?the simple form of the bronze hand-bell constituting the largest type of object produced (Bourke 1980, 62). Insular chalices?with the exception of the smaller Ardagh chalice and the Ulster Museum vessel?are held together by pins passing through the cups, stems and feet. Detailed information on this important aspect of chalice construction is almost totally lacking for published European early medieval vessels. The forms of insular chalices do not closely match those of their Continental analogues. That is not to say that they do not share certain characteristics. In general terms it may be said that the surviving Continental chalices of the period to c. 1100 listed by Elbern, whether with or without handles, are more slender in proportions than their insular analogues. This can be expressed mathematically by dividing the height by the maximum cup diameter?the resultant figure gives an index of proportions. Values of 1 or near it indicate relative broadness; less than 1 indicates that the diameter of the cup is greater than the height of the vessel; nearer to 2 indicates relative narrowness of the cup, the value 2 being the result given by a cup the diameter of which is equal to half the height. The values for the Irish and other chalices of insular provenance are tabulated below with pre-Carolingian and Carolingian chalices for comparison.

A number of chalices are damaged and therefore the precise values cannot be calculated. The group of five grave chalices from Hildesheim Cathedral span a period of 55 years. They range in value from that of Bishop Osdag (ob. 989) at 1.17 to the 1.6 of Bishop Dithmar's (ob. 1044) but no significant pattern emerges. The sixth century Galognano chalices all lie below 1.5 but the values vary within the range from the relatively broad no. 3 to the relatively tall no. 1. These chalices were presumably in contemporary use, so at an early stage variety of form and propor tions was evident. Of Carolingian chalices, only one is of broad proportions?the Cunpald chalice at 1.37; all the others are slender with values above 1.5. The Gauzelin chalice at a value of 1.2 stands apart in being a two-handled vessel and in having certain decorative peculiarities which will be discussed below. Of all the Continental chalices listed in Appendix 1, 21 examples (including one doubtful) have values lying between 1 and 1.5 while 21 (including one doubtful) lie between 1.5 and 2. No values could be calculated for six of them. Only one chalice had a value greater than 2. It seems, however, that there was some preference for chalices with a cup diameter of about two-thirds of the height: about a third of the total had values lying between 1.4 and 1.6 and about half between 1.3 and 1.7. These statistics are essentially a crude representation of the proportions of early European chalices?they are based on a small number of vessels widely distributed in time and space. The vessels themselves were designed for different purposes?for consecration and administration of the Eucharist for daily mass and for special occasions, for use when travelling and placing in graves. Nevertheless, it is clear that the insular vessels which represent about one-seventh of the combined total of the listed early medieval chalices show a marked preference for broader proportions?they are all in the lower end of the range, four of them, most strikingly, being the only ones to fall below a value of 1. These are the larger vessels which could have been used ministerially. The distinction between them and nos 10, 20 and 45, which have values higher than 1 and are all smaller, may reflect a difference in function. Given the strong formal links between all the insular chalices, it would be unwise to erect subclasses within the group purely on numerical grounds. Numerically speaking, however, the European chalices including the insular vessels seem to form a continuous series. The vessel shapes of the insular chalices, in the main, differ from those of Continental examples. With few exceptions, the pre-Carolingian, Carolingian and Ottonian vessels which survive have half-ovoid cups. The Trewhiddle chalice and Lough Kinale chalices are the only insular examples to approach this shape. The Hexham chalice's cup is a segment of a sphere like a number of those from Ottonian and early Romanesque grave finds. The Irish chalices?with one exception?have broad, near-hemispherical bowls with everted rims which are very striking in appearance and which are not closely matched on Continental vessels</page><page sequence="35">Ryan?Insu lar eu charts tic chalices 315 Pl. XV?Copper alloy basin, Dereen, Co. Clare (photo: National Museum ofh eland). even by the Cunpald and Gauzelin vessels which have hemispherical cups. The broad Irish bowls have consistently been identified by scholars as adaptations of the insular 'hanging-bowl' form and technique of manufacture to the purposes of chalice-making (Gogan 1932, 44; Elbern 1963, 22; 1965b, 118; Ryan 1983a, 14; 1983b, 124?5; 1984b, 140). The style of bowl gives them a particular distinctiveness (Haseloff 1951, 12). Similar bowls have been found in non-ecclesiastical contexts, for example at Lagore Crannog (Hencken 1951, 77-8) and at Derreen in Co. Clare (Pl. XV) where a vessel bears a double-horizontal moulding below the rim (Anon. 1962, 153-4), but they are not hanging-bowls. The form of the foot on insular chalices is especially characteristic. The Trewhiddle chalice, with its domed foot and rim turned and hammered flat to form a broad flange or foot-ring to improve stability, has been the subject of comment by a number of scholars. Haseloff (1951, 12) refers to the foot in the course of a discussion in which he marked the divergence of the Trewhiddle chalice from the customary Continental form, and he is followed in part by Wilson in this view although the latter was at some pains to connect the vessel from Cornwall with the Continental chalices (in Wilson and Blunt 1961, 90-9, esp. 90, note 5). Elbern (1965b, 115-17) in his paper on insular chalices emphasises the marked resemblance between the shape of the foot of the Trewhiddle chalice and that of the great eleventh-century silver chalice from the abbey of St Domingo de Silos (Pl. XIII). The resemblance is so close, despite the fact that both vessels are widely separated in time and space, that he believed that there must be some connection between them. The Ardagh, Trewhiddle, Hexham, Derrynaflan and Lough Kinale chalices provide good parallels for this foot form, as Elbern pointed out in the case of the first three. The Ardagh chalice foot is not, however, near hemispherical?it is broadly sub-conical with slightly convex sides. Its foot, like the Trewhiddle and Santo Domingo de Silos vessels, is large in relation to its cup. It has a broad foot-ring which has been elaborated as a field for decoration. The Derrynaflan chalice follows this pattern?its foot is, however, more definitely conical in shape. Wilson (in Wilson and Blunt 1961, 90) drew attention to the foot of the Hexham chalice which matches the shape of the Trewhiddle foot closely?a point re-emphasised by Elbern (1965b, 119). The Trewhiddle and Derrynaflan</page><page sequence="36">316 Proceedings of the Royal Irish A cademy _lS__tf__^_l_|^lk v Pi.. XVI?Copper allov chalice ex.

The occur rence of the same foot type on the diminutive paten from Lough Kinale is remark able. While flanges hammered along the edges of the feet of chalices are known on a few Continental examples?Haseloff (1951, 11) compared the foot-ring of the Grimfridus chalice with that of .Ardagh?nothing in the Continental corpus approaches the large, broad, domed or conical bases or wide foot-rings of the insular chalices and the Santo Domingo de Silos vessel. While the form of the foot is a useful trait linking chalices closely connected in time and space, its value for indicating far-flung connections is probably over-rated. The disc-like foot (PI. XVI) of the Ulster Museum vessel illustrates the point very well. At first sight it is difficult to believe that such a relatively narrow flat foot was associated with the cup and stem, yet from two widely separated points we find good parallels for its form. The vessel (possibly a chalice) from a seventh-century hoard at Zemiansky Vrbovok, Czechoslovakia (Svoboda 1953; Friesinger 1979, pi. 114a), consists of a cup, one-third spherical in shape, on a baluster-like stem with a narrow, flat disc shaped foot (Fig. 11). The chalice of Menendus Gundisalvi (PI. XIV) in Braga shares the same feature. Clearly, we are seeing either the result of drawing on a common pool of traits of vessel design as widely distributed in Europe as the Roman Empire was extensive or simply an example of convergence. There are, after all, limits to the variety of solutions for problems of cup design. Elbern (1963, 26; 1965b, 119) took the relatively large size of the cup in the composition of the chalice and the domed foot to be marked characteristics of the insular group?to which should be added a tendency to de-emphasise the stem portion between the foot and the bowl.</page><page sequence="37">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 317 Fig. 11?The cup from Zemiansky-Vrbovok (not to scale). Elbern (1963, 26) felt that the form of the so-called Lebuinus ivory chalice from Deventer could be attributed to insular influence. Morphologically the Lebuinus chalice (Meyer-Barkhausen 1931; Elbern 1965b, 121) is distinct from other surviving Carolingian communion cups and the fact that it is made of ivory may account for much of this. Its cup is closely comparable with that of the Trewhiddle chalice while its stem, as noted above, differs sharply from the normal Continental flared foot. Its base has some of the characteristics of the foot of a column. The decoration is heavily influenced by that of the Palace School of Aachen and shows no insular influence whatsoever. In this it may be contrasted with the Tassilo chalice which has a Continental form but betrays substantial insular influences in its decoration (Elbern 1963, 26). Elbern, convinced of its insular aspect, regards the Lebuinus chalice as a heterogeneous product typical of the mixture of influences prevalent in Carolingian Europe in the early ninth century when presumably it was made. However, a direct insular connection is difficult to accept?respectable Hellenistic and Roman antecedents in glass as Elbern himself showed, but also in silver, can be quoted for the form of the Lebuinus chalice (see below). The Lebuinus chalice probably derives from a well known classical type which frequently bore vegetal ornament; it has no insular influence on its form. It is simply another example of a eucharistic chalice which stands close to one of the many Late Antique vessels from which communion cups ultimately derive (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 49 and chart p. 51) but ornamented in the prevailing style of its period and place of origin. Elbern (1963, 128-30) has interpreted the architectural nature of the ornament in detail and concluded that a tempietto/tholos representation of the Eons Vitaewas intended by the artist. The cylindrical stem, so marked a feature of the larger Irish silver chalices, is rare. The chalice of Menendus Gundisalvi (late tenth or early eleventh century) at Braga has a long, almost cylindrical openwork stem with only a slight suggestion of a knop in a low central swelling (Elbern 1963, 41 and 44, pl. 52, 67-8, no. 4). The Silos chalice follows the same style. A cylindrical element of stem intervening between the knop and the bowl is an occasional feature of Byzantine vessels but is known in the west only on the Ursus chalice. The cylindrical stem of the Irish silver vessels and the partially cylindrical stems of the Iberian chalices set them apart therefore from the surviving western European types, although clearly the more common knopped stem was known in Britain and Ireland, as the Trewhiddle, Hexham, Ulster Museum and Lough Kinale chalices show. The cylin drical or partly cylindrical stems may therefore represent cognate developments</page><page sequence="38">318 Proceedings of the Royal Irish A cademy from an ultimately Late Antique common origin. Alternatively they may be viewed functionally. Knops were intended as aids to holding the vessels. Chalices with handles simply may not have required them. They cannot in the present state of knowledge be taken as specific evidence for connections between metalworking traditions widely separated in time and space. The copper alloy chalice from Ardagh and the Ulster Museum vessel lack the characteristic insular foot but their bowls are so close to the form of the Derrynaflan and the Ardagh chalices that they cannot be dissociated from the others of insular provenance. The cup of the copper alloy chalice from Ardagh must have been as disproportionately large in relation to its stem as that of the Ulster Museum vessel. The small sample of Irish chalices which we have indicates clearly, however, that there was variety of foot design, although the coincidence of the small domed foot on both a chalice and paten from Lough Kinale is remark able testimony to the persistence of the form in Ireland. The applied rims of the silver Ardagh and the Lough Kinale chalices are unique in the western European corpus of metal eucharistic cups. It may be that the Trewhiddle chalice formerly carried such a feature and it is also possible that a moulding was applied to the lip of the Cunpald chalice, but I have not examined it. The only analogues seem to be amongst the composite metal-mounted hardstone vessels (see below), although rolled but not applied rims are a feature of hanging-bowls (Henry 1936, 217, fig. 5; Fowler 1968, 293, fig. 70). It is clear that in considering the insular chalices we are not dealing with a fixed, uniform, unvarying type. We are presented rather with a number of tenden cies in vessel design which were current in western Europe for a number of centuries and whose adoption did not preclude borrowing of traits of design or decoration from other traditions. Comparable cross-fertilisation produced the Tassilo, Lebuinus and Gauzelin chalices on the Continent. While the contrasts of proportion, structure and bowl form between insular and early Continental chalices are strong, nevertheless there are tendencies which suggest that they represent variants of a common tradition. The Carolingian and Ottonian chalices possess cups which are larger in relation to their total size than those of later periods and they have relatively narrow funnel-shaped feet, two characteristics which both Haseloff (1951, 10) and Elbern (1963, 58) derived from Byzantine Mediterranean prototypes, a suggestion which will be considered below. The tendency anticipated on the large Irish chalices?insofar as the surviving sample may be relied upon?to enlarge the foot in order to increase stability makes its appearance in surviving late Carolingian-early Ottonian times on the Continent? albeit in a different way?when the very broad funnel-shaped foot became common. A trend towards reducing the relative size of the cup becomes noticeable at the same time; it led eventually to the high Gothic tradition of tall chalices with small beaker-shaped cups and broad, extremely elaborately decorated feet. This general sequence is represented in a simplified form by Rohault de Fleury (1883-9, chronological table, p. 151). Decoration of chalices also provides a number of contrasts and comparisons. Engraved ornament occurs on both the insular and Continental chalices. The insular corpus has only two examples of engraving on the bowl (the Ardagh and Trewhiddle chalices) and one of engraving on the foot (the Ulster Museum vessel). The Tassilo, Cunpald and Lebuinus chalices are all decorated with engraved ornament, or, possibly in the case of the Tassilo chalice, decoration resembling engraving produced by casting. Engraved and applied ornament</page><page sequence="39">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 319 occurs on the Grimfridus chalice. Bands of ornament of enamel or amber and filigree are present on two insular chalices?the silver Ardagh and the Derrynaflan vessels. The filigree is, however, applied in the Irish manner?that is, it is made up of a series of discrete foil-backed panels. The former existence of an applied band has been inferred on the Trewhiddle chalice. Jewelled bands of filigree ornament are present on the Gourdon and Gauzelin chalices, but they are not applied as prepared panels?the filigree wires are soldered directly to the surface of the cup in each case. This, however, may be taken only to reflect the different practices of different traditions of goldsmithing in attempting to achieve similar effects. On both the Gourdon and Gauzelin chalices the jewelled bands, like their Irish analogues, pass through the handles. The composition of the Gauzelin chalice (Fig. 4) is especially noteworthy?its hemispherical raised bowl, jewelled band, bowl medallions and broad jewelled foot-ring may indicate some community of tradition with the Irish chalices. Elbern (1963, 34) suggests a Byzantine element in its design. The vertically disposed ornamental bands on its foot have close comparisons among the vessels from the treasury of San Marco in Venice. The conclusion to be drawn is that the insular chalices differ from the contemporary Continental analogues in a range of design traits although common characteristics occur. The cups of the Lough Kinale, Trewhiddle and Hexham vessels fall within the range of Continental examples. Traits such as the foot-ring and the use of knops and applied ornament are also common to both groups. The most striking insular characteristics are the domed or cone-shaped foot with broad flange or foot-ring (favoured in five vessels)?this is only found elsewhere on the Santo Domingo de Silos chalice?and the distinctive bowl form (four examples). Within the small sample of insular chalices there is variety which makes the resem blances between the Ardagh and Derrynaflan silver chalices all the more remarkable. While asserting that there are some contrasts between insular and Continental traditions, it must be emphasised that they are cognate?both stem from Late Antique tableware, and both were intended for the same ritual purpose in what was essentially a united Christian church. The occurrence of the jewelled and filigree bands and the applique medallions on the Ardagh chalice makes it clear that there was influence on Irish vessels from designs elsewhere. How far the differences have been influenced by native technology is difficult to assess. Where did the insular chalices emerge? Clearly, the hanging-bowl on which the large cup appears to be based is rooted in late Roman and early post-Roman Britain (Fowler 1968). While many early hanging-bowls were undoubtedly made in Britain, Irish centres of production are very likely for the late class with elaborate rims either rolled around an iron core or reinforced (Henry 1936, fig. 5 d, e and 239) and perfectly possible for the largest hanging-bowl from Sutton Hoo with its distinctive mouldings and enamelled ornament (Bruce-Mitford 1987, 36). The Ardagh chalice with its applied rolled rim stands close to the appearance of hanging-bowls of class D, although the structure of rim differs from them. The applied rim of the Lough Kinale chalice also differs in structure but clearly reflects the same tradition. Although it is impossible to be certain, the distinctive adaptation of the hanging-bowl to the manufacture of chalices seems to be an Irish one. When this took place is a matter for conjecture; the surviving examples, it may be argued, can be dated mainly to the eighth and ninth centuries and it may be that the type emerged during this period in parallel with the elaboration of class D hanging-bowls. The surviving sample is so small, however, as to make this highly speculative.</page><page sequence="40">320 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 5. Early Byzantine silver chalices From the end of the Second Punic War (Strong 1966, 123-4) silver plate became common in Rome. It was avidly collected by the wealthy of the Republic and the Empire and prized pieces are known to have changed hands for huge sums. Silver plate played an important role in domestic and political life?presen tation pieces were commissioned and distributed by emperors to mark particular occasions. Much silver was presented to barbarian kings and that is one reason why, outside the bounds of the empire, a great deal of Roman silver has been preserved. Silver tableware and show-pieces were commonplace in patrician and middle-class houses, and even slaves are recorded as owning collections (Strong 1966, 125). Private collections may be represented by such finds as the Mildenhall, Kaiseraugst and Esquiline treasures. Temples, too, had their collections of plate?one such was the Temple of Mercury at Canetonum, the silver of which was found in the Berthouville hoard (Strong 1966, 161). The Christian churches, like their pagan counterparts, began early to accumulate treasures. Given that the Eucharist originated as a meal, it follows that the tableware in circulation in the Roman world would have furnished the models for the vessels used as the new religion spread. Thus, because of the uniformity of Roman material culture, more or less the same types would have supplied the local churches throughout the empire. Initially there was little distinction between domestic plate and that used for the mass. Painter (1977, 22) illustrates this point by quoting the story of St Athanasius who was tried before the emperor at Nicomedia in A.D. 332 for, amongst other things, sacrilege. He was charged that his priest, Macarius, had interrupted the celebration of the Eucharist by the priest Ischyras, whose credentials Athanasius rejected. Macarius had broken Ischyras's chalice, overturned his altar and burned his books. Athanasius was acquitted?he claimed that Ischyras's house was not a church and that 'there are many cups in private houses and in the market, and there is no sacrilege in breaking any of these; but the mystic cup, which if it is deliberately broken, involves the perpetrator in sacrilege, is found only in the possession of lawful priests'. Regularisation of the liturgy changed things dramatically: vessels were designed and consecrated for sacred use. Dodd (1961, 27) recounts an incident from the Life of St Theodore of Sykeon, written during the reign of Heraclius (610-41). Theodore sent his archdeacon to the capital to buy a chalice and paten. On his return the archdeacon showed it to the saint who objected to it on the grounds that it was defective. The archdeacon insisted on its high quality and showed its control stamps but Theodore persisted in his opinion. On being filled and prayed over, the chalice turned black and only reverted to silver on being put away. It was returned to Constantinople, where the metal of which it was made was found to have been previously used for a profane vessel. The anecdote is useful not only for indicating the growth of liturgical tradition but also for showing the importance of the capital of the eastern empire in developing styles of vessel for the provinces. The collection and control of the quality of silver was centralised in Constantinople in the office of the Comes Sacrarum Largitionum (Kent 1961). He also controlled workshops where finished and partly finished objects were made for sale. Thus a chalice might have been made in Constantinople and stamped there but decorated in the provinces. Many of the chalices considered here were probably stamped in the capital, although found in Syria. It is difficult to be certain which of the early silver chalices to survive is the oldest. Extravagant claims have been made for the Antioch chalice (Appendix 2,</page><page sequence="41">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 321 no. 15) which is said to have been found in a hoard. It is now generally thought to have been made sometime between the fourth and sixth centuries A.D. (Kent and Painter 1977, 87; Mundell Mango 1986, 183-7). It is an openwork cup with an inner, silver lining. Its deep, half-egg-shaped bowl stands on a disproportionately narrow foot. Its lip is roughly finished. Its vine ornament encloses two figures of Christ and ten saints in its scrolls, together with ornament of insects, birds and animals. The form of the vessel has classical precedents in the cups from the Casa del Menandro, Pompeii, Alesia, Gaul (Strong 1966, pis 33A, 33B), and the Hockwold treasure, Norfolk (Toynbee 1964, 301-3;Johns 1986, 3, frg. 2 and pi. 3). The dominance of vegetal motifs and general form of the Antioch chalice are also strongly recalled by the Lebuinus chalice. However, Mundell Mango suggests that it is sixth-century in date and is to be identified as a lamp. The Lampsacus treasure produced an unstamped hammered cup (Dalton 1901, 82) which may have been liturgical. The body of the vessel is cylindrical with a rounded bottom. It has a small pedestal foot and a short stem of double concave outline. It is 9.86cm high and 19.01cm in rim diameter. It was found with a pricket candlestick, two cross-inscribed bowls (perhaps a form of paten), a hanging-lamp and other pieces. The stamped objects from the hoard, of which there are four, range in date from the mid sixth to the early seventh century A.D. The hoard may have been deposited in the first half of the seventh centurv (Dodd 1961, 90, 103, 166,169). A remarkably uniform series of sixth- and seventh-century communion cups has been found in a small number of closely linked hoards in Syria (Appendix 2, nos 1-10, 12-14, 16-19). These have recently been studied by Mundell Mango (1986), who suggests that many of the objects belong to a single 'Kaper Koraon' hoard which had been split up by dealers for various reasons during the earlier Pi..

The chalices all consist of large, deep bowls almost invariably with inwardly curving profiles and tall, narrow, funnel-shaped, knopped stems. Dedicatory inscriptions within gilded mouldings running around the bowl at the rim, or just a short distance below it, are frequent. Three chalices now in the Cleveland Museum of Art (Pis XVII-XIX) and one from Hama in the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore (PI. XXIII; Appendix 2, no. 3; Mundell Mango 1986, cat. nos 57-9 and 3), have decorated knops. Decoration chased on the bowl at the junction with the stem occurs on the three Cleveland chalices. Flanging of the rims of the feet to produce a more stable base is a regular feature. Only one of the chalices, the Sarrah chalice or chalice of St Stephen, said to have been found at Rusafa, Syria, now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (Mundell Mango 1986, no. 73), has handles (PI. XX). Some of the chalices bear figured ornament?in arcades (the Hama chalice, Appendix 2, no. 3), figures on a plain field (Phela?, Syria, Abegg Stiftung, Berne, Appendix 2, no. 5; Mundell Mango 1986, no. 61), and busts in medallions (the three chalices in the Cleveland Museum of Art, Appendix 2, nos 7, 8, 9, Pis XVII-XIX). A pair of crosses occurs in the arcades of the Hama chalice (Appendix 2, no. 3) and the Chi-Rho monogram with pendant alpha and omega occurs on each side of the bowl of the Sarrah chalice. One of two badly damaged chalices from Kumluca, Turkey, has a large cross on the body (Firalti 1969). Bronze vessels similar to the silver chalices exist?an example with a gadrooned body was found at Zalesie, Galicia, Poland (Elbern 1963, 23, pi. 16). There is an unlocalised bronze cup of this general type in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin (Elbern 1980, 51). A bronze chalice said to be sixth-century from Bolu, Turkey, bears portraits of the Evangelists on the body below an inscription (Atasoy andParman 1983, 172). Until recently, reliable technical descriptions of the Syrian vessels were lacking but this has now been remedied by Mundell Mango (1986, 70) and her collabora tors. Two forms of foot-cup joint have been identified. In the first?type A?the foot was either simply soldered to the bowl or, as in the case of the British Museum chalice (Appendix 2, no. 12; PL XXI), a collar was first soldered to the base of the cup and the foot placed into it and soldered. Afterwards all surface evidence of the joint was removed. All but two of the chalices constructed by this method are stamped. The second type of join?type B?is mechanical. A ring or collar was soldered to the base of the cup. The foot was placed inside it and the metal of the collar then hammered down to effect the join. No type B chalice is stamped but a majority of them bear figured decoration. The Syrian chalices are large, the maximum height recorded being 21cm and the maximum rim diameter being 18.6cm. The great width of the bowls gives these chalices a somewhat top-heavy appearance?their proportions range from 0.98 (no. 14) to 1.29 (no. 7), a spread which places them clearly in the lower end of the series established for chalices of mainland western Europe, Britain and Ireland. In proportions the Syrian chalices are more closely comparable with the surviving insular examples. Other points of resemblance exist between the Byzantine vessels and the surviving Irish chalices, especially the two large silver examples. The three vessels now in Cleveland (Milliken 1951) are remarkably uniform in appearance. Each is decorated with four circular medallions symmetrically placed on the body, within each of which is the bust of a saint and, in one case, the beardless Christ. One of the three cups (Appendix 2, no. 7; PI. XVII) carries a</page><page sequence="44">3 2 4 Proceedi ngs of the Roy a I Irish A cadem y Pi.. XX?Silver chalice of St Stephen, said to have been found at Rnsafa, Syria (photo courtesy of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Edward J. and Man S. Holmes). dedicatory' inscription just below the rim and a plain moulding at the stem-bowl junction. The other two chalices (Appendix 2, nos 8 and 9; Pis XVIII and XIX) lack the inscription but have instead a decorative band based on the egg-and-dart motif within beaded mouldings girdling the bowl a little distance below the lip. On the base of the bowl around the junction with the stem there is chased decoration. A resemblance to the Ardagh silver chalice can be seen in the occurrence of the decorative girdle, inscription, medallions, and ornament on the base of the bowl. The bowl of the Sarrah chalice (PL XX), also said to have been found at Rusafa, provides another parallel for the composition of the Ardagh silver chalice (de Paor 1980, 12; Harbison 1981, 237; Ryan 1984a, 22). While it lacks the purely ornamental features of the Cleveland vessels it is equipped with a pair of ring handles with thumb-plates flush with the rim. Just below the rim and interrupted by the handles is a dedicatory inscription within half-round gilded mouldings. Below it, on the centre of each face, is a repousse gilded Chi-Rho with pendant alpha and omega recalling the medallions with crosses of arcs (decayed Chi-Rhos: Thomas 1981a, 86-92) on the bowl of the Ardagh chalice. A small silver cup, from the seventh-century princely grave of Malaya Pereschepina (former province of Perm, USSR), has applied bands of ornament and bowl medallions (Fig. 12; Conway 1923; Werner 1984, 12-14). It will be discussed further below in connection with composite chalices. It is one of 21 chalice-like vessels from this grave find, and although they are secular and of local manufacture they may owe something ultimately to Byzantine influences (Werner 1984, pi. no. 26).' The Syrian chalices, although far removed from them in time and space, provide particularly close analogues for the use of large bowls on the Irish silver vessels. Other resemblances are traceable also in the insular series.

The Hama chalice (PL XXIII), now ^Baltimore (Dodd 1973, 16, fig. 8), has a thick, disc-like projection at the base of the bowl somewhat similar in superficial appearance to the downward projecting flange on the upper ring of the stem of the Derrynaflan chalice. Both may well be skeumorphs of a feature of composite chalices (Ryan 1984b, 144; 1985; see also below). Moreover, the bronze Ardagh chalice, although possessing a cup in the hanging-bowl tradition, compares closely with the Byzantine series in having a bowl which is large in relation to its narrow, funnel-shaped foot. Large Byzantine chalices of the type under discussion must have been known in the west. The Empress Theodora is depicted on a sixth-century mosaic in San Vitale, Ravenna, carrying a jewelled version (Paolucci 1978, 51-2).

The tradition of large-bowled chalices remains widespread in the eastern churches to the present day. A silver chalice of eastern origin is specifically described in an early Irish text. Arculf, a Frankish bishop, on his return from the Holy Land and Byzantium,</page><page sequence="47">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 327 visited Iona where Adomnan took down his account of the Holy Places?a work which enjoyed wide currency in early medieval Europe. Arculf described to Adomnan the chalice of the Last Supper preserved in Jerusalem, which he had seen and touched, as made of silver, the measure of a Gaulish sextarius in capacity and having two handles (Meehan 1958, 50). (The modern estimate of the value of a sextarius is disputed and varies between roughly 570cc and 1420cc (Gogan 1932, 45).) Gogan regarded the chalice described as the 'perfect exemplar' of the Ardagh chalice (Gogan 1932, 44; Ryan 1984b, 144). How likely is it that such eastern silver chalices played a part in the formation of the Irish style? Both Elbern (1963, 58) and Haseloff (1951, 10) agree in seeing some Byzantine influence on the Tassilo chalice and its analogues. Direct connec tions between the insular world and the east are documented but perhaps overstated (U. Roth 1979, 12-22, 26-30, for a recent survey). Apart from Arculf s dramatic account of pilgrimage, we should note that Theodore, archbishop of Canterbury c. 668-90, came from Tarsus. It is, however, unwise to invoke the person of Theodore as a conduit for eastern influences in England and thence ultimately in Ireland. He was sent to England together with the Abbot Hadrian, whose role, according to Bede, was to guard against Theodore introducing oriental customs. The occurrence of imported pottery of eastern Mediterranean origin in western Britain and in Ireland is well known (Thomas 1959; 1981b), while Alexandrine vessels ('Urceos alexandrinos') were in circulation in western Europe (H. Roth 1980). It is therefore perfectly conceivable that eastern ideas of vessel design were available in the insular world in the early centuries of Christianity. Thus it is possible that chalices produced in a mature phase of development of the indigenous styles drew on ideas imported earlier from the east. The presence of Byzantine bronze and silver tableware in the Sutton Hoo burial shows clearly that the widespread trade of the time could have dispersed vessels and ideas of vessel design widely. It is impossible, however, to decide whether there was specific eastern influence on insular chalices because the common origin of all Christian altar plate would have ensured that common characteristics were widely distributed. (A case has already been made for the Late Roman inspiration of the Derrynaflan paten (Ryan 1987b).) Here, too, we have to reckon with the bias of survival. In an important observation on the decoration of what may be an earlier fourth-fifth century box or pyx in the Hama hoard, Mundell Mango (1986, 114-17) compared it with the decoration of a piece from the Coleraine hoard. She noted that objects of that date or slightly earlier, discovered and probably made in Syria, often found their parallels in the west. She advanced a number of explanations for this. Firstly, most fourth-century silver has been found in the west. Secondly, the multiplication of imperial capitals and the state network of production produced a widespread standardisation of certain types. Furthermore, in the fourth century Antioch was an imperial residence with a strong Latin presence. By the same token, it can be observed that most sixth-century church plate has been found in the east and, with very little material to compare to the few western examples of the period and slightly later, the points of resemblance may be correspondingly overstressed. It is, however, best, given the size of the sample of early chalices, to regard the western and eastern metal chalices partly as outgrowths from a common Late Roman stock and partly as similar solutions to similar problems of function and manufacture and, while allowing for the possibility of cross-fertilisation, to see them as essentially regional and even divergent traditions.</page><page sequence="48">328 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy ^^^KBKrr^^^^^^^K^Km^S^^^^m^^e^^^^^l^^t^^' JHHIIBik -^"^~^wBKr''"*'" '"C^^^^_^_^_l mSv*^5S^!SBKS_SS___^_|B #x&gt;^kL."s dfe / "?r ^^- I '4^ dS^_s?^S^^^^^K?yiafl^^^9E?iibMi^B HSJiLq^jm^ fc___G_NE_^_H_HV~' ~?t "^"WpP t^_a f J ' * ^ta. . _K_flET**&amp;* . _^_^______r_____________B _^___wq / * ^fi]Si_H_r? j?*w ' / \ s ^^ijni^HH^KMpffiP^K^^^H ^ Hbk?.

Chalices of semi-precious stone By no means all early medieval chalices were made of gold and silver and gilded base metals. A number of semi-precious stone with metal mounts survive?those of Doha Urraca and St Denis have already been mentioned, together with the so-called 'Coupe des PtolomeeV in the Cabinet des Medailles, Paris, and the 'Heinrichskelch' in Munich. No corpus of chalices of semi-precious stone has been published (Alcouffe 1984) but those of the treasury of San Marco in Venice have been catalogued by Grabar (1971) and Erdmann (1971) and frequently commented on (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 104-7; Dalton 1911, 574; Braun 1932, 47 and Tafs 1, 3, 5-9; Alcouffe and Frazer 1984 with refs.) The 'Chalice of St Adalbert', now in Gniezno Cathedral, Poland, has been studied by Skubiszewski (1978). Antique vessels of semi-precious stone have been the subject of a studv by Biihler (1973). Twenty-seven of the San Marco vessels catalogued by Grabar (1971) and one of those by Erdmann (1971) are chalices. Of these, four are made of glass (Grabar, no. 54) and one is of silver frame-work with large crystal inserts (Grabar, no. 55). Of the remaining 22 vessels, nine are of onyx, five of sardonyx and one of chalcedony; three are made of alabaster while there is one example each of rock crystal, porphyry, jasper and serpentine. The majority of the chalices have stems and broad flared feet of metal. Eight examples (three of them glass: Grabar, nos 58, 63 and 65) have low, stemless feet. One (Grabar, no. 86) lacks a stem, while no.</page><page sequence="49">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 329 Vic. 13?Sardonyx chalice with applied metal mountings (chalice of the Emperor Romanos), Treasury of San Marco, Venice, tenth century A.D. 46 has a modern replacement. Stems are often knopped and sometimes have cylindrical elements. Inscriptions are common. Chalices are regularly equipped with handles?in three cases (Grabar, nos 42 (Fig. 13), 60, 61) the handles are caned in one piece with the bowl but one example almost certainly was an antique bowl reused (see below). The handles otherwise are of metal and are fastened to the bowls by means of applied metal bands. Six chalices have applied metal handles, nineteen are without handles, while the silver chalice (no. 54) has three. There is an agate chalice with a broad bowl, short cylindrical stem and domed foot in the Hermitage, Leningrad (Grabar 1971, 57 and pi. 87). Hardstone vessel-making has a long history (Biihler 1973). It was being practised in Egypt in early times and by the sixth and seventh centuries B.C. raw material was apparently imported from India. The inclusion of Egypt in the Roman Empire led to a flowering of the art because of the expanded market. The vessels were highly prized in Rome and it is conceivable, given the carving of cameos, that vessel-making was also practised there. Gem workshops were known at Aquileia and Tarento, and an agate dish in Venice carries an inscription which suggests that it was made at Trier (Buhler 1973, 31). It seems that antique carved cups continued to be prized in the Byzantine world and surviving vessels were often fitted with metal mounts and used as chalices. Later, hardstone vessel making may have been revived in the eastern empire and cups were formed specifically for use as chalices, ewers and so forth (Alcouffe 1984). Outside the Christian world, the workshops of the Fatimid caliphs of Cordoba were producing vessels in carved rock crystal, examples of which were remounted in the west as chalices, e.g. the 'Heinrichskelch' in Munich. Vessels of Sassanian workmanship are also attested, while later Islamic work in hardstone is well known. It is highly likely that the carving of large gemstones was introduced into the Rhineland in the</page><page sequence="50">330 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy early medieval period and, in later times, carved crystal reliquaries and monstrance fittings of western workmanship became fairly common and many survive in museum collections and church treasuries. No definitive methods have been worked out for distinguishing between antique hardstone vessels reused in medieval times and those carved in later centuries. Alcouffe in his short essay indicates as a rule of thumb that the classical vessels are those of finer craftsmanship with thinner walls and handles often carved in one piece with the bowls. Thus he suggests that whereas the chalice with caned handles of the Emperor Romanos in San Marco reuses an antique bowl (Fig. 13), its fellow with metal handles on a truncated conical cup and with a eucharistic inscription is likely to be entirely of ninth- to eleventh-century Byzantine workmanship (Alcouffe and Frazer 1984, 129-31, 156-8). Making chalices by mounting metal fittings, including a stem, on a bowl of semi-precious stone causes special problems. A horizontal metal band?often an applied lip?was attached to the rim and from this ran vertical strips to fasten the bowl and hold it firmly to the applied stem. These strips were normally attached to one another by means of simple hinges. Classical hardstone cups normally had foot-rings and these had to be accommodated in substantial squat cylindrical housings at the tops of the stems. In later times, even when bowls were custom made for chalices, e.g. the 'Chalice of Patriarchs', San Marco (Fig. 14; Alcouffe and Frazer 1984, 159-65), and other chalices in Venice, a horizontal band was placed around the base of the bowl to fasten it to the stem and this, too, can be a Fie. 14?Sardonyx chalice with applied metal mountings, Treasury of San Marco, Venice, tenth century A.D.</page><page sequence="51">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 331 very prominent feature. The feet of the chalices are normally widely splayed with a broad rim or flange to form foot-rings not unlike those of the Ardagh silver and Derrynaflan chalices. Rim bands of the most sumptuous chalices in Venice are usually divided into panels, often enamelled with the busts of saints (Alcouffe and Frazer 1984, pis pp 130, 131, 136, 160, 166). Stems and feet are also jewelled and enamelled, one example (Alcouffe and Frazer 1984, 163, fig. 16b) having alternating quadrangular and round jewels on the footring. Two especially striking chalices bear round, figured medallions on the vertical strips binding the bowls to the stems. A common feature is the use of pearls strung on wires passing through loops to form mouldings which define the rim bands and other decorative metal features. Chalices of semi-precious stone were known in western Europe in pre Carolingian times (Braun 1932, 37-8). Heiric, writing in the mid ninth century, records that Queen Brunhilde (ob. 613) presented to the church of St Stephen, Auxerre, 'a chalice of wonderful beauty of onyx stone decorated with purest gold' (Knogel 1936, 85, no. 144). The Irish Vita Brendani (Plummer 1922, 58) describes how in his wandering the saint and his companions came upon a monastery, in the church of which they found chalices of crystal, but whether this should be taken as more than hagiographical hyperbole is open to question. In the Carolingian period, to judge by the 'Coupe des Ptolomees' and the paten of Charles the Bald, hardstone vessels were in circulation and Braun (1932, 46) records numerous references in contemporary sources. In later centuries they became relatively frequently mentioned in the treasury inventories of important churches (Bischoff 1967, passim) and especially amongst Suger's acquisitions for St Denis (Gaborit-Chopin 1986; Wixom 1986). It is recorded that a hardstone cup reached Anglo-Saxon England. In 1104 the relics of St Cuthbert were translated to their new resting place in the rebuilt cathedral at Durham. In the Anonymous Account of the translation (Battiscombe 1956, 103) a list of the relics found in the coffin is given. Amongst them is described '. . . a chalice, small in size but from its materials and workmanship precious, its lower part representing a lion of the purest gold, which bore on its back an onyx stone, made hollow by the most beautiful workmanship and, by the ingenuity of the artist, so attached to the back of the lion that it might be easily turned around with the hand, although it might not be separated from it . . .'.At which of the previous openings of the coffins it had been placed in the tomb is unknown. Athelstan (reigned 925-39) received from Duke Hugo of the Franks many precious gifts which included a carved vessel of onyx (Dodwell 1982, 156) and he is known to have presented gifts to St Cuthbert's shrine. In the case of Anglo-Saxon England, we know from the Liber Pontificalis that the exchange of vessels was not one-sided; under Pope Leo III (795-816) the church of St Susanna in Rome had a silver dish of Saxon workmanship, and later in the ninth century St Mark's is recorded as having twelve silver vessels of 'Anglian' workmanship (Duchesne 1892, 3, 74). There is no evidence recorded that chalices of hardstone reached Ireland. It is, however, inconceivable, given the regular intercourse between the Irish church and that of the European mainland, that they would have been entirely unknown. 7. Chalices in other media The field has been surveyed principally by Braun (1932, 30-47) and reviewed by Buckton (forthcoming). Glass chalices are often attested in historical sources.</page><page sequence="52">332 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Braun suggests, for instance, that the story of the broken chalice told about St Athanasius and Ischyras (above, p. 320) might indicate the use of glass chalices. The use of base materials for liturgical vessels became something of a hagio graphical convention in early medieval times; thus Jerome says of St Exsuperius that 'he ministered the Body of Christ in a basket of osiers and the Blood in a glass cup', while Boniface is credited with the aphorism about golden priests celebrat ing with chalices of wood in former times in contrast to his own day when the priests were of inferior quality but the chalices of gold. It is conceivable that wood was actually used (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 65) and it was banned at the Council of Trebur in 895 (Webster 1924, 4). The Council of Rheims (847) specified that gold and silver were to be the materials of chalices but that tin might be allowed in cases of great poverty. The Council of Calchyth (Chelsea?) in 787 outlawed the use of oxhorn for the making of chalices and patens (Haddan and Stubbs 1871, 452). The anecdote in Walafrid Strabo's Life of St Gall has sometimes been quoted as evidence of Irish practice. The saint was giving alms to the poor when a disciple, Magnoald, suggested withholding a silver vessel for use in the liturgy. St Gall rebuked him and said that his blessed teacher Columbanus was accustomed to offer the sacrifice of the mass in vessels of bronze because it was said that Christ had been fastened to the cross with bronze nails (Joynt 1927, 90-1). Here, too, hagiographical convention is in question. The saint is represented as seizing the opportunity to point a moral and the writer has clearly opted to demonstrate the holy man's sanctity without particular regard for historical truth. The reference does not document either Irish or other traditions of chalice manufacture. Glass cups, bowls, bottles and lamps were extensively used in the Roman Empire and factories existed in the Rhineland, the products of which were widely distributed in the west. The vessels, understandably, tended to match their metal counterparts in range of shapes. Thus it is that some cantharus and scy/?/ms-shaped cups have survived in Migration Period graves. A fourth-century woman's grave at Strasbourg yielded an excellent sample (Schulze 1980, 80, no. 77). A closely similar vessel from Cologne was compared by Elbern (1965b, 121, 122, fig. 7) with the Lebuinus chalice. The Liber Pontificalis records of Pope Zephyrinus that he ordered glass patens to be borne into the church when a bishop celebrated mass (Duchesne 1886, 61). Despite proscription by Pope Leo IV (Nesbitt 1875, 339) and by others (Rohault de Fleury 1883-9, 100), glass liturgical vessels enjoyed what might be termed respectability in the early medieval church (Braun 1932, 36-7). Wurzburg is recorded in the ninth century as having a chalice of glass decorated with gold, together with its paten (von Schlosser 1892, 133). Glass vessels are recorded in Britain from the seventh century. Benedict Biscop, as Bede relates, brought from Gaul "vitri fadores who made windows for his church at Monkwearmouth as well as vessels designed for a variety of uses (Knogel 1936, 219). However, by 764 his successor, Cuthbert, was writing to the archbishop of Mainz asking for help in obtaining the services of a maker of glass vessels (Dodwell 1982, 63-4). The archaeological evidence for glass vessels in pagan and Early Christian contexts in Britain has been documented by Harden (1956). Glass vessels were almost certainly current in Ireland in the period when the Derrynaflan and Ardagh chalices were made, although only fragments have been found and some of the glass may have been imported as raw material for enamel work (Harden 1956, 154). An anecdote in the eighth-century Old Irish Life of St Brigit (O hAodha 1978, 10-11, 27-8) recounts that the saint restored through prayer a highly prized</page><page sequence="53">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 333 goblet which had been let fall and been smashed against a table. The most likely interpretation?although not the only one?is that a glass vessel rather than, say, a pottery one was intended by the author. The story appears also in the metrical Latin Life of St Brigid of the early ninth century (Kissane 1977, 107). A similar miracle is attributed to St Ailbe (Gogan 1932, 13). A chalice of glass is mentioned in the Life of Barra of Cork (Plummer 1922, 16) but this is a late source. Gogan (1932, 13-14) has discussed chaiice-Iike vessels from which vines grow on f. 32v of the Book of Kells (Alexander 1978, pl. 243) as being of glass. They are depicted in a pale blue wash but, as they are the vessels from which the 'True Vine' is growing, they are an expression of the widespread Early Christian 'Tree of Life' icono graphical convention. Although clearly of eucharistic import they are not specific evidence for glass chalices in whatever locality Kells was painted. He also remarked on a reference to glass chalices in the Vita Tripartita (Gogan 1932, 12-13). It is conceivable, therefore, that chalice design in Ireland may have been influenced by vessels of glass which no longer survive, but we possess at present no way of identi fying or quantifying such influence, if any, nor have we any way of determining whether such influence was brought to bear in Ireland or whether it had been already assimilated into oth^r metalworking traditions elsewhere which in turn influenced Irish work. Following an earlier tradition of scholarship I argued in outline (Ryan 1984b, 143-4) that chalices of semi-precious stone and of media other than metal contributed heavily to the development of the early Irish chalices. In this I was following an argument first put forward by Conway (1923, 11) when he described the Ardagh chalice as dimly retaining some of the characteristics of Byzantine metal-mounted hardstone vessels. He argued convincingly that the silver chalice shaped cup?one of several from the seventh-century grave of Malaya Pereschepina already mentioned (Fig. 12; Perm, USSR, Conway 1923, pl. Ill, fig. 2; Werner 1984, 12-14)?demonstrated that characteristics of composite vessels were sometimes translated to those entirely of metal. The Malaya Pereschepina cup has applied mouldings forming a bowl girdle and vertical bands connecting the girdle to the base of the bowl. At that point there is a further horizontal band forming a disc-like projection at the base-stem junction. There are two mouldings formed of beads strung on wire in the manner of some of the San Marco vessels as well as a medallion in the middle of the bowl. As noted above, the Malaya Pereschepina cups are regarded as a table service. It seems likely that the Irish vessels owe something, although the debt is less obvious, to the tradition of composite vessels. A general indication in support of this view is that all the decorative components of the Irish silver chalices are applied, as the metal ornaments of a stone vessel must of necessity be, although it may be argued that this was a regular Irish method of ornamentation and that a native craftsman might have approached the problems of decoration in this manner as a matter of course. The other argument is formal?the applied bands of the bowl girdles look somewhat like their counterparts on composite chalices. The projection at the base of the bowl of the Derrynaflan chalice is without practical function but nevertheless reflects closely the shape of the housings at the stem-bowl junctions of surviving composite chalices in San Marco (Ryan 1984a, 22). The use of applied lip-mouldings on two (and possibly a third) insular chalices may likewise owe something to composite vessels. The case for arguing some influence of composite stone and metal vessels is therefore not to be dismissed. There is, however, no way of tracing the manner by which those</page><page sequence="54">334 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy influences might have been brought into play, whether directly or indirectly, through other metal vessels themselves reflecting the composite form, through imports into Ireland, through direct links with the eastern Mediterranean or through reports and sketches from which a craftsman may have been asked to work; nor do such resemblances as exist permit us to infer any form of direct connection between the surviving Irish metal chalices and those of semi-precious stone. Continuing Byzantine connections are evident in continental Europe throughout the period: Wixom (1986, 295), discussing the much later chalice of Suger from St Denis, regards its composite construction as showing a 'healthy respect' for Byzantine traditions. Buckton (forthcoming) has discussed the problem of the raw materials in detail and shows how the gradual preference for gold and silver was related in a large measure to the desire to protect the integrity of the contents of eucharistic vessels. This desire must also have influenced structure. The seamless bowl fastened externally to the foot became the norm, the method of fastening the foot to the bowl becoming especially important here. A pin uniting the components would pose the threat of leakage. The San Marco chalices were, he felt, entirely votive because the metal fastenings at the lip were imperfectly sealed and would have threatened the integrity of the eucharistic wine. His point finds some support in the instructions for preparing the altar for liturgical feasts at Metz in the twelfth or thirteenth century, where chalices of onyx, gold, silver and crystal appear to have been employed as ornaments (Bischoff 1967, 138-9). Chalices suspended in arches as decoration occur frequently in manuscript illuminations, and hanging chalices are mentioned in the Liber Pontificalis. Such an argument does not necessarily apply to the insular chalices because foot-cup joins effected by large pins or rivets occur on both the large silver chalices and the humbler Ulster Museum, Lough Kinale, Hexham and Trewhiddle examples, although it is perfectly conceivable that the larger chalices were votive and not intended for use. MacRoberts (1961), assuming the St Ninian's Isle vessels to be liturgical, argues that the votive chalice was known in the insular world. Protection of the integrity of the Eucharist was taken as seriously in the early Irish church as elsewhere, but that may not have extended to design features of sacred vessels at the period?joints could in any event have been waterproofed with wax if necessary. The Derrynaflan paten with its knitted wire mouldings would have posed many problems if used for the Host?particles would have become trapped in the mesh and cleaning it would have been very difficult. Was it, therefore, a purely votive paten? The evidence of wear on some of the filigree insets of its enamel studs suggests that it?like the Derrynaflan chalice?had received some handling consistent with use. In the present state of knowledge the question cannot be decided either way. Doherty (1980, 72) speculated that some chalices and patens may have represented royal wealth converted to liturgical use for display, and questioned whether kings might not have retained a claim on such gifts. It is an interesting idea, but given the small amounts of bullion in the vessels and the reverence in which sacred utensils were held, they were unlikely to have been a regular method of displaying reclaimable royal wealth. The element of display is as well served by the outright gift of vessels for votive or practical purposes. There is no doubt that chalices of precious metal were melted down in medieval times, to be recycled in the form of new liturgical objects, when taken as booty, to relieve distress in times of poverty, and to raise money for payments such</page><page sequence="55">Ryan?Insular eucharistic chalices 335 as ransom and exactions like the Danegeld in England. The majority of the insular and Byzantine silver chalices were found in hoards and their survival is the result of action taken in times of stress to safeguard them. The majority of Continental chalices were preserved in graves. These facts alone indicate that the western European sample is seriously skewed in the direction of smaller, less sumptuous vessels and only very exceptionally can we glimpse the full range. Despite the smallness and bias of our sample, the distinctiveness of the insular chalices?five from Ireland, two found in Anglo-Saxon England?emerges clearly. It seems that chalice form was yet another cultural trait shared by the Irish and Anglo-Saxons in early medieval times.</page><page sequence="56">i s Appendix 1 Early medieval chalices: Europe (based on Elbern 1963 with additions) Elbern Present no. location Provenance Materials Dimensions Proportions Remarks 1 Amsterdam: Utrecht, Silver Damaged: c. 1.8 Grave chalice of Bishop Bernulph Rijksmuseum St Peterskerk original H. ?9cm, (ob. 1054) D. 5cm (rim) 2 Bamberg, Bamberg Silver Damaged: c. 1.2 Grave chalice.

The explanation seems reasonable</page><page sequence="64">344 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Appendix 2 Byzantine metal chalices The list of Byzantine metal chalices given here includes all those known to me from the literature to November 1986. Of the chalices listed, nos 1-3, 6 and 11-14 have been seen by me in the course of museum visits to inspect comparative material. Only two, however, have I been able to handle and examine closely. The overwhelming majority of the chalices are recorded as having come from Syria and as having been found in a few hoards?those of Antioch, Hama, Riha, Rusafa and Phela. Great confusion exists about the precise find circumstances of most of these hoards and deliberate misprovenancing and promoting of confusion about the contents of hoards may be suspected. Mundell Mango (1986) believes that many of the so-called hoards were created out of a single Kaper Koraon find. It is fortunate that the dating of stamped objects is independent of precise associa tions?this applies not only to chalices but to associated patens, ewers, spoons, flabella etc. It is remarkable how closely knit chronologically the hoards are, and how often connections between them are established by personal names or dedica tions. The hoards were deposited in the later sixth or, more probably, earlier seventh century. To the silver chalices listed here should perhaps be added the four golden cups of broadly similar type from Vrap, Albania (Werner 1986, Tafs 1, 3, 4-6), one of which bears repousse stylised figures of Constantinople, Cyprus, Rome and Alexandria (Kent and Painter 1977, 91, no. 154). A supplementary list of other possibly relevant vessels is appended?it does not claim to be exhaustive. Proportions are calculated by dividing the height by the rim diameter as for the chalices of Appendix 1. However, as some Byzantine chalices achieve their maximum diameter at a point slightly below the rim, the method chosen represents the chalices as slightly more slender than they are in reality. It has not been the practice to publish the greatest diameter in the literature and so it is impossible to base statistics on the ratio of height to that dimension. NOTE ADDED IN PRESS My attention has just been drawn to the announcement by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York of the recent acquisition of a new hoard of fifteen religious objects associated with the important merchant town of Attarouthi in the ancient province of Apamea, Syria. The hoard consists of ten silver-gilt chalices, three silver censers, a wine-strainer and a eucharistic dove, also of silver. The chalices are unstamped and all but one carry repousse figures of saints?in at least five cases in arcades. The chalice without figured decoration bears cross and star motifs. The chalices and censers bear dedicatory inscriptions recording donors' names?the majority of the inscriptions mention the town of Attarouthi in variant spellings. The chalices are all provided with decorated knops and funnel-shaped feet, and there is marked flanging of the foot-rims. The feet are decorated with hammered ornament in relief?a running wheat-sheaf motif seems to be standard. The wine-strainer is of composite sieve-and-funnel type. The chalices increase the corpus of Byzantine examples significantly but do not suggest a major revision of classification. A preliminary notice of the hoard was published by Margaret E. Frazer, 'Silver liturgical objects from Attarouthi in Syria', Fourteenth Annual Byzantine Studies Conference, Abstracts of Papers (the Mesnil Collection and the University of St Thomas, Houston, 1988), 13-14.</page><page sequence="65">f &amp; Co I oo No. Location Provenance Dimensions Proportions Comment References 1 Baltimore: Hama, Syria H. 15.6cm, 1.11 Knopped chalice with gilded Miner 1947, 87, 396; Dodd 1961, Walters D. 14cm inscription around rim.

Bronze bowl, Jaaten, Rogaland, Norway. This insular bronze bowl, decorated with Ultimate La Tene motifs, was cut down and adapted for use as a box for weighing-scales during the Viking Period. Raftery (1941, 103) regarded it as having originally been the bowl of a chalice, but the dome-head of its rivet is on the exterior. Regarded, rightly, as uncertain by Warners (1983, 279), who nevertheless felt the rivet may have been reversed when the bowl was modified. He illustrates (Warners 1983, fig. la, pl. 280) hammer-work which he associates with a possible relocation of the rivet. It need not be secondary. Webster (1989, 66) has argued that the Jaaten bowl may originally have formed the foot of a drinking vessel. II. Bronze mount, Clonmacnoise, Co. Offaly. Identified by Raftery (1941, 103) as the base of a chalice, this small hemispherical object is not perforated for the reception of a central pin or rivet. Instead it bears what is quite clearly a setting for a glass or amber stud (Warners 1983, 279). Rather than being the base of a chalice it is closely comparable with the bosses on the recently discovered Lough Kinale book-shrine. III. Gilt bronze and niello-inlaid boss from Steeple Bumpstead (Smith 1923, 137-40; Henry 1965, 99). Tentatively suggested as a chalice, it appears to be a large boss designed to be attached to the wooden backing of a shrine, altar or other composite object. The large central perforation is quite clearly a setting for a stud and not a hole or socket to receive a stem. Not accepted as a chalice fragment by Raftery who regards it together with other mounts as a portion of'tabernacle decoration' (Raftery 1941, 98-100, esp. 99-100). IV. Decorated, dome-shaped, gilt bronze mount from Baere-Var, Stokke, Vestfold, Norway. Identified by both Raftery (1941, 103) and Warners (1983, 279-82) as the base of a small travelling or grave chalice (it is 2.9cm in diameter and 1cm high), it has a flanged rim and a central perforation. While it is possible that it is from a chalice, there is no particularly compelling reason for so identifying it.
