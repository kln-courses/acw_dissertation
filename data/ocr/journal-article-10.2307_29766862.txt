<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Use and Abuse of Animals In Criminology: A Brief History And Current Review Piers Beirne 1. Introduction IN AN ESSAY ON ANIMAL-RELATED HUMAN BEHAVIOR, THE SOCIOLOGIST CLIFTON Bryant (1979) once made a plea for the study of "zoological crime." By this somewhat jarring term, Bryant referred to the violation of "animal related social norms...[which] may well be among the most ubiquitous of any social deviancy" (Ibid.: 412). Since that clarion call the study of "zoological crime" (or of "animal abuse," the term used here) has altogether failed to find a place in criminology. Scholarly studies of animal abuse remain virtually non-existent, and the topic is completely ignored in criminology textbooks. The few apparent exceptions remain segregated from the mainstream, marginalized either by the esoteric nature of their subject matter (Hawley, 1989; 1993) or else by their radical political viewpoint (Frank and Lynch, 1992: 82,90-94). This essay is written in the belief that animal abuse should be placed firmly on the sociological agenda. My original strategy to remedy its neglect was to try to constitute the category of animal abuse as a coherent object of study. Yet the achievement of this task was abruptly thwarted by my discovery that, though the field of crimes against animals does not yet constitute a recognized, let alone a coherent, object of study, this is not to say that animals are never present in criminological discourse. I discovered that animals already provide a surprising amount of material for such diverse problems as, inter alia, the configuration of rural class relations in 18th century England, the alleged links between crime and human nature, and the behavioral manifestations of children who are likely to be violent as adults. In what follows I identify the scripts and statuses with which animals are endowed in criminology. I describe seriatim four intellectual milieus in which Piers Beirne is a Professor of Sociology and Legal Studies, University of Southern Maine (96 Falmouth Street, Portland ME 04103). His recent books include Inventing Criminology (1993) and Criminology (Second Edition, 1995, with Jim Messerschmidt). He is currently writing a book on animal abuse. The author wishes to thank the following colleagues for comments on an earlier version of this article: Jacqueline Helfgott, Alan Hunt, Jim Messerschmidt, Barbara Perry, and members of a seminar at the University of New Hampshire. Social Justice Vol. 22, No. 1 5</page><page sequence="2">6 Beirne animals can be found on those occasions when they enter criminological dis? course. These I term, respectively: 1. Animals as criminals (and vice versa); 2. Animals and humans as partners in crime; 3. Analogies between animals and humans; and 4. Animals as objects. How do animals enter these milieus? Do they appear as authentic subjects, for example, or are they brought in as Cartesian automata that are mere appendages to humans? Are they viewed as sentient beings with innate rights or as edible meat awaiting slaughter? I will suggest that, when answered, some of these questions invite the charge that, as a discipline, criminology has been guilty of a thorough? going speciesism. I must stress that, though it is the discursive presence of animals in criminology that this essay addresses, my concern here is more with a description of the roles that nonhuman animals (henceforth "animals") occupy in criminology than with animal advocacy as such. That task I will undertake in an essay companion to this one. 2. Animals as Criminals (and Vice Versa) In parts of medieval Europe from approximately 1280 until as late as 1750, animals that had harmed humans were sometimes prosecuted and punished for their misdeeds (Beirne, 1994). Ideological confirmation of this seemingly bizarre practice was extracted from biblical dictates. Thus: "if an ox gore a man or a woman that they die, then the ox shall be surely stoned" (Exodus, xxi, 28). Its institutional enforcement was sanctioned both by folklore and by legal (especially Catholic) opinion, which agreed on the need to prosecute deserving animals in the medieval courtroom and, in appropriate cases, to execute them for their crimes. Domestic[ated] animals were tried in the secular courts and, if necessary, were exposed to the same terrors of public execution as were humans. Wild animals and "vermin" were tried in the ecclesiastical courts and, if found guilty, were subject to the curse of a malediction. The broad matrix of medieval animal trials has been described, and their origin and end debated, in a small English-language literature devoted to the subject (Evans, 1906; Westermarck, 1906, 1: 249-260; Frazer, 1923: 397-417; Kelsen, 1923: 3-8; Newman, 1978: 89-94; Finkelstein, 1981; Cohen, 1986; Oates, 1989; Beirne, 1994). Though the object of this predominantly anthropological literature is an examination of medieval animal trials, the topic of bygone animal executions compels thought about some elemental epistemological questions that modern criminologists tend to ignore. Are we precluded from understanding the criminalization practices of another period or culture, or another culture today, whose standards of rationality and criteria of proof differ fundamentally from our own? In trying to understand them, is it inevitable that we see their beliefs as mistaken and their practices as absurd?</page><page sequence="3">The Use and Abuse of Animals in Criminology 7 Though the anthropomorphic tendency to divine human intentions in animal behavior is certainly an ancient one, the folkloric notion that animals are capable of engaging in crime did not expire with the last of the medieval clerics.1 That notion has been preserved and even, on occasion, developed by criminologists themselves. Most prominently, it was held in the 1870s and 1880s by the Lombrosian members of the school of criminal anthropology ? one of whose chief aims, in trying scientifically to demarcate Homo criminalis from Homo sapiens, was to combat superstitious dogma of all sorts. The ideas of late 19th-century criminal anthropology about animal criminality, and about the pivotal role of animal instincts in the genesis of crime among humans, were probably inspired by a famous passage in Darwin's The Descent of Man. Here, in the context of a discussion of moral evolution, Darwin had suggested that those with "the worst moral dispositions" are reversions to a savage state from which we are not removed by many generations: "Such men are the black sheep of the family" (1871, i: 173). His suggestion was pursued by Lombroso, the inventor of the notion of the "born criminal," who located the source of criminality in the phenomena of atavism, a constellation of animal-like attributes dependent on a demarcation of the "normal" and "law-abiding" citizenry from the criminal type. After Lombroso had identified atavism as the chief scientific cause of crime, one of the underlying evolutionary questions pursued by criminal anthropologists was the precise range of species about which it was legitimate to characterize as potential criminals. Lombroso himself held that the criminal "must be a survival of the primitive man and the carnivorous animals" (1895a: 35). On other occasions, with more or less candor, he associated criminality with animal instincts and animal savagery, and he suggested that to search for its origins one might need to go "as far back as" various insectivorous plants (Lombroso, 1895b: 31; 1918:365,368; see also Lombroso-Ferrero, 1911: 135-136); furthermore, in the first part of his famous rUomo delinquente, Lombroso (1876) had already exposed crimes committed by animals such as storks, beavers, and ants. However, in his widely read book, The Criminal, the English Lombrosian and eugenist Havelock Ellis rejected as less than authoritative Lombroso's claim that in the search for criminals one must go "as far back as" various insectivorous plants. Ellis reasoned that one could scarcely hope to find genuine vegetable criminals because to be criminal "the deed must be exceptional in the species, and must provoke a social reaction among the other members of that species" (1890: 248).2 In seeking the biological origin of crime, most agreed it was necessary to start with "intelligent" animals, criminal examples of which were "lazy" beavers and "rogue" elephants (Ibid.: 249-250); "thieving" monkeys, "wild" goats, "dangerous" cows, "robber" and "adulterous" bees (Hall, 1902: 24-27), or "thievish" bees, "robber" sparrows, "thieving" pigeons and female dogs, and "murdering" hawks and elephants (Ferrero, 1895, passim). In directly confronting the question of whether "crime exist[s] among animals," the American sociologist Arthur Cleveland Hall responded affirmatively</page><page sequence="4">8 Beirne by referring, for example, to theft by monkeys, to incest and adultery among anthropoid apes, storks, ravens, and domestic poultry, and to treason among animals in general (1902: 24-25). To the criminal anthropologists, one of the chief discursive ploys in the search for similarities between the higher species of animals and some of the lower races of humans was to inventory those species whose members have the potential for criminality. Set in the context of Darwinian evolution, these similarities included not only crime, but also ethics, language, and psychology. In his book Evolutional Ethics and Animal Psychology, for example, E.P. Evans (1898) was keen to show that animals and humans may be subject to the same ethical sense of justice and that, as such, they convene courts of justice for criminals. Thus: The instances recorded of animals holding courts of justice and laying penalties upon offenders are too numerous and well authenticated to admit of any doubt. This kind of criminal procedure has been observed particu? larly among rooks, ravens, storks, flamingoes, martins, sparrows, and occasionally among some gregarious quadrupeds. It is as clearly estab? lished as human testimony can establish anything that these creatures have a lively sense of what is lawful or allowable in the conduct of the individual (Evans, 1898: 230). Moreover, some criminal anthropologists suggested it was beyond doubt that, like Homo criminalis, members of the animal world could be "born criminals" (e.g., Lombroso, 1881; see Hyde, 1916:723), while others argued that the laws of criminal heredity are the same for humans and for animals (e.g., Ferrero, 1895:497). William Ferrero (Ibid.: 492) divined that almost every form and variety of human crime is found among animals, though he distinguished between animals who harm other animals in the course of the struggle for existence, which is not crime, and those who harm or even murder members of their own species, which is. Lombroso himself suggested that animals commit crime in the same factual, albeit unconscious, way as members of a mob (1895b: 31). On this point, at least, the Lombrosians stood on the same ground as theorists of crowd psychology, including committed anti-Lombrosians such as the French sociologist Gabriel Tarde, who referred to crowds and mobs as "feminine" and "fickle" or, worst of all, as "beasts" (1892: 377). If animals can commit crime, then it is only a short step to the claim that human criminals are animals or, more weakly, that human criminals have animal character? istics. Lombroso's labors, for example, contained and were perhaps even derived from more or less direct analogies between the crimes of animals and those of humans. In a self-described flash of insight, the source of this analogy was revealed to Lombroso in 1864 during his post-mortem analysis of the skull of the notorious brigand Villella: "the whole idea of my future work rose before me like a picture.... I instantly perceived that the criminal must be a survival of the primitive man and the carnivorous animals" (Lombroso, 1895a: 35). Lombroso then admitted how his</page><page sequence="5">The Use and Abuse of Animals in Criminology 9 perception had fallen short of the truth: "I saw that the criminal was worse than the savage, worse sometimes than the true Carnivora" (Ibid.: 36). In his book Crime: Its Causes and Remedies, Lombroso (1918) reasoned backward from effects to causes, arguing that born criminals are essentially atavistic beings. Born criminals are endowed with many of the characteristics of "savage races" and their atavism "may go back far beyond the savage, even to the brutes themselves" (Ibid.: 365,368); these facts "prove clearly that the most horrible crimes have their origin in those animal instincts of which childhood gives us a pale reflection" (Ibid). At times, the Lombrosians posited that animal instincts were always present in violent men, and at other times that they erupted only in the presence of further, inhibition-loosening anomalies such as epilepsy or feeble-mindedness. Thus, the U.S. Lombrosians Schlapp and Smith noted that among the characteristics that usually incline the feeble-minded toward criminal conduct are "brutishness and savagery, which cause us to see in them a reversion to low ancient ancestries, to the wild man and the troglodyte" (1928:154). Some even claimed that criminals indulge in "zo?philia" (e.g., Nordau, 1895: 315; Ellis, 1890: 182-183), though it is unclear whether this was a reasoned argument about the mental bonds between criminals and animals or, rather, Victorian circumlocution for bestiality. 3. Animals and Humans as Partners in Crime Bestiality illustrates a second milieu in which nonhuman animals enter criminol? ogy and which is based on the juridico-religious notion that animals and humans are capable of criminal partnerships. In principle, this milieu includes any instance when a human drives, rides, leads, or otherwise controls an animal during the commission of a crime and for which the animal might incur a penalty. Examples would include organized cockfighting, bear baiting, and a train robbers' use of horses to escape from a posse before the advent of motorized transport. In each of these cases the animal is liable to be confiscated or even destroyed. In criminological discourse, however, neither cocks nor bears nor horses are likely to be seen as participants or accomplices in crime but, rather, as misused and pitiful objects of human guile. In criminology, the notion of nonhuman animal "participation" in crime has been confined to accounts of bestiality and witchcraft accusations (Evans, 1906; Newman, 1978; Holmes, 1991; Beirne, 1994) in precapitalist societies, analyses of which have yielded important concepts like "moral panics," "folk devils," and the Leviticus inspired "scapegoats." In his book, The Punishment Response, Graeme Newman (1978:89-94; see also Derrida, 1990) rightly stresses that animal trials were only one facet of a broad network of social control constructed by religious authorities in their attempt to dominate and to stabilize the social and natural worlds. To bodies such as the Holy Inquisition, then, animals were a form of life that presented a challenge no less threatening than other marginal beings like women and Jews. The juridical proximity of bestiality and witchcraft accusations occasionally appears in histories of crime and justice. The French author Dubois-Desaulle (1933:</page><page sequence="6">10 Beirne 58), for example, refers to a case of unknown date when a certain Francoise Secretain was burned alive because she had had carnal knowledge of domestic animals ? a dog, a cat, and a cock ? and because, she admitted, she was a witch and her animals were actually earthly forms of the devil. Evans refers to a string of cases in which humans were convicted of having intercourse with a variety of animals, including mules, cows, sows, a mare, heifers, and sheep. Thus, in a case of 1662 recorded by Cotton Mather, in New Haven, Connecticut, Evans (1906: 148-149) reports that a pious wretch named Potter was executed for "damnable Bestialities" with a cow, two heifers, three sheep, and two sows, which were hanged before his eyes. However, cases recorded by Dubois-Desaulle (1933: passim) suggest that, especially for accusations of bestiality combined with witchcraft, goats were often the animal of choice. The scanty literature on the role of animals in cases of witchcraft and bestiality stresses how formal accusations of misconduct are officially articulated in religious discourse. This occurs in Evans' (1906) work, for example, which stresses the defining influence of Judeo-Christianity on the medieval understanding of these practices. Thus, the biblical laws in Leviticus and Deuteronomy about the goring ox and the condemnation of witches were often used in concert as justificatory mechanisms for prosecutions in the medieval courts. The sinful dangers of bestiality, too, were cast in powerful religious imagery. In Leviticus and Exodus, as with animals that harmed humans or were involved in witchcraft, animals in bestiality cases were seen to have ruptured the divine order of the universe. In cases of bestiality, both human and animal were executed, usually by fire but sometimes by beheading or hanging, and their bodies, with all legal documents and pieces of evidence, were then buried together. More recently, Holmes (1991:27-28) devoted three paragraphs of his book, Sex Crimes, to the neglected crime of bestiality. Yet how much his otherwise welcome treatment advances our knowledge of this crime is unclear, since his sole theoretical referent for bestiality is the unsatisfactory claim that it is a substitute for sex with a "suitable human partner." With even less satisfaction, Friedman (1993: 1; see also Chapin, 1983: 127) refers to a 17th-century case of bestiality involving a sow and a certain Thomas Hogg. Rather than using this case to explore deviant human/animal relationships, Friedman uses it only as a rhetorical device to deny the uniqueness of "somewhat exotic or notorious or outrageous examples of criminal behavior" (Ibid.)? 4. Analogies Between Human and Nonhuman Animals Appreciating other animals, recognizing our evolutionary continuity with them, and accepting our common need for air, water, and food is something quite different from using biology and evolution to make certain socially specific human attributes or institutions inevitable parts of the nature of things (Hirst and Woolley, 1982: 67).</page><page sequence="7">The Use and Abuse of Animals in Criminology 11 After the late 1920s, animals almost completely disappeared from criminology for the next half century. The only major exception was the rather vague parallels drawn by Chicagoan social ecologists (e.g., Shaw and McKay, 1942) between the processes of natural selection in the world of nature and in urban development, respectively. Not until the rise of sociobiology in the early 1970s did animals again enter criminological discourse in any seemingly significant way. The reappearance of animals in criminology at that time reflected a coincidence in the domain concerns of two intellectual tendencies. One was held by natural scientists who wished to apply principles of ethology and ecology to the study of human societies. This was manifest in works such as Konrad Lorenz' (1966) On Aggression andE.O. Wilson's (1975) Sociobiology, the New Synthesis,both of which gained a wide and predictably hostile audience among sociologists. The other tendency was the desire of some sociologists to abandon D?rkheim's imperialistic declaration in The Rules that the social and cultural realms are autonomous from the biological. In wrongly imposing rigid boundaries between human and animal societies, D?rkheim's dictum effectively privileged the authenticity of the former. The price of autonomy from biological imperialism, in other words, was seen to be social or cultural essentialism (Hirst and Woolley, 1982: 63). The meeting of these two tendencies fostered the reinsertion of animals into criminological discourse, a movement that occurred in the perspectives of "evolu? tionary psychology" and "evolutionary ecology" or, more simply, "biocriminology." Animals occupy two discursive roles in biocriminology. In studies that claim causal relationships between human nature and crime, animal behavior tends implicitly to be posited as an expression of the unproblematic negation of human morality, as the dark underbelly of human life. The existence of an objective human nature is the cardinal assumption of Wilson and Herrnstein's (1985) widely read Crime and Human Nature (pp. 508-529, passim). The core argument of their thesis lies in the claim that "there is a human nature that develops in intimate settings out of a complex interaction of constitutional and social factors, and that this nature affects how people choose between the consequences of crime and its alternatives" (p. 508). They assert that modern criminology retains two primary views of human nature: "Man the Calculator" and "Man the Naturally Good." The former posits humans as rational calculators who respond to the rewards and punishments encountered in their dealings with others. Against this quasi-Hobbesian view, Wilson and Herrnstein protest that humans are also governed by conscience, sympathy, and a sense of justice. On this view, these three qualities are indispensable to the understanding of human behavior in general and of criminality in particular (p. 517).4 In the latter, Rousseauian view of human nature, humans are seen as virtuous creatures whose goodness is revealed only under decent social conditions. Recogniz? ing the influence that this view has had on "positivist criminology," the two authors find evidence to support it in the areas of socialization and unmet economic needs. Yet, while dismissing both its Utopian and romantic elements and also the diluted</page><page sequence="8">12 Beirne versions of modern-day Rousseauianism, they praise its emphasis on the centrality of compassion among humans. Compassion, to them, is a vital hallmark of human nature. To these two views of crime and human nature Wilson and Herrnstein add a third, though it is less visible than the others. This they term "Man the Social Animal" (pp. 522-525). "Man is meant," they write, "for social living because he alone, of all the animals, is equipped with verbal language. Language enables him to communi? cate his experiences, but it also enables him to declare what is just and unjust" (p. 522). "Man's" sociality is chiefly manifest in the coherence and the persistence of the human family unit, which functions to inculcate virtue (e.g., justice) in its members and thus to inhibit criminal behavior. Indeed, both the hallmark of human nature and its most important social achievement is the family: [t]o develop, from a fleeting instant of physical lust, a lifelong community encompassing the whole of the conjoint lives ? that has been and is one of the greatest triumphs of sociality against the persistent animality of our species (Ibid:. 524, quoting Stark's The Social Bond). In identifying the traits of a specifically human nature, Wilson and Herrnstein seem implicitly to set them apart from those that are natural to animals. Thus, in the first view ("Man the Calculator"), where humans are posited as having the qualities of conscience, sympathy, and a sense of justice, they imply, without evidence or reasoned argument, that animals are amoral, ethically neutral, and indifferent or hostile (pp. 517-518). In the second ("Man the Naturally Good"), because among all the animals only humans have the quality of compassion, it follows that nonhuman animals must, at best, be indifferent or cynical (pp. 518). In the third ("Man the Social Animal"), described with some enthusiasm, they repeat the Aristotelian view that heritable traits are "animal traits" (p. 522) and that, because some human qualities (e.g., intelligence) are heritable, humans and animals share some unknown range of natural traits. However, the development of these traits requires communal living, and hence humans are "social." Given the brevity of their comments, it is difficult to uncover Wilson and Herrnstein's exact view of the relation between human nature and crime. This is so not only because their view of crime is quite uncritical, but also because the degree to which they either oppose or subscribe to aspects of each of the three views of human nature is not at all clear. Similarly, it is difficult to detect their view of the relation between the respective natures of humans and animals. Is human nature akin to animal nature? If so how, how much, and with what consequences? Animals also appear in biocriminological discourse when generalizations about their social behavior comprise sites of extrapolation for inferences about the criminal behavior of humans. Here, particular analogies can be made either implicitly or explicitly and they can serve a variety of purposes and be articulated with quite different emphases. Let us dwell a moment longer on Wilson and Herrnstein, who claim that the influence of human nature is most visible in the universality of age and</page><page sequence="9">The Use and Abuse of Animals in Criminology 13 sex differences in crime and in the variable heritability of differences in intelligence and temperament. They argue that a substantial constancy exists in human nature and that, specifically, "the best evidence suggests that this continuity exists with respect to antisocial aggression among males" (p. 513). Moreover, the importance of aggression on sex differences in crime rates is the sole area in which Wilson and Herrnstein actually refer to animal behavior as a site for potential extrapolation to the understanding of crime by humans. It is therefore surprising, perhaps, that in doing so they challenge the empirical scope of the one study (Maccoby and Jacklin, 1974) in their book that generalizes across animal and human behavior. Such cross-species generalizations, Wilson and Herrnstein point out, are inherently dubious. Analysis of animal behavior remains somewhat at the periphery of Wilson and Herrnstein's work, but it is nonetheless central to evolutionary psychology and evolutionary ecology. Animal behavior is employed here as a site of extrapolation for generalizations about human behavior, the most prominent examples of which occur in the work of Daly and Wilson (e.g., 1988; Wilson and Daly, 1993; and see Hrdy, 1987; Cohen and Machalek, 1988; Vila and Cohen, 1993). They begin with the idea that because the properties of all organisms are adaptively constructed owing to natural selection, we should examine how actors' behavior is organized to serve their self-interests. Predators, for example, exhibit search strategies adapted to the dispersion of their prey, searching the vicinity of the last capture if the prey species is a gregarious one, but moving on if it is solitary. Small mammals that are usually timid become fierce when they have pups to defend (Daly and Wilson, 1988: 5). Similarly, in an essay on lethal confrontational violence, Daly and Wilson invoke the motivational psychologist's need for selection-mindedness in relation to the contingent control of fearfulness: A stickleback fish guarding a nest full of eggs.. .will stand his ground against an approaching predator longer, and dart at the predator more bravely, the more eggs he has in the nest.... In effect the greater fitness value of a larger brood elevates the statistical probability of death that the little fish is prepared to accept. One correlate of brood size, which may be the cue modulating fear versus bravery in this case, is carbon dioxide production by the eggs, and if so, then it is likely that this cue will prove to mitigate fearfulness only in egg-guarding males (Wilson and Daly, 1993: 91). "Selection thinking" suggests that "the evolved motivational mechanisms of all creatures, including ourselves, have been designed to expend the organism's very life in the pursuit of genetic posterity" (Ibid.). Unlike Wilson and Herrnstein, therefore, these authors do not shy away from cross-species generalizations. Throughout, they</page><page sequence="10">14 Beirne extrapolate freely from nonhuman animal behavior to human behavior ? "the relevance of all this to the human case should be obvious" (Ibid.: 143) ? and, conversely, from human behavior to animal behavior. For Wilson and Daly the theory of selection-thinking is admirably confirmed by recent studies of animal behavior. Thus, female ground squirrels discriminate among their litter mates in favor of their full sisters and against half sisters.5 Full sisters exhibit less territorial aggression against each other and are less likely to aid a half sister whose burrow has been invaded by a nonrelative intent on killing her young (pp. 10-11). Daly and Wilson advance numerous such explanations of homicide among humans, many of which rely on the findings of violence and killing among nonhuman animals. Closely related to evolutionary psychology is evolutionary ecology, which also begins with the Darwinian notion that all species exist, or through natural selection cease to exist, in a constant struggle to reproduce as successfully as possible and to survive better and to acquire more resources than competing species (Cohen and Machalek, 1988; and see Ellis, 1990; Vila and Cohen, 1993). Cohen and Machalek, for example, claim that an "unrivaled breadth of insight" into crime can be had by examining the genetic, developmental, and cultural strategies that might be common to such diverse species as ants, bees, chimpanzees, and humans.6 To these authors, all species acquire and develop both "normal" and "nonconforming" strategies in order to expropriate ("usurp") valuable resources (objects of symbolic or material value) in the struggle for survival. In this view, there is an objective similarity in the respective expropriative strategies of, on the one hand, animal diggers such as moles who invade and occupy the sheltered burrows of other animal diggers and, on the other, Mertonian human innovators (such as bank robbers). It is thus of some sociological comfort to discover that when both humans and animals engage in nonconformity, their respective behaviors are, in a Durkheimian sense, normal rather than pathological states. Anticipating a major difficulty for their viewpoint, Cohen and Machalek carefully stress that there is a world of difference between the objective and subjective dimensions of animal and human expropriative strategies. As such, only humans can engage in crime. This is so because, although by partaking in expropriative strategies both moles and bank robbers engage in behavioral nonconformity, their actions' respective ontological statuses differ vastly. Ani? mals do not appear to choose strategies consciously, yet humans are endowed with "a unique combination of cognition, high intelligence, long-term memory, and culture [and] represent a special case" (1988:470). "[OJnly humans," they stress, "commit expropriative crime (a subset of noncomformity)" and only humans have normative rules called criminal law (Ibid.: 478). Space limitations do not allow me properly to assess the role of animals in biocriminology, though it would be remiss of me to refrain from comment altogether. To begin with, one must question the adequacy of Cohen and Machalek's distinction above between the subjective and the objective dimensions of expropriative strate</page><page sequence="11">The Use and Abuse of Animals in Criminology 15 gies. Biocriminologists are keen to distinguish these two dimensions because to speculate about animals' "reasons" for acting leaves them vulnerable to the charge of anthropomorphism. We humans can never understand what it is like to be a bat, for example,/rom a bat's perspective (Nagel, 1974). The contours of this epistemo logical cul-de-sac have been examined most extensively in the famous debates of the 1930s and 1940s about cultural relativism and about the putative existence of criminal law in "primitive" cultures (Beirne, 1983). Further, while it is not clear that all attempts to understand reasons and motives in animal behavior are necessarily anthropomorphic, I must challenge the coherence of any explanation of human behavior premised on an a priori rejection of the relevance of such subjective factors. Cohen and Machalek, and also Wilson and Daly, seem to forget that there is nothing objective in a definition of crime, and that criminal behavior is a label the meaning and the imposition of which display infinite cultural variation. To say that moles, bees, and humans all engage in expropriative strategies or in homicide, in other words, is not to say anything meaningful at all. Moreover, even if we accept that the behavior of all animals ? of humans and nonhumans alike ? is governed by the principle of natural selection and that its operation is the chief context in which the "homicidal" or "expropriative" behaviors of nonhuman animals are to be understood (by we humans!), it does not at all follow that human criminal behavior reflects that principle alone. Indeed, though in all areas of social relations ? including those of crime and criminal justice ? many human beliefs, practices, and institutions doubtless address or are constitutive of serious conflict or hardship, it does not follow, as biocriminologists suggest, either that they respond to urgent problems of physical survival and adaptation to the environment or that they are necessarily adaptive to the environment or even productive of social order (Hirst and Woolley, 1982: 82). While biocriminologists disavow the methods and conclusions of 19th-century criminal anthropology, some among them have complained that many leftist critics have been tempted to place their discourse in the same historical trajectory as Lombrosianism. Though I do not wish to add fuel to that complaint here (and not because it has no merit), it does not follow, either, as some leftist critics of biocriminology would claim, that the search for commonalities in human and nonhuman animal behavior is necessarily a racist or a speciesist endeavor. If only because they all inhabit tiny planet Earth, species of all sorts share a variety of common environmental problems having to do with the supply and quality of food, water, and oxygen, and destruction of natural habitat. How various species respond to these problems, whether their respective responses are the same or not, and whether in the search for solutions to them some species are able to impose their will and their interests on others ? these are real difficulties that cannot be dismissed by doctrinal fiat. Indeed, conventional leftist objections to the discursive copresence of animals and nonhuman animals, Hirst and Woolley sensibly remind us, amount "to making the human a preserved domain which the natural sciences can enter only if they</page><page sequence="12">16 Beirne declare in advance that their results will loyally support egalitarianism and human perfectibility" (Hirst and Woolley, 1982:71). This would do no more, they conclude, than make us hostages to our own ignorance. 5. Animals as Objects of Human Agency Animals have also entered criminology in the role of objects of human agency. In this role, whether alive or dead, they are passive objects acted upon by humans and, as such, they enter the discourse solely because they reflect or are drawn into some aspect of the complex web of human relationships, which is seen as problematic or undesirable. As objects of human agency, animals appear in criminology as property, as weapons, and as signiflers of violence between humans. Animals as Property As property (as objects of human ownership), animals have entered criminology when they are stolen, poached, damaged, held as ransom, rustled, or otherwise misappropriated. It is in such cases, when the primary attribute of animals is their status as property or commodities, that the harms that are inflicted on them are the least visible. This is nowhere more striking than in the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, which, though they include no data at all on crimes against animals, do refer (next to "office equipment" and "televisions") to the proprietary items of "livestock" and "clothing and furs" within the category "Type and Value of Property Stolen and Recovered" (FBI, 1993: 205). As property, animals enter criminological discourse in diverse ways. They do so, for example, as momentary stage props in historical treatises on crime and criminal justice. Deer, for example, have appeared as written evidence ("the taking of deer") in a search for the authentic Robin Hood in 14th-century England (Bellamy, 1985: 102-103); horses as sheriffs' transport harnessed for purposes of policing in early colonial America (Walker, 1980:18); and steers as an occupational definer ("cattle? men") in the denomination of conflict among white settlers in Wyoming in 1892 (Ibid.: 57). Horses, again, have entered criminology as the objects of deviant practices by owners, trainers, jockeys, and punters at racetracks, where they are the source of profits, purses, wages, and winnings (Case, 1987). As property, too, animals appear at different points in the food chain of carnivorous societies. In this guise they appear in studies of aristocratic hunting and poaching, where their deaths serve for young males as adolescent rites of passage and as substitutes for war (Manning, 1992); of game-keepers (Palmer and Bryant, 1985) and of ecological law enforcement (Shoe? maker and Bryant, 1985); of deterrence, when their survival or death is used to test the effect of hunting laws on the poaching of game (Reisner, 1991); of gun ownership, when rural gun owners are distinguished from urban gun owners because many of the former are hunters who own rifles (Wright, Rossi, and Daly, 1983:106,53-63); and of the meat and poultry industries, when their quantity or quality as commodities may</page><page sequence="13">The Use and Abuse of Animals in Criminology 17 signify theft, fraud, or deceptive advertising (H?rtung, 1950; Clinard, 1952; Simon and Eitzen, 1982: 101-102). A well-known example of animals as property in criminology is Clinard's (1952) analysis of white-collar crime, which was published as a chapter of his book The Black Market. Here Clinard focused on white-collar crimes associated with the slaughter and distribution of meat in the U.S. in the context of the system of meat rationing that existed in the 1939-1945 War. Yet the animals in his analysis appear only as commodities that arrive in supermarkets as neatly wrapped packages of flesh and that can be exchanged for tickets in coupon books. Nowhere did Clinard consider whether, before the rationed carcasses of these animals were distributed, white-collar executives had participated in crimes of cruelty against them. Clinard's research was motivated by his belief that "a reasonably equitable distribution of meat at a fair price [is] a 'must' in a national emergency" (Ibid.: 115). It is just this sort of belief that contributed to the existence of the white-collar crimes in his study! This said, it is the ideational pressures around meat consumption in a time of national emergency that also need to be investigated. To understand these pressures one could usefully see them, if not in terms of Derrida's (1990: 951-953) notion of carnivorous sacrifice, then at least from Carol Adams' (1991) feminist viewpoint in The Sexual Politics of Meat. In this book, she argues that in a society where meat consumption has always been very much a masculine activity, government rationing policies reserved a consistent supply of meat for U.S. soldiers, who were the epitome of masculine men during the 1939-1945 War (Ibid.: 32). Another example of animals as property is given in Simon and Eitzen's (1982) widely read book, Elite Deviance. In it they ask their readers "to consider the ingredients of the hot dog": The hot dog...by law can contain 69 percent water, salt, spices, corn syrup and cereal, and 15 percent chicken; that still leaves a little room for goat meat, pigs' ears, eyes, stomachs, snouts, udders, bladders and esophagus? all legally okay. There is no more all-American way to take a break at the old ball game than to have water and pigs' snouts on a bun, but you might prefer to go heavier on the mustard from now on (Ibid.: 102). The authors' message is that the deceptive practices of meat packers can result in "dangerous nutrition" and in "adulterated products." This happens, they suggest, because profit-conscious meat packers know better than to label hot-dog packages with a full list of ingredients for squeamish consumers. Yet no consideration whatsoever is given by these authors to the conditions of production, legal or not, whereby chickens, goats, and pigs are raised, fed, and slaughtered for consumption as hot dogs by humans. Moreover, one must assume that the authors would have offered no sarcastic complaint about the need for extra mustard if, instead of using eyes, ears, and other organs, hot-dog producers instead used the more palatable flesh of breasts, legs, and wings.</page><page sequence="14">18 Beirne A classic example of the positing of animals as property is found in the voluminous and often Marxist-inspired research on game laws and the crime of poaching in 18th-century England. Analytically, animals enter this social history as they existed in the eyes of English society, namely, as the private property of the landed gentry and the moneyed classes and, therefore, as coveted and contested objects of law ? a practice that was, incidentally, roundly condemned by no less an authority than Blackstone.7 The function and position of animals in this analysis are well exemplified by Douglas Hay's (1975) essay on the enforcement of the English game laws against poachers on Cannock Chase, an area of heath and woodland between Stoke and Birmingham. Hay shows that game were enmeshed in a complex web of attitudes in rural society that reflected a variety of social conflicts and alliances among the rural gentry, Justices of the Peace, servants, game-keepers, warreners, poachers, black marketeers, and the poverty-stricken masses. This rich cast of characters interacted with animals only in the sense that the latter existed as objects and prizes of class struggles. Thus, the actual fact that rabbits, hare, deer, pheasants, and partridges were netted, snared, attacked with razors, and shot, is not regarded as significant. For 18th-century English society, and also for Hay, the peculiar signifi? cance of objects such as sides of venison is that they represented in rural society no more than tokens of social position. As Hay records, game was a special currency of class based on the solid standard of landed wealth, untainted by the commerce of the metropolis. It could be spent lavishly at dinners in order to command esteem, or given to others to mark important relationships: to inferiors as an indulgence, to superiors as a mark of respect. The significance attached to it could create long, rancorous disputes over apparent trivialities (Ibid.: 246). There are very few, if any, counter-examples in criminology to my claim that animals have been understood mainly in terms of their legal status as the private property of human masters. Yet one study that deserves mention is John Archer's (1985) work on animal maiming in 19th-century Norfolk, Suffolk, and parts of Cambridgeshire. In that its explicit focus is animal suffering, Archer's study is at first glance also a very useful corrective to the standard works on rural protest by social historians, all of which acknowledge the existence of a crime that was forbidden by the Act to Prevent the Cruel and Improper Treatment of Cattle (1822), but do so perfunctorily and in misleading ways. As Archer points out, social historians have been reticent to deal with the crime of animal maiming because they assume that nothing further could be said about an isolated crime that largely involves the hamstringing and the hocking of the forelegs of cattle. Social historians, Archer argues, tend to echo the sentiments of their contemporaries, and: [tjhey feel little sympathy with, let alone understand, the perpetrators of such "abominable acts." The maimers were and are seen as perverted and</page><page sequence="15">The Use and Abuse of Animals in Criminology 19 inexplicably cruel. It takes little imagination on the reader's part to reenact, let us say, the stabbing of a cart horse with a dung fork.... While it is difficult to conceal a sense of outrage when reading of the many and varied tortures the animals had to suffer, moral outrage on the historian's part does not add to our understanding of this crime (Archer, 1985: 147). Contrary to the traditional view that animal maiming was simply a vicious form of rebellion by rural laborers against the landed gentry, Archer shows how in practice it was a peculiar, complex, and quite varied activity. Animal maiming was sometimes undoubtedly a form of social rebellion, as in the maiming of their masters' horses by horsekeepers. Yet it was typically a form of psychological terror, of symbolic murder, that resulted from personal feuds among members of the same social class. Thus, the maiming of donkeys and asses tended to indicate a dispute between one craftsperson and another?such as blacksmiths, cordwainers, butchers, and laborers ? since they were the chief owners of such animals. The poisoning of cats and dogs, however, suggests a conflict between farmers and gamekeepers over the rearing of game birds (Ibid.: 152-153). Moreover, Archer shows that there was tremendous variety in the method of maiming, in the choice of target, and in the ownership of the maimed animals.8 Archer's study of animal maiming is a rare challenge to the notion that animals are simply commodities. Beyond showing how complex a crime animal maiming can be, his sensitive investigation diverts attention from the social relations between maimers and owners and directs it, instead, toward the plight of the suffering animals themselves.9 Animals as Weapons In the role of object, it is possible for an animal to be used as an instrument of physical or psychological terror by one human against another.10 Sometimes, the use of animals as weapons is regarded as lawful activity, as in the case of guard dogs used either by the police or for the security of commercial and residential premises. In criminology, far more often, animals enter discourse momentarily when they are wielded as weapons, as when one partner in a relationship inflicts pain on the other's companion animal during an act of domestic terrorism. Typically, the use of animals as weapons has been uncovered in situations of intra familial violence. In one study of families where children had been abused, it was found that abuse of companion animals by a family member had occurred in 60% of the families (Deviney, Dickert, and Lockwood, 1983). In a study of lesbian partner abuse, 38% of the respondents who had companion animals ("pets") reported that their animals had been abused by their partners (Renzetti, 1992: 21); in Browne's study, When Battered Women Kill, the destruction of animals was reported "quite frequently" (1987:157). At present, however, there is no systematic evidence on how widespread such situations might be.</page><page sequence="16">20 Beirne Much of this sort of evidence is anecdotal. Thus, in a case that intersects with the milieu "Animals and Humans as Partners in Crime," reports from Los Angeles "tell of a man who, after fights with his girlfriend, sought revenge by raping her pet chicken" (quoted in Holmes, 1991: 27). In another case it was reported that a girl "told how her father put her dog out in 20-below-zero-degree weather, and the dog froze to death" (Gelles and Straus, 1988: 68 and 119); in another, the girl's sister "told of how her father killed a pet rabbit and then gutted the rabbit at the kitchen table while the young child watched silently" (Ibid.). Another study has reported three instances where emotional abuse between siblings was accompa? nied by the torture or destruction of a companion animal (Wiehe, 1990: 44-45). In one of these, a Tennessee woman described her worst and earliest abuse by her older brother as follows: He shot my little dog that I loved so dearly. It loved me?only me. I cried by its grave for several days. Twenty years passed before I could care for another dog (Ibid.: 44). Moreover, recent studies contain still more anecdotal evidence of how the threat of animal cruelty is used by adults in daycare centers as a coercive ploy prior to acts of sexual abuse (Faller, 1990: 199-201; Finkelhor, Williams, and Burns, 1988; Kelley, 1989; see also Hunter, 1990: 19-20). Finkelhor, Williams, and Burns (1988: 92-95), for example, report that children were threatened with snakes, spiders, wild animals, and monsters and that, occasionally, animals were even killed in front of them. Kelley (1989: 508) reports that up to 25% of children exposed to ritualistic or satanic abuse in daycare centers were exposed to animal mutilation (accompanied by the threat, "This is what will happen to you if you ever tell"). In none of these studies are animals the focus of study. In all they are the more or less passive recipients of human agency. Thus, when children are threatened with the mutilation of their companion animals by a guardian, when a father ostenta? tiously guts his daughter's pet rabbit in front of her, when a brother shoots his sister's beloved dog, when a daycare employee threatens his young charges with spiders and snakes or with the destruction of the family pet ? never are we told about the pain suffered by the animal, whether it was forbidden by the law, and, if it was, whether human perpetrators were arrested, prosecuted, and punished for their violent actions. Thus, in Renzetti's (1992) otherwise sensitive study of lesbian partner abuse, there is no concern as to whether criminal charges were filed against the partners of the respondents who reported abuse of their companion animals. Indeed, in this study the abuse that is referred to as "psychological abuse" (Ibid.: 21) is not that of companion animals, but exclusively that of one human partner by another. Similarly, in Browne's powerful study of spousal homicide, her only comment on the reportedly "quite frequent" destruction of animals was that "these incidents often seemed to the women a representation of their own death" (1987: 157).</page><page sequence="17">The Use and Abuse of Animals in Criminology 21 In this discourse, in other words, the intentional destruction of nonhuman animals has no significance in its own right. It acquires significance only as a prehomicidal sign of human conflict. Animal Abuse as a Signifier of Violence Between Humans Browne's study above exemplifies two aspects of the discursive role of animals as objects in criminology. As objects, animals enter criminology not only as weapons, but also as abused signifiers of violence between humans. As objects of abuse, though not necessarily in their role as property, animals may signify the presence of a psychologistic defect of human character, especially in "assaultive" children and perhaps in serial killers. There is a growing body of research seeking to establish links between psychologistic notions of "character" and animal abuse. Two main avenues of research have examined this intersection point: one focuses on the psychological and sociological characteristics of children ("assaultive children") who assault animals and the other on the developmental relationship between the abuse of animals by children and adolescents and, subsequently, their eventual maturation into violent adults. The majority of research on children who assault animals has been done by psychologists and psychiatrists (e.g., Patterson, DeBaryshe, and Ramsey, 1989; Ascione, 1993: 233-235). Their work has focused on multiple personality and dissociative disorders, and childhood animal cruelty is now included in a description of conduct disorder in the most recent edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Orders (Ascione, 1993: 233). Yet several findings have emerged from this literature that are likely to be interesting to sociologists. First, assaultive children appear to be overwhelmingly young, male, and of normal intelligence (Tapia, 1971; Felthouse, 1981). Second, several studies have shown that assaultive children are themselves often sexually abused at home (Friedrich, Urquiza, and Beilke, 1986; Hunter, 1990:214-216) or physically abused and neglected there (Deviney, Dickert, and Lockwood, 1983). Third, assaultive children often live in a family situation of spouse abuse, although the relative frequency of this is not yet known. It has also been found that the behavior of assaultive children is typically accompanied by nonproductive firesetting and enuresis, though this triad has been disputed and contradicted (e.g., Justice, Justice, and Kraft, 1974; Wax and Haddox, 1974; Wooden andBerkey, 1984:35-37,56-57).11 As more research is forthcoming, complex empirical reality will doubtless play havoc with such conceptually tidy categories, as occurred in a many-faceted case recently reported in West Memphis, Arkansas, in June 1993. Here, several young males were allegedly involved in a cult that killed animals, raped young females, and murdered three eight-year-old boys. As part of the initiation rites, novitiates had to kill a dog, skin it, cook it over a bonfire, and then eat the meat from its right leg (Associated Press, June 8th, 1993).</page><page sequence="18">22 Beirne A second area of research has focused on the relationship between the abuse of animals in childhood and adolescence, on the one hand, and the concurrent and/or consequent development of antisocial, aggressive, or criminal tendencies among adults on the other (Felthouse and Kellert, 1987; Ascione, 1993: 229-223). By and large, and with varying degrees of methodological sophistication, research has proceeded with the aid of questionnaires or interviews that ask adults to recall the frequency and intensity of their childhood violence against animals. Early indications are that there is a significant relationship between childhood animal cruelty and subsequent adult interpersonal violence. Thus, Kellert and Felthouse (1985; see also Tingle et al., 1986:113; Felthouse and Kellert, 1987; Ressler, Burgess, and Douglas, 1988: 29) compared the frequency of animal abuse among aggressive and nonaggressive male inmates in U.S. penitentiaries in Connecticut and Kansas with a control group of randomly selected "noncriminals" in New Haven and Topeka. They found that 25% of the aggressive group of prisoners had abused animals five or more times during childhood, compared with only 5.8% of the nonaggressive group; of the "noncriminals" the figure was zero percent. Similarly, in another study, 36% of women convicted of violent crime were found to have engaged in "cruelty to animals," compared with zero percent of nonviolent women offenders (Felthouse and Yudowitz, 1977:273). Elsewhere, it was found that among convicted psychiatric patients, murderers are more likely than nonviolent offenders to have abused animals (Langevinetal, 1983: 338). Finally, mention must be made of reports that mass murderers and serial killers tend as children disproportionately to have engaged in serious animal abuse. Anecdotal evidence about this has appeared in national newspapers (e.g., Goleman, 1991), in the literature of the animal rights movement (e.g., Lockwood and Hodge, 1986; White, 1992; Anon., 1993), and in law enforcement training manuals (e.g., IACP, 1989). Typical of these reports is that of Patrick Sherrill, a postal worker who killed 14 co-workers in 1986; he is said to have stolen local companion animals and then to have allowed his own dog to mutilate them {Ibid.: 2).12 Moreover, it was reported in Ohio that alleged serial killer Thomas Lee Dillon was known to neighbors and co-workers for having "stabbed, stomped, and shot 1,000 cats and dogs" (Anon., 1993: 17); Alberto DeSalvo (the "Boston Strangler") is reported to have shot arrows at trapped dogs and cats; as a youth, Jeffrey Dahmer (the "Milwaukee cannibal") had impaled the head of a dog on a stick, and had impaled or staked frogs and cats to trees (Goleman, 1991); and Ted Bundy, executed in 1989 for one of as many as 50 murders, reportedly spent much of his childhood with his grandfather torturing animals (White, 1992: 6). It is again worth stressing that animals only appear in these reports because they are seen as involved in some problematic aspect of human social relationships. Animal abuse enters criminological discourse here as a signifier of violence between humans. As a result, yet again, nowhere is the psychological and physical abuse of animals an object of study in its own right.</page><page sequence="19">The Use and Abuse of Animals in Criminology 23 Two other aspects of this literature also deserve brief mention. First, many basic methodological and conceptual issues still need to be clarified. These issues include the problem of differential recall of animal abuse in self-report studies, the use of control groups of nonrandom composition, and even the uncritical constitution and employment of such categories as "abuse," "cruelty," and "children." Second, the question of why some children assault animals has not yet been subjected to sociological analysis. After polite nods to concepts like the socialization process, existing theoretical commentary is either limited to individualist and psychologistic explanations or else it quickly degenerates into hollow biological assertions about innate male aggressiveness. However, there are some interesting sociological dimensions to the problem of why some children assault animals and others do not. If assaultive children are overwhelmingly male, as has been found, then why is this so? Perhaps in some societies this practice may serve as a resource for "doing gender" (Messerschmidt, 1993: 79-83). In abusing the most available living beings that are unable to offer resistance to them ? dogs, cats, fish, birds, and reptiles ? perhaps young boys are mimicking (aping?) the violence of their fathers toward their mothers or sisters. Why do young males eventually desist from abusing animals, if this is in fact so? Conclusion: Against Speciesism in Criminology The animals of the world exist for their own reasons. They were not made for humans any more than black people were made for whites or women for men. ? Alice Walker (1988: 14) This essay has tried to identify the discursive roles allotted animals in four milieus in criminology. Precisely because animals remain inadequately theorized in crimi? nology, each of these milieus is seen by the authors of studies within them as largely independent of the other three. Each differs from the others not only in its empirical manifestations, but also in such factors as the type of roles assigned animals in its discourse and the degree of importance accorded them there. What do these milieus tell us about animal abuse? A brief answer is "very little indeed." Yet in raising this question it would be wrong of me to imply that the sole purpose for studying animal abuse is to further their welfare or to secure their rights. Such pro-animal agendas tend, anyway, to be motivated less by a focused concern for animals than they are by the search for answers to questions about human personhood. What is the good life? What are our duties as citizens? How can we act responsibly toward our fellow creatures? Questions of human personhood aside, when animals do enter criminology they are cast as creatures of anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism, those twin bastions of speciesism. However one views its origins and persistence, and whether it is seen</page><page sequence="20">24 Beirne as an inevitable feature of human (or any other) life, the charge that as a discipline criminology has been guilty of speciesism is an appropriate one. How else can one explain the awkward fact that the category animal abuse (or, more narrowly, crimes against animals) is entirely absent from criminology? On nearly every occasion that animals appear in criminology and in whichever of several milieus, their presence is entirely subservient to human needs and to human problems. This bias is especially dramatic in the literature on interhuman violence, where investigators admit the discursive relevance of animal abuse but do not, either theoretically or practically, perceive it as an object of study in its own right. In the intellectual history of criminology the only discursive milieu in which animals are regarded as subjects of law is when, ironically, in medieval animal trials or in criminal anthropology, they are seen as malefactors or criminals. Concerning nonhuman subjectivity, in the context of the decline of medieval animal prosecutions, Carson (1972: 35) has written that: Today animals appear from time to time in court records as property, as evidence, or because they barked, scratched, or bit, but not as witnesses or defendants. Their risk of being declared criminals has vanished, it is true. But they are no longer treated as people, either. Yet Carson's perceptive comments do not go far enough. He documents that animals' risk of being declared criminals has vanished, but he ignores the fact that the rack and the gibbet have been displaced by the clinically painless euthanasia dispensed by lethal injections and vacuum chambers administered in animal shelters. Instead of being executed for crimes committed against humans, animals are nowadays far more likely to be dispatched ? silently, invisibly, and without advocates ? for such "crimes" as homelessness and overpopulation. Though there is a substantial mass of legislation specifying various crimes against animals, including the federal Animal Welfare Act (1965) and numerous state anti cruelty laws, the concerns of sociology and criminology lag very far behind those of criminal law. Even the most enlightened or progressive definitions of crime are permeated with speciesism. To define crime as "social harm" or "analogous social injury," for example, seems to deny space ab initio for harms and injuries committed against animals. The untheorized treatment of animals as mere obj ects in the literature of sociology and criminology is an embarrassing reflection of how they are massively and routinely treated in factory farms, research laboratories, zoos, and aquaria, and of how, too, they are displayed as items of clothing and, sometimes, as pets. Animals are used and abused by humans in many of the same ways, and for many of the same dominionistic reasons, as males oppress women and whites have enslaved persons of color.</page><page sequence="21">The Use and Abuse of Animals in Criminology 25 NOTES 1. However, I am not concerned here with the presence of animal metaphors in modern criminology unless they serve some explicitly discursive purpose. I therefore ignore notions like "cool cats," "wolf packing," "rat packing," and "maddog," which are retained by contemporary youth gangs and which are documented by Katz (1988: 97-98). 2. Ellis believed that it was necessary to discriminate among the large body of evidence that had by then accumulated about the criminality of animals. "It is only when we are dealing with animals of the very highest order of intelligence," he pontificated, "that we find any manifestations that can be at all fairly described as criminal" (1890: 249). 3. In a study of 21 forms of paraphiliac acts committed by 561 sex offenders in Memphis and New York City, Abel et al. (1987: 19) report that 1.1% of all completed acts involve bestiality. 4. Wilson and Herrnstein are aware that a strict utilitarian might object that we manifest sympathy, for example, in the hope of its being reciprocated. They reply that "sympathy extended to a dog or horse may be reciprocated with affection and service, but few would claim that sympathy given a cat elicits much more than mere tolerance" (Ibid.). 5. Similarly, based on studies of aggression among adult male stumptail monkeys and among macaques, Smith and Byrd (1987: 192-193) predict that humans will act with least aggression against relatives, though Reite and Capitanio (1987) have suggested that both humans and nonhuman primates are more likely to abuse their children if they themselves experienced early separation from their parents. 6. Similarly, it has been suggested that, by extrapolation from analyses of order-maintenance activities among nonhuman primates, criminal justice systems may be particular instances of the general Darwinian process of evolution through natural selection (Ellis, 1990). 7. In his Commentaries on the Laws of England, written two decades before the publication of Bentham's utilitarian approach to the welfare of animals, Blackstone had condemned as unreasonable the tendency in the English law of larceny to transform ferae naturae into objects of property, either absolute or qualified (1769, Book 4, Chapter 23: 235-236). 8. Archer himself appeals to the same sense of moral outrage when he refers to "those acts of mutilation that outraged people's sensibilities more than any other form of maiming." In some detail, he proceeds to describe cases where two-foot-long knotted sticks were thrust into mares' wombs, which were then vigorously rented ("a nine-year-old boy found guilty of such a crime at Nayland in 1842"), where the penises of cart horses and donkeys were cut off, or the case of "labourer Robert Key of Reydon, Suffolk, who tore out a sheep's entrails with his bare hands from the hind parts of the animal" {Ibid.: 152). 9. Archer concludes by invoking greater sympathy for the maimers than for the maimed animals. "Before historians shudder at these violent deaths of animals and pass moral value judgments on the maimers," he writes, "they should remember that the maimers often had grievances and that the death of an animal was, perhaps, preferable to the murder of a human being" (Archer, 1985: 157). 10. On November 23,1993, in Ohio's Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, Jeffrey Mann was convicted of murdering his woman friend by turning his pit bull terrier on her. This is apparently the first time that a murder conviction has resulted from the use of a nonhuman animal as a weapon {Animal People, December 1993: 16). 11. Wooden and Berkey, for example, found that "young (4-to-8 year old) firesetters were more likely to be cruel to animals than older (9-17 year old) firesetters" (quoted in Ascione, 1993: 235). 12. Arluke and Sax (1992) confront the explanatory difficulties posed by the fact that from the early 1930s the regime in Nazi Germany engaged in one of the worst cases of mass murder in history and yet at the same time was strictly committed to "animal rights."</page><page sequence="22">26 Beirne REFERENCES Abel, Gene G., Judith V.
