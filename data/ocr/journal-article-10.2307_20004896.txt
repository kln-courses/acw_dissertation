<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Charles Hartshorne. Creative Synthesis and Philosophic Method. Pp. xxi + 337. (London: S.C.M. Press, 1970.) 8os. J4. According to its preface, Creative Synthesis and Philosophic Method is an essay in systematic metaphysics. However, the publisher is both more modest and more accurate in describing it as a 'collection of essays', for that is, essentially, what it is. Many of the essays have been published before, but most have not. In general, the book is disappointing, and for a number of reasons. We have had collections of essays from Hartshorne already, and as yet nothing that merited the title of systematic metaphysic. Another book from this author would have been welcome if one or both of two conditions had been fulfilled. First, if it had said something new, or at least offered new insights into the system he has made his own. But there is very little, if anything, that he has not said elsewhere. A possible exception is his discussion of the suggestion that his metaphysical system derives from a generalised root metaphor. He does attempt to resist the allegation (pp. I28 f.), but does admit elsewhere that 'History is the cognitive paradigm, not mathematics. . . ' (p. i i 9). There are, too, attempts to face the problems raised for the system by rela tivity physics (pp. I23 f., 29I f. and by Kantian difficulties about the infinity of time (p. 235), but there is a tendency to dismiss them with a shrug of the metaphysical shoulders: 'I incline to the infinite horn of the dilemma, though I confess myself puzzled by the matter'. One would have hoped that he might have a little more to say after a lifetime's thought about his system. Second, the book would have been welcome it if had presented the student with a clear account of the metaphysic as a system, on the analogy of, say, Spinoza's Ethics. There is no doubt that this would be possible, if not in so mathematical a structure, at least in terms of axioms and their development, and would be most illuminating. It is not denied that there is here an attempt at comprehensiveness and coherence, but this is sabotaged by lack of clear connection and unacknowledged repetition. The first of these is well illus trated by the strange irrelevance of Chapter XV to the theme pursued in the previous chapter, and by the failure to argue clearly why 'dual transcen dence' (Ch. XI) should succeed a chapter on the logical primacy of non symmetrical concepts. Certainly there is a reason, within the logic of the system, but it is not made clear to the uninitiated. The second fault, of repetition, is too frequent to require illustration. Suffice it to say that there are at least five places in which metaphysical doctrines which are central to the system are repeated with no reference to the previous discussion in the book. Repetition may have been necessary in all those contexts: but the book would have read more like a systematic metaphysic if the reasons for such repetition had been clearly pointed.</page><page sequence="2">266 REVIEWS General dissatisfaction is increased by some of the sweeping generalisa tions that are made. For example, 'Causality is the principle of contingent existence, not of existence in general. To assume it should be the latter, as Kant did in a famous passage, begs the question. The eloquence of the passage has blinded people, as Kant's eloquence often does, to its illogical character. It is irrelevant poetry' (p. 250) . One woniders if it was Kant who was making the assumptions. And then there is one fatuous appeal to ordinary language, something that is in any case hardly appropriate in a revisionary metaphysic of this kind: 'It is true that a man's state depends upon the prior existence of the same individual man, but not because the state is in the man; rather, because, as ordinary language, with profound justice has it, the man is "in a state" ' (p. IO5) . Can this really be serious? The context would suggest that it is so meant. There is, then, no one thesis argued in this book, which is best seen as an attempt to present the salient and interrelated doctrines of Hartshorne's neoclassical metaphysic. As such, it will be of most interest to those who al ready have some knowledge of Hartshorne, and wish to read deeper into the system as a whole. The ratlher harsh judgements already made must not be allowed to obscure the fact that some of the doctrines are expounded in more detail than elsewhere, and the reader is enabled to see clearly the unfashion able rationalist epistemology and metaphysical optimism that Hartshorne has preached throughout his philosophical life. Perhaps many of the faults of presentation derive from the lonely battle that he has waged, and are more excusable in this light. But there comes a time when the reader longs for this philosopher to distance himself from his system, and to consider more seri ously sonme of the objections raised against it, and especially against his under standing of moral responsibility and personal identity. Finally, what of the system? The process metaphysics, as any reading of Hartshorne will reveal, is very mnuch the child of the breakdown of the classi cal conception of God. But for the crisis of faith in the twentieth century, which must at least in part derive from some such breakdown, there would seem little reason for the desperate joy with which it has been received in some Christian circles. Perhaps Hartshorne's greatest contribution to Chris tian theology will lie in his clarification and purification of the theological hints left by Whitehead. A clear exposition of this should be able to show clearly that the system requires an anthropomorphic understanding both of the 'lower' creation and of God, in terms of the central metaphor of process. If this gerieralising of certain abstracted aspects of human reality can be made to appear reasonable as the clue to the whole of reality, God included, then so be it. But let the eager apologists beware lest they prepare yet another Procrustean bed for the God whose cause they seek to advance. COLIN GUNTON</page></plain_text>
