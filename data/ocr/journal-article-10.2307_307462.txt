His use of the phrase "the blessed, meaningless word" (blaiennoe, bessmyslennoe slovo)2 in Tristia was a reference to his view that a word is not identified with any one referent, but instead radiates associations "in all directions."3 "The word as such" (slovo kak takovoe), inseparable into form and content, demanded to be recognized as the sum of all its equal and interconnected "elements"-- semantic, phonological, morphological, and syntactic.4 "Solominka" was written in 1916, and appears as No. 88 in Tristia. Unusually rich in phonological effects, it is an example of the blazennoe, bessmyslennoe slovo at its most versatile.5 Images fluctuate within a single stanza, between the two parts of the poem, and between "Solominka" as a whole and other poems.6 The associations of certain words change com- pletely in the process, while others retain the same diffuse "super-associa- tion" or semantic field. Like many other Mandel''tam poems, "Solominka" begins with a "fundamental reality" and then travels to the borderline between fact and fantasy.7 The following analysis does not endeavor to undertake an extensive in- depth study of semantic fields in "Solominka," but instead examines the ways in which form embodies content, as the theme of metamorphosis is illustrated, as it were, by the structure and sound patterns of the poem.8 I. Sound Patterns. "Solominka" is one of a minority of Mandel''tam's verses that bear titles, and this is an effective title indeed: puzzling and ambiguous, it sets the tone for the entire poem. The title conveys the initial impression that the subject is a solominka, or piece of straw, referred to in the diminutive. The alternation of the dark vowels o and a is echoed imme- diately in the first line; the title has already swept the reader phonetically into the emotional atmosphere of the poem. The first line of the first stanza begins an adverbial clause with the word kogda. The combination of unstressed o and stressed a in this first word echoes in near-reverse the unstressed and stressed o's of the title. A mirror image is also created by the initial unstressed ko- of kogda, which imme- diately repeats the last syllable of the title word (unstressed ka). The subtle-</page><page sequence="3">Mandel'stam's "Solominka" 407 ty of these phonological modifications already foreshadows the poem's motif of ambiguity. The o-a alternation continues in the repetition of the title word solominka immediately after kogda. The sound repetition is hyp- notic and almost obscures the surprise of this second solominka, which could be either vocative or appositive, creating an ambiguity as to whether the narrator's addressee is being compared to a little straw or actually is one. The adverbial clause is resumed with the words ne spi'". The verb spii' is given some phonetic shock value: appearing in the first foot after the cae- sura, which creates an initial pause to emphasize it, the word "sleep" para- doxically contains the only high tense vowel amid a sea of soporific long stressed a's and o's, and also introduces an equally lulling hushing conso- nant. Appearing in the negative, spii' describes a "non-solominka" state, since solominka clearly is not sleeping, or perhaps not yet asleep;9 neverthe- less, the initial s still preserves a slender phonetic tie with solominka. The emphasis on spi'" that is achieved by phonetic and metrical means enhances the logical disharmony of the image of a straw not sleeping in an enormous bedroom, and the reader now first senses that the referent of solominka is human.10 The alliteration of the first line is marked and complex. The a-o pattern of ogromnoj creates a truncated interior rhyme with solominka (SOLOM- IN-ka, v OGROM-N-oj) while also echoing the phonetics and stress pattern of kogda (V-O-Gromnoj-KOG-da). The phonetic parallelism emphasizes a semantic contrast between the diminutive figure of the straw in the first hemistich and the enormous space surrounding it in the second. Spal'ne emphasizes both phonetically and morphologically the idea of sleep which first appeared in the word spi'", and closes the line by repeating in reverse order the stress pattern of the first word (kogda-spal'ne). This closure is mimicked by a second mirror image inside the second hemistich: the word spal'ne ends the hemistich with the same unstressed syllable ne that opened it, and juxtaposes within it the solominka and non-solominka states (ne spiA' vs. spal'ne). Although the solominka state under discussion is sleeplessness, the haziness of perception and the tranquilizing dark vowel pattern asso- ciated with solominka suggest that sleep is imminent. Line 2 begins a parallel clause with the conjunction i." Despite the absence of a comma at the end of the first line, there is no real enjambe- ment. The syntactic parallelism between lines 1 and 2 is echoed in the rhythmic-syntactic structure of line 2 itself: like solominka in line 1, bes- sonnaja follows an initial iambic foot, is ambiguous as to vocative or appositive meaning, and continues the solominka motif of stressed o, s, nasal consonant and final unstressed a. The lulling rush of dark back vowels and nasal consonants neutralizes the normal restless associations of bessonnaja.12</page><page sequence="4">408 Slavic and East European Journal The second hemistich of line 2 introduces an outgrowth of the still unre- solved kogda clause. This second clause, which begins with Ctob, is struc- tured in inverse syntactical order, with the subject coming last, and it puts solominka and another presence in opposition at the two ends of the stanza, in much the same way that line 1 contraposed solominka and the room. Where the subject, or at least a verb, might be expected after c'tob, this second clause is instead interrupted by the two predicate adjectives valen and vysok, which indicate that the yet-unnamed presence awaited by solo- minka is masculine. The opposition between solominka and the other pres- ence is conveyed not only through contrast in gender and size, but also by the juxtaposition of the long-form adjective bessonnaja and the short forms vaien i vysok, which are linked by repetition of the consonant v. The two adjectives are also connected syntactically by the conjunction i, echo- ing the parallelism between the clauses of lines 1 and. 2. The phrase is stressed rhythmically as well: not only is c'tob the weakest syllable of the line, coming directly after the caesura and thus emphasizing the syllable that follows, but the consonant cluster by in c'tob valen is difficult to exe- cute quickly, creating a natural pause that emphasizes the upcoming adjec- tive. The contrast between solominka and the other presence is somewhat neutralized by the reappearance of a hushing consonant through both hemistichs of the second line: the new consonant I appears in connection both with solominka (ides') and with the new presence (valen), and the stressed syllable of vy-SOK links the other presence with solominka in an abbreviated echo of both besSOnnaja and SolOminKa). The suspense of the still-unidentified subject of the clause continues throughout the third line, causing the reader to wait for its revelation just as solominka does. The initial phrase spokojnoj tjafest'ju puts even more distance between the beginning of the clause and its conclusion. The first syllable of spokojnoj echoes the sleep-associated sp of spis' and spal'ne, and forms an anagram with the last syllable of line 2 (vySOK-SPOKojnoj). An element of surprise is created by the insertion of this phrase in the first hemistich, which until now has been reserved for solominka. The t which was first introduced subtly in line 2 in connection with the other presence (c'tob) appears twice in palatalized form in tjafest'ju, once in combination with the solominka-motif s. This word also repeats the unifying I of ideg' and valen, as well as a fronted variant of the earlier stressed a's.13 The first three feet of the line are composed of two three-syllable words rather than the 2/4 combination of the earlier two lines. The caesura of this line is the strongest of the stanza: the adverbial phrase, which interrupted the Ctob clause, is in turn interrupted sharply by a rhetorical question. Rhythmically this dramatic shift is accomplished by the word c'to, which, as the initial stressed syllable of the foot immediately following the caesura, creates one of only two spondees in the poem. Not only does cto echo the hushing-</page><page sequence="5">Mandel'stam's "Solominka" 409 dental combination of ideg' and c'tob, but it also appears in the same posi- tion as Ctob within the line, as the first syllable after the caesura. The i and t of tjaiest'ju are repeated in moet, and the final t appears again in byt'. The word pec'al'nej, which echoes the palatal and stressed a of tjaest'ju, officially codifies the emotional atmosphere of the stanza: clearly a negative object is being awaited. The c'tob clause continues in line 4 with the intervening prepositional phrase na veki cutkie. The noun veki in conjunction with spokojnoj tja- ,est'ju emits an association of heavy eyelids and sleep. There is a rhythmic parallel between tjaest'ju in line 3 and cutkie: the identical placement of these two three-syllable words directly before the caesura creates another contrast between their respective referents. The c'tob clause is finally resolved by the disturbing image of a descending ceiling. The image is made all the more striking for two reasons: not only have the modifiers vaen i vysok led one to expect a human figure, but, in addition, after the phrase na veki Cutkie the expected subject of spustilsja is son, and not potolok. This underlying association between the descending ceiling and sleep, in conjunction with the word play between na veki and naveki, creates a metaphor of the closing of a coffin lid, indicating that the opposing presence is death. Once again the size opposition between the victim solominka and the menacing presence is emphasized through the contraposition of veki in the first, "solominka" hemistich and potolok in the second. The fourth line returns to the familiar nasal consonant and k associated with solominka (na veki, c`utkie), but these are already com- bined with the e and t of the other presence, the v which appears in con- nection with both opposites, and the i of spi?', which depicts the state that solominka has not yet entered. The blending of the three separate phono- logical motifs continues in SPuS-Til-Sja, and the climactic potolok that is threatening to fuse with its victim contains both the opposing t and the k, 1, o and unstressed a of solominka. The first word of stanza 2 is solomka, the diminutive for the collective soloma ('straw'), rather than for solomina ('a single piece of straw'). It is unclear throughout the first line whether solomka and solominka are the same thing: the -ka diminutive suffix could be simply a more ironic or vulgarized variant of the affectionate -inka, or solomka could be a differ- ent identity.14 It is also uncertain whether solomka/solominka is (are) being addressed in the vocative, or whether the two words constitute the subject(s) of the sentence. The adjectives zvonkaja and suxaja, linked somewhat by their associations of rigidity and fragility, pit the "voiced" solomka against the dry and presumably silent solominka which we recog- nize from the first stanza. This opposition is echoed morphologically and phonologically as the noun-plus-adjective pattern of the first hemistich (solomka zvonkaja) recurs transformed in the second (solominka suxaja).</page><page sequence="6">410 Slavic and East European Journal The modifier makes it now appear less likely that solominka is a woman's nickname, but it still preserves the possibility that the word is simply a metaphor. The familiar dark vowels, s, and sonorants of line 2 create such an intense acoustic effect that it is difficult to notice that the long kogda-clause that composed the entire first stanza apparently has been left dangling.'5 The syntactic incompleteness makes it unclear whether the scene has been changed, or whether the second stanza is actually the logical resolution of the clause. Another distraction from the incomplete syntax of stanza 1 is the phonological intricacy of the entire second stanza. The hypnotic sing- song of the vowels, together with the chanty rhythm and seemingly infinite series of anagrams on solominka (so-LOMKA ZVONKA-ja so-LOM-i-NKA su-Xa-ja) deadens some of the unexpectedness of the illogical upcoming images. Suxaja echoes the s plus unstressed vowel of solominka, but trans- forms the unstressed -ka and stressed second-syllable o of solominka into a stressed -xa. This adjective carried many different associations for Man- del'Stam and usually emanates a "super-association" of either death or a draining of life energy.'6 The u of suxaja and the predominating s of line 1 are repeated in the following word vsju, which begins the second line. A paradoxical synthesis is reached in smert', which, although in semantic opposition to solominka, combines the "anti-solominka" t and new e with the s and m of solominka- solomka. The t is immediately repeated in ty: the soft and hard t's which meet across the word boundary form another difficult consonant cluster, causing the syllable ty almost to approach in intensity of stress the follow- ing and rhyming vy of vypila, which, like vsju, contains the initial v that appears freely in both the solominka and anti-solominka motifs. The spe- cific mention of death confirms the associations of the descending ceiling in stanza 1. Once again the opposition of small and large is created by juxta- position of the straw and death, and death is also given a liquid association which, in conjunction with the image of the straw's drinking, suggests poi- son. Solomka and solominka now appear to be the same figure, since they are both referred to by ty. Because of the past tense feminine ending of the verbs, the image oscillates between an anthropomorphic straw absorbing liquid death, and a woman using a straw to sip poison. The ambiguity of identities is echoed in the solomka-solominka dichotomy. The anagrams on solominka are given a single reprise in line 2 in the past tense feminine endings of the verbs (vypi-LA, sde-LA-LAS'-SOL-ominka). The coappearance in sdelalas' of the reduplicated solominka-syllable with the new opposing e of smert' seems to illustrate that the change in solominka is taking place through death. The most striking word of the line is netnej: in describing solominka's change, it combines the e's of smert' and sdelalas' with the solominka-motif n; it also contains the i which has occurred before</page><page sequence="7">Mandel'stam's "Solominka" 411 in similar mergers of the two patterns. Viewed in light of Mandel''tam's other poems, the word neinej has been long-expected, ever since the appear- ance of tjafestju in stanza 1: it forms the second half of the characteristic tja'est'-nei'nost' near-opposition,17 and is associated, at least in the com- parative, with a changed solominka, while tjafest' is the quality of the opposing death. Neinej plays a double role: not only does it echo the earlier comparative pecal'nej, which referred to the descending ceiling in stanza 1, but it is also in opposition to suxaja, which modified solominka in its state prior to the change. The three-way comparison captures the parallelisms and oppositions among solominka, death, and the imminent transformed, non-solominka state. The use of the comparative is significant, since the absorption of death results only in a partial transformation at this point.'8 Neinej also foreshadows the nature of solominka's metamorphosis through the contradictory suggestion that after drinking, solominka becomes more flexible, as if it thrives on death. After the brief respite from the solominka alliteration in line 2, the sound pattern of line 1 returns with a vengeance to line 3. As if demonstrating the metamorphosis of solominka after drinking death, the semantically power- ful verb slomalas' contributes simultaneously to a full round of word play, including an anagram (sloMALas'-soLOMka), mirror-image suspended alliteration (sloMALas'-soLOMka-MILaja), and more subtle anagrams (SLOMalas'-SOLOMka, SLOmalas'-SOLomka). The little straw that has broken is referred to a second time by the variant solomka and modified by the adjective milaja, which receives phonological emphasis through its sole stressed i, which serves as an indicator of the narrator's affection for the old solominka. The insertion of solomka between two adjectives repeats in altered form the syntactical pattern of line 1. The adjective nef'ivaja is particularly ambiguous: the negative form creates a double association, both as a euphemism for "dead," and as merely "lifeless" in the sense of "devoid of energy." Both of these associations are encompassed by the semantic field of the adjective suxoj, as used in Man- del''tam's poetry.'9 The hushing consonant I is once again present in a word that combines the phonetic motifs of the victim solominka and overpower- ing death. An opposition is created between the old nelivaja solominka and the changed one, which is nez'nej: the two phonetically similar adjectives are in parallel positions at the end of lines 2 and 3. There is also a juxtaposition with the death presence, however, as the initial nez-cluster of both neinej and nefivaja forms a mirror image of the last syllable of vazen in stanza 1, which referred to the opposing ceiling/coffin lid. The initial syllable ne- is repeated in the ne and net of line 4: this repetition also gives neinej a sec- ondary negative overtone, almost as if it too began with a negative prefix. The repetition of the negative in line 4 by the interjection net is empha- sized rhythmically: it is the only strong third foot under subheading I of the</page><page sequence="8">412 Slavic and East European Journal poem. Line 4 contains the syntactical formula "not B, but A," a device which appears often in Russian folk poetry and is used frequently by Man- del'Stam as well.20 The narrator evidently expected the broken solomka- solominka to be the same personality as the newly introduced figure Salomeja,21 but now has decided against it. Salomeja, the central word of this stanza, was heralded in line 3 by slomalas', which introduced the stressed a sound and is a distorted mirror image of the name (sloMALAS'- SALOMeja) and a truncation as well (SLOMalas'-SALOMeja). Her first subtle foreshadowing, however, came even earlier, in the -ej of pec'al'nej and neinej, which is echoed again in skorej. The tentative denial of Salomeja and assertion of solomka serve to join solomka and solominka at last as a single personality. The position of solominka after the caesura repeats the rhythm of lines 1 and 3. The intensity of the acoustic effects of this stanza sets it apart from the others; it seems to be a deliberate imitation of the Futurist zaumnyj]jazyk, but with each anagram used in furtherance of the semantic associations desired. The third stanza is dominated by the e - t phonetic motif, as the subject changes from solominka to the room. After the flashback effect of the past perfectives of stanza 2, perhaps this stanza in the present tense is the miss- ing resolution of the kogda-clause of stanza 1 ("When you can't sleep ... objects are heavier"). Bessonnicy of the first hemistich recalls bessonnaja, and is the only word in stanza 3 that contains a dark vowel. Tjafelee recalls tjafest'ju of stanza 1; the image of heaviness is used again in connection to objects in the room, reintroducing the familar second-hemistich e - t sound pattern (predmety tja'elee) immediately following a solominka-motif. The parallels in morphological and phonetic form reinforce the semantic opposi- tion between tjafelee and neinej of stanza 2, as the parallel metamorphoses of the room and solominka proceed. Line 2 begins with the ambivalent comparison kak budto, and continues the predominant e and t throughout the line (men's'e, takaja, tilSina), accompanied again by hushing consonants. TiMina appears in an abrupt interjection that recalls the interruption in stanza 1, line 3. In line 3, the initial mercajut undergoes an anagrammic distortion (mER- cajut-v zERkalo) that recalls the word smert', imitating phonetically the metamorphosis of the pillows that is taking place in the mirror. The seman- tic associations of mercajut contradict the image of objects growing heavier: the flickering of reflections in the mirror conveys an eerie impression of movement or draft. The soporific u and s of line 2 are echoed in the prosaic podugki, which is unexpected after mercajut, causing the same sort of sur- prise as potolok in stanza 1.22 The sounds are reverberated again in Cut', which also recalls cutkie from stanza 1. The stressed diphthong in beleja rhymes with Salomeja of stanza 2, as well as with the endings of the sim- ilarly state-alternating comparative adjectives of stanzas 2 and 3. This</page><page sequence="9">Mandel'stam's "Solominka" 413 gerund is the culmination of the hints of light in mercajut and zerkale, the first specific reference to light in an atmosphere hitherto implicitly dark. The final line begins with the conjunction i and a parallel clause which continues the image of the mirror reflection. The u of podugki is repeated in the word play v kruglOM OMute, which itself creates a mirror image of a solominka-syllable. The mirror reflections are clearly associated with the solominka-Salomeja dichotomy of stanza 2: in the mirror the pillows seem to be moving, just as solominka seems to be Salomeja. The mirror is the image of metamorphosis and ambiguity: appearing to reflect realities, it actually transforms them. The synthesis of the opposing phonetic patterns begun in stanza 3 is continued in the first line of stanza 4 as the subject returns ambivalently either to solominka or to its double in the mirror. The repetition of nega- tives in line 1 recalls stanza 2, line 4, but contradicts it: this time the narra- tor has decided that the figure is not solominka. The syntactic pattern of net, ne solominka seems to require a resolution according to the formula "not B, but A," as earlier, but it is not forthcoming within this stanza. This time net precedes ne, and the two negatives appear together, intensifying the e. The e - t and the solominka sonorants are united once again by Z and v in toriestvennom, while the entire line consists of alternations of stressed e's with o's and a's. V toriestvennom atlase, normally an innocuous phrase, carries overtones of a shroud in the context of the death imagery of the first two stanzas, and is made phonologically sinister by the e - t motif and its similarity to tjaest'ju.23 Line 2 of stanza 3 is composed of two prepositional phrases. The first, v ogromnoj komnate, is a repetition of the syntactic figure v toriestvennom atlase, as well of v ogromnoj spal'ne in stanza 1, line 1. Coming immediately after the solominka prepositional phrase, v oGROMNoj KOMNate creates another opposition in size between solominka and the room, while reflect- ing the solominka phonetic motif in an interior rhyme. Nad cernoju Nevoj for the first time identifies the setting concretely.24 The sound pattern of line 2 has returned to the dark vowels, since the subject once again is at least ostensibly solominka. The black Neva is in contrast to the white in stanza 3, evoking equally threatening associations of unrest. The phrase "over the Neva" implies the presence of a window which is never specifi- cally mentioned, but which figured in the poem's precursor.25 Line 3 shifts the subject to images which are outside the room and apparently are viewable through the implied window or the mirror. This shift in focus from solominka to other subjects is accompanied, as usual, by a change to e's, but this time the e's are in combination with a's and sib- ilants, creating a new type of synthesis that is crystallized in the merger of s and t into c (dvenadcat'-mesjacev-smertnom case). The change of subject to dvenadcat' mesjacev is unanticipated, particularly as it comes after a</page><page sequence="10">414 Slavic and East European Journal mere comma. The phrase pojut o smertnom case recalls the earlier v smert- nom case, and implies that death has not yet come but is now impending: the emphasis is less on death than on dying. There is some ambiguity as to whether the hour of death here belongs to solominka or to the months; in the latter case, the reference to the anthropomorphic singing months indi- cates the end of December, an association continued by the reference to ice in the next line.26 The singing is also a metaphor of the sound of the wind over the Neva. Line 4 is characterized by alternating e's and u's. The s of case undergoes a double synthesis with t in the immediately following word STruiTSja. The inverse syntax of the clause, with the subject coming after the verb, as in stanza 1, adds emphasis to the surprising and illogical image of streaming pale-blue ice, which suggests frozen breath: within the mirror, the winter has entered the room. The phrase "pale-blue ice" is an anagram containing yet another metamorphosis (LED BLEDno-goLUBoj), and is also metri- cally emphasized, appearing as a spondee. The reference in stanza 4 to the twelve months is clarified in the initial word "December" of stanza 5, line 1. Toriestvennyj, which appeared as a modifier of atlas in stanza 4, line 1, is used here to modify dekabr', and once more carries an association of death. Again, the interplay of stressed e's with a's synthesizes the two phonetic patterns, while images of death and life are juxtaposed through the phonetic parallel between the first and last words of the line (DEKAbr'-DYXAn'e), which repeat the unstressed -ka of solominka. The verb struitsja appears here transformed into a transitive verb, and the same pale-blue ice of stanza 4 has now actually become the frozen breath of December.27 Line 2 of stanza 4 is dominated by permutations in phrasal combinations that reflect the metamorphoses taking place in the room. The kak budto of stanza 3, line 2 recurs in a second indication of the narrator's ambivalence, while the t of toriestvennyj is repeated in budto, komnate, and tjazelaja. The prepositional phrase v komnate is placed rhythmically in the same position it occupied in stanza 4, line 2, but now the phrase modifies not solominka, but the threatening river, which appears to be in the room but evidently is an illusion. The Neva appears as the last word in the second line, as in stanza 4, but this time it is heavy rather than black, receiving a sinister overtone in light of the earlier contexts of tjafest'ju and tjafelee.28 The flooding of the room recalls the drinking of death in stanza 2, during which the tiny straw was permeated by a force of overwhelmingly larger volume. Line 3 repeats the first hemistich of stanza 4, line 1, but this time the denial of solominka is followed by its logical conclusion ("not B, but A"). The new name Ligeja is given dramatic effect by its interjectory character: it comes after a dash and a strong caesura, and is equated with umiran'e.29 Ligeja is also the phonetic culmination of the poem, rhyming with Salomeja</page><page sequence="11">Mandel'stam's "Solominka" 415 and appearing where Salomeja is expected, in the context of a denial of solominka's existence. All that is left in it of the solominka motif is the 1: the new name is the ultimate transformation toward which all the lesser permu- tations expressed by -ej have led. The presence of umiran'e in place of smert' is significant, since umiran'e is not a state, but a process. The use of the word indicates that the theme of the poem is not death, but metamor- phosis: after all, the literary Ligeja managed to transcend death, and through the dying of another identity achieved her second life. Line 4 of stanza 5 contains the first specific reference to the narrator as a participant in the poem. This new thought interrupts the sentence originally begun in line 3 about the identity of solominka, and comes as an expression of relief after the feverish interjection Ligeja, umiran'e, which are the blaen- nye (and presumably bessmyslennye) slova of line 4.30 The phrase blaizennye slova almost completes the phonetic cycle of the poem by returning to the familiar solominka dark vowels, s, 1, and n, which are now inseparable from the metamorphosizing I after solominka has been transformed. The pro- noun vam, referring to the words Ligeja and umiran'e, repeats the lesser metamorphosizing v-motif. The last line is a summation of the effect of the poem itself: just as the identity of solominka has fluctuated and finally is transformed, a transformation has taken place in the environments and associations of the individual words of the poems. The word play of the first five stanzas subsides noticeably as the border between subheadings I and II is crossed. The first line of stanza 1 of sub- heading II simply reproduces the phonologically synthesized last line of stanza 5 under subheading I. Line 2 of stanza 1 supplements the Ligeja image by including among the blaennye slova the names of other ethereal heroines, all of whom were involved in dying, being transformed, and con- tinuing life in one way or another.3' Solominka's position immediately before Ligeja parallels the arrangement of stanza 5, line 3, but the sur- roundings have been transformed: this time Solominka's presence is asserted rather than denied, and she coexists with her counterpart rather than being replaced by her, as in stanza 5. The pattern Lenor, Solominka, Ligeja, Sera- fita unites the four figures with an i-s-1-s alternation of solominka phonetic features.32 Ligeja now is deemphasized by the presence of other trans- formed heroines, as if to clarify that her major association in I and II is with metamorphosis. This modification of the Ligeja image suggests that the theme in relation to Salomeja Andronikova, the "real" Solominka, is the replacement of one personality by another, i.e., the poet's changing perception of his beloved as the nature of their relationship is changed. II. Structure. While the metamorphosis of solominka and its phonologi- cal illustrations culminates in the last stanza of subheading I, on the structu-</page><page sequence="12">416 Slavic and East European Journal ral plane a more global transformation is taking place simultaneously, and it reaches its fruition later, in the set of stanzas under II. The three stanzas below the subheading II have been discussed by ana- lysts either as a second part of the poem or as a separate "twin" poem; but no one has acknowledged that there might be any question as to which view is correct.33 To some extent the question is even moot, since Mandel'- 'tam intended Tristia to be read as an entire work. The three stanzas of II could conceivably stand independently of I, but they would compose a much weaker poem, since the central image of the straw is totally absent, and Solominka appears in contexts that clearly demonstrate that it is a woman's name. The very ambiguity of the relationship between I and II continues the atmosphere and theme of the poem; in addition, the three stanzas under II function as a metamorphosized double of the "original" poem under subheading I. Like solominka's own transformation and its phonological illustration, the structural alteration embodied in II preserves the essentials of the original, reflecting them as a distorted mirror image. The six-foot iambic metrical pattern of subheading I is retained, as well as the tendency toward a weak third foot, but the aBaB rhyme scheme of I is reversed to AbAb, with an even more extreme transformation to AbbA in the middle stanza. This vertical mirror reflection runs perpendicular, as it were, to the horizontal juxtaposition of solominka and death before and after the caesurae in the lines under subheading I. Other distortions and transformations include compression of the original five stanzas into three, reshufflings both of lines within a stanza and of phrases within an individ- ual line, and the substitution of new nouns in adjectival phrases.34 The last series of structural permutations is a continuation of a tendency that began in the last two stanzas of I, and its growth coincides with the gradual dim- inution of phonological play in II. The backward rearrangement of lines in II makes the time relationship ambiguous between the two parts: there is no way of determining whether the three new stanzas follow chronologically, or whether they are simul- taneous with I. Most likely, both possibilities were intended: after the nar- rator's discovery of the blazennye slova, the metamorphosis is achieved, and the ambivalences of I are replaced with certainties; at the same time, the two variations taken together imitate the doubling effect of the bedroom mirror. The prominent image of that mirror in I has no place in the imagery of II, however, because the mirror has been passed through. The inverse order of the lines and stanzas of I reflected therein causes the poem to come full circle in a sense, returning from the blalennye slova and Ligeja to close with a last mention of the old solominka, who is gone. In contrast to I, the narration of II is straightforward, and serves as a clarification of certain ambiguities in I. Mandel'gtam is no longer interested in imitating the atmosphere of the Ligeia story on either a phonological or</page><page sequence="13">Mandel',tam's "Solominka" 417 semantic plane, and indeed, once the blazennye slova have been learned, there is no need to. Instead, II undertakes a series of experimental varia- tions on the phrases and pictures of I. Stanza 1 begins the mirror image slowly, by reproducing the last line of I without changes. The pattern Solominka-Ligeja of stanza 5, line 4 of I is reproduced in II in identical position within the line; but as the environment of the two figures is changed, they are now equated rather than contrasted. Line 3 reproduces stanza 5, line 2 in an altered form that combines the earlier version with stanza 4, line 2 of I (V ogromnoj komnate tjafelaja Neva = Kak budto v komnate tjafelaja Neva + V ogromnoj komnate nad cernoju Nevoj). The kak budto element is absent now because on this side of the mirror the Neva is in the room. Finally, line 4 of stanza 1 skips over line 1 of stanza 5 in I, metamorphosizing instead stanza 4, line 4, and turning pale-blue ice and breath into light-blue blood, which flows not in the air, but out of granite, over the river embankment and into the room. The flooded room also appears to be a recodification of the image of the absorption of liquid death in I; this time, however, the water imagery clearly is infused with a life force of blood as well as with death,35 and an ambiguity remains as to whether the blood is the Neva or a force opposed to it. Blood is the central image of these three stanzas, and the word krov' appears as the stressed syllable of the only strong third foot in II. The ice image is repeated again in stanza 2, line 1, which backtracks to create a distorted reflection of stanza 5, line 1 of I: December glows rather than emitting breath; the phrase nad Nevoj is removed from stanza 4, line 3, and inserted here instead, so that it is December rather than the mirror and pillows which is the source of light. Stanza 2, line 2 is preserved in its entirety from stanza 4, line 3 of I. Line 3, which is identical to stanza 4, line 1 of I, again denies the identity of solominka without offering an alternative, and is followed by the new line 4, a reworking of the spokojnoj tjaz'est'ju of stanza 1 in I. From this point on solominka's metamorphosis has already been achieved, and no more individual lines from I are reflected in II: only the images from the earlier part continue to be dissected and reconstructed in new form. Stanza 3 repeats the word krov' in a new context that also carries associa- tions of life (v moej krovi). The participation of the narrator in the poem is continued from I, although there is again an ambiguity in identity, since solominka could also be the speaker. Ligeja makes a second appearance, and this time it is expressly stated that she is living, although the modifier dekabr'skaja also implies dying in light of the dying year, which recalls the literary Ligeia, who died and lived again, taking life from the dead. It becomes clear through this closer juxtaposition of December and Ligeja in II that the December which was breathing its icy breath earlier in the poem was the life-in-death Ligeja herself, who at that point had overtaken Solo-</page><page sequence="14">418 Slavic and East European Journal minka. The earlier emotional force of bla.ennye slova in I is transferred to the phrase bla'ennaja ljubov', and the image of love asleep in Ligeja's sar- cophagus suggests strongly that it is an emotional relationship that has died. The living Ligeja is in contrast to ta solominka, and the narrator has put distance between himself and the now-defunct solominka by using a deictic pronoun to modify it. Solomka is absent from II, and Salomeja is introduced at this point as the only ambivalent image (byt' mo.et), keeping the Solominka-Salomeja ambiguity unresolved, and preserving the three- way comparison among solominka, Ligeja, and Salomeja that was mimicked on a lesser level by the Solomka-solominka-Salomeja oscillation in I. The last line of the poem begins with the emotionally charged modifier ubita, which forms a pair of opposites with the krov' of the same stanza. The juxtaposition of ubita with falost'ju in the last stanza recalls tjafest'ju from the very first stanza of I, so that the poem reaches full circle as Solo- minka is apparently crushed by the weight of pity. In light of the parallel between falost' and the earlier outside force of tjafzest', it seems likely that solominka's demise has been caused externally, possibly by the narrator's compassion. The final line closes with the statement that solominka will not return again. The death of the little solominka whom the narrator knew, and her replacement by the unfamiliar Ligeja, reflect the poet's alienation and changed perception of his beloved. In 1933, Mandel''tam offered the following comment in the essay Razgo- vor o Dante: As in all true poetry, Dante's thinking in images is achieved through the aid of a characteristic of poetic material which I suggest calling its transformability or changeability .... In fact, imagine an airplane (despite the technical impossibility) which puts together and launches another machine while in flight. In exactly the same way, the second flying machine, caught up in its own flight, is able to put together and launch a third machine.36 In "Solominka," this process has even become the content: the theme of metamorphosis is created and sustained by the poem's phonology, struc- ture, and semantic associations. By engendering more and more diverse metamorphic images through myriad combinations and distortions, the blaizennye, bessmyslennye slova have performed their task well, and they continue to create associations long after the reading of the poem is over.

II, 374. 4 "Utro akmeizma," Sobr. II, 321. 5 It has been suggested that despite its actual later date of composition, "V Peterburge my sojdemsja snova ..." was moved by Mandel'?tam to a position directly preceding "Solo- minka" in the second (1923) edition of Tristia, partly because it speaks of blafennye, bessmyslennye slova and could thus introduce "Solominka" as an example of those words in action. See Clarence Brown, Mandelstam (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1973), 237. "V Peterburge .. ." was written in 1920 to Mandel'?tam's love Ol'ga Nikolaevna Arbenina, and the repetition of the phrase in the later poem probably was intended to recall the alter ego of solominka, his earlier amour Princess Salomeja Nikolaevna Andronikova. 6 Mandel'ltam intended his collected poems to be interpreted and considered as a single work, and indeed, the repeating themes and images in the Tristia collection require that interpretation of each single poem draw in part on other poems, both within Tristia and in the earlier Kamen', which use identical words in different contexts. See Ju.I. Levin et al., "Russkaja semantiteskaja poetika kak potencial'naja kul'turnaja paradigma," Russian Literature 7/8 (1974), 52-82, at 65. 7 For other examples of this phenomenon in Mandel'ltam's poetry see Ju. Levin, "O soot- nogenii meldu semantikoj poetiteskogo teksta i vnetekstovoj real'nost'ju (Zametki o poezii Mandel'gtama)," Russian Literature 10/11 (1975), 147-72, at 151. 8 For discussion of semantic fields in Mandel'ltam's poetry see Kiril Taranovsky, Essays on Mandel'tam (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1976); Lidija Ginzburg, "Poetika Osipa Mandel'ltama," Izvestija Akademii Nauk SSSR, Serija literatury i jazyka 31, no. 4 (1972), 307-27; Levin, "O sootnogenii." 9 The first line appeared originally as "Kogda, solominka, ty spi?' v ogromnoj spal'ne!" (Sobr. I, 431), and was changed only after the first edition of Tristia. The later version eliminates the suggestion that the occurrences that follow are a dream, or that solominka is actually dead at the beginning of the poem. 10 Brown (Mandelstam, 24) notes that the capitalization of the word solominka varies among the different editions of Tristia and thus it should not be considered a reliable index of the semantic associations intended. 11 This is not an instance of Mandel'?tam's frequent unmotivated conjunctions, which are used simply to tie together two logically unrelated clauses. For a discussion of this device see Levin et al., "Russkaja semantiteskaja poetika," 63. 12 The insomnia motif appears also in an earlier poem in Kamen', "Bessonnica. Gomer. Tugie parusa .. ." (1915) (Sobr. I, 48-49). Many of the images of this work are used in new contexts in "Solominka," and the insomnia of the earlier poem is devoid of sinister connotations. For discussion of the precursor poem see Nils Ake Nilsson, "O. Mandel'- 9tam's 'Insomnia Poem,'" IJSLP 10 (1966), 148-54. 13 For discussion of the semantic field of tjafest' see Taranovsky, Essays, 281. 14 Since a solomka also is a toffee stick and a type of cookie, it might alternatively be a separate affectionate nickname. 15 Unfinished clauses beginning with the adverb kogda appear in other Mandel'?tam poems as well. For a list of these, see Levin, "O sootnogenii," 163; also "Zvuk ostoroinyj i gluxoj ?. ." (1908) (Sobr. I, 3), a one-stanza poem consisting of an unfinished clause. 16 For an exhaustive semantic analysis of dryness, see Ginzburg, "Poetika," 314-15. The straw image appears in numerous poems within this semantic field. 17 The most famous example of this is the juxtaposition of heaviness and tenderness in "Sestry-tjaiest' i neinost'.. .," in Tristia (Sobr. I, 76-77). For discussion of this pair, see D. Segal, "Fragment semantiteskoj poktiki O.E. Mandel'ltama," Russian Literature 10/11 (1975), 59-146. See also tjafest' and nefnost' in "V ogromnom omute prozraino i temno</page><page sequence="16">420 Slavic and East European Journal ." in Kamen' (Sobr. I, 11), the second of two "twin" poems containing imagery that was to be used again in "Solominka." 18 The second stanza of "Solominka," with the image of the straw absorbing poison, is a condensation of the water and straw imagery of "V ogromnom omute ..." in a new context. In the earlier "twin" poems Mandel''tam compared his heart to a reed ("Iz omuta zlogo i vjazkogo ..." [Sobr. I, 10]) or a straw ("V ogromnom omute ..."), oscil- lating between the depth and surface of water. The two poems, apparently variations of a single idea, seem to treat the words solominka and trostinka as synonyms. 19 See Ginzburg, "Pobtika," 314-15. 20 Levin ("O sootno'enii," 152) interprets this formula as an expression of Mandel''tam's striving for the unattainable. 21 Salomeja Andronikova was a married woman with whom Mandel'Stam was in love in 1916. The room depicted in "Solominka" was confirmed by Anna Axmatova to be the large bedroom of Andronikova's home overlooking the Neva. Mandel'?tam clearly was aware of the additional literary and historico-cultural allusions of the figure of Salome: Clarence Brown (Mandelstam, 33), in addition to supplying Axmatova's comments, notes that Mandel''tam was enthusiastic over Richard Strauss's "Salome" as a boy, even writing a very early poem on it. In addition, Oscar Wilde's play "Salome" created a scandal when it was banned by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1908 (Taranovsky, Essays, 54, n. 6). 22 Cf. use of the word izgolov'e in "V ogromnom omute .. ." and "Bessonnica. Gomer ..." in Kamen'. 23 The corpse which is transformed into the different personality of Ligeia in Poe's short story "Ligeia" is wearing funereal garments. Spontaneous movement of objects in the room also occurs in the story. 24 For analysis of the semantic field of cernyj in Mandel''tam's works, see Ginzburg, "Pobtika," 315. 25 See the line "I temnoe okno beleet" in "V ogromnom omute ...," a compact presentation of three major words of the "Solominka" poem in a different context. 26 Axmatova noted in her memoirs that this line had been borrowed from one of her own poems ("Ne smertnogo 1' Yasa idu"). According to Axmatova, Mandel''tam used a var- iant of this line in a later poem devoted to Ol'ga Arbenina, in the context of a woman's disregard for the dying of an emotional relationship ("dto znaet ienStina odna o smert- nom Ease"). See A. Axmatova, "Mandel'Itam (Listki iz dnevnika)," Sobranie socinenij, vol. 2 (Munich: Inter-Language Literary Associates, 1968), 166-90. (See note 8 on another use of "Solominka" imagery in poems to Arbenina.) This other context of the phrase supports the view that the dying in "Solominka" is the dying of a love rather than of Salomeja. (Salomeja Andronikova outlived Mandel'?tam by at least thirty years [Brown, Mandelstam, 244].) 27 Breathing has been interpreted to refer in Mandel'gtam's verses to poetic creativity and/or a life force (Taranovsky, Essays, 10). 28 The Neva also enters the bedroom in the "Bessonnica" poem. 29 The use of a series of isolated segments, set forth in lists of two or more, is a common device of Mandel'?tam. For other examples see Levin, "O sootnolenii." The character Ligeia in Poe's story overcame death through sheer will, and returned to life and her husband by metamorphosizing herself from the corpse of his unloved second wife. The opium-laden atmosphere of the story, which is told in the first person by the husband, includes mysteriously moving furniture as in "Solominka." The hazy perceptions, ambiv- alent images, and distracted narration in "Solominka" demonstrate Mandel'Itam's use of a literary subtext for general mood rather than for plot. Nilsson ("O. Mandel'Itam's 'Insomnia Poem"') carries the Ligeia analogy further by suggesting that she is the Per- sephone that haunts so many of the Tristia poems.</page><page sequence="17">Mandel''tam's "Solominka" 421 30 Blaiennyj has been interpreted in connection with poetic creativity. For a list of its occur- rences in other poems, see Segal, "Fragment," 97-98. 31 Brown (Mandelstam, 243) notes that Lenore is another dead Poe beloved, and emphasizes that Seraphita, the heroine of the Balzac novel by the same name, also died. Nadeida Mandel'Stam dismisses any conjecture as to the significance of the choice of names, claim- ing that these were simply beloved of poets. See N. Mandel'Itam, Vtoraja kniga (Paris: YMCA Press, 1972), 70-71. Nikolaj Xard.iev, the editor of the Soviet editon of Mandel'- stam's collected works, notes that Solominka is contrasted with this ethereal host to emphasize her earthliness. See O. Mandel''tam, Stixotvorenija, ed. N.I. Xardliev (L.: Sovetskij pisatel', 1973), 272. Nadeida Mandel''tam's view ignores the analogies in the stories of the three literary heroines. Lenore is not only the heroine of the Poe poem by the same name, with which Mandel'?tam may not have been familiar, but also the central figure of the better-known poem "The Raven." "Lenor" is a lament for the poet's dead bride and contains no motif of change. In "The Raven," however, the bird that haunts the narrator's room and refuses to leave is a metamorphosis of the dead Lenore. The heroine of Balzac's Seraphita is dying also; but, as an embodiment of the Sweden- borgian concept of the soul, she lives forever as a spirit in heaven. Seraphita is a dual figure as ambivalent as solominka-Salomeja: she appears simultaneously to different characters as a man or as a woman, and in fact is androgynous. Although Seraphita is often referred to in the narration as "he," depending on whose point of view is being presented, in the end Balzac states that the angel Seraphita/Seraphitus is properly a "she" because of its identity with the Hagia Sophia, which is the Eternal Feminine. The Sweden- borgian overtones to the mention of Seraphita in "Solominka" call forth associations of the Russian Symbolists. (Cf. stanza 2 of I, which carries associations of Futurism.) The company that solominka keeps in stanza 1 consists of generally positive ghostly figures; Seraphita was holy, and, indeed, the opium-drugged narrator of "Ligeia" and the narrator of "The Raven" were not distressed to have their wives back from the dead. Despite the literary subtexts, however, the use of diminutives and the narrative focus on solominka indicate that the narrator's sympathies in "Solominka" are clearly with the old solominka rather than with her metamorphosized double. 32 This is the last of the sound play, with the exception of the lines repeated verbatim from subheading I and the totally new line "Vku'aet ME-DLENNYJ, to-MI-TEL'NYJ pokoj." Cf. the earlier version "Vkugaet medlenno toriestvennyj pokoj" (Sobr. I, 431). 33 See, for example, Ju. Levin, "O nekotoryx 'ertax plana soderlanija v pottiteskix tekstax: Materialy k izuieniju pottiki 0. Mandel'ltama," IJSLP 12 (1969), 106-64, and Nilsson, "O. Mandel''tam's" (II as one of two "twin" poems); compare Brown, Mandelstam, 237ff. (II as the second part of a single poem). 34 Nearly every noun in I is modified by at least one adjective. The substitution of nouns rather than adjectives in the metamorphosized phrases reflects Mandel'Itam's greater dependence on the associations of adjectives for the creation of imagery. 35 Blood is a semantic field which is employed by Mandel'?tam in connection with life rather than with death (Ginzburg, "Pobtika"). 36 "Razgovor o Dante," Sobr. II, 382 (my translation).</page></plain_text>
