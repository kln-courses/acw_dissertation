<plain_text><page sequence="1">LEON ROSENSTEIN Metaphysical Foundations of the Theories of Tragedy in Hegel and Nietzsche Voll Verdienst, doch dichterisch, wohnet Der Mensch auf dieser Erde. Rilke WHAT IS the ultimate intent? The intent is to show the relations of aesthetics to meta- physics in general, to show that, at least in the idealistic tradition, the aesthetic theo- ries of philosophers depend almost en- tirely upon their metaphysicsl, to show that with regard to their theories of tragedy there exists an overwhelming similarity (which can, on one level, be seen as consensus), and to erect upon this in- terpretation a theory of tragedy. This will in turn have its implications with regard to an underlying aesthetic, and this, in principle at least, to a metaphysic. Such a project may perhaps ultimately be called an analysis in working backwards to meta- physics through art. Since such an attempt would require a lengthy book, this paper deals with only one fragment of the analy- sis and is therefore incomplete at best. What shall here be dealt with are the theories of Hegel and Nietzsche only, and these only with regard to the art form of LEON ROSENSTEIN is a doctoral candidate in philos- ophy at Columbia University and teaches philoso- phy at San Diego State College. His dissertation is on the metaphysical foundations of aesthetics with reference to a theory of tragedy. "tragedy" (but since, for each, tragedy is the highest form of art, it can be taken as indicative [if not paradigmatic] of what art in general is conceived to do and be). After examining their theories separately I shall show how the metaphysic of each relates to his aesthetic as expressed in his theory of tragedy. I then shall compare the two theories of tragedy. From this com- parison shall arise a more comprehensive theory of tragedy, and possibly a more complete one. Thus the question is one of ground. If it is indeed true, and it is here accepted as such, that every theory of art implies an underlying metaphysic, and if it is correct that poetic tragedy is the highest form of art-as maintained by Hegel and Nietzsche-then the examination of trag- edy should make apparent how the theo- ries of tragedy (and of art in general) in Hegel and Nietzsche relate to their con- ceptions of the real and the true.2 I will first say something about the truth which the work of art reveals; the issue will undoubtedly arise since Nietzsche and Hegel (and myself) insist that art does indeed reveal truth. The</page><page sequence="2">522 truth revealed by tragedy concerns reality. But it is not difficult to see that the great- est tragedies neither reveal nor utter cliches, such as the "law" that "the high" must fall, or cite "facts" and "descriptions" regarding the passions of men, or make in- junctions and prohibitions that one should not kill or bed one's mother, nor be over- bearingly proud or wrathful or ambitious, nor be jealous to the point of blindness or contemplative to the point of inaction. The difficulty is that one can often be easily forced into asserting these as the "truth" of the work of art. Tragedy is not merely a more forceful or better way of presenting a literal truth; for propositional statements (literal truth or not) are not really explications of the truth of tragedy, which can best be understood, not as a simplistic description or exemplification of laws or things but as a new way of seeing, acting, and living. Perhaps the best state- ment of truth's relation to art is Heideg- ger's "Art is truth at work."3 Indeed it may well be the case that philosophic theo- ries regarding tragedy can never be "sup- ported" by the plays themselves. This is not to imply that such theories are by any means false (though the ultimate useful- ness of examples may be thrown into ques- tion). Rather, it may be that art and phi- losophy stand side by side in eliciting truth (or truths) from what might best be called the tragic situation, which is real. Laotze once said that "the reality which can be conceptualized is not the essential reality." It is perhaps equally true that the reality which can be dramatized (or poetized) is not the essential reality. To attempt simply to reduce the created art work to philosophic theory or vice versa seems from the outset not only futile but fruitless in any case. In this light, art and philosophy may best be seen as mutually influencing and nourishing each other as truth and reality. Now, what philosophy says about reality may be true; and what art says about reality may be true; and, if both are true, then one will want to say the truths are "the same." But this is an extremely sterile and perverse way of speaking, for the answer to the question, "All right, what is this truth?" inevitably LEON ROSE NSTEIN ends with the level of the "cork floating on water," the "phrenology" standpoint Hegel speaks of,4 and we have arrived no- where at all. It is typical of philosophy that it seeks not only truth in general but also seeks truths about the nature and function of art. And it is here that the truth which tragedy reveals seems, in one way or another, to be lost in the maze of philosophic systems-in Hegel's in ulti- mate absolute knowledge as unfolded or in subjective-objective, logical-ontological equations, and in Nietzsche's in the nugatory flux or in the will to affirm and justify. Hegel asks: what is art, why is it im- portant, how does it function, and to what is it related? He answers that art is the sensuous expression, manifestation, or "show" of the Absolute Idea. The Abso- lute Idea comes both to know itself and to be what it is in a historical, dialectical, and evolutionary process. Art stands in this process (together with religion and philos- ophy) as one of the three "moments of Absolute Spirit." In a sense, it transcends all historicity (stands above the rational dialectic in time and space); yet, since art is created by man and for man and is ad- dressed to his senses and his mind, it is in no way an hypostatized essence excluded from the world in which it becomes what it is. Seen as working itself out, art itself is even a process within a process.5 Now the Idea, as "the presentation of the most exalted subject matter" (namely, "the con- crete world process considered as a sys- tematic unity") is both what art is and what it discloses. In this form (as art) the Idea is disclosed to the senses as beauty. The whole world of this beauty Hegel calls the "Ideal." Hence, the object of the philosophy of art is to "unfold the essen- tial nature of the beautiful and the way in which it is illustrated in works of art." Hence, since "nothing is actually real but that which is at once of the substance of nature and mind," art, though it is an im- mediate appearance to sense (as much as is any natural phenomenon), yet "points be- yond itself, directing us to the spiritual, which it seeks to envisage to the concep- tive mind." 6 That is, the "philosophical</page><page sequence="3">Tragedy in Hegel and Nietzsche idea of the beautiful must combine meta- physical universality with the determinate content of real particularity." 7 Thus, the Idea as it appears in the work of art oc- cupies a "midway ground" between the "show" of the objective world and the ideality of pure thought, wherein the "sensuous aspect has a right to determinate existence only insofar as it exists for the human mind." Art does not function as an imitation of nature or as a means of information or as an evocation of emotion (except insofar as any sensuous entity is liable to these), but as a revelation of truth. And this is its im- portance and purpose: to be "deliberately disposed either to be the mere plaything of entertainment or a mere means of in- struction" (issuing from the Absolute Idea itself and having as its end the sensuous representation of the Absolute itself): it is art's function to reveal truth under the mode of art's sensuous or material configuration, to dis- play the reconciled antithesis previously described [viz., between theory and subjective thought-in- ward freedom, abstract and empty-and objective existence and experience-external necessity, con- crete and full] and by this means to prove that it possesses its final aim in itself, in this representa- tion in short and self-revelation.8 The Idea thus conceived exists as the work of art, as an individual configuration of reality, i.e., it is molded in conformity with the notional concept of the Idea, and is the Ideal, for the Ideal is the "appropri- ate coalescence" of both the truly concrete Idea and its true embodiment. Hegel con- cludes his work on The Philosophy of Fine Art with this summary statement: The aim of all art is the identity, produced by the mind, in which the eternal and divine, the substantively true, is revealed in real appearance and shape to our external perception, our feel- ings and our imagination.... the liberation of the mind from the content and forms of the finite, with the presence and union of the Abso- lute within the sensuous and phenomenal, and with an unfolding of the truth which is not ex- hausted in the evolution of nature, but reveals itself in the world-history, of which it consti- tutes the most beautiful aspect and the best re- ward for the hard toil of reality and the tedious labours of knowledge. Having thus indicated Hegel's general theory of the nature of art (as the sensuous 523 embodiment of the Idea) and of its func- tion (the revelation of truth), we arrive at his concept of tragedy. From his notion of art, Hegel derives (via the deduction of the moments of the Idea as art) a double classification: the doctrine of the evolu- tionary phases of the Idea as art, distin- guished by the modes of relation between the given historical conception of the Idea as content and its sensuous embodiment or configuration-symbolic, classical, roman- tic; and the doctrine of the division of the particular arts, the specific modes of sensu- ous configuration, distinguished by the na- ture of the external material of the media-architecture, sculpture, painting, music, poetry. The double classification is historically interconnected so that certain arts are the "most perfect" manifestations of certain evolutionary phases in the de- velopment of the Idea as art. Thus, for example, in the (historically first) sym- bolic stage-where the Idea is as yet so undeveloped (hence the content is so in- definite) that no particular material me- dium is really adequate to its vague sense of power, mystery, and sublimity-the most satisfactory medium of sensuous configuration is architecture, which merely manipulates, elaborates, and coordinates external inorganic nature in an abstract relation to spirit. As a form of drama and thus as poetry, tragedy belongs under the last category of the subjective arts classified under the ro- mantic moment: Drama, because it elaborates its content as well as its form into an altogether perfect whole, must be regarded as the highest phase of poetry and of art generally. For in contrast to every other sort of sensuous material, whether it be stone, wood, colour, or tone, that of human speech is the only medium fully adequate to the presentation of spiritual life; and further, among the particular types of the art of articulate speech, dramatic poetry is the one in which we find the objective character of the Epos essen- tially united to the subjective principle of the Lyric. In other words, it presents an action com- pleted in the past of actually happening before us, both as emanating from the inner life of a self-directed character and as determined in its outcome by the substantial nature of purposes, individuals, and collisions.9 Drama presents to the imaginative con-</page><page sequence="4">524 sciousness definite ends in their actually visible form, ends individualized in living personalities. These personalities, in ac- tualizing themselves, realize the ideal in- tention which they embody in the objec- tive world, and are manifested as actions having ends in conflict with contradictory ends (other personalities or situations). These opposed ends are then resolved by being referred to the essential totality of the Idea as necessity, for the actions which bring them about are recognized to be the material of the dialectic of the self-revela- tion of spirit, which is the whole of the world seen as a historical unity. Thus the principal aspect of poetic drama is its "ex- position of the ideal spirit of the action, not merely in respect of the dramatis personae and their action... but also rela- tively to the universal essence of the action in its conflict and destiny." Since the "true should be vindicated" in this way, "the dramatic poet must in the profoundest sernse make himself master of the essential significance of human action and the divine order of the world." The true theme of "primitive" tragedy is the Divine entering into the world in in- dividual action; and in this form "spiritual substance" is dispersed as an ethical force distinctively defined in characters each of whose whole independent being is a por- tion of the substance of the ethical viewed as an inactive and concrete unity. Can- celled out, therefore, are the harmony and coordination of the forces asserted in the collision of individual action (e.g., Anti- gone and Creon). The contradictory forces (the opposed characters) are individually justified in themselves; yet within the greater view of the whole, they are too ex- clusive and one-sided and tend to be mere negation and violation of their opposing forces.l0 This conflict is moreover neces- sary, Hegel claims, since the whole must "move from its, in the first instance still abstract ideality, and transplant itself in the real actuality of the phenomenal world"; just as necessary, however, is the conflict or contradiction resolved and rec- onciled by "eternal justice." And this is the fate of the tragic character who em- bodies the force in its particularity, that LEON ROSENSTEIN "unable to accommodate itself to this har- mony, and consequently in the tragic course of its action through inability to disengage itself from itself and its designs, it either is committed in its entire totality to destruction or at least finds itself com- pelled to fall back upon a state of resigna- tion in the execution of its aim insofar as it can carry this out." 11 In Greek tragedy, therefore, conflicting forces are represented by such heroic fig- ures as Oedipus, Antigone, Creon, Orestes; but the representative of the undivided and tranquil ethical consciousness is the chorus, the "spiritual scene." In a sense the chorus, to use Heideggerian terminology, is the clearing in Being where the Dasein of the tragic character appears, and is sep- arated out; it is the home, the architec- tural temple, where the statue of a new living and acting god works out his char- acter under the sky of "eternal justice." 12 What is eternal justice? As has already been noted, antagonistic claims, sub specie aeternitatis, are equally justified, hence "good"; therefore in no sense is the recon- ciliation through eternal justice a triumph of Good over Evil. When Hegel speaks of "justice," then, he conceives of it in a sense similar to that of the pre-Socratics- namely, as the criterion of the "nothing too much"; hence, justice is equivalent to the Logos. Just as the rivers in season over- flow their banks and are "punished" by the goddess of justice, so the heroic char- acter, overstepping his "natural" being, meets defeat (e.g., Oedipus, Pentheus, Macbeth). Indeed, Hegel's entire philo- sophic system could be said to work on the principle of eternal justice: the inadequate notion, claiming more than its due, is over- turned and, collapsing from within, yields to the larger view, the more complete reality. But Hegel also adds the concept of historicity and evolution, whereas the Greeks limited justice to a recurrent proc- ess (we shall see later how Nietzsche reverts to the Greek view). In the same way, trag- edy is not to be limited to the presentation of conflicting moral claims, for although Hegel speaks of the "ethical substance" and the contradictions which arise within it, he defines this concept in the broadest</page><page sequence="5">Tragedy in Hegel and Nietzsche sense as "nothing else than the absolute spiritual unity of the essential substance of individuals in their independent real- ity." 13 Hence, in its broadest sense, any in- teraction of individuals within a social context exists as a mode of ethical sub- stance. The important polarity is there- fore not simply family gods as opposed to state law, but the unconscious and un- divided totality as opposed to the con- scious and individuated, the unmediated and passive as opposed to the active and mediated, necessity and potentiality as op- posed to contingent actuality. Thus, for example, the conscious determination and recognition of the status of the chthonic deities with regard to the Olympian gods remain hidden within the human spirit until Orestes slays Clytemnestra and An- tigone opposes Creon. The tragic charac- ter can therefore be seen as an antithesis to both the inadequacy of the thetic14 substance from which it arises and in which the conflict operates and also to the greater truth which eternal justice brings into being from the synthesis engendered by its downfall. From the viewpoint of the necessity of eternal justice, therefore, the value, in terms of "goodness," of the tragic character is almost irrelevant; it is in this sense that Hegel says of tragedy that "we are elevated not by the destruction of the best but by the triumph of the true." 15 A. C. Bradley, in his essay "Hegel's Theory of Tragedy," 16 attempts to reconcile the difficulties of the ethical substance (as it affects Hegel's interpretation of modern tragedy and his preference for it as op- posed to Greek tragedy) by interpreting "good" as "anything of spiritual value" and interpreting tragedy as a portrayal of the self-waste of Spirit. This interpretation is essentially correct, except that what takes place is not so much a "self-waste" of Spirit as a waste of man as tragic hero through Spirit's coming to its truth; and, in any case, waste is not the exact word for the process. If one had to give a cause for the action of a tragedy, one could perhaps best answer by referring to an Aristotelian classification: material cause, human sub- stance; efficient cause, the definitive action of the character; formal cause, the dialectic 525 of the Idea as eternal justice working it- self out in a moment of the artistic mode; the final cause, truth. It is apparent that the Antigone of Sophocles is not the only play which can give valid support to Hegel's theory of tragedy. Indeed, I think it is possible to extricate from his broad concept at least three different-though overlapping- types of tragedy. They are the purely ethical (the ethics of family in opposition to and amidst that of the state); the spiritually moral (knowledge and will in opposition to and amidst the necessity and responsibility of the act completed); the expansively personal (subjectivity in its in- ternal conflict and self-creation in opposi- tion to and amidst the infinite breadth and variety of external conditions and rela- tions). Examples of the first two formulae are the Greek tragedies of Antigone and Oedipus; the third is peculiarly modern and best exemplified in the tragedies of Shakespeare. The first expresses the oppo- sition "between ethical life in its social universality and the family as the natural ground of moral relations";l7 the second is "concerned with the claim of alertness in our intelligence ..,. under the directing providence of the gods";18 the third re- quires only "formal greatness of character and power of the personal life which is able to ride out everything that negates it... capable of accepting their conse- quences... [where] substantive ends... form the particular ground upon which such persons... take their stand...rather than have supplied what we may regard as the result and ultimate content of the volition and action." 19 We also may note the variety of resolu- tions achieved by eternal justice in Greek as compared to modern tragedy. In the former we have either (1) the destruction of both individuals (as in Antigone), or (2) the deus ex machina solutions of objective justice through divine judgment (Eumeni- dies), or (3) the personal surrender of sub- jective or (and) objective spirit to the will of the gods (Philoctetes), or (4) resolution through internal purification, illumina- tion, and death (Oedipus at Colonus). In modern tragedy, justice takes on a "more</page><page sequence="6">526 abstract," yet more varied and profound, nature, for modern tragic figures are placed within so wide an expanse of condi- tions and relations that the conflict "essen- tially abides within the character itself... for the simple reason that they are the kind of men they are." Thus modern trag- edy resolves the conflict either through (1) the character's becoming conscious of a more exalted condition of eternal blessed- ness, or (2) his displaying sheer persistence of strength and equanimity to the death, or (3) his recognizing and acknowledging his fate as due and merited, or (4) "the spiritual nature of such noble characters" being in such great accord with what evolves that, though justice appears to operate a mere convergence of external accidents and unhappy circumstances, the whole external world seems to emanate from their mere presence (as exemplified in Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet). The wholly schematic and general na- ture of this tripartite classification of the types of tragedy and of the forms of resolu- tion is apparent from the first, since (to take the most obvious example) in Oedi- pus it is clear that, though a Greek trag- edy, its resolution can be classified under any, indeed, under all of the resolutions of modern tragedy; and its genre can be seen to be as much the ethical or expansively personal sort as the spiritually moral sort. Although I believe Hegel clearly has these distinctions in mind (whether he makes them explicit or not), I do not think they are essential to his theory of tragedy as such, however much they may serve to de- velop his historical picture of the evolu- tion of tragedy as an art form or may be interwoven with his theory of the evolu- tion of spirit in general. In any case, al- though these distinctions may be helpful in the overall view, I believe they collapse entirely in application. (Indeed, Hegel's apparent preference for the last member with regard to type and resolution in each of these classifications itself points to the conclusion that the preceding types are either incomplete characterizations, as "perfect" tragedy, or subgenres of the last, for Hegel nowhere deprecates the tragedies which he believes to belong under other LEON ROSENSTEIN than the last of the three types or contain other than the last of the varieties of reso- lution.) Thus, one must have the broad- est possible conception of the tragic char- acter and plot: As the individual in his work ipso facto accom- plishes unconsciously a universal work, so again, he also performs the universal task as his con- scious object. The whole becomes in its entirety his work, for which he sacrifices himself, and pre- cisely by that means receives back his own self from it.20 The deed consists in getting in motion what was unmoved, and in bringing out what in the first instance lay shut up as a mere possibility, and thereby linking on the unconscious to the con- scious, the non-existent to the existent. In this truth, therefore, the deed comes to the light:- it is something in which a conscious element is bound up with what is unconscious, what is pe- culiarly one's own with what is alien and ex- ternal:-it is an essential reality divided in sun- der, whose other aspect consciousness experiences and also finds to be its own aspect, but as a power violated by its doing, and roused to hostility against it.2 Thus we are brought back to Hegel's metaphysical ground for his theory of tragedy. The point is that art-and par- ticularly tragedy-reveals the metaphysical truth of Being by presenting it to con- sciousness in the most complete and ade- quate form that sensuous representation can take: namely, the truth that the Idea comes both to be and to know itself (1) as a historical fact and (2) as a logical deduc- tion by a process (a) of experiencing the derivation of the world as its own reality, acting out existentially and developing its own predicates (thus establishing its own living [spiritual] truth in returning to it- self as objectively mediated self-conscious- ness), and (b) of deriving knowledge of its own essence by a dialectical cognitive "notioning" of more adequate modes of consciousness (thus establishing its own absolute truth in returning to itself as suc- cessively mediated conceptions of self-con- sciousness). This, I suggest, tragedy does by exhibiting the tragic character as a mo- ment of spirit's evolution, the catastrophe being the overthrow of its being and the limitations of its truth. Thus, for example, Hegel can say with regard to metaphysical necessity that the unmediated human22 substance unconsciously assents to what is</page><page sequence="7">Tragedy in Hegel and Nietzsche by performing it (it is only an "abstract identity of the subjective will with that which is"); thus it suffers fate, whereas the divisive and conscious tragic figure, in the events making up the objective ground for the overthrow of the truth of his notion, undergoes eternal justice.23 The simultaneous progression of neces- sary truth and necessary process is only to be expected in a dialectical metaphysical system where logical contradiction is the other side of active conflict. Thus the tragic figure is at once the combatant and bringer of truth. This is, as it were, the ex- plication of the necessary progress of the characters within the tragedy. It is equally obvious, however, that tragedy as an art form, as a human creation, is itself a mo- ment (or aspect) of the unfolding of the Absolute. Indeed, it is precisely because of this last fact that there can be a "science of art" at all, as Hegel attempts to show in his Introduction to The Philosophy of Fine Art. A science of art is possible be- cause reality is an evolutionary process and because art, as part of that process, not only exhibits its own internal evolution but also functions as a stage of the evolu- tion of the totality. And it is a matter of "historical fact," Hegel claims, that we, now at a higher level of human conscious- ness, can look back at spirit's earlier stages at a time when art was spirit's highest achievement. Hence, we must always keep these several levels in mind. Tragedy pre- sents the character as enacting and discov- ering truth, presents the audience with this truth-and on a higher (because artis- tic) level than is available to the hero him- self, for whom the truth is immediate- and, as a moment in spirit's coming into all of what is its own, is itself the devel- opment of truth. I will now discuss Nietzsche's conception of tragedy and its underlying metaphysic. Although Nietzsche later said that The Birth of Tragedy "smells suspiciously Hegelian," from its opening pages it marks off its metaphysical presuppositions clearly. Whereas Hegel began with a "demonstration" of the possibility of a science of art (and it "worked" because he had made it part of a total science of 527 Being), Nietzsche does not begin here, nor does he ever construct an "external" sys- tem. Nietzsche will allow nothing worth- while "outside of," much less superior to, art. Hence, art is not only "the highest task and proper metaphysical activity of this life," but it is the "consummation of existence." And since the motive force of art is the conjunction and conflict of the Apollonian and Dionysian, the ultimate reality is of a Heraclitan and not Parmen- idean sort. Thus there is no progressive synthesis into higher notions of truth, be- cause there can be no science of Being, but only an aesthetic of Being where "above all things there stands the heaven of chance, the heaven of innocence, the heaven of hazard, the heaven of wanton- ness." 24 Furthermore, art indeed arises from reality's need to see itself (this is suf- ficiently Hegelian), yet it is not because it sees itself materialized in art that reality is "eternally suffering and divided against itself," but because originally it required the vision of art "for its continuous salva- tion." And in this additional emphasis upon the eternal recurrence, Nietzsche again abandons the Hegelian dialectic-as much with regard to truth as to contingent historicity-and reverts to a more Greek notion of time. Further, in emphasizing the "need" and in abandoning final "ends," Nietzsche will obviously be domi- nated in his aesthetic not by an ultimately mediated eschatology but by an immediate psychology; not cognition, but volition will be the key. Again, because of the un- derlying metaphysic, tragedy, in contrast to Hegel's conception, will make reality not simply intelligible but bearable and jus- tifiable:25 the self lost in the confrontation with reality (found in Hegel as well) does not just arrive at a higher notion of its truth, but, being a telos in a non-teleologi- cal world, must find internal justification and support (to be explained psychologi- cally); for here is not moment in a finite process, but an "eternal moment." We noted the similarity between Nietz- sche's metaphysic and Heraclitus'. For Heraclitus, reality is a concatenation of opposites maintained in a tenuous equilib- rium by Strife, which is identified with</page><page sequence="8">528 the Primal Unity, with the Logos, and with justice. His image of the lyre is per- fectly clear in this context: each string (which is "one") is at its ends "two," the opposites of which are maintained by ten- sion; further, the entire instrument with its frame is a unity of opposites which are one and is itself the author and withholder and container of its total tensions or strifes; it is only through tension and strife that the cosmic-lyre can be kept in tune (order). For Nietzsche, the Apol- lonian and Dionysian are the polar charges of a Primal Unity ("Apollo could not live without Dionysus"). Just as out of the tensions of the strings emerge the harmony of the plucked chord, so out of the suffer- ing of the tragic hero emerges the beauty of the tragedy. And this harmony and beauty is the only justification for the strife. Hegel also recognized the relation of strife and justice, except he claimed that the latter arises from the former, whereas it is Nietzsche's (and Heraclitus') point that justice is in strife. But once the harmony is recognized, the liability to illusion arises, for the subject may claim the harmony without the taut strings, without even the lyre; he may step forth as a separate entity with a kind of pseudo- knowledge. As Nietzsche says: Thus all our knowledge of art is basically quite illusory, because as knowing beings we are not one and identical with that Being who, as the sole creator and spectator..., prepares a perpetual entertainment for himself. Only insofar as the genius in the act of artistic creation coalesces with this primordial artist of the world, does he catch sight of the eternal essence of art; for in this state he is, in a marvelous manner, like the weird picture of the fairy-tale which can turn its eyes at will and behold itself; he is now at once sub- ject and object, at once poet, actor, and specta- tor.26 One must not only hear the harmony (the Appollonian alone) or play the lyre; one must become part of (or one with) the lyre in its (the Dionysian) interior. Hence, from the ontological standpoint tragedy represents the lyre in its harmony; from the psychological standpoint the lyre repre- sents the torment of strife in imitation of an incoherent and hazardous hidden real- ity. L E O N R O S E N S T EI N What then happens to the tragic char- acter? Nietzsche offers the following analy- sis. Through the Dionysian music which recasts the world, the tragic character is lost in the Primal Unity and identifies him- self with its pain and contradiction; then, under the inspiration of Apollo, there is a second recasting of the world in a "sym- bolic dream picture" in which he can now live with "joyful satisfaction." This occurs in the plot as the sage-hero, Oedipus, per- forms an act of ultimate counter-naturalness ("a-morality")27 by breaking the laws of in- dividuation (of time and space) in the name of Dionysus-thus uncovering the riddle of Nature and (since his "wisdom is a crime against Nature") "experiencing the dissolution of Nature in himself."28 Yet, from this arises the "supermundane cheerfulness" of the Oedipus at Colonus, for the "noble man does not sin." "All laws, all natural order, yea, the moral world itself, may be destroyed through his action, but through this very action there is brought into play a higher magic circle of influences which build up a new world on the ruins of the old."29 In his purely "passive attitude," Nietzsche claims, the "hero achieves his highest activity"; and this is obviously so once we realize that Nietzsche is interpreting "activity" as the Aristotelian concept of "actuality" or en- telecheia. This Nietzsche calls the mystery doctrine of tragedy: the fundamental knowledge of the oneness of everything existent, the conception of individua- tion as the prime cause of evil, and of art as the joyous hope that the bonds of individuation m:ay be broken in augury of a restored oneness." The question, of course, is what makes Oedipus joyous? The answer, which I think Nietzsche would have to give, is that he has been, like the Dionysian reveler, torn asunder; yet in being so, he is united with Nature precisely because the Primal Unity tears itself asunder, something he can now bear because he has already acted out all that he potentially was and, having no more to do, dies. But what about the spectators? Here Nietzsche accounts for their reaction through his interpretation of the chorus. Just as the tragic characters act only be-</page><page sequence="9">Tragedy in Hegel and Nietzsche cause of illusion (because "their action cannot change the eternal nature of things"), so tragedy as such represents reality to the audience under an illusive screen, viz., through the chorus which, acting as a scapegoat or emotional ab- sorbent, beholds the spectacle for us. Un- der the enchantment of the drama, the spectator (the would-be Dionysian reveler) sees himself as a member of the Satyr chorus (the bridge and barrier) which in turn beholds the god; and this god is rep- resented to the Satyr as the "Apollonian consummation of his own state," for the chorus is "a perpetual disburdening into the Apollonian image-world." This "meta- physical comfort" the audience must have (since it is not prepared to die with Oedi- pus), if it is to continue living and acting: the spectator is "saved by art, and through art is saved for life." And this is why Nietzsche claims that tragedy not only ex- plains existence but also justifies it. Trag- edy has to justify existence, because exist- ence itself has no justification. (To use Nietzsche's own metaphor, man gets drunk and man dreams; but one can't live drunk only, because then one can't act, and one can't live in a dream, because a dream simply isn't true.) It is man who justifies because he insists upon justification; he wills it; and in willing it he evaluates and creates and thus is freed: Willing emancipateth, for willing is creating.81 What is great-that is to say, the creating agency.2 "Man", that is, the valuator.... Valuating is creating.88 Hence, although Nietzsche repudiates metaphysics in the traditional sense, he must allow for creation (which is in some sense metaphysical) in art. As Arthur Danto has noted: Will-to-power is related to Nihilism, in the mature phase of Nietzche's philosophy, in much the same way as the Apollonian was related to the Dionysiac in its early phase. Here, as in his con- ception of art, both forces or concepts are re- quired. Nihilism is needed to clear the way for creativity, to make it plain that the world is without significance or form. And will-to-power imposes upon that unshaped substance the form and meaning which we cannot live without. There is no specific form or meaning without 529 which we cannot live, however. How we shall live, and what we shall mean, is up to us to say.4 Nietzsche admits a metaphysical unity, therefore, in the broadest artistic sense, for "the will-to-beauty is a ruthless develop- ment of forms" and the will-to-power (his major ontological premise) speaks through art. As Jaspers points out, there is a unity in this flux insofar as there exists a unity of "world vision within which eternal re- currence, the will-to-power, and Dionysian life are fused together,"35 and insofar as unity is not conceived as eschatological, transcendent, or ideal (in the non-Kantian sense), but as symbolic, and in that sense, "aesthetic." So, also, Nietzsche must allow for truth-even if only for the truth of his own system-for "truth is the kind of error without which a certain species of life could not live. The value for life is ulti- mately decisive." 36 But it must be remem- bered that, from this very formulation, life stands higher than truth, for truth is made in and for life. And it is in the life which is the creation of the art-work, not in cognition, that truth is found. In Heidegger's work on Nietzsche this point is stated as follows: "art transforms life and lifts it up to higher, as yet unlived, possibilities which do not transcend life, but on the contrary reawaken it out of it- self to a quickening wakefulness."37 It follows, then, that the greatest work of art is man himself. This fact is the ground of tragedy, for it is tragedy which depicts the awakening of the hero to himself as his own creation out of the illusory, imper- fect, and contradictory stratum in which he finds himself "who goeth into God-for- saken wilderness." Thus, Nietzsche refers to "man, especially the wisest, as the greatest aberration of nature and self-con- tradiction (the being that suffers most)," as therefore being the most beautiful. Indeed, value too is present; and its "measure" (now in the aesthetic sense) is man. For the tragic hero represents to us the necessity of our "living according to our own standard and law," for through him we learn "to function as the actual helmsman of this existence and not permit our existence to appear as a thoughtless accident." Finally, then, the "tragic end,"</page><page sequence="10">530 death, is not at all, as it too easily appears, a contradiction of the greatest values-of life and the will-to-power-but is rather an affirmation of them. To say yea to creation, to will what is as a transcendence of what is, to die (to reach the self-measured equi- librium), is beauty or power become visi- ble.38 Nietzsche advises: "Let us guard against saying that death is opposed to life." Since there does not exist that which is after or above death, death as a creative act is an act of life (and in this sense even a will to death can be said to exist). There- fore, "we must transform the stupid fact of physiology into a moral necessity"-that is, through the "willed" death of the tragic hero as the completion of his creation. "My death, praise I unto you the volun- tary death, which cometh to me because I want it... when? ... at the right time for the goal and heir." This gives value-just as in Dionysian orgy there is creation in destruction-provided that it is the "right time for termination and succession," that all has been made actual. "To imprint the character of Being upon becoming- that is the highest will to power"-that is the very "will to the thinkability of Being." Yet it must ever be emphasized that knowledge is secondary to life-"the 'will to truth' is the impotency of the will to create." The living (that is, the creating) of life (that is, creation) is all. "My self- made ideal demands this and that virtue of me, that is to say my virtue; that is hleroism ... for being heroic causes one to meet his greatest grief and his highest hope at one and the same time." To exclude grief or death would be to exclude a nec- essary portion of reality and thus to deny the human affirmation of life and truth: "we have become men,-so we want the kingdom of earth." 39 Thus we can now see how dependent Nietzsche's conception of tragedy is upon llis metaphysics. Since reality is formless and Dionysian, human thought-which is essentially Socratic, Christian, or Apollo- nian-must comprehend reality ultimately through tragedy, replacing its (i.e., thought's) own transcendence by imma- nence, and its pure reason by existence. With the same Dionysian will, the individ- LEON ROSENSTEIN ual, like Nature itself, acts out of "the full- ness of its potentialities," but fulfills only himself within himself (because "in real- ity there is no purpose") and in this crea- tion justifies himself. Thus, as Nietzsche came to recognize in his later work, the suffering of existence is justified not sim- ply by the illusion which tragedy creates but the will to creation itself, by the will to accept the tragic character as one's own, by a "will to tragedy," by the affirmation and identification of the Apollonian and the Dionysian in the creative act, of the forces of man with those of Nature, of the wills to suffer, to create, to rise, and to fall. We may now note how the theories of tragedy of Hegel and Nietzsche reflect the internal relations of the metaphysic and aesthetic of each, yet are in contrast to one another. For Hegel, the ontological structure of the world is the unfolding of Absolute Spirit, metaphysics is the truth of the Ab- solute Idea revealed, and wisdom is knowl- edge regarding the necessity of the Abso- lute. Thus, art is ontodicy;40 it is neces- sary to knowledge of (and part of the proc- ess of the justification of) Being, which is "knowledge." A science of art can exist be- cause, in the historical process, art is super- seded by theoretical notions, and can be externally interrogated, since it is only the sensuous manifestation of the Idea (i.e., the world process as a systematic unity) as it reveals truth (i.e., the meta- physical reality). For Nietzsche, on the con- trary, the ontological structure of the world is the community (rather, disunity) of self-transcending wills, metaphysics is illusion (but necessary error), and wisdom is value regarding the nobility of the self which wills its own self into creation. Con- sequently, art also is ontodicy; but in cor- responding contradistinction to Hegel's view, art is the will necessary to the life of Being, which is the will to life. No science of art can exist because there is not only no history but also no true external- ity (e.g., the philosophical view) from which it can be investigated, since art is only the most psychologically satisfactory manifestation of illusion and the enuncia- tion of will.</page><page sequence="11">Tragedy in Hegel and Nietzsche Second, regarding justice and the dynam- ics of the world process, there is, for He- gel, the dialectic of the metaphysics of Being-the dialectic between objectivity and subjectivity and between conflicting notions, all in hierarchical order-which is Being's right, as the "triumph of the true," to unfold according to the dialecti- cal system. (This "justice" of course is non-Greek in being historical and in being subservient to the principle of the unfold- ing of truth, for in Hegel everything finds its external justification in an ultimately mediated eschatology.) In an identical fashion, through what may be called ontomimesis,41 art in tragedy performs the same dialectic as the world as a whole- here between the tragic hero and the world; the character recognizes in his own sub- jectivity that his world in its objectiv- ity is his creation; he envisions (notions) incorrectly of what he can or cannot act or of what the world can or cannot contain ("the time is out of joint"). As in the case of the evolution of Spirit, the tragic hero arises from a preceding abstract (unme- diated) state (notion), becomes its antith- esis in enactment, and in turn is over- thrown. And his justice is the product of his dialectic with the world (just as Spirit's is). Thus, reality sees itself in art thIrough dialectic which is the result of embodiment as time and evolution. Regarding justice and the dynamics of the world process for Nietzsche, on the other hand, there is only the universal strife of wills-strife between will and will -which is the "heaven of chance, the heaven of wantonness," and whose only justice is the creation of the will, for everything here finds its internal justifica- tion in a non-ultimate immediacy (though perpetually re-enacted). (This justice is closer to the Greek in its abandonment of Hegelian historicity and evolutionary no- tions and in its reversion to the notion of the eternal return; yet insofar as there is a strong emphasis in Nietzsche upon chance and an apparent total lack of "restraint," it must be considered at least with regard to the prevailing Greek con- ception of justice-as, to this extent, un- Greek.) In a parallel way, through onto- 531 mimesis, art in tragedy for Nietzsche enacts the strife of the totality of wills, here between the tragic hero and the world; the character recognizes himself and his world as his creation as he experiences internal strife of will in act and creation. As in the case of the flux of wills, tragic heroes per- petually undergo dissolution and resurrec- tion through illusion and the affirmation of the life principle. And their justice is the act of their strife with the world of wills. Thus, reality sees itself as art in strife, which is the process of disburden- ing and creating, mediation as psychology. Third, with regard to historicity, Hegel relies on historical evolution; and meta- physics and reality end with philosophy, wherein all is realized. Hence, in art there is a history of the levels of notions, as em- bodied in adequate or inadequate modes, and in particular types, as determined by the material media-art "ends" (histori- cally) with religion and philosophy by which it is superseded. On the contrary, Nietzsche finds only the eternal recurrence, the endless opposition of wills, and the endless creation of forms, wherein nothing lies complete forever. Hence, in art for Nietzsche, there is only the "continuous disburdening into the image world": art, as one form of the creations of strife, is only temporarily superseded by another form. Finally, as regards function, Hegel treats art as only a function and a part of his metaphysic in general; its sensuousness points to the spiritual; and it accomplishes the spiritual over a long historical process, through greater levels, by transcending one notion at a time (for no level but the high- est is "the truth"). For Nietzsche, on the other hand, art is identical with metaphys- ics; it is a breaking down and a building up of worlds; and it accomplishes this dis- solution at once (but recurrently) by de- stroying all worlds, all relations at hand, because whatever is or may become the literal, everyday truth will not reveal "the truth." Now, despite their almost total disagree- ment about metaphysics, Hegel and Nietz- sche in some important respects agree with regard to tragedy. This agreement occurs precisely on that higher level</page><page sequence="12">532 where metaphysics bears a direct relation to tragedy. Both Hegel and Nietzsche see in the tragic situation a "care" 42 for the being of the tragic hero in his self crea- tion and destruction, which occurs as the tragic hero individuates himself by acting contrary to Nature (whether this "Nature" be seen as a contingent externality, "thet- icity," the everyday, the given, the accepted ideal, society, or contravening wills; and whether "contrariety" is a logical negation or an existential combat); thus he stakes or risks his being, chances his death. The individuation takes on dialectical form: in Hegel it is achieved through the act which breaks with the human substance, but is consequently lost because it is decontex- tualized; in Nietzsche it is lost through the act which involves Dionysian dissolu- tion, but is consequently achieved because it is the creation of will. Whether arising out of and against the "ethical substance" (Hegel) or the "unsevered consciousness" (Nietzsche), the tragic hero, in creating himself, makes the world-his own of the drama and (in imitation of the "demi- ergos") thus the world in general. Thus, through his acts, he brings into being his own perfection insofar as he completes all that of which he was capable, and is his own criterion so long as he is creative of what is. But through his completed crea- tion comes his destruction; he falls because in this completed form he, as an acting existent, is insupportable for eternity and because there is nothing left for him to "do." Finally, the "wisdom" involved must be conceived of as a way of being and an active truth-making, since for both Hegel and Nietzsche, art is at once what the world is and what the world does-it is wis- dom made real and making real; for the truth of wisdom is not simple logical knowledge with its purely rational abstrac- tions encased in propositions which pop out with mere pluses and minuses, but is suffering and creating and valuing, a lib- eration in existence, which is the "care- ful" 43 battleground and communion of the individual with respect to the All. Perhaps a more general way of saying this is to describe tragedy as the existential intersection of the personal and the universal with regard to LEON ROSENSTEIN value and their essential convergence with regard to truth. Expressed and felt in the individual, tragedy is understood and ac- cepted in the universal. 1Not in the obvious sense that every philosopher who has had a metaphysic and an aesthetic must so construct the latter as not to contradict (logically or in spirit) the former, but in the deeper sense in which the latter is not a mere appendage to the rest but is in a special sense and in its own way a restatement of the entire Weltanschauung. 21 maintain that the domain of truth does not exclude all but affirmative propositions, that the domain of reality is not confined to the bouyancy of corks floating on water, and that, further, the work of art-and tragedy in particular-is not equivalent either to a sneeze, or a verbal inter- jection, or a manifestation of psychopathic afflic- tion. Hence, I shall not make the antiseptic "clarifications" of the everyman lexicographers or the latter-day phrenologists (cf. G. W. F. Hegel, The Phenomenology of Mind, trans. J. B. Baillie [London, 1949], pp. 337-72; hereafter cited as Phenomenology); nor do I dismiss as merely per- verse those who do "see tragedy in what could not conceivably be otherwise," and as deluded those who attempt to discover through philosophy pre- cisely what is the source of art. That is to say in general (to use one of Nietzche's metaphors), I do not here count myself among those whose "soul grows ardent over the task of counting the fila- ments of a flower." Cf. also Albert Hofstadter, Truth and Art (New York, 1965). Martin Heidegger, Holzwege (Frankfurt am Main, 1952), p. 28. 4 Phenomenology, V,A, last paragraph. GThat is, insofar as art is a particular mode of unity of the world process, insofar as it is a histori- cal moment in the dialectic of subjective-objective realization, all these occur: the world is seen ob- jectively as functioning in an artistic way, man sees himself as a creator of and as created by the world; the art work is seen subjectively as functioning in an intelligible way (i.e., one explanatory of the world), the work is seen as revelatory of the his- torical process of self-knowledge (for in the work man sees himself for what he was and is and hence sees the world as well). But art itself is just one level of Spirit's self-revelation and self-realiza- tion, hence the same analysis is repeatable on a "higher" level. 'G. W. F. Hegel, The Philosophy of Fine Art, trans. F.

Briefly, the former denotes the "justification of Being" (in the sense in which "theodicy" is used in reference to God), i.e., the giving of what is a value. The latter denotes the "imitation of Being" (meant in a sense similar to that in which Aristotle speaks of art as partly imi- tating and partly completing Nature), or what the tragic hero or art itself does as a microcosm. 41See preceding note. Also, it may of course be claimed against both Nietzsche and Hegel that they are guilty of anthropomorphism or some "naturalis- tic fallacy"; but one may reply that to make such an objection is already to beg the question, to take a metaphysical position which would need as much (if not more) of a defense as the ones we are consid- ering. 42 See note 14. 49 In Heidegger's sense.</page></plain_text>
