<plain_text><page sequence="1">FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER RELIGION Algorithmic Culture and Inter-Religious Encounter Rachel Wagner The things we do in video games, says gamer theorist Galloway, "are an allegory for the algorithmic structure of today's informatic culture" (17). But our fascination with algorithms is hardly new. Indeed, reli gious history is infused with a host of scripted, coded forms of interac tion, facilitated by religious authorities who have typically acted as the moderators of consistency—the operating systems for culture, if you will. As scripts for interactive behavior, rituals are traditional forms of "algo rithmic culture." Rules about behavior, about textual interpretation, and about how to interact with others are often coded into religious systems, as algorithmic in design as any computer-based script. This is especially true of the Abrahamic, revealed religions, since these three faiths typi cally include a belief in God as Programmer and propose that the world unfolds via the interaction between God and his creation. Because they seem for so many people to depend so much on the idea of a Program mer God, these religions also have the most at stake in a consideration of algorithmic culture. Galloway is one of a growing number of interdisciplinary thinkers interested in how digital culture is meaningfully shaping our lives. A highly respected media scholar, an expert video game player, and a phi losopher engaging with the cultural landscape, Galloway draws on his interest in "algorithmic culture" to propose that video games should not be viewed as sheer entertainment; indeed, he argues, the forms of "con figuration" found in video games "express processes in [broader] culture that are large, unknown, dangerous, and painful" (16). Religious practice, © 2012 Association for Religion and Intellectual Life J U Ν Ε 2 01 2 · 181</page><page sequence="2">FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER RELIGION too, can be viewed as a reflection of larger cultural processes, sometimes compassionate, but sometimes also hateful. Given the decline in institu tionalized religious identification that is happening at the same time as video games become increasingly popular, is it possible that video games might be performing some of the same functions as religious activ ities? And if so, what does that mean? Both religion and games, after all, provide us with structures founded in worlds that we enter into, provid ing us with temporary escape from our daily lives. And both, of course, are products of human culture: they both represent the kinds of things we as humans do and make, the ways that we script our lives. Both can provide interpretive maps for how the world works. And both offer a sense of order and purpose, however temporary, to the people who "play" them. Religion: the game The first major obstacle encountered in an inquiry of this sort is huge and, frankly, insurmountable. How can I compare religion and games, when both terms are so riddled with definitional controversy and compli cated by so many participants weighing in that there is no obvious agree ment? How can I pretend to know what religion is, especially enough to even label it as a "game" for the sake of argument? Instead of tiying to define religion and games, I perform an exercise in synthesis and provo cation. By composing an assemblage of resemblances between religion and games, I reveal my interest in the common concerns that emerge. Any similarities, however, should aptly be viewed as thought-provoking, not as normative. Indeed, the comparison reveals a list of shared features that is fluid, incomplete, and enthusiastically open for debate. 1. Both religion and games are often described as predominantly social, although both also have lesser "played" forms that are solitary. Salen and Zimmerman (2004, 462), two of today's leading video game the orists, point out that "over the centuries, games have been valued as social experiences, as a way for people to relate to each other, as a way for people to play together." Many theorists of religion, including Emile Durkheim, Victor Turner, and Jonathan Z. Smith, among others, have similarly noted the social aspects of religious experience, especially reli gion's ability to offer a sense of identity and purpose for a group of peo ple, often in distinction from other groups of people. 182 · CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="3">RACHEL WAGNER 2. Religion and games are both often described as absorbing, some times in ways that also promote social belonging. For Johan Huizinga, a game is a free activity standing quite consciously outside "ordinary" life as being "not serious," but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner. It promotes the formation of social groupings which tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress their difference from the common world by disguise or other means. (13) Religion, like games, can also be viewed as deeply absorbing, as evi dent through meditative or prayer practices, through ritual repetition, through vicarious identification with religious figures in sacred stoiy, and even through ongoing commitment to a fixed set of habits and values. Both religion and games reflect an immersive quality that Mihâly Csiks zentmihâlyi has famously called "flow." He defines flow as "a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience is so enjoyable that people will continue to do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it" (4). Flow, in games and in religion, offers form and structure to our experiences, often obscuring our sense of time and self. 3. Both religion and games involve elements of what we might call make-believe, or the investment in a set of "what-if" propositions that gov ern behavior. Caillois (2006) defines a game as an activity that is essen tially "free" (voluntary), "separate," "uncertain," "unproductive," "governed by rules," and characterized by "make-believe" (128). In my recent book Godwired, I examine the performative element of "make believe" in games and religious practice and suggest, drawing on the work of performance theorist Richard Schechner, that a better term is "make-belief." "Make-belief" is the willing suspension of disbelief per formed by those with a desire to inhabit a set of propositions as fully as possible, to the point that through an act of will, make-believe becomes belief. This process can emerge in games, especially real-life games like JUNE 2012 · 183</page><page sequence="4">FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER RELIGION alternate reality games (ARGs) that invite a sense of re-enchantment in which ordinary objects are viewed as part of the game, and also in reli gion, in which ordinary objects and daily events are inscribed with added potency and an assumed sense of divine purpose—what in other contexts we might call the rules of the game. 4. Caillois' inclusion of the feature of voluntary activity, too, is one that we might easily enough see applying to religious activity, especially if one comes from a tradition that promotes the idea of free will and com mitment. The altar call is a great example. Csikszentmihalyi (1990) claims, based on his arguments about flow, that "[t]he best moments in our lives are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times... The best moments usually occur if a person's body or mind is stretched to its lim its in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worth while" (3). We must be committed in order to be engaged, in both religion and in games. 5. Religion and games are both typically structured according to rules. Rules are "a fundamental part of any game," according to Salen and Zimmerman (2006, 9). The material properties of a game are, in the end analysis, subject to the rules and defined by them. For Suits (2006), it is the rules that make a game even possible, since "games are activi ties in which rules are inseparable from ends... but with the added qual ification that the means permitted by the rules are narrower in range than they would be in the absence of rules" (181). For Byork and Holop ainen (2006), rules are "embedded in every... component" of play. Rules "govern what the game elements are, how they behave, what actions players perform, and so on" (10). It is easy to see the kinship between religion and games in this Sunday School exercise, engineered to con flate the creator's vision of Christianity's rules with an existing chil dren's game: Choose one person to be "it" as a sin vims that wants to infect as many people as possible. Select another person to play Jesus, the only safe refuge from "sin." If "sin" tags you, you're infected and must link elbows. However, if you can ran to Jesus and link elbows before "sin" tags you, you're safe. As long as you remain linked to Jesus, "sin" cannot infect you. If you let go, you're vulnerable again. If you are infected by "sin," you can cry out, "Jesus, please 184 · CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="5">RACHEL WAGNER help me." Then Jesus can come tag you and set you free. The goal is for eveiyone to link up in a giant Jesus chain and leave "sin" with no victims to infect. (Van Hooser 2012) What makes this example compelling is the surprisingly easy reduc tion of Christian theology to simple game mechanics. In another Sunday School game guide, "Musical Chairs" is offered as a model for Christian life, but serves primarily as a foil for teaching a par ticular Christian worldview: "Every job, family, activity and game has lim its and rules to abide by. God does as well. He makes it simple. Christianity isn't about leaving people out or following just rules. Chris tianity is about one thing—believing in Jesus and accepting Him into your life. He loves eveiyone and, unlike the game of musical chairs, Jesus doesn't want anyone excluded from His love and guidance. He leaves that choice up to you" (Scheidies). For this game creator, there is nothing con troversial about the claim that Christianity is indeed a game. It is just a game with one rule and an ultimate outcome. The same principles can apply to board games, such as the Christian game Faith and Redemption, in which players journey "from the Garden of Eden to Judgment Day" and attempt to "overcome the ever-present temp tation of sin." In the Hajj Fun Game, players will "learn how the acts and rites are performed during Hajj, and what its do's and don'ts are [sic]. In short, the Hajj Fun Game will bring alive the annual pilgrimage of Hajj." In Let My People Go, players will "journey with the children of Israel as they emerge a free nation from slaveiy."1 Nikki Bado-Fralick and Rebecca Sachs-Norris have shown in Toying with God: The World of Religious Games and Dolls (Bado-Fralick and Sachs-Norris, 2010) just how compelling the association of religion with board games can be. In many of these reli giously affiliated games, rules are also structuring mechanisms for how to view life and can govern storytelling as well as expectations for behav ior. They also dictate what "winning" looks like and thus point toward the next shared feature: competition. 6. Religion and games can both be characterized by competition. Indeed, for some theorists, conflict is the most defining feature of games. Avedon and Sutton-Smith (1981) see the idea of winning or losing as essential to games: "At its most elementary level then we can define game as an exercise of voluntary control systems in which there is an JUNE 2012 · 185</page><page sequence="6">FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER RELIGION opposition between forces, confined by a procedure and rules in order to produce a disequilibrial outcome" (7). At its most basic level, a game is a sorting system, shaped by rules and procedures that help to define what goes where. As I write in Godwired, this kind of process resembles certain aspects of religious practice: Conflict in ritual can be seen as a kind of sorting process, putting things in their proper place. Smith (1987, 109) defines ritual in one instance as "an assertion of difference." Smith echoes [Catherine] Bell here, since both see opposition as key to ritual and its cathartic functions, such that the resolution of the oppositions creates a "fit" between the "taxonomic order" of the ritual and the "real world of experience." In other words, ritualization organizes things for adherents, by demarcating a structural coherence, which often involves oppositions—insiders and outsiders, good and evil, right and wrong (Bell 1992, 104). The function of ritual, then, as a means of quantifying outcomes and creating closure through difference, has a lot in common with that of games. (Wagner 2012, 73) Salen and Zimmerman's definition of religion also includes the ele ment of conflict as a crucial feature: "A game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifi able outcome" (2004, 96). As I argue below, some people "play" religion as just this kind of game, seeing the system of rules that define their faith as a means of excluding others and defining ultimate forms of "win ning" or "losing." 7. Religion and games can also both provide us with a sense of pur pose. Gamers, asserts game theorist Jane McGonigal, have "had enough of reality" and are "abandoning it in droves" (2). Why? Because "the real world increasingly feels like it's missing something" and gamers cast about for "that gamer sense of being fully alive, focused, and engaged in every moment," for a feeling of "power, heroic purpose, and commu nity" (3). Religion makes similar claims to engagement, empowerment, belonging, purpose, and community. Such a boon is especially welcome at a time in cultural history when such order seems increasingly hard to come by. The things that most readily connect us in the twenty-first century—communications, immigration, ease of international travel—are 186 · CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="7">RACHEL WAGNER the same things that require of us new modes of interacting and that challenge values we previously took for granted. We live in a time of competing values, differing religious perspectives, and the disintegration of hegemonic cultural values imposed from above. Is it any wonder that some of us look for modes, temporary or seemingly permanent, that offer us reliable rules for how to live? Gamers seek a rush of power, but admit that "reality isn't engineered to maximize our potential. Reality wasn't designed from the bottom up to make us happy" (McGonigal 2011, 3). Games, however, apparently are engineered to make us feel powerful and fulfilled. Games provide rewards by "teaching and inspiring and engaging us in ways that reality [does] not" (McGonigal 2011, 4). Similar claims crop up in evangelical Christian self-help movements. One of the most obvious examples is Rick Warren's Purpose Driven Life, in which he argues that "God has not left us in the dark to wonder and guess. He has clearly revealed his five purposes for our lives through the Bible. It is our Owner's Manual, explaining why we are alive, how life works, what to avoid, and what to expect in the future" (Warren 2002, 20). The Bible provides the rules, Warren believes, that give us a sense of purpose. Games, McGonigal says, offer "a feeling of power in a powerless situa tion, a sense of structure in a chaotic environment" and offer "a better way to live when [one's] circumstances [are] otherwise completely unsup portive and uninhabitable" (6). Games may offer a salve that is akin in pur pose to religious structure. Game theorists Salen and Zimmerman (2006, 3) remark that games have the ability to turn play "into an act of nearly religious devotion." Game theorist Ian Bogost concurs the following: People know that there's something magical about games. They don't always express that opinion positively, but even condemna tions of video games acknowledge that they contain special power, power to captivate us and draw us in, power to encourage us to repeat things we've seemingly done before, power to get us to spend money on things that seem not to exist, and so forth. While not everyone agrees that games are culture, or media, or art, every one seems to agree that games are powerful. And that power is mysterious and wild, like black magic. You don't have to like games to want a piece of it. But games are also terrifying, for just JUNE 2012 · 187</page><page sequence="8">FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER RELIGION the same reasons. "Games" seem both trivial and powerful all at once. (2011) For McGonigal, it is not even a matter of people choosing games or reli gion. Games are winning and seem to be filling our need for community, meaning, purpose: "We are starving, and our games are feeding us" (6). 8. Juul (2003) addresses what McGonigal calls the "sense of purpose" that games provide by considering the related element of player effort, the eighth feature that I identify as also evident in religious practice. Both religion and games typically require of followers a degree of discipline and adherence to set patterns of behavior. Indeed, Juul's definition of game deals quite a bit with the value of play and effort and consists of six points, some of which I have already discussed: (1) games are "rule based"; (2) games have a "variable, quantifiable outcome"; (3) games assign different values to different outcomes; (4) players exert effort "in order to influence the outcome"; (5) players are attached to the outcome and hope to be "happy" about a positive ending but will be "unhappy" about a negative one; (6) the same game may or may not have real-life consequences, relative to player choice (2003). When we apply Juul's definition to religion, we find that many of the features we have been discussing are represented. A player of religion, like a player of a game, "invests effort in order to influence the outcome," and is certainly hoping to be "happy" rather than "unhappy" about the outcome, especially if the game of religion being played involves the afterlife. Indeed, although certainly not all religious believers do so, one of the most common ways to "play" religion is by elevating the feature of winners and losers to be one of the most important defin ing features of the game. I call this mode of religious gameplay "first person shooter religion." First-person shooter religion First-person shooters (FPS) rely upon a unique mode of perspective. They allow entry into a typically strictly coded, scripted environment in the form of a subjective personal inhabitation of an entity that engages in vio lent destruction of enemies. In simple terms, in FPS games, we see a screen with a gun that we control featured prominently on its perimeter. The gun is often the only visible appendage representing us, and we are expected 188 · CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="9">RACHEL WAGNER Figure 1. Playing Battlefield 3 for Xbox360. Photo by Ashley May. to shoot it at any enemy who appears onscreen. As Galloway explains, in films, the first-person perspective is "marginalized" and disorienting and instills in the viewer a "sense of alienation, detachment, fear, or violence." In a first-person shooter video game, however, the "subjective experience" of the player is highlighted, even as the experience is rather rigidly coded to instructions to destroy one's opponents. The subjective perspective in this case serves to "achieve an intuitive sense of motion and action" and emphasizes the player's feeling of empowerment, even as he or she moves through a pre-designed experience (40). Indeed, the first-person shooter is more like a ritual than a film is, since in the latter, the player moves through a pre-scripted experience with an intense feeling of agency and performance. This kind of control is very fulfilling, especially for those people who might feel powerless in their everyday lives. Playing religion as a first-person shooter also meets the need for a clear identification of winners and losers, friends and enemies. Reliance JUNE 2012</page><page sequence="10">FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER RELIGION upon winners and losers is in some ways just a metaphysical sorting: a performance of the assumption of order in the cosmos, the desire for a belief that there is good and evil in the first place. For Smith (2004), the need to mark out others as different from oneself is a crucial objective in self-perception and religious performance: ... the issue of problematic similarity or identity seems to be partic ularly prevalent in religious discourse and imagination. Thus the ancient Israelites created a myth of conquest, fabricating themselves as outsiders and therefore as different from their encompassing and synonymous group, the Canaanites, from whom they cannot be dis tinguished. Paul never writes against Jews or members of Greco Roman religions, but always against fellow Christians from whom he insists on contradistinguishing himself and his teachings. John of Pian del Carpini and William of Ruysbroeck, thirteenth centuiy mis sionaries to the Mongols, have no difficulty in recording scores of positive comparisons between the feared Tartars and their own Christian-European culture, even though they are at war; rather their deepest perceptions of problematic difference are focused on the Nestorian Christians who remain largely unintelligible to them. From heresy to deviation to degenerations to syncretism, the notion of the different which claims to be the same, or, projected internally, the disguised difference within, has produced a rich vocabulary of denial and estrangement. For in each case, a theory of difference, when applied to the proximate "other," is but another way of phrasing a theoiy of self. (245 to 246) Bishop John Shelby Spong sees the same kind of religious gaming at work today in fundamentalist forms of religion: "We have called the differ ent ones by a wide variety of titles. They are the unwashed, the uncircum cised, the unbaptized, the unfit... the heretics, the religiously incorrect... Since we cannot comprehend the God of these different ones, we assume that the unknown deity is demonic and evil... We even justify our warfare against them as a religious act" (Spong 2001, 70 to 71). The language of gaming even creeps into political discussions about religious difference. Bo gost (2011) notes that conservative political scientist Frank Luntz coined the term "war on terror," which "suggests that the complex extra-govern 190 · CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="11">RACHEL WAGNER mental motivations of ideological groups like al-Qaeda are winnable con flicts between "good" and "evil," clashes identical to two-party state-based conflicts". Religion is a serious game, indeed, and as Smith suggests, it is those most like us that we may most wish to identify as "other." For Spong, the tendency to play religion as a game is a direct result of the need for purpose, and the loss of easy solutions in today's complex religious landscape. Attempts to deal with postmodern chaos of belief can be terrifying and thus may at times result in angry retrenchment into dualistic game-like patterns of interpersonal encounter. Spong cites, among other examples, the Holocaust; civil war in Bosnia, Serbia, and Ko sovo; conflicts in Africa in Rwanda and Uganda; violence in Ireland between Protestants and Catholics; tensions in the Middle East; and rac ism. He dubs all of these evidence of "the death of the theistic God," that is, the death of a God who is controlling the fate of the world with a providential, anthropomorphic hand. I suggest that we might also call this the death of God the Programmer, God the Game Designer. The result of this crisis is an increase in "tribal identities" objecting to the "awareness of human vulnerability and human meaninglessness" by relying stubbornly upon a simplistic belief in a "theistic God, who was thought to be sufficiently powerful first to tame and then to control these fears by being our human ally" (2001, 62, 64). Spong (2001, 81) argues that human beings developed their religious systems precisely to fight the difference they encountered in other religions and other "tribes" such that people come to believe that "our deity is the only true deity; the truth of this deity has been given only to us, and it was given by direct revelation, so its truth cannot be questioned... [and] we alone can interpret it properly, and our interpretation cannot be challenged." This is, at root, an argument for cosmic rules and an assumption of a cos mic religious "game." Sometimes, religion the game becomes an actual video game too. Because the FPS view of religion so readily accords with a gaming per spective, such games reinforce the problematic identification of contem porary religious belief with dualistic, us-versus-them values. Some of the most potent examples of FPS religion are Muslim and Christian video games that encourage players to cany the dualism of the game back into real life, where the performance of certainty sometimes has devastating consequences. JUNE 2012</page><page sequence="12">FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER RELIGION Both Under Siege (2005) and Under Ash (2002) were created by Dar al Fikr, a Syrian gaming company. Both are based on events surrounding Palestinian uprisings against Israeli forces and are based on interpreta tions of real historical events. Under Ash is no longer available, but the website still offers a backstory for the stoiy's main character, Ahmad (Characters, "Under Ash," http://www.underash.net/echarecters.htm [sic], accessed Januaiy 20, 2012). On the game's website, Ahmad is described as long-suffering, poor, uneducated but virtuous: Ahmad will hold an arm [weapon], and is going to shoot, but he is doing so because he is defending himself; a conduct that is not deemed violence... We do not want to waste time repulsing, justify ing or understanding violence. The problem of defending our exis tence, as Arabs, is much more important and urgent. We will never feel ashamed of presenting .toad's courage and reactions as a cure of the case of loss, weakness and humiliation which we, adults, are living today... ("Characters") As Souri (2007) describes it, in the start of the game, Ahmed dodges Israeli-fired bullets while trying to reach the Al-Aqsa Mosque, throwing stones at the soldiers firing on him. Once Ahmed reaches the Dome of the Rock, he is expected to "evacuate injured Palestinians, grab a rifle from an Israeli soldier, and throw the soldiers off of the site—a re-creation of the incident that marked the beginning of the Second Intifada" (538). Writing as an academic and from a Palestinian perspective, Souri also tells the story of a young girl in Ramallah describing the new fea tures of the Hezbollah-designed video game Special Force. The girl delights that Hezbollah has "changed the rules" of who it was possible to shoot, finally allowing attacks on Israelis. The girl likens the game to another Palestinian produced game Under Siege, in which "we get to shoot the soldiers who started the Intifada... it's our revenge on Israel. We get to shoot the Israelis. We get to blow up Markava [Israeli militaiy] tanks!" (536). Souri observes that "[although both games are based on actual history, their lure for Arab gamers has been the ability to turn the tables on Israeli power over Palestinians and have the upper hand in the resistance without 192 · CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="13">RACHEL WAGNER any real-life repercussions" (538). Both games, that is, impose a set of rules and a system of meaning onto real-life chaotic events. At the same time, however, they diminish the individuality of the people represented and reduce historical events to simple conflicts with winners and losers. Galloway critiques Sid Meier's Civilization (1995) and Civilization III for similar reasons, pointing out its tendencies to reduce people to algo rithms: Worse than attributing a specific characteristic to a specific racial or national group, is the fact that ideological models such as these ignore the complexity, variation, and rich diversity of human life at many levels... [Civilization III] conflates a civilization with a specific national or tribal identity and ignores questions of hybridity and diaspora such as those of African Americans or Jews... It transposes the many-layered quality of social life into an inflexible, reductive algorithm for "civilization"—a process not dissimilar to what Marx ists call reification, only updated for the digital age. (98) The game, then, mirrors the kind of world-sorting that Samuel Hun tington engaged in with his argument for a "clash of civilizations" and offers similar oversimplified modes of dealing with the challenges of glob alization and intercultural encounter. In coming years, says Huntington (1993), (two years before Civilization was released), the "great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural... between nations and groups of different civilizations... The fault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future" (22). The same kind of dualistic perspective informs Pogromly, released as a Nazi fundraiser in the late 1990s. Pogromly is modeled on Monopoly and invites players to move from a swastika as its starting point and "drives imaginary Jews around the board across squares marked with SS runes, concentration camps, gas plants, and a portrait of Adolf Hitler. It uses fake reichsmarks as currency and replaces the white-mustachioed capitalist of the original game with a skeleton dressed in a Nazi uniform." The game resembles another game from the 1930s, Juden Raus (Jews Out!), which involved "hunt ing down and concentrating Jews from a walled city at a collection point from which they would be deported to Palestine" (Nothnagle 2011). Another obvious example of first-person shooter religion is the Left Behind series of video games. Although the video game's interface does JUNE 2012 · 193</page><page sequence="14">FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER RELIGION not match the typical "first-person shooter" design and instead is a sort of "God game" (presented with a top-down visual perspective, with the player controlling many digital entities at once), the game nonetheless theologically matches the kind of dualistic encounter that typifies what I am calling first-person shooter religion. The Anti-Defamation League (2006) criticized the 2006 release of the first installment of Left Behind: Eternal Forces, claiming it was "based on the same intolerant theology embedded in the adult and children Left Behind book series, which fea tures goiy depictions of the annihilation of Jews and other non-Chris tians who refuse to convert at Armageddon." The video game Left Behind: Eternal Forces, says the ADL, "pits the 'good guys,' a Christian reli gious militia," against the "bad guys," who in the game are ironically called the "Global Community Peacekeepers" but are meant to resemble the United Nations as if led by the anti-Christ. As the ADL site describes it, "Ultimately, the game comes down to a choice of fighting—both materially and spiritually—against the forces of evil, or joining evil and losing." Taylor (2006), president of Tyndale House Publishers, has argued that the video game is "designed to be a classic battle between good and evil," and claims that the game "does not gratuitously depict vio lence or death." Nonetheless, the ADL harshly criticizes the video game's "tale of the hellish demise of non-believers," and rejects the claim of the series' coauthor, Timothy LaHaye, that the video game will "perpetuate positive values" (2006). The kind of religion represented in Left Behind: Eternal Forces and games like it is the same kind of religion that Bishop Spong finds "dan gerous," if comforting. And it manifests in every religion around the world, especially today when "security" and certainty are in short supply: Religion is a human social invention to keep insecurity in check because being human is a veiy insecure thing to be. We're self-con scious. We know we're going to die and we have to relate to that. ... Religion is part of our defense system against the radical insecurity of life. In order for religion to make you secure you have to make exces sive claims. You have to say that, "We are the chosen people," or "The pope is infallible," or "Our way is the only way," or "the Bible is inerrant." You have to make a claim that locks security up tightly. It doesn't work, but it's popular. (In Chellew-Hodge 2012) 194 · CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="15">RACHEL WAGNER Spong (2001, 53) argues similarly elsewhere that "the anxiety we once controlled by our conviction that the theistic God was alive, well, and in control is no longer [easily] holding" and "the emotional component of human life is increasingly unable to keep its sense of trauma and hysteria under control." The result, he says, is a kind of rigid fundamentalism and increasing "tribal" conflict among religions and within religions. The assertion of religion as a game is appealing since order, meaning, pur pose, and the notion of easily identifiable "winners and losers" is essen tial for some believers to provide comfort in a restless and changing world. Video games also respond to insecurity by providing temporary algorithmic order, the assurance of who to hate and to destroy and with whom to create productive alliances. Whether it is grounded in com puter programs or in theology, play has the ability to "create order, is order. Into an imperfect world and into the confusion of life it brings a temporary, limited perfection. Play demands order absolute and supreme. The least deviation from it 'spoils the game,' robs it of its [perfect] character and makes it worthless" (Galloway 2006, 29). Real life, says Spong, is conversely characterized by "radical insecurity," resistant to feeble attempts to gamify it since these attempts will always be trumped by the complexity of lived experience, by the necessity of real and unfold ing curious and respectful engagement with others. Transformative play Of course, not all religious people play their faith like a first-person shoo ter. Instead, some are engaged more in what game theorists Salen and Zimmerman call "transformative play." That is, some believers "actively engage with the rule system of a game, manipulating it in order to shift, extend, or subvert their relations with other players. Transformative social play forces us to reevaluate a formal understanding of rules as fixed, unambiguous, and omnipotently authoritative" (2004, 475). This sounds a lot like what Spong was talking about. Transformative play is also akin to what I call in Godwired religion experienced as "sandbox" rather than as "answerbox:" The religiously pluralist approach has a powerful analogy in a "many worlds" look at new media, in which many options for meaning co JUNE 2012 · 195</page><page sequence="16">FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER RELIGION exist for the self-in-process... Such open encounters, however, require a relaxing of one's rules and a relinquishing of the assump tion that there is only one sacred, one religious story-world, one mode of being. Fluid encounters require that we view religion as transmediated, co-created, existing across multiple platforms, and profoundly participant-driven. Within this view, religious worlds are things-in-process too. They are idea sandboxes in which we play, dis cover, explore, and most importantly, converse with one another as we build worlds together, and see each other as co-residents of our own lived world. The sandbox approach requires that we recognize the constructed nature of all religious belief. (Wagner 2012, 224) An example of transformative play is an interactive work designed by Wafaa Bilal, an Iraqi-born American artist and U.S. citizen, who left Iraq after being imprisoned and tortured under Saddam Hussein's regime. Bilal's piece Domestic Tension involved him confining himself, while observed via webcam, for thirty days inside a gallery space that enabled website visitors to shoot him remotely with a paint gun. Over the month long period, over 60,000 paintballs were shot as Bilal spent eveiy moment of eveiy day in fear of being hit by them. The goal of the piece was to "raise awareness about the everyday life of Iraqi citizens and the home confinement they face on a daily basis due to violence and surveillance" (Flanagan 2009, 236 to 237). Another example of transformative play, September 12th, was designed by game producer and theorist Gonzalo Frasca (2003). This simple web hosted game is a critical performance of media memory of 9/11 and offers players veiy limited options: to shoot or not to shoot at a village of civilians, while presumably aiming at terrorists. When the terrorists are missed, village buildings are destroyed and civilians are killed: "The embittered survivors become terrorists themselves" and eventually only they remain. The game, says Flanagan, has "no win-or-lose state." That is to say, there is no single achievable goal and so "there can be no obsta cles to that goal and so the game has no inherent conflict, except that which might arise in players themselves. Even a simple illusion of a win state cannot be maintained in a game that openly declares it has no end and can't be won. The lack of an opponent makes conflict or balance irrelevant." Nonetheless, says Flanagan, September 12th has some elements 196 · CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="17">RACHEL WAGNER of recognizable gameplay: "it has a clearly defined set of cause-and-effect actions... and the world [of the game] thoughtfully models a problematic situation that might also classify it as a game for social change." It con tains intentional "emotional content," drawing from the real world and making a simulative and issue-driven argument (240). According to Flana gan, Frasca wanted to demonstrate the "climate of resentment, ven geance, and hatred that can spawn new enemies" in real life. Drawing upon but transforming classic game mechanics, September 12th implies that other choices could be possible if the rules of the game were changed and thus argues that in real life too people are responsible for the rules they follow. For Flanagan, this means that players also "actively partici pate in creating meaning" and that to act through play "is fundamentally different from reading a static text or visual representation" (241). We are called to see ourselves in the choices we make in the game. September 12th is a "transformative play" because it is "a special case of play that occurs when the free movement of play alters the more rigid structures in which it takes place" (Salen and Zimmerman 2004, 305). We can imagine such a view applying to religious experience as well, in which received structures of authority, assumed rules about behavior, and declarations about texts are called into question in favor of a more emerging kind of practice. Galloway draws on Derrida to mark this kind of play as a "permanent state of nonwholeness, or non-totalization," a kind of "permanent agitation of the field, a generative motion filling in the structure itself, compensating for it, but also supplementing and sus taining it" (26 to 27). There is a paradox at work here. When experienced as part of a game, play creates order, in the ways that Johan Huizinga marked out over half a centuiy ago, in light of the simple fact that play can easily be understood as a set of rules. But as experimentation with existing systems, play takes existing order and sees what is possible. In this view, the system of religion can be seen as inviting players (or believ ers) to experiment with the rules: to stretch them, redefine them, test them, perhaps even reject them. Such a view would then invite new ritu als, perhaps those explicitly recognizing religion as a game and its rituals as hackable code. This perspective would consist of experiencing religion as a game through "the play of the structure, a generative agitation between inside and outside effected through the diegetic machine act" (Galloway 2006, 37). Salen and Zimmerman remark of games that "[rjules JUNE 2012 · 197</page><page sequence="18">FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER RELIGION are never as stable as they seem. Rules are made not only to be followed, but also to be broken, uncovered, negotiated, and refashioned into entirely new kinds of play" (2006, 12). Religion seems to possess similar elastic qualities. These kinds of new readings are happening in lived religion every day, as theologians challenge received traditions and call for fresh approaches to inter-religious encounter. Indeed, one could argue that this kind of fluid approach has always been a possible current of religious engagement and thus can be consciously re-embraced in today's complex world. Rabbi Blu Greenberg, echoed by Steven Jacobs, calls for a re-envisioning of Christian tradition that allows it to embrace the kind of flexibility and fluidity that certain strands of Judaism have manifest via the "open" textuality of the Talmud and the Midrash for centuries. She hopes for future Christians an inability to distinguish easily between the foundational texts of faith and those that represent ongoing and fluid interpretations of it, such that "Christians of the next two thousand years ought not to be able to read or teach or understand first century Christianity without these hermeneuti cal texts of quasi-canonical status; that in the year 2500, a Christian child standing at any point along the religious denominational spectrum will not and need not know where the Scripture leaves off and quasi-Scripture begins" (cited in Jacobs 2004, 141). Orthodox Jewish theologian Solomon (1991) argues similarly for such open engagement for Jews in interfaith encounter, in which believers admit that "we cannot set the bounds of truth; we must listen and tiy to learn, grow in experience and forge language, remain open to the world around us with its myriad people and ways, and read and interpret the words of scripture and sage constantly, critically, and in the context of our own age and society" (244). Hartman (1990), another Jewish theolo gian, argues similarly for an incompleteness in Jewish tradition that allows for openness of encounter with others, asserting that revelation "was not meant to be a source of absolute, eternal, transcendent truth. Rather, it is God speaking to human beings within the limited framework of human language and history" (247 to 248). Similarly, for Muslim theologian Mottahedeh, God can still be viewed as in charge of creation, even if rather than preprogramming a dualistic universe, God created a sandbox of diversity: "The message of Rumi is not some mealy mouthed multiculturalism. Rumi is a devout believer. Yet 198 · CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="19">RACHEL WAGNER he recognizes that others are not only free to disagree with him, but that God supplies the arguments of disagreements. Certainty is structurally impossible in the mundane realm" (42). The rules of the game, in such cases, are constantly under negotiation; "play" is unfinished, and God is always revealing Godself as humans wrestle with what it means to "play" with religious tradition. Dominique-Sila Khan argues, "(cjonfronted with reality, the factual and 'passive' plurality of Islam gives way to a dynamic pluralism that plays an important role at the social and economic levels. Traditional divisions become mere clichés that hardly coincide with the facts" (Khan 2010, 52). The assumption of winners and losers is replaced with transmediated, user-participatoiy religion. The game becomes flow. Speaking as a transformative voice within Christianity and echoing the work of theologians in Islam and Judaism, Spong calls for a move from a "childish" to an "adult" form of Christianity, a move that ironically is accompanied by a greater rather than a lesser degree of play: "We Christians today know that we possess neither certainty nor eternal truth... God surely cannot be contained in any religious system, nor can any people continue to live as if God were the tribal deity of their particu lar nation or group" (2001, 178). That is to say, Spong proposes that we do not play religion as a game of winners and losers and implicitly requests that we give up belief in a fully knowable anthropomorphic Programmer and instead involve ourselves in shared community and the deliberate construction of compassionate values. This is a different kind of play altogether. Spong argues that believers can "never capture the truth of God, all they can do is point to it" (2001, 178). Christians today "must develop new visions, propose new models, chart new solutions" (2001, 42 to 43). The church, he says, "must thus be reconstructed from the bottom up" (2001, 271). We must remember how to play for the sake of play. If religion is a game—or at least if it can be played like one—then it is also true that we can choose to play religion like a first-person shooter or we can choose to play it like members of a cooperative co-constructed and emerging world. It is impossible to argue by resemblances alone that gaming culture is changing religion, but it does seem that as a culture we are thinking more and more about what it means to build worlds, to con struct realities, to play with texts and traditions. Gaming is a large part of that conversation, and it is becoming more central every day to the way humans see themselves in the world. In a way, gamer theory comes at JUNE 2012 · 199</page><page sequence="20">FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER RELIGION the end of a long line of critical thinking about religion and culture that took on accelerated life in the nineteenth centuiy with Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud and is still being developed by many critics today. The impor tance of games and game designers to our culture today mean that we can no longer easily deny that human beings have always constructed the cultural practices that define our world. Whether or not there is a God, whether or not histoiy unfolded as our sacred texts say that it has, people have always used cultural materials to create systems, rules, and modes of behavior, to set goals and define behaviors in ways that simu late, or perhaps even create, the worlds of meaning that we inhabit. Ga mers understand that nothing is permanent, and virtual worlds are made and destroyed. This awareness is now affecting religious establishments as well, who find it increasingly difficult to maintain claims of ultimacy in their own competing rule-based systems. As Wark (2007) has quipped, "You are a gamer whether you like it or not, now that we all live in a gamespace that is everywhere and nowhere" (4). Conclusion Roger Caillois has argued that gaming culture exposes the sacred: "[S] ecrecy, mysteiy, and even travesty can be transformed into play activity, but it must be immediately pointed out that this transformation is neces sarily to the detriment of the secret and mysterious, which play exposes, publishes, and somehow expends. In a word, play tends to remove the veiy nature of the mysterious" (124). If Caillois is right, then the increas ing tendency to gamify contemporary life, even religion, may bring with it the double-edged awareness that play itself is a human construct, revealing human dreams and the rules we craft to pursue them. Poole (2000) argues that users wishing to be critically aware of gaming's effects "must learn the sequences the programmers have built in to [a] game— and, okay, there are hundreds of them, but that does not constitute free dom" (33). Freedom, instead, comes with the recognition of coded options and the rejection of those that do not promote human flourishing. Simi larly, if we view religion as a game, we can reject those rules that are harmful and replace them with others, recognizing that we are the pro grammers and we have control over the experiences we make. This kind of self-consciousness paves the way for constructivist modes of religious encounter. Maybe this is akin to what McGonigal means when she says: 200 · CROSSCURRENTS</page><page sequence="21">RACHEL WAGNER "We are living in a world full of games and gamers.
