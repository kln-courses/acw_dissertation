<plain_text><page sequence="1">Semiotic Transformability in All God's Chillun Got Wings Michael Basile Queen's College TO WHAT FORCES may we attribute the extraordinary theatrical and critical neglect of All God's Chillun Got Wingsl Although O'Neill considered it one of his most important plays, it received few stagings in his lifetime after its premiere in 1924. The Provincetown Players, for instance, failed to mount a single production from 1940 to 1970;1 and only one staging has been reported in the last fifteen years.2 I stake my proof of sustained theatrical neglect upon a perusal of production lists in the Eugene O'Neill Newsletter and Eugene O'Neill Review since 1977. The lists announce performances of O'Neill's plays in diverse corners of the globe, along with stagings by professional, amateur and college theatres in the United States. The dedicated reviewers cum detectives who contribute to this important feature deserve credit for their peripatetic efforts, although, for Chillun, those efforts have yielded only the 1982 production by the Columbia University Teachers' College?by default our modern theatrical paradigm. Happily, no single critical reading of the play bears a commensurate literary responsibility. A further review of the tables of contents, abstracts and current publication lists from 1977 to 1991 reveals exactly five articles which focus upon Chillun as the object of their study.3 By applying some rather basic quantitative analysis we discover that The Hairy Ape and The Emperor Jones, for instance, received seventeen and fourteen readings respectively. And the theatrical comparison demonstrates an even clearer dispropor? tion: in the fifteen years from 1977 to 1991, the Newsletter and Review report twenty six stagings of Ape and twenty four of Jones. If numbers do not tell the whole story, neither do they wholly lie. There has been, and still is, a general neglect of All God's Chillun Got Wings, while other plays of Eugene O'Neill's juvenilia continue to inspire important new interpreta? tions. I believe prejudice reigns as the cause of this past and current neglect?prejudice both racial and artistic. Although O'Neill insisted</page><page sequence="2">26 The Eugene O'Neill Review throughout his career that "the Negro question ... it must be remembered, is not an issue in the play" (qtd. in Gelb 536), his public felt otherwise. The publication of Chillun in H.L. Mencken's American Mercury prior to its theatrical premiere exposed the interracial marriage of the two protagonists and nearly incited the New York public to riot (Sheaffer 134 142). That was in May of 1923. Today, we, O'Neill's current public, do not feel threatened when a black man kisses a white woman, for in most American communities hardened racial prejudice has finally begun to crack. But while racial prejudice abates, artistic prejudice endures. We demand today much the same stylistic homogeneity of our theatre that was demanded nearly seventy years ago. Alexander Woollcott, reviewing the 1924 premiere, accused O'Neill of compromising "the old realism," which resulted in "a kind of half-hearted sublimation of the material world through which his figures move" (Gelb 556). That the American theatre had produced little else but realistic plays prior to 1924 may be offered as a partial excuse for Woollcott's narrowness of view. In our case, however, the seventy-odd-year retrospec? tive which should have enlightened us implicates us instead, for we maintain a stylistic homogeneity now that is nearly as rigid as Woollcott's was then. We yield only an academic recognition of some stylistic hetero, some stylistic "other" besides realism. Labeling it "expressionism" (among other things), we proceed to treat it poorly, housing it in dimly lit basements in Soho, and unofficially granting it "separate but equal" status with the realistic venue on the "Great White Way." Such segregated neighborhoods effectively restrict the passage of stylistically "mulatto" plays like All God's Chillun Got Wings. I label Chillun "mulatto" because it combines some of the more significant features of both realism and expressionism. O'Neill charts the mental and emotional disintegration of his female protagonist with an acute sense of what all post-Freudian generations would recognize as a natural progression into psychosis. By this, he aims to break through the imaginary fourth wall that separates actors from audience and to foster an emotional bond between the onstage and offstage worlds. On the other hand, O'Neill employs theatrical devices such as masks and anthropomor? phized sets to foreground the theatrical event as theatrical event, to create what Brecht called an "alienation effect," so that the spectator "is not fobbed off with an invitation to feel sympathetically, to fuse with the hero" (Brecht 9).4 Never entirely abandoning the naturalistic tradition, which did work toward a sympathetic response from the spectator (through a willing suspension of disbelief if you will), O'Neill nevertheless</page><page sequence="3">Michael Basile 27 sought liberation from a theatre "where most of the so-called realistic plays deal only with the appearance of things" (qtd. in Gelb 520). He wanted a "real realism" (Chothia 32-33) and turned, ironically, to the new expressionism to achieve it. Particularly in his early plays, O'Neill sought liberation from what he called "the dark age when the American theatre was still, for playwrights, the closed shop, star system, amusement racket" (qtd. in Chothia 20). His father's artistic ossification after several thousand performances in the lead role in The Count of Monte Cristo lent him intimate knowledge of the effects of this star system; and it was here, with an assault on the actor centric tradition, that his liberation of the American theatre began. Although O'Neill's early experimental plays drew upon the work of several European innovators such as Maeterlinck and Appia, All Gods Chillun owes a particular debt to the Englishman Gordon Craig and his theory of the Uber-marionette. Postmodern scholarship credits Roland Barthes with the death of the author, but it has had little to say of this much earlier assault on the actor by Gordon Craig's Uber-marionette. Early in his career, Craig expressed a clear distaste for actors, and so prescribed that "the actor must go, and in his place must come the inanimate figure?the ?ber-marionette we may call him" (Walton 74). Being the son of renowned English actress Ellen Terry, Craig had developed his disdain of the "star system, amusement racket" empirically, compiling evidence from what must have been the same sort of first hand experiences as O'Neill's.5 As Craig saw it, the theatre had become artistically barren, and he blamed that barrenness on the nineteenth century tradition which promoted actor over play. According to Jindrich Honzl, however, the dominating influence of the actor, so disturbing to Craig, demonstrates only an historically and culturally situated phenomenon, for each theatrical tradition evolves its own particular hierarchical relationship amongst various collaborators who participate in and shape it: We do not mean by this to prove that the text, actor, and director are auxiliary or dispensable factors that merely affect the balance of theatrical structure. We wish to show only that every historical period actualizes a different component of dramatic expression and that the creative forces of one factor can replace or suppress others without decreasing the strength of the dramatic effect. We could also prove that certain periods directly demand such shifts in the balance of the dramatic structure. ("Dynamics" 86)</page><page sequence="4">28 The Eugene O'Neill Review The commedia dell'arte, for example, depends almost entirely upon the actor and his improvisatory skills; no written script exists, and thus no playwright. On the other hand, the Elizabethan theatre developed through a dependence on the playwright and his text working in close collaboration with the actor. But an open air platform which employed no lighting effects, little scenery, and standardized, contemporary costumes had little need for a stage director. By the early twentieth century, however, Craig believed that the theatre demanded such directors, not only to unify the technological advances in lighting, scenery and sound, but also to speed the evolution of a new hierarchy that would breathe life into a moribund art form. He created himself the first stage director by subsuming much of the actor's interpretive license under his own aegis; and one of his most significant innovations to that end was his theatre of puppets. These puppets, manipulated by offstage personnel, would represent dramatic character. Anticipating Brecht's Verfremdung by a full decade, Craig's theatre of the ?ber-marionette went further than the mere alienation of the actor from the audience; Craig prohibited the subjective, empathetic response so distrusted by Brecht by eliminating the actor altogether. Although Craig's redistribution of power strikes me as somewhat extreme, I nonetheless share his basic contention: homo sapiens does not possess the exclusive ability to represent dramatis personae. Anything placed on stage?including the human actor?acquires the property of a sign and functions representationally for some other thing (Honzl, "Dynamics" 74). To cite a simple example, a large diamond on a character's hand may function as a sign for many possible things including wealth, ostentation, or a recent nuptial. (It will often function as all these and more, for sign value accrues by virtue of its placement within the dramatic context.) Whether the diamond be real or glass, the onstage sign value is not affected. The material inconsequentiality of the stage sign makes for its ultimate transformability, for, freed of its responsibility to function materially, it may then assume almost limitless semiotic value. But while sign value may accrue within the dramatic context, the dramatic medium requires only a few basic components. Most basic and most necessary is the human agent, but that agent may be represented by any number of the signs available in the theatre. Indeed, an actor playing the role of Hamlet is really an actor playing a man playing the role of Hamlet. Kevin Kline does not have a direct relationship with the fictional character Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, but "becomes, rather, a semiotic unit standing ... for the intermediary signified ['man'], i.e., for the class of</page><page sequence="5">Michael Basile 29 objects of which [he] is a member." Accepting the proposition that stage objects relate to "their signified classes rather than immediately to the dramatic world" helps clarify how "non-literal signifiers may perform the same semiotic function as literal ones" (Elam, Semiotics 8). Non-literal signifiers for dramatis personae may include masks, scenery, lighting, or Craig's puppets. If the human actor traditionally fills this function, traditions evolve and change, as we have seen; and the transformability of the theatrical sign provides the one indispensable tool for the evolutionary process. Eugene O'Neill possessed an innate understanding of the semiotic potential of the theatre, and in Chillun he employs it to establish the "real realism" of which he often spoke. And, like Craig before him, he employs it to assert a new hierarchical relationship with his actors. Curiously, O'Neill's most significant semiotic transformations occur not in the dramatic text proper, but in the paratext; that is, in pre-textual scenic introductions, and intertextual notes to the actors spliced between units of dialogue (Genette). The former are largely realizable in production; the latter, largely, are not. Throughout the play, scenic introductions evidence the playwright's firm hand as he attempts to demonstrate the overwhelming societal forces working against the interracial marriage of black Jim Harris and white Ella Downey. The fullest, most detailed effort occurs immediately before the marriage, when the stage set becomes anthropomorphized. Describing the urban New York neighborhood which surrounds the church where the marriage is being performed, O'Neill writes: "The buildings have a stern, forbidding look. All the shades on the windows are drawn down, giving an effect of staring, brutal eyes that pry callously at human beings without acknowledging them" (318). Arthur and Barbara Gelb champion O'Neill's precedent-shattering dramaturgy which included what they incorrectly call "abstract stage settings" (535). There is nothing abstract about the above stage setting; and a close examination of it will reveal its "concrete" function in the play. O'Neill, seeking to disrupt the dramatic structure in this scene, succeeds by offering the non-literal signifier "building" as representative of the class of objects "actor." In realistic theatre, stage sets are usually employed to replicate the geographical setting in which the action of the play takes place. Indeed, in realistic theatre, stage sets serve purely scenic functions. O'Neill, however, employs the set-as-actor, or as the agent, and not the place, of the action.6 His directions clearly dictate an anthropo? morphic rendering of commonplace architectural signs. Those backstage personnel entrusted with the responsibility of painting the backdrops for</page><page sequence="6">30 The Eugene O'Neill Review these sets must create buildings with "a stern forbidding look" and windows which appear like "staring, brutal eyes" The concrete function of this transformation of set into actor may best be understood by way of a dramaturgical analogy: O'Neill's set-as-actor serves his play much as the Attic chorus served Greek tragedy. Though his chorus remains mute, it effectively articulates a societal judgment on the fate of his two protago? nists. I believe the audience in the theatre would have little difficulty interpreting the harsh anthropomorphic signs of the stage set as a prediction of the dire consequences soon to develop from Jim and Ella's impending interracial marriage. If scenery may become actors, actors may become scenery: the transformability of the theatrical sign extends to all of the semiotic systems which combine to create dramatic structure (Honzl, "Dynamics" 85). Roland Barthes believes that "every performance is an extremely dense semantic act," and speaks of "a density of signs ... at once dense and extensive, simultaneous and successive" ("Literature" 260-264). Surely he is correct; however, the basic requirements of the theatrical medium remain mise en scene, or what Patrice Pavis calls "the confronta? tion of dramatic text and performance" (86). And O'Neill's innovations in Chillun concern just this confrontation. When O'Neill semiotically transforms the architectural signs of the New York tenement so that they may represent dramatis personae, he questions not only this traditional signifier-signified relationship, but others as well. Actors do appear in this scene, but when they do they assume physical and facial attitudes that we are meant to feel are anything but human: "people ... pour from the two tenements, whites from the tenement to the left, blacks from the one to the right. They hurry to form into two racial lines on each side of the gate, rigid and unyielding, staring across at each other with bitter hostile eyes" (319). The mask-like expressions dictated by these paratextual directions disrupt our expectations. People appear, but they seem more machine than human. By inhibiting the actors' naturalistic presentation of body and facial gesture, O'Neill dehumanizes them. Their mask-like rigidity approaches architectural stasis?in contrast to the scenery, which appears to "move." Indeed, O'Neill said that Chillun should be performed by actors in masks, save for those seven playing the larger, speaking roles (Cole 68). But he frequently attempts to mold and stabilize the facial expressions of the major characters as well. The boxer Mickey acquires "a typical 'pug's' face, with the added viciousness of a natural bully" (306). Jim is described as "keeping his attention concentrated only by a driving physical effort which</page><page sequence="7">Michael Basile 31 gives his face the expression of a runner's near the tape.... [H]is eyes have an uneasy, hunted look" (331). And later in the same scene, when Ella's psychosis manifests itself in all of its horror, O'Neill notes that "a startling transformation comes over her face. It grows mean, vicious, full of jealous hatred. She cannot contain herself but breaks out harshly with a cruel, venomous grin" (337). Soon after, nothing but her face appears on stage, as "her head is thrust out at the side of the portieres. Her face is again that of a vindictive maniac" (337). Not the character Ella, but the disembod? ied, dehumanized masklike face (or, if O'Neill is successful in his efforts, face-like mask) utters the final imprecation in this terribly painful scene. After she cries out "Nigger!", O'Neill specifies that "the face disappears." Craig had said in "A Note on Masks" that "Drama, which is not trivial, takes us beyond reality and yet asks a human face, the realest of things, to express all that. It is unfair" (Walton 21).7 The use of masks in Chillun and other early plays testifies to O'Neill's similar artistic goals, for what is his "real realism" but Craig's symbolic elevation of life "beyond reality"? Yet masks, however artistically justified, may also serve political ends. In the scenic introduction discussed above, the hostile crowds represent a universal statement on the intransigence of racism and not the accumulated individual bigotries of each particular character. Therefore, masking these performers?as O'Neill wished?appears a sound and appropriate artistic decision. Masks quite obviously deprive the actors of much of their customary kinesic control, for kinesic signs are those involving bodily and facial gesture. Since he wanted masks to "get across the abstract drama of the forces behind the people" and not merely "the bromidic, hypocritical defensive double personality of people in their personal relationships" (Gelb 594), I would agree that he succeeded in this instance. Additionally, he provides no dialogue, thereby entirely prohibiting the possibility of any paralinguistic contributions by the actors that would inappropriately individualize his scenic statement: without words there can be no disturbing variances in pitch, volume or tone. By assuming control of those semiotic systems which traditionally evolve during performance, O'Neill has realigned the hierarchy among theatre collaborators. Leading the siege on the actor-centric tradition in America, he strove to contain the excesses of performance under the newly ascendant collaborative power of playwright and stage director. Nothing more nor less than the evolution of traditions, as Honzl would say. Yet evolutions, particularly in their earliest stages, sometimes receive unexpected acceleration from those who cannot be content to sit and wait.</page><page sequence="8">32 The Eugene O'Neill Review While many of O'Neill's efforts at realignment seem artistically justified, others seem less so. I speak particularly of the superfluity of motivational directions to his actors, a superfluity noted by many before me.8 Spliced within, before and after nearly every unit of dialogue, these paratextual intrusions aim to program those semiotic signs which cannot be controlled from the page and must be allowed to evolve in performance. What is at issue here is the relationship between the dramatic text and the performance text, and the essential question must be: what can and cannot be effectively translated from printed page to theatrical produc? tion?9 Sets may be painted, and actors may be masked. Creative use of makeup and nose putty may even convey the "typical 'pugY face" that O'Neill demands of the actor playing Mickey the boxer. But O'Neill's highly specific notes to his actors, which surround and nearly asphyxiate actual dialogue, do not, in large part, translate into performance. I choose to examine the scene, the first in Act Two, in which Jim and Ella return from France and are confronted by Jim's militant sister Hattie, though any scene would easily demonstrate a comparable informational disjunction between what the reader of the dramatic text is privy to, and what the audience at a performance is largely denied. Hattie symbolizes black racial pride, but pride that has denuded her of her humanity. She has been consumed by race quite as thoroughly as Ella, and O'Neill places them in dramatic counterpoint.10 Therefore, their first and only dramatic confrontation might be expected to provide some theatrical sparks. And it does. But much the best part of the emotional conflagration remains on the page. I provide below the dialogue alone, without paratextual additions: ELLA. I remember playing marbles one night?but that was on the street. JIM. Don't you remember Hattie? HATTIE. It was a long time ago?but I remember Ella. ELLA. I remember. But you've changed so much. HATTIE. Yes, Fve grown older, naturally. Fve worked so hard. First I went away to college, you know?then I took up post-graduate study?when suddenly I decided I'd accomplish more good if I gave up learning and took up teaching. But this sounds like</page><page sequence="9">Michael Basile 33 stupid boasting. I don't mean that. I was only explaining? ELLA. I didn't know you'd been to school so long. Where are you teaching? In a colored school, I suppose. HA I I IE. Yes. A private school endowed by some wealthy members of our race. ELLA. Then you must have taken lots of examinations and managed to pass them, didn't you? HAT LIE. I always passed with honors! ELLA. Yes, we both graduated from the same High School, didn't we? That was dead easy for me. Why I hardly even looked at a book. But Jim says it was awfully hard for him. He failed one year, remem? ber? (327-328) On the basis of this dialogue, the audience would undoubtedly sense an emotional friction between the characters: Hattie's black pride surfaces when she speaks of her educational and vocational successes; and Ella's stereotyping?"Where are you teaching? In a colored school, I sup? pose"?would succeed as effective contrapuntal prejudice. But a good deal of the theatrical power in the scene devolves from the playwright's notes spliced between the spoken remarks?notes which the audience cannot read. O'Neill instructs the actress playing Ella to deliver her first line "queerfy?with a frown of effort"; Hattie accompanies her first words with gesture and movement as she comes "forward with a forced smile" and "holds out her hand" As the emotional tension builds, the paratextual directions grow more and more explicit. Ella takes Hattie's hand, "looking at it with ... queer defiance"; Hattie is "stirred to hostility by Ella's manner" and is directed to deliver her speech about her educational successes "in a tone which, as if in spite of herself, becomes bragging" When she finishes she "suddenly checks herself9 and is "ashamed, and stung by Ella's indifference." Finally, explicitness nudges absurdity when the playwright's notes aim for a near total circumscription of the actresses' creative choices. Ella must have "an indifferent superiority in her words that is maddening to Hattie," and she later "turns and smiles at Jim?a tolerant, superior smile but one full of genuine love" It must be evident that</page><page sequence="10">34 The Eugene O'Neill Review actresses cannot play these directions. Indeed, many performers confronted with such a script immediately erase or blot out all such possible impediments to the motivational license they must exercise in translating written words into stage action. Therefore, if the actor cannot (and often will not) attempt to convey this important information, and the audience in the theatre cannot read it on the page, the disjunction between dramatic text and performance text becomes manifest.11 Roland Barthes has said that if authors wish to "come back" into their texts, they may do so only as "guests" ("Work" 161).12 He might have added that some never intend to leave in the first place. In Chillun, O'Neill's stage directions, by which he aims to circumscribe the kinesic and paralinguistic choices of his actors, fail in almost direct proportion to their quantity and specificity. Conversely, some of his other paratextual efforts serve effectively to elevate the personal issues in the play to a symbolic statement on the intransigence of societal racism. I believe that he succeeds when he succeeds?and that he succeeds even when he appears to fail. The control which he seeks over his actors eludes him, and his failure therefore provides performers with enormous creative opportunities as they "flesh out" the rugged contours of the spoken dialogue. It is easy to understand just why professional actors love to play O'Neill: marionettes they cannot and must not be if the full psychological realism of his characters is to be discovered. Additionally, the expression istic elements in Chillun provide substantial creative opportunities for all other members of the collaborative team including, among others, director, scenic designer and makeup artist. Indeed, the stylistic heterogeneity of All Gods Chillun, which may have been the cause of its past neglect, should now be the inspiration for its immediate reengage ment by theatre professionals and scholars alike. Inducement for theatre professionals I have noted above. For scholars, O'Neill's early experi? ments with the transformability of the theatrical sign not only mark the palpable seam which exists on the border between the theatrical traditions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; they also provide a practical, working appraisal of theories of his European contemporaries.</page><page sequence="11">Michael Basile 35 NOTES 1.

All further references to the periodical will appear as EON, and all future references to its successor as EOR. 2. See "Recent and Forthcoming Productions," EON 6.3 (Winter 1982): 48. 3. See "Works Cited and Consulted" below for those most relevant to this discussion. 4. Brecht's Verfremdung is predated by the Russian Formalists' ostranenie, or, loosely translated, "making strange." The purpose of both is to defamiliarize the audience (or reader) with that with which he or she is habitually familiar by exposing the structure of the play (or poem) as a meaningful element in its own right. Although Brecht's work was derivative to a certain degree, it nonetheless provided an important point of departure for the Prague Linguists. And this discussion is indebted to their work. 5. It would be a mistake to equate the acting careers of James O'Neill and Ellen Terry, for Terry realized the artistic promise that escaped O'Neill. But legitimate artists are few, and are invariably surrounded by hacks, so it is likely that both of these "sons of the theatre" habitually experienced the sad spectacle of inflated egos strutting and fretting about the stage. 6. See Kenneth Burke's A Grammar of Motives for his highly useful dramaturgical pentad of act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Although he does not mention Chilluny he conducts an interesting analysis of Lavinia in the last scene of Mourning Becomes Electra when he claims that O'Neill "threatens to dissolve drama into behaviorism, as Lavinia ceases to be an agent in becoming a merely automatic Response to a Stimulus" (247). Of course the question before us is O'Neill's manipulation of agent and scene, though I propose a future treatment of Electra that will profit from Burke's discussion of O'Neill's manipulation of agent and purpose. 7. See page 66 of Toby Cole's Playwrights on Playwriting in which Cole quotes from O'Neill's "Memoranda on Masks" in The American Spectator, Nov. 1932: 3. O'Neill said that "at its best, [the mask] is more subtly, imaginatively, suggestively dramatic than any actor's face can be." It is well known that O'Neill read Craig's periodical The Mask. Once again his indebtedness to Craig appears unchallenge? able.</page><page sequence="12">36 The Eugene O'Neill Review 8. I turn again to EON and EOR and wish to cite four sources which support my contention that O'Neill's stage directions cause much consternation. In 13.2 (Fall 1989), Robert Cooperman states in an article entitled "Marco Millions: O'Neill's Other Comedy" that Marco "must be the only play in history with stage directions for the audience." He alludes to the epilogue when Marco strolls though "the 'surprised' playgoers to a waiting limousine" (37). Secondly, I would like to cite Sheila Hickey Garvey's "Anna Christie in New Haven: A Theatrical Odyssey," 14.1-2 (Spr./Fall 1990): 53-70. In this important backstage look into the rehearsal process of a major theatrical production, Garvey brings attention to several instances when the actors felt it necessary to alter or completely disregard O'Neill's stage directions. In 6.2 (Sum./Fall 1982), Colleen Dewhurst, one of the modern theatre's most celebrated O'Neill interpreters, pleaded: "Look at O'Neill's stage directions. You're supposed to laugh, cry, I don't know what?all in three seconds.... that's impossible" (52). Finally, James Fisher reports in "Eugene O'Neill and Edward Gordon Craig" 10.1 (Spr. 1986): 27-30 that Gordon Craig himself objected to the superabundance of stage directions in Lazarus Laughed on the grounds that it circumscribed the actor too greatly. Craig sometimes wanted it both ways. 9. Attempts to unify the semiotic methodologies of theatrical and dramatic communication have proven illusive. For anyone interested in a f?rther exploration of this problem, I highly recommend Keir Elam's Shakespeare's Universe of Discourse (Cambridge University Press, 1984). His work, though seminal, still fails to consider performance semiotics from the performer's perspective, but rather subordinates gesture, movement and intonation to the exigencies of the written text. 10. O'Neill said that Ella was a woman who "could not love [her husband] as a woman would a man, though she wanted to, because of her background and her inherited racial prejudice" (qtd. in Gelb 535-536). 11. Many actors do not, of course, entirely avoid stage directions. They read them and assimilate them into their performances. It remains unlikely, however, that the information contained in motivational stage directions to the actor can ever be translated from text to stage in as pure a form as many playwrights would like, no matter how compliant the actors. But perhaps playwrights intend stage directions for their readers as much as for their actors. Chillun represents such a possibility, for it had been published in the American Mercury months before it was staged at the Provincetown Playhouse. 12. See Patricia A. Suchy's "When Words Collide: The Stage Direction as Utterance" (79) for this citing of Barthes, and for the many important questions she raises about stage directions and authorial intention.</page><page sequence="13">Michael Basile 37 WORKS CITED AND CONSULTED Barthes, Roland.
