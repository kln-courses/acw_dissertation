Acta Insti- tuti Romani Regni Sueciae, Series Altera, I. Lund: Gleerup (Leipzig: Harrassowitz), 1939. Paper. THESE studies in celebration of Nilsson's sixty-fifth birthday are distributed over a wide variety of subjects. The title of the volume invites one to seek for a common characteristic, but it is scarcely possible to find any, save perhaps in the general effect of a technical competence which abjures the humaner interests, and stands out the more starkly because of the difficulty too obviously ex- perienced by many of the contributors in expressing themselves in languages other than their own. Among the articles dealing with literary subjects one may note a sober examination by B. Axelson of the thirty-four lines which appear after Juvenal vi. 365 in the Bodleian MS. Dissenting from Leo, Housman, and the rest, Axelson decides that these lines are spurious. His reasons are cogent, and he is at pains to dissociate himself from the type of argument favoured by U. Knoche, who, in Philologus 1938, p. 196, also condemned this passage. In another useful article E. Ltfstedt dis- cusses the difficult use of the genitive of the gerund in Tacitus, Annals, xiii. 26, xv. 5, 21; he produces many passages from other, chiefly later, sources to show that this use of gerund for infini- tive is not so unparalleled as used to be supposed. E. Nachmanson studies the 'adverbial partitive genitive' in Greek. It is common enough, as, for example, with verbs of eating and drinking, but a very thorough consideration of the usage sheds unexpected light on some hard passages in the Hippocratic writ- ings. A. Svensson produces well thought- out statistics to show that as a rule the article is much less frequent in the messengers' speeches than elsewhere in Euripides; here is further evidence of Euripidean 'archaism', or at least of a tendency to imitate the epic style. The articles of C. Hieg, who argues against the current view that the second plead- ing of the Verres trial is fictitious, and of A. Nygren on St. Augustine's re- habilitation (under Neoplatonic in- fluence) of the word 'amor', ought not to be overlooked. Many articles are concerned in the main with matters of mythology and of religion. These include F. Blatt's publi- cation of a new text of Migne, Patrologia Latina, x. 733-50, an apologetic work whose author (he holds) cannot now be identified; B. Olsson on threatening and abusive language towards the gods; S. Eitrem on an 'aretalogy' of Apollo, first published in Hermes, 1920, p. 188; A. W. Persson on the prehistoric origins of Hellenic mythology; and a few articles on Scandinavian folk-lore. There is a noteworthy effort by E. Arbman to draw a distinction between 'mythic and religious thought'. Religious thought asserts a supernatural power acting directly upon nature, mythic thought describes this supernatural action as indirect, attributing to it in graphic and anthropomorphic manner the use of external machinery such as mortals use. Arbman applies his distinction to Homer; anthropomorphic descriptions belong to the poet speaking in his own person, while his characters are as a rule content with the bare statement of the</page><page sequence="2">214 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW gods' intervention. That many myths, though by no means religious, imply a background of religious belief is a sound thesis; but one does not see why Arb- man wishes to reserve the epithet 're- ligious' for the purely colourless and abstract. There is no discussion of the comparative validity to be assigned to these varieties of 'thought'. Rather Arbman appears to assume that each is uniformly invalid-that is, if one is to take seriously his incidental assertion of belief in an empty and mythical philosophy of 'nature' as an 'all- embracing' system. On this article one would like to have had the opinion of J. Lindblom, who makes a similar dis- tinction in an essay contrasting Job and Prometheus: the O.T. idea of God (as, e.g., unchangeable) is 'a deeply religious one', whereas the Aeschylean idea is 'typically mythological'. Another ar- ticle which makes for some clarification of principles in this sphere is E. Briem's 'Totemism and Animal Worship'. He has little difficulty in showing with the help of Frazer that animal worship is not derived from totemism (which is not a religion), and takes occasion to correct a statement of Nilsson's that totemism was 'certainly the basis of the Egyptian religion'. Most of the contributions which are concerned with history and archae- ology-the largest class-aim at the description or classification of finds. Some, however, are of more general interest, e.g., A. Boethius on Vitruvius as a critic of Augustan architecture, and A. Wifstrand on the Greek titles of Roman emperors. The thirty-seven articles are followed by a minutely detailed bibliography of Nilsson's pub- lications. J. TATE. University of St. Andrews.</page></plain_text>
