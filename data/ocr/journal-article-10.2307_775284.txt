<plain_text><page sequence="1">Berlin's New National Galerie Alfred Neumeyer The opening of the new National Galerie in Berlin in September 1968 represented an event of international significance. Politically it was a demonstration of the will of the peo- ple of West Germany to maintain the conti- nuity of this city as the center of cultural life in Germany. Through the glass walls of the building the eyes take in the vicinity of "the Wall," divider of the two Germanies. An en- tire cultural center is going up in this pre- viously trackless No Man's land, wiped out during the bombing war, which now includes a Staatsbibliothek, various museums and the famous concert hall built by Berlin's most imaginative architect, Hans Scharoun. Architecturally it is a milestone because it is not only Europe's most recent large museum but probably also the last impressive documentation of the Bauhaus style, built by Mies van der Rohe.1 Art-historically it is an event because it provides a representative home for the field of nineteenth and twentieth century art where previously two sites served this purpose on a temporary basis: the left wing of Schloss Charlottenburg for the National Galerie and the "Galerie des 20. Jahrhunderts,"' sup- ported by the city of Berlin, in the Kunstbi- bliothek. Director of the new National Gal- erie is Werner Haftmann, known to every reader of the ART JOURNAL. He had never previously held a governmental position and therefore represents a choice as unorthodox as it is ingenious. The three aspects, political, architectural and art-historical, contain complex problems. The politically problematic aspect is, of The author, a frequent contributor to ART JOURNAL is Professor Emeritus at Mills Col- lege and Honorarprofessor of the Freie Universitdt in Berlin. N course, the uncertainty of the status of Ber- lin, interpreted in one way by the Western Powers and Western Germany and in quite a different way the Communist block. It stands for an affirmation of the values of creative life against the accidental nature of political history. But the inner ear easily translates the whirring of the air conditioners into the sound of rumbling tanks. Nowhere does one feel today more intensely this precarious situ- ation. The National Galerie is a moving monument to the hope for peace. The architecturally problematic nature of the new museum is comparable to that of Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum. Both are architectural achievements on a high order but do not serve their specific pur- pose very well. If a community is willing to accept such a structure as an architectural monument for its own sake-as Berlin expres- sively has done-then one should concur gratefully with such a decision and all it im- plies. In the case of Mies van der Rohe the museum administration as well as the City of Berlin wished to avail themselves of a great architect who had been driven out of his country by the Nazi government and thus to honor and recognize him. The world would be poorer without such a problematic piece as Michelangelo's staircase in the Laurentian Library just as it would be poorer without the Guggenheim Museum and the National Galerie. Both, the Wright and the Mies buildings are born from universally applica- ble formal ideas (snail house and glass cube); interchangeable as to their purpose, inflexi- ble in their perfection and demanding the highest flexibility on the part of the users. Mies van der Rohe had already prepared a comparable plan for the Bacardi Rum Com- pany in Santiago de Cuba, going ultimately back to the design for a 50 X 50 foot square house of the year 1950/51. The completely symmetrical National Galerie is based on a module of 3.60 m. X 3.60 m. and raised on a platform which visually lifts it above the plane on which it is located. The impression is nearly solemn, due to the perfection of proportion and the purity of materials. For its position on a pedestal it has been com- pared to Gilly's designs for a monument for Frederick the Great and to Schinkel's plans for a museum in Berlin. I doubt whether Mies van der Rohe thought of these antece- dents with whom he has in common, however, the classical gesture. Yet it is "classical" with- out Greece and without the Renaissance, merely by the purity of its materials and the visualization of its proportionate relations. If one thinks about it, it is not even a building in the conventional sense. It is an enclosure of glass made expressive by its skeleton of steel and its socle of stone. It is reductive ar- chitecture, a mathematical formula, a geo- metrical idea made solid. It rejects chance, surprise and any sort of anthropomorphic as- sociations. This is its strength and also its limitation. It is doubly fascinating because looking through the glass walls one sees to the north and nearby Stfiler's Mathdiikirche of 1864, the only remaining building of the old Tiergar- ten section, amusing by its contrast of Italian- ate historicism. One cannot escape the feel- ing that such confrontation takes on the na- ture of an architectural exhibition for its own sake. One can even extend the perimeter of the architectural exhibition and included the nearby Philharmonie of Scharoun, built 1960-1963, the anti-Bauhaus creation par ex- cellence. There the inner space of the concert hall and its foyers and galleries dictates the irregular outside, a very ugly outside, so it seems to me, but enclosing a breathtakingly imaginative amphitheatre with cascading, ir- regularly faceted sections of seats. It demon- strates by its very existence that architecture has since gone beyond the principles of Mies van der Rohe, which by this fact enhances the classicity of the museum's structure. But back to the Mies building. The overhanging steel roof becomes empha- -- - - -- A . . .. . National Galerie, Berlin, exterior.

X 65 m. extension rests on eight steel columns of which, however, only the outer four are bearing while the inner ones, sheathed in green Tinos marble, have no function but contain all the service parts necessary for ventilation, electricity, conducting of water from the roof, etc. This arrangement indicates that the structure carries the mantle of func- tional simplicity but is not more functional than many other buildings. In fact, it is less so. And here we touch upon one of the ob- vious difficulties of Mies van der Rohe's cre- ation. The glass enclosed upper hall is ulti- mately a reception room, unfit for permanent installations. It provides for flexible partition boards hanging from the casetted ceiling and it can well display monumental pieces of sculpture. There is so much light that the glass walls have to be covered-according to need-with huge drapes which contradict to some extent the aesthetic intention of the glass membrane. Furthermore, it achieves its monumental effect by sacrificing half of the building for this purpose and thus makes it unusable for permanent display. It can only be utilized for changing exhibitions, of which the first, dedicated to Mondrian, lent itself especially well for display because Mondrian's aesthetics form a common ground with Mies van der Rohe's ideals. One is-as it were-ex- posed to the arcanum of hidden but felt har- monies. Yet the music of the spheres and museum display are and remain two different things The display area is on the lower story, in- sufficient by far for the large number of art works available. It has one open glass front toward the sculpture garden, the rest depends on artificial light. All walls-according to the architect's wish-are white and one cannot en- tirely escape the feeling of being cut off from the world of light and air, glorified by the painters of the nineteenth century, whose works are so largely represented in the display. Here, however, I want to refrain from judge- ment because at the time I saw the building the pictures were not yet installed. But what- ever the excellence of presentation may be, one definitely has the feeling of being in a basement while in the modest display of Schloss Charlottenburg the pictures lived in harmony with the light and the world outside of the windows. It seems to me that works of art belong to the organic world and suffer from the aestheticism of extreme isolation. What the visitor will find in the new Na- tional Galerie is impressive. By no means does it exclusively show works of German art. It is a National Gallery in a wider sense, col- lecting and exhibiting the best of modern art worthy to be owned by a cultured nation. This task is made difficult by the fact that the Hitler government removed all non-na- turalistic works of art from Van Gogh to Pi- casso, either destroying them or selling them in Switzerland. There exist therefore great gaps, truly tragic losses, many of which can never be filled, either because such pictures are no longer available or because they are shockingly expensive. Werner Haftmann has already begun with an impressive start, sup- ported by the acquisitions of his predecessors Reidemeister and Jannasch (Galerie des 20. Jahrhunderts). If there is anyone who can do the job with aplomb then it is Haftmann, due to his widespread connections with artists and dealers, his vast and thorough knowledge of the field and his exuberant energy. The museum has published an attractive cata- logue which offers a good idea of what there is and what is missing. It begins with the Ger- man Classicists and Romanticists, with Runge and Friedrich, whose pictures by their inti- mate size and subdued color, look best in rel- atively small rooms and in daylight. The Berlin masters Schinkel and Blechen lend a specific local character to this large and representative group. From there it leads to Menzel who finds his largest representation anywhere, here in Berlin. No student con- cerned with the rise of naturalistic painting in Europe can bypass this collection. Feuer- bach, Boecklin and Martes demonstrate the continuation of the longing for the classical- Mediterranean spirit in German art. Leibl and Thoma and their respective circles lead to the masters of German Impressionism: Corinth, Liebermann and Slevogt. The French representation is modest, especially when compared to the internationalism of the contemporary group. For the nineteenth century the division of Berlin with its two National Galeries is doubly painful if one thinks of the French masters and especially of the C.zannes in the Eastern zone of Berlin. Gauguin and van Gogh (except for one early picture) are now entirely absent but Edvard Munch is represented by ten pictures includ- ing the frieze of eight paintings for the Max Reinhardt Theater in Berlin, acquired in 1966. The reconstruction of German Expres- sionism is proceeding with great speed and it remains astounding what has been accom- plished. There are for example, no less then ten paintings by Max Beckmann. If one real- izes that there exists also in Berlin the charm- ing small "Brficke" Museum going back to a donation by Schmidt-Rottluff, then the stu- dent of Expressionism will feel rewarded in- spite of evident gaps (such as the "Blaue Reiter"' group). The near absence of Kandin- sky and Picasso is especially lamentable be- cause besides their own great contribution, their presence elucidates the development of the following decades. With energy and en- thusiasm Haftmann is working on the docu- mentation of these last decades which he has so comprehensively covered in his books. There exists also a large group of sculpture, much of it outdoors and some of monumen- tal size, but I have not yet seen them. While as a collection it is projected toward the future, it should not be forgotten that the old National Galerie has a tradition going back to 1861, moving into a representative building on the Schlossplatz in 1876. Its rise coincides with the rise of the German empire and it therefore carried the inscription "Der Deutschen Kunst.'" Today it serves as the Na- tional Galerie of Eastern Germany. Its his- tory is described in the excellent posthumous book of P. O. Rave Die Geschichte der Na- tional Galerie, published by the New National Galerie on the occasion of its opening. It also honors the author, who for a long time had been connected with this institution. Different from the "Museums of Modern Art" which usually start their survey at the end of the nineteenth century, the National Galerie in Western Berlin permits a more comprehensive picture beginning in 1800. It thus reveals the deeper roots of modern art and demonstrates at the same time the total break with the tradition of the nineteenth century. 93 .............~.. ..................... .............i~~ii!,ii~+i?+!i?,+...
