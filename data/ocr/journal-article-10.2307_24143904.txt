This might involve questions and answers, reports, discussions, and many other ways to get the child to use the words. At the same time, care should be exercised that the other students profit from this by listening. Explanation by the Teacher Many times a day in the biology class, a broad concept must be explained by the teacher, es pecially with the type of student who ordinarily has great difficulty in generalization. Care should be taken here that the explanation is used as a vocabulary review.

Planetarium to bring the night skies into the classroom Use of Pupil-Made Materials at the teacher's command. This is an extremely valuable technique, since many of the students truly enjoy the work of making charts, graphs, illustrations, cages, aquaria, etc. For example, a student who makes a chart to explain the whole concept of the word "photosynthesis" will most probably not forget the broad meaning of the word. Emphasis on Concept Building As stated earlier, the type of pupil described here has a definite handicap in that he cannot generalize too effectively. Since this is an im portant ability to have, we continue to try to improve his competency. A word such as "para site," when carried to its fullest meaning, can involve a concept that includes almost a complete understanding of the whole interrelationship be tween plants and animals. Both the importance and the difficulty of this purpose of education are at a high level. Wide Reading This is a relatively easy technique. Both di rected and non-directed readings are done by most students in the area of biology. Magazines, newspapers, and books are utilized continuously. Obviously, the teacher must continue to empha For information, write: size vocabulary building on the part of the stu department s dents when pursuing this activity. SPITZ LABORATORIES, Inc.

Informal and Formal Word Study The study of words, both directly and inci dentally, is quite important in an area where many words are derived from Greek and Latin. For example, the idea that "phyte," when used as a suffix, means plant, is an extremely useful bit of information. The study of words within words, prefixes, and suffixes will help the child to achieve an ability to derive meanings from context, which is important in his reading ability and understanding. CONCLUSION Finally, it is recommended that students be made aware that the study of a new subject also requires growth and development in the use of a technical vocabulary. It is through this means that information on a new subject becomes more meaningful to them.
