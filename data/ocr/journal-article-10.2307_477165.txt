<plain_text><page sequence="1">198 REVIEWS Dante the traveler, whose " childish " thought is pleasantly accepted by Beatrice (Par. 3. 26)? p. 124 (speaking of the griffin in the Paradiso) " He knows that Scripture condescends to human powers by attributing feet and hands to God (Par. 4.43), yet he himself presents no anthropomorphic God. Even the Holy Spirit as a dove, however Biblical, has no place in his poem. In representing divinity, he concedes to human weakness as little as he can. Is is likely that he abandons such a practice to typify the Second Person of the Trinity as a mythological draft animal? But the poet is in the reader's hands; each man may interpret the allegory as he will." pp. 169-170 (speaking of the uniformity of appearance of the in- dividuals among the redeemed) " After Saint Benedict has spoken feelingly of his order, the traveler, with courtesy but yet as though not much in- terested in what has been said or in the lights, asks if he can see the saint without his brilliant disguise (22. 60). The latter politely answers, then turns back to the topic interrupted by the traveler's irrelevant inquisi- tiveness. Are we to suppose the questioner wearied by the monotonous lack of individuality in the appearance of the redeemed? " No reviewer could possibly, in the space at his disposal, list more than a few of the questions he raises or the interpretations he proposes. I also doubt that any one teacher would agree to any more than a small portion of them in most cases. Be that as it may, I am sure that the book will be received as a worthy and useful addition to the vast resources already available. I hope that it will have its place in every library of standing and also in that of every teacher of Dante's works. Reading it and pondering over it will be a profitable and rewarding experience for the teacher and the specialist, as well as for every other person truly interested in what Dante has written for the centuries to read and meditate upon. WM. MARION MILLER Miami University THEOPHIL SPOERRI: Dante und die europdische Literatur. Das Bild des Menschen in der Struktur der Sprache. Stuttgart: W. Kohlhammer, 1963. 209 pp. This is neither a historic nor a romantic nor a scholastic nor a neocritical but an existential introduction to the Divina Commedia. It is existential insofar as Spoerri in the midst of a behavioristic world of relativities shares with Dante the belief in absolute values coming from a Supreme Being who can at any time break directly or indirectly into the life of an individual and lead him through a cleansing process to a sincere knowledge of self, to purity and truth. This happens as main event to the wanderer, poet and Christian Dante in the central scene of the Earthly Paradise. Here the blinded sinner, after having witnessed in the prison of</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 199 Hell the horror of godlessness and tasted in the fresh air of the high mountain the endless varieties of the shameful weakness of passion, is deeply humiliated, nay annihilated, by Beatrice's wisdom and charity so that he finally finds freedom, peace and bliss in understanding the reve- lation: " E' n la sua volontade e nostra pace." This, says Spoerri, is not only poetry, it is confession, revelation, dialogue, breaking through egocentric projections into the absolute presence of the " Other one." Taking this insight as a measurement not only for the individual but for any earthly community as well as for philosophy and art, Spoerri uses particular passages of the Commedia to make digressions into the political, literary and ideological history of Western civilization, to show the cultural heights occurring always when the social phaenomena, e.g. the civic community based on personal relations and responsability, appear in conformity with Dante's views (Pascal, Vico), and the low ebbs when such phaenomena, e.g. egocentric retreat, pseudo-community of regiment- ation, are in conflict with them (Boccaccio, Descartes). Spoerri by such di- gressions finds an occasion to include in nuce his earlier excellent literary studies on Ariosto, Tasso, Racine, Pascal and on French versification in this best and third of his books on Dante. Spoerri, seventy three years old, professor emeritus, one of the last living pupils of Jules Gillieron, comes also back - as the subtitle suggests - to his earliest love, language. And one has to admit that, with his selected examples illustrating the function, possibilities and limitations of Dante's language, he gives us as much at least, or even more, as far as qualitative verbal values are concerned, than the extensive illustrations of T. S. Eliot, Ernst Robert Curtius or even Luigi Malagoli. It actually is with Dante's imagery that Spoerri explains the tonality of each of the three cantiche. In the Inferno there are images concerning leaves driven around by the wind, starlings flying in disorder, the whirlwind of desert dust, all symbols of lack of a clear direction; in the Purgatorio there a mountain has to be climbed, there are messengers with an olive branch, frightened doves leaving their food, hurrying sheep trying to find their way, all symbols of the vibration of the soul in view of an effort of " directio voluntatis "; in the Paradiso there is motion and splendor of jewels, sparks, eyes, the soaring flights of the lark, the stork, the falcon, the crow, the eagle and the dance of lights and voices, all symbols of burning charity and intel- lectual clarity. Spoerri proves by his approach that language itself with its delicate shades causes the depth of the thought and he quotes Merleau Ponty, Brice Parain and Martin Heidegger to confirm his own conviction. He follows closely the relationship between structure and poetic language (i.e. " tex- ture ") throughout the Commedia and extends his thesis to Dante's verse whose hendecasyllabic structure shows 828 forms of texture, thanks to the musicalisation of poetic rythm since the troubadours, the laudesi, nay the ecclesiastical hymns, particularly the free sequences. But the culmination of this double principle of structure is motivistic: the human features of</page><page sequence="3">200 REVIEWS Christ in one of the three divine circles at the end of the mirabile visione. Spoerri's structural explanations are unusual. When Dante enig- matically swoons speechless before the fate of Francesca, the solution comes on the top of the Purgatorio where Dante appears entangled with the voluptuous crowd around Forese Donati and there Dante acquires knowledge of self; says Spoerri: " The deepest meaning of poetry is guidance by the Spirit and divine judgment." Literary confrontations are made in a new and personal way. Dante is bound to all sacred traditions, his exile is his tragedy, while for Petrarch exile is " cosa da nulla "; for Dante beauty is secularized sanctity, for Pe- trarch it is sensuality. Dante's Hell is avarice sex, power condemned, Balzac and Proust's comedies humaines try to accept all these vices since to them the sources of life are poisoned. Nietzsche still understood Dante's problem that a purifying effort is the life of the spirit which healthily threatens and censures easy going manners, but Croce already is uncapable of understanding the Paradiso at all, since he cannot see the integration of things from the distance of a divine perspective; and he misreads thd dialogue of loving reciprocity which again is well understood by the religious insight of Martin Buber and which crystallized in unique fashion in Dante's word creations: inluiarsi, intuarsi, inmiarsi (Par. IX). The horizontal encounter of men in loving solidarity is the precondition for the vertical invasion of God. Spoerri is sincere enough to say that Dante's poem, which he quotes in the respectable German translation of Karl Vossler, has only a slim resonance today within the three small realms of the absolutes which are left; the idealistic spirit, the art and the churches. Elsewhere matter has killed the spirit, and drives, believed deterministic, have killed the effort of love. In Purgatorio XXVII, 142, Spoerri finds " the historical (!) transition from an institutional concept of authority to the autonomy of man founded in the immediate guidance of God " (124). Dante's poetical conversio furthermore is watered down by its rapprochement with other historical (!) kinds of " detachement," which among themselves are entirely different: Guillaume de Poitiers, Nicholas Cusanus, St. John of the Cross, the nuns of Port Royal, existentialism and the philosophy of Zen. One may regret that the programmatic attempt at an identification of Dante's " conversio " through Beatrice with concrete modern revival experiences, even that of Frank Buchman, founder of the moral rearmament, draws away from Dante's poetry. This procedure of Spoerri is not only a " metabasis eis to allo genos." from poetry to life, typical also of the hunters for a historical figure behind DXV. And yet I prefer even this to other Dante interpretations which may be more sophisticated, more scholarly, more adapted to a " modern reading," more selective by the helpless sup- pression of decisive elements, and I tink of names like Singleton, Montano, Fergusson, Croce. But nowhere, except perhaps in Ulrich Leo. I find</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 201 a real interior relationship to the Commedia and a sincere appreciation of the deeper meaning of its message than in this Dante interpretation of Theophil Spoerri. HELMUT HATZFELD Catholic University of America DINO BIGONGIARI: Essays on Dante and Medieval Culture. Firenze, Leo S. Olschki, 1964, pp. 181. Il caso di Dino Bigongiari ?, se non unico, certamente raro nel mondo della cultura accademica cui appartenne. Professore alla Columbia Uni- versity, salvo una breve interruzione, per oltre un cinquantennio (1904- 1955), la sua produzione di studioso appare quantitativamente molto esigua, se non addirittura minima. Eppure la vastitA e profonditA della sua dot- trina non solo gli permise di abbracciare nel suo insegnamento sia le lingue classiche che quelle romanze, sia la storia che la filosofia, ma come dice Henry Paolucci nella affettuosa introduzione al materiale raccolto in questo volume, gli guadagn6 il rispetto e l'ammirazione di studiosi come " William L. Westermann in the field of ancient history, Lynn Thorndike in the history of science, Richard Mc Keon in ancient philosophy, Paul O. Kristeller in Renaissance philosophy, Lindsay Rogers and Franz Neumann in public law, Kurt von Fritz in classical philology, Marjorie Nicolson and Harry Morgan Ayres in the modern literatures (p. 6), senza con- tare l'espressa gratitudine di decine e decine di studenti ai quali prodig6 senza riserve i frutti del suo sapere. " Colleagues sent a stream of students to him annually - dice sempre il Paolucci - including from time to time, doctoral candidates badly in need of the substance of an unwritten book. If the rush of words was too great for an unretentive memory, he would not hesitate to write the whole matter out, sheet upon sheet, to be carried away for restudy and eventual incorporation in a dissertation " (p. 7). Oltre ad illuminare la personalitA dello studioso, questi cenni offrono la chiave per la comprensione dell'opera in esame, il cui scopo precipuo e quello di presentare in volume scritti sparsi in riviste e altrove. Anzich? ricercare delle idee conduttrici che diano unitA a questi Essays, sarA quindi da passarne in rassegna il contenuto per vedere dove risieda la vera forza dello studioso e quale sia il contributo da lui recato agli studi medievali, e in modo pili particolare agli studi danteschi. 11 volume si apre con una breve presentazione del pensiero politico di Dante (" The Political Doctrine of Dante," pp. 1x-24). Lo scritto risente del carattere divulgativo cui deve la sua origine (si tratta dell'introduzione scritta dal Bigongiari per la traduzione inglese del De Monarchia, pubbli- cata da H. W. Schneider presso la Liberal Arts Press, New York, 1949), e malgrado la chiarezza dell'esposizione lascia un po' perplessi per l'assenza di qualsiasi cenno alla problematica sorta intorno al trattato.
