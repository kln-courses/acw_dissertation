<plain_text><page sequence="1">LUCRETIUS AND THE STOICS by D. J. Furley Lucretius' poem contains several attacks on rival theories. I believe that their target or targets have often been mistaken by the editors and commentators, who fairly constantly refer particular passages to the Stoics. Cyril Bailey (1947, p. 15)* says: "Above all, the beliefs of the Stoics . . .are set aside, sometimes with argument, often merely with a contemptuous delirum or desipere est." Elsewhere in Bailey's commentary we find many remarks like this: "What is doubtless most in Lucretius' mind - the Stoics" (p. 782); "There can be little doubt that he has now passed in mind. . .to the Stoics" (p. 949). Similarly in Munro's commentary: "No doubt the zeal with which the Stoics maintained this doctrine added vehemence to Lucretius' denunciations" (p. 554); "The whole of this reasoning is doubtless directed against the Stoics" (p. 577). And in Robin's commentary likewise: "mais il s'agit sans doute des Stoiciens" (I, p. 235). I am persuaded that the editors have been too quick to banish doubt about this matter. In this article I shall examine the passages which have been declared to be directed against the Stoics; I hope to show that some of them are certainly not, and most of them probably not, attacks on the Stoics, and that none of them is necessarily aimed at the Stoics. This may sound tiresome ly destructive. It seems necessary to be destructive, however, since the assertions of the editors continue to exercise influence, and in the course of the investigation some more positive results may be achieved. To identify the "anti-Stoic" passages I have used the indices in Munro's edition and in the commentary of Ernout and Robin. Giussani's edition has no index; Bailey's index recognizes nothing between "sterility" and "style". I have gone through the latter edition with as much care as my patience allowed, but there may be allegations which I have overlooked. I have also studied the text of Lucretius on my own account to see if there might be allusions to Stoic theories which the editors have missed. A. i. 449-482. Properties and Accidents After establishing that there exist atoms and void, Lucretius asserts that there is no third thing to be discovered (430-448). Everything that you can name is a compound of atoms and void, or else a property or accident of these (a coniunctum or an eventum) (449-458). Thus time * All modern works cited are listed in the Bibliography at the end of the article. 13</page><page sequence="2">does not exist per se, independently of things which change in time (459-463). Thus also the argument that, because we can still speak of Helen raped (Tyndaridem raptam. . .esse) or the Trojans defeated, and because that rape and that defeat cannot now be the accident of Helen and the Trojans since they are long since dead, therefore the rape and the defeat are per se entities, is quite invalid. For they are accidents of a certain quantity of atoms and void, which still exist (464-482). "Doubtless he dwells at such length. . .on this argument, because the stoics taught that all states, qualities, virtues, etc., were body" (Munro, p. 376). But this cannot be right. Lucretius is not protesting against the wrong inclusion of states, etc. in the category of bodies, but against setting up a third category, other than bodies and void. Bailey asserts only that the last two points are anti-Stoic ("combatting his natural opponents, the Stoics"). (1) The Stoics held that time is a per se entity, and Lucretius argued against them. This is false, for two reasons. First, the same point about time is made in the same context in Epicurus' Letter to Herodotus §§ 72-3, and no-one is likely to make a serious claim that the argument there is aimed at Zeno. Second, the Stoics did not hold that time is a per se entity, but defined it in much the same way as Lucretius did (cf. SVF 1. 93 Zīļvcov i&lt;ņr'&lt;jt xpôvov eivai Kiviļcjecos SiáciTrma. Also SVF 2. 509-21). Bailey quotes a little snippet from Sextus to the effect that for the Stoics time was a kgcô* ocùtó ti vooúnevov irpayna; but the context shows that this was an inference by Sextus, not a report (e£ ou ÔrjÀov yiyveTai õti. . .õoÇáÇoucri, SVF 2.331). (2) The second point supposed to be anti-Stoic is the point about the rape of Helen. Robin finds in this an attack on an alleged contradiction in Chrysippus' theory of time (for which see Plutarch De Communibus Notitiis chapter 41), but does not explain at all clearly how he under- stands Lucretius' argument. The argument was correctly understood by Bailey, who realised that its target could not be as Robin had said, but found another Stoic target for it - a theory that events or occurrences had independent existence and were indeed bodies. He thought there was evidence that the Stoics held such a theory in some sentences in Seneca's Epistulae ("quod acci- dit alicui. . .corpus est", 117.7). But this will not do. Seneca's purpose in the passage is to argue, against Stoic orthodoxy, that, since sapientia is a good, sapere must also be a good. This has nothing whatever to do with the independent existence of res gestae , which is Lucretius' target. No other evidence has been produced to show that the old Stoics believed in the inde- pendent existence of res gestae. It is quite likely that the whole passage is not directed against any opponents. It may be that Lucretius, or his source, is dealing with possible objections to the Epicurean theory of coniuncta and eventa which had not in fact been raised by any particular group of people. If a definite target must be suggested, however, it is Plato's Academy which comes to mind, since it was the Platonists who argued from the possibility of talking about past events to the existence of certain per se entities. According to Aristotle Metaphysics A 9, 990 b 14, there was an argu- ment for the existence of Ideas which had the technical name "kottct rò voeïv ti cpdapevToç". B. i. 615-626. Infinite Divisibility Part of Lucretius' argument for the existence of minimae partes of atoms is as follows (I have commented on the whole argument more fully in Two Studies in the Greek Atomists , to be published later this year by the Princeton University Press). If there were no minimum, both the smallest and the largest bodies would consist of infinitely numerous parts. Hence the whole universe and the smallest parts of the universe would contain an equal number of parts. Lucretius held this to be unthinkable. 14</page><page sequence="3">The Stoics were among those who believed in the infinite divisibility of matter, and accor- ding to Plutarch De Communibus Notitiis 1079 a, they were apt to say that "a man does not consist of more parts than his finger, nor the cosmos than the man". But there were other possible targets for this polemic. Anaxagoras, who is to be attacked by name and at length two hundred lines further on, said: "Of the small there is no smallest, but always a smaller, since what exists cannot cease to exist; also there is always a larger than the large. And it (sc. the large) is equal to the small in number. . ." (fr.3). In Physics I 5, 204 a 20 ff., Aris- totle argues that it is impossible that the infinite should exist as an actual being, for in that case any part of it you like to take will be infinite, and it is impossible for the same thing to be many infinities. The Epicureans may have adopted this argument from Aristotle and turned it against his own theory of infinite divisibility - for they were impatient with his careful distinc- tion between potential and actual division. Again, the pseudo-Aristotelian On Indivisible Lines , 968 a 2 ff., mentions an argument which is quite similar to these lines of Lucretius, and this treatise is usually thought to be concerned with debates that belong to a pre-Stoic age. There is some slight reason for thinking that Chrysippus aimed to answer this Epicurean argument. For he pointed out explicitly that the theory of infinite divisibility does not entail that a finite thing consists of an infinite number of parts ( SVF 2.482), and it appears from the Plutarch passage quoted above that he avoided saying that two infinites are equal. C. i. 635 -704. Fire Nearly 300 lines of Book i are devoted to attacks on the theories of matter put forward by Presocratic philosophers. Heraclitus, Empedocle s , and Anaxagoras are named. Lucretius expresses admiration for Empedocles, though he was wrong about the four elements; and he is fairly gentle with Anaxagoras. "But the attack on Heraclitus," Bailey remarks (p. 709), "is more vehement and bitter, doubtless because his theories had been adopted. . .by Epicurus' rivals, the Stoics." (As a matter of fact, the Empedoclean theory of four elements was adopted by the Stoics too; so this argument is not a strong one.) Lucretius objects that a single element cannot generate such varied things as there are in the world. By supposing that fire varies in density, all you can get is weaker or stronger fire, if parts of fire retain the character of the whole; but in any case people who say this also deny the existence of void among things and therefore cannot explain variations in density at all (645- 664). If on the other hand they say that fire is extinguished and thus changes its nature, then they fall foul of the argument set out earlier in Lucretius Book i (215 ff.), according to which the elements must persist through change since otherwise everything will in the end be reduced to nothing (665-674). Now what reasons are there for thinking that this attack is directed not only against Hera- clitus but also, and chiefly, against the Stoics? Only Heraclitus is named. However, Lucretius does frequently use the plural instead of the singular to refer to his opponents in this passage, and he says that Heraclitus was only the leader of the fire-men. But the plural certainly need not refer to the Stoics, since plural Heracliteans were well known in the doxographical tradition from Plato onwards. Bailey claims that rarefaction and condensation as the mode of transfor- mation of fire is well attested for the Stoics, but badly attested for Heraclitus; the truth is not so simple. There is good evidence that Heraclitus held this doctrine in the report of Theophrastus ( Physi - corum Opiniones fr. 1; see Kirk, pp.22 ff.). The Stoic position is more obscure. They certainly held that fire was in a sense the primary element and that it was transformed into the other ele- ments by cjúcrracjis and reconstituted by xúaiS (SVF 2. 413). It is perhaps significant, however, 15</page><page sequence="4">that they chose these words, rather than ttukvcocjis and ¿paícoatg. Their meaning is more like solidification and liquefaction than condensation and rarefaction; changes of quality or state were explained by variation in the tension of the pervading pneuma ( SVF 2. 379 etc.), which might cause the parts of a substance to occupy a different volume but was not synonymous with such a process. But they did admit that when the world was changed into pure fire at the peri- odic conflagrations, a great expansion would take place; they admitted the existence of the void outside the cosmos to allow for this expansion ( SVF 2.597, 609, 618, 619). Since they did not admit the existence of void inside the continuum of matter, and yet held that the conti- nuum could expand, from an Atomisťs viewpoint their theory was open to the objection brought forward by Lucretius. Bailey maintains that Lucretius' objection cannot be directed against Heraclitus, because Heraclitus was too old (i.e. pre-Parmenides) to deny the existence of void in things. This is an argument which deserves some respect, but I think it can be answered. Lucretius treats the three pre-Socratic theories, of Heraclitus, Empedocles and Anaxagoras, as rivals to atomism. He sees them, I believe, as three variations on a single theme - the theme of continuity, the contradictory of atomism. Empedocles and Anaxagoras both denied the existence of void in the universe; Lucretius would naturally take Heraclitus, as a typical mortisi, to be denying it too. So he begins (635): "Those who thought that fire is the material of all things, and the universe consists of fire alone" (i.e. no void), "are evidently far from the truth. Their leader was Heraclitus. . ." I conclude that the evidence does not show that this passage must be directed against the Stoics. The strongest reason for thinking that it is - the deliberate mention of the denial of void in the cosmos and the assertion that this is incompatible with condensation and rarefaction - turns out to be illusory, because Lucretius could well have criticized Heraclitus on this ground, and because the Stoic theory of the transformation of fire appears to have implied condensation and rarefaction only incidentally. It is important to add, too, that there is no trace here of the characteristic Stoic doctrines about fire - the distinction between creative and destructive fire, ekpyrosis , and the divine properties of fire. D. i. 782-802. The Four Elements Part of Lucretius' criticism of Empedocles' theory is directed against the idea that the four elements change into one another. Empedocles himself did not believe in such a change; so the editors have wondered whom Lucretius had in mind. "It may be," Bailey writes, "that there was some sect of the 'four -element' thinkers who adopted this extreme form of the 'trans- formationist' theory." It is odd that Bailey did not think of mentioning Aristotle as being a member of such a "sect", for he has surely at least as good a claim as "Lucretius' usual oppo- nents, the Stoics". E. i. 1052-1113. Geocentric Cosmology After arguing that the universe is infinite, Lucretius continues with an attack on the geocen- tric cosmology. Illud in his rebus longe fuge credere, Memmi, in medium summae quod dicunt omnia niti. (1052-3) There is some doubt about the construction of this sentence. Giussani took "quod dicunt" to be dependent on "in medium summae"; "do not believe this, Memmius, that all things tend 16</page><page sequence="5">towards the centre of the whole universe, as people call it." Ernout agrees with Giussani. Munro says that "quod dicunt" is parenthetical and equal to "id quod dicunt": "do not believe this, that all things tend towards the centre, as they say." Bailey says that "quod dicunt" depends on "illud" and governs the noun clause: "do not believe what people say, namely that all things tend towards the centre." Against Munro he quotes another instance where "illud" is picked up by "quod" in the next line; and he dismisses Giussani's interpretation without deigning to say why. But as a matter of fact the interpretation of Giussani and Ernout, taking "quod dicunt" as modifying "medium summae", is syntactically as reasonable as any other interpretation, and makes good sense; for Epicureans denied that there is such a thing as the medium summae. On balance I slightly prefer this interpretation. It should be noticed first that the subject of "dicunt" is not identified by Lucretius. None of the editors shows any doubt that the Stoics are meant. Lucretius continues: atque ideo mundi náturám stare sine ullis ictibus externi s ñeque quoquam posse resolvi, summa atque ima quod in medium sint omnia nixa, ipsum si quicquam posse in se sistere credis, et quae pondera sunt sub terris omnia sursum nitier in terraque retro requiescere posta, ut per aquas quae nunc rerum simulacra videmus. (1054-60) In 1042 ff. he has explained the Epicurean theory that the world remains relatively stable because the material which would be lost to it through the expulsion of atoms by internal colli- sions is kept in its place by an infinite series of atoms colliding with the world from outside. So now he warns Memmius against believing that it can remain stable, sine ullis ictibus exter- nis , for a different reason - that the summa atque ima all tend towards the middle. The Epicu- reans believed that the downward fall of atoms provided a datum in the infinite universe; so the summa here are the things at the top of the world, on our side of it, and the ima are things on the under side. Lucretius continues by contrasting the paradox of the geocentric theory with the common-sense of Epicureanism. The geocentric theory asserts that the heavy body of the earth and the things on the earth remain where they are because they are mutually sup- porting; those on our side of the world are sustained by the opposite pressure of those on the other side. In that sense it says that "a thing can stand on itself". The Epicurean relies on observation that heavy things fall in just one direction - downwards; the geocentric theory says that heavy things rest upside-down on the under side of the earth, like reflexions in a lake. (I have followed Lachmann's punctuation of this section. Modern editors, except Martin, read it slightly differently.) Next, Lucretius describes the ridiculous antipodes in more detail and advances his objec- tions to this theory (1061- 1082); the text is mutilated, but there is not really much doubt about its contents. First, he objects that since the universe is infinite it cannot have a centre; second, that if it had a centre there would be no reason why anything should come to rest there, because heavy bodies go on falling through any space whatever, and it makes no difference to call one piece of space the middle; there is no place such that heavy bodies lose their weight when they arrive there, and there is no part of the void whose nature is to resist rather than to yield. These objections are clearly framed from an Epicurean point of view. Lucretius has already proved that void exists (i . 335 ff.) and that the universe is infinite (i. 951 ff.); he simply uses these two propositions to criticize his opponents. There is certainly no reason to think that 17</page><page sequence="6">either of them was asserted by his opponents. But these objections make one thing clear about the rival theory: it depended on the notion of the centre of the universe as a whole, not some other centre. Now comes a surprise. Lucretius continues with some more polemic against the geocentric theory, and now he points out that his opponents after all do not maintain that all bodies are centripetal: praeterea quoniam non omnia corpora fingunt in medium niti, sed terrarum atque liquoris, umorem ponti magnasque e montibus undas, et quasi terreno quae corpore contineantur; at contra tenuis exponunt aeris auras et calidos simul a medio differrier ignis. . . (1083-8) Earth and water are centripetal, air and fire are centrifugal. Strictly speaking, this is incon- sistent with lines 1053 and 1056, which assert that omnia niti in medium. One might argue that the opponents aimed at in 1083 ff. are different from the omni -centri petal i s ts aimed at in 1052 ff.; but no-one will wish to choose that way out. The fact that the opponents are an anonymous third person plural in line 1083, without any new specification, tells against it, and so does the conjunction praeterea. The use of the word omnia in 1053 ff. is easily explained. Lucretius was thinking there of the queer theory of the antipodes, and by omnia he meant not only the things on our side of the earth, but also things on the other side. The text continues with two more features of the rival theory: atque ideo totumcircum tremere aethera signis et solis flammam per caeli caerula pasci, quod calor a medio fugiens se ibi colligat omnis, nec prorsum arboribus summos fronde scere ramos posse, nisi a terris paulatim cuique cibatum. . . (1089-93) At this point the text breaks off. MS. O leaves a gap of eight lines, obviously corresponding to the eight mutilated lines 1068-1075. The two additional details are these. First the stars twinkle in the sky and the sun's flame is nourished because all the heat or fire which rises from the centre collects in the place of the stars and the sun; and second, some related point explains how the high branches of trees get enough nourishment from their roots in the earth. What was in the lacuna? The mst-clause beginning in 1093 lacks its verb, the quoniam - clause beginning in 1083 lacks its apodosis. The text continues with a ne-clause which lacks an antecedent main clause. This might be different from the apodosis of the guoniam-c lause, or it might be identical with it. These elements must be supplied, but there is room for more as well. For our present purpose all that matters is this: the ne-clauses beginning in 1102 and continuing to 1110 cannot easily be construed in any other way than as consequences drawn by Lucretius from the theory of centrifugal air and fire, with the intention of refuting the theory. The logic of the whole passage might be this: Since our opponents assert (1) that air and fire are centrifugal, (2) that the stars and sun are kept going by centrifugal fire, (3) that trees grow upwards somehow because of centrifugal air and fire. . .perhaps also (4), (5), etc. in the lacuna - therefore, on these assumptions, there is a danger lest. . . ne volucri ritu flammarum moenia mundi 18</page><page sequence="7">diffugiant subito magnum per inane soluta et ne cetera consimili ratione sequantur neve ruant cae li tonitralia templa superne terraque se pedibus raptim subducat et omni s inter permixtas rerum caelique ruinas corpora solventis abeat per inane profundum, temporis ut puncto nil exstet reliquiarum desertům praeter spatium et primordia caeca, nam quacumque prius de parti corpora desse constitues, haec rebus erit pars ianua leti, hac se turba foras dabit omnis materiai. (1102-1113) A few lines earlier, as we saw, Lucretius applied some Epicurean ideas to the rival theory: the rival theory assumes that the centre of the universe has great significance, but on Epicurean principles there is no centre. Similarly in these last lines Lucretius' objection does not seek to punish an internal inconsistency in the rival theory, but to show that from it together with some Epicurean principles most disagreeable consequences would follow. The danger in the rival theory is that air and fire, being centrifugal, will disperse into the vast void. On Epicu- rean principles it would then follow that the whole world would disintegrate; for the Epicureans believed that the heavy earth remains stable because it is essentially unified with the rest of the cosmos. There is no direct evidence from the fragments of Epicurus for this view, but there is a strange and unpalatable passage in Lucretius v. 534-563 which explains why the heavy earth does not crash through the bed of air and fire on which it rests. We can omit the weird dynamics for the present: all that matters is that Epicureans believed the world to remain as it is, suspended in space, because it is a single unity and because the weight of the earth is somehow modified by its unity with the lighter elements which surround it. The point is just this: if the air and fire are going to vanish outwards into the vast void, then the earth will start to collapse under our feet. It does not matter where the weakening begins; wherever it begins, the unity of the world is broken and it will rapidly disintegrate. The editors have been mistaken in their interpretation of this passage. It is true as they say that Lucretius ignores the opponents' tenet that earth and water are centripetal, so that on their theory there would be no danger of the earth and water following the air and fire away from the centre into the vast void. But Giussani, and Bailey who offers a translation of Giussani without acknow- ledgment, are wrong when they say that the danger is not of the earth's precipitating itself downwards but of "scivolandoci", slipping away, from under our feet in the form of atomic dust. Lucretius is not substituting mysteriously centrifugal earth for his opponents' centri- petal earth: he is canvassing the peculiarly Epicurean fear of the earth's falling downwards through space. We have now, if this analysis is correct, dissociated the rival theory from the Epicurean elements which Lucretius employs to criticize it. The rival theory asserted that there is a centre of the universe, and that our world is held together by the centripetal tendency of the elements earth and water, so that in the antipodes people walk as it were upside-down. The sun shines in turn on our side of the earth and on the antipodes. Fire and air are centrifugal, and this fact accounts for the stars' light and the sun's heat and the upward growth of trees. * * * Whose theory was this? Not the Stoics', in spite of what the editors say. Admittedly on this occasion they are able to quote evidence, some of it persuasive. Munro quotes Stobaeus' report of Zeno ( SVF 1.99): "All the parts of the cosmos have motion towards the centre of the cosmos, and especially the parts that have weight. The explanation is the same, both for the stationary position of the cosmos in the infinite void, and for that of the earth in the cosmos . . . 19</page><page sequence="8">Not every body has weight; air and fire are weightless; but these also are somehow drawn towards the middle of the whole sphere of the cosmos, and they take up their position towards its circumference, since they are naturally centrifugal (ávcocpoua) because of having no weight." At first sight, this looks just like the target theory: earth and water are centripetal, air and fire are centrifugal, and the cosmos is held stable because of the equal balance all round. But if we look more closely, we can see that Zeno' s theory in fact contains the answer to the Epicurean criticism. Zeno said, it seems, that all the elements are somehow "drawn towards the centre", including air and fire. He did not say that air and fire have lightness (kouçottis) but only that they have no weight. This is surely the answer to the Epicurean criticism that if air and fire are positively light, there is nothing to prevent them vanishing outwards into the infinite void. Zeno answered that they are not positively light: they occupy the outer regions of the spherical cosmos because they have no weight whereas the middle is occupied by elements that have weight; but they do not fly off into outer space because there is no reason why they should, and they are joined continuously with the rest of the cosmos. The evidence for this Stoic theory is of course confused. Stobaeus reports, as we saw, that according to Zeno air and fire are naturally centrifugal. This is not strictly true: if Zeno* s theory was as we have just described it, it said that air and fire are neither centripetal nor cen- trifugal. But the confusion is easily explained: air and fire are naturally centrifugal compared with earth and water, and the doxographers, unconscious of the importance of the distinction, might well forget that they are centrifugal only in the presence of earth and water. We must dwell a little longer on the evidence for the Stoic theory, because its interpretation is not generally agreed yet. There are some more scrappy assertions of the doxographers in SVF; but the key passage is a longish section of Plutarch's De Stoicorum Repugnantiis. Two chapters are relevant. In chapter 42 he asserts that Chrysippus held two contradictory views about air: he held both that it is centrifugal and light, and that it is neither heavy nor light. The significant thing is that Plutarch can quote chapter and verse for the latter, but he has to work hard for the former. He deduces it in fact from two propositions of Chrysippus: that fire, being weightless (not light), is naturally centrifugal, and that air is akin to it. Chrysippus, then, did not say that air and fire are light: if he had said so Plutarch could have had his contradiction without working for it. Chrysippus said that air and fire are weightless, and are therefore centrifugal when in the presence of earth and water. In chapter 44 Plutarch asserts that Chrysippus held both that all bodies tend towards the centre of space (a concept which Lucretius attacks in our passage), and that space, being infi- nite, has no centre (which Lucretius accepts). Again, the significant thing is that he can quote chapter and verse for the latter, but needs a subtle argument to prove the former. Chrysippus, he says, asserted that nothing that is infinite has "a beginning, a middle, or an end" (1054 b). He often said it was impossible and contrary to nature to think that bodies naturally tend to the middle of space, because there is no difference in the void which would attract bodies to one place rather than to another; the cause of the centripetal motion, he said, is the arrangement of the cosmos. In other words Chrysippus was arguing for something like the Newtonian theory of gravity (as Professor Sambursky is quick to point out). His view was that all the matter in the universe has a natural tendency to congregate at its own centre. He went on to argue, as Plutarch and others tell us, that this centripetal tendency is responsible both for the durability of the cosmos and for its stable position in space. For the other half of the contradiction, namely that all matter tends towards the centre of space , Plutarch goes to a statement by Chry- sippus that if matter were not arranged round the centre the cosmos would be destroyed. This 20</page><page sequence="9">would follow, says Plutarch, only if he were speaking of the centre of space. But Plutarch is wrong; what Chrysippus probably meant was that matter must be evenly distributed or balanced round its own centre: the cosmos would be liable to destruction if the orderly concentric arrange- ment of earth, water, air and fire were somewhere disrupted. This is probably the sense of the passages in S VF which say that for Chrysippus the light and the heavy are in balance. We may take it to be established, then, that in Chrysippus* cosmology the four elements were naturally centripetal, and that the centre in question was the centre of the four elements themselves taken as a whole, not the centre of the infinite void. There is no reason to think that any of the early Stoics dissented from this. But this cosmology is obviously not the target of Lucretius' criticism, but the answer to it - and an answer totally ignored by Lucretius. The Epicureans say that it is nonsense to imagine there is a centre of everything, to which the heavy elements tend, because there is no centre in the infinite void; Chrysippus takes the point, and says that nevertheless the elements are centripetal; they tend to their own centre. The Epicureans say that if air and fire are centri- fugal there is nothing to stop them flying away ad infinitum ; Chrysippus answers that they are only relatively centrifugal, so that once they have reached the outside of the heavy elements there is no reason why they should go any further. So we return to our question: whose is the cosmology attacked by Lucretius? The last ditch defender of orthodoxy might reply that it is after all a Stoic cosmology, not that of Chry- sippus, but of a later Stoic, say Panaetius or Posidonius. But the burden of proof has now shifted on to the defence; and there is no convincing evidence for a change in Stoic theory about these points. * * * If not the Stoics, then who? Aristotle is the obvious suggestion. Aristotle constructed the geocentric cosmology before the Stoics, and as everybody knows his theory of motion inclu- ded the proposition that earth and water are centripetal and air and fire centrifugal. Moreover, the centre in question is defined as the centre of "the whole" (De Cáelo B 14, 296 b 13), and the Epicureans would naturally interpret this to mean everything that there is - on their own theory, the infinite void and the infinitely numerous atoms. Bignone suggested the Aristote- lian theory as the target for Lucretius' criticisms years ago, in his lone but lengthy protest against the universal cry of Stoicism. But there are difficulties and obscurities which were not removed by Bignone, and it may be that we can improve the situation. The main difficulty is this. If Lucretius' target was the cosmology of Aristotle, why is there no mention of Aristotle's triumphant innovation, the fifth body (or the first body, as he always calls it in the De Cáelo )? Not merely is there no mention of it, but it actually disarms one of Lucretius' criticisms from the start. Lucretius objects that if air and fire were centri- fugal there would be nothing to prevent them from dispersing at large; but Aristotle's world was bounded by shells of aether, the fifth body, which was not centrifugal but had a natural tendency to move in a circle, so that fire would have no tendency to rise beyond its proper sphere. Again, Lucretius mentions as a feature of the rival theory that heat rising from the middle accounts for the sun's heat and the stars' brightness; but Aristotle explicitly rejects the proposition that the sun is nourished from the earth in his Meteorologica 354 b 32-355 a 32. The fifth body, of which the sun and the stars and their spheres are made, is something quite different from the four elements at the centre of the cosmos. A third possible objection has already been dealt with. Lucretius criticizes the rival theory on the ground that there is nothing to hold the universe together in the infinite void; but Aristotle, unlike the Stoics, rejected the idea of an infinite void outside the cosmos ( De Cáelo A 9, 279 a 12). It has already been seen, however, that the infinite void is an Epicurean idea introduced into the criticism here. There 21</page><page sequence="10">is no need to suppose that it was a feature of the rival theory; Lucretius was not looking for internal inconsistencies. On the subject of the fifth body, let us consider this question: was it always in antiquity taken to be a thesis universally held by Aristotle and his school, that the heavenly bodies are made of a fifth element, different from the other four, having a natural circular motion? This thesis is the main subject of Aristotle's De Cáelo A and B. It is well known to the doxographers and to Cicero ( Académica i. 7. 26). It became one of the most famous, if not notorious, of all Aristotelian doctrines. Yet there is good evidence that he himself did not believe it all his life, and that his immediate pupils did not accept it. It has often been observed that the De Cáelo theory of five elements does not appear in Aristotle's Physics. Sometimes this observation is explained by the supposition that Aristotle was simply limiting himself in the Physics to the study of the principles of nature in the sub- lunary world, and therefore felt free to say nothing about the fifth element. But there are passages particularly in Books T and A which seem to be incompatible with the 5-element theory, not merely to be silent about it (see Physics T 5, 205 a 10-19 and 205 b 24-28; A 7, 214 a 6-9). What is more extraordinary, there are passages in the De Cáelo itself, in Books T and A, which are strangely difficult to reconcile with the 5-element theory of Books A and B. Professor Solmsen has recently drawn attention to these (1960, p. 299): "Is it mere pedantry," he asks, "to expect that Aristotle, instead of saying 'of necessity each body has either a definite weight or a definite lightness', or 'the elements must be subject to generation and destruction', should say 'each body except the first', or 'the elements other than the aether'? (301 b 16 and 305 a 13). Patience is a virtue, and we may try to be patient with Aristotle's forge tfulne ss; but this forget- fulness goes astonishingly far when Aristotle asserts that there are 'no more than two simple local movements' (i.e. upward and downward) (303 b 5). And when we read that a body neither heavy nor light could move only by compulsion and would thereby be carried an infinite distance (302 a 20 -b 1), our patience is beginning to be overtaxed." Quite so. The likeliest explanation appears to be that at the time when he wrote the Physics (perhaps excepting Book 0), and De Cáelo T and A, Aristotle had not yet arrived at the theory of a fifth body having a natural circular motion. Presumably at this time he believed, like most of his predecessors, that the stars and planets were made of some kind of fire. It is worth asking at this stage whether his dialogue On Philosophy may not belong to this period. This is important because of Bignone's thesis that Epicurus' philosophy was formed in opposition to Aristotle - but to Aristotle's exoteric works, particularly the Protrepticus and the dialogue On Philosophy, rather than to his school-treatises. Bignone's thesis cannot be swallowed whole. Yet we may here be able to offer an unexpected confirmation of it. Since Jaeger's Aristotle , it has been fairly generally accepted that the dialogue On Philosophy first introduced the doctrine of the fifth body. The basis for this belief is what Cicero says in the De Natura Deorwn, coupled with a single sentence of his Académica. The Epicurean spokes- man in the De Natura Deorum i. 33, accusing Aristotle of a lavishly inconsistent theology, says that in the third book of his On Philosophy he calls the "ardor caeli" a god. In the Académica i. 26 Cicero lists earth, air, water and fire, and then mentions Aristotle's "quintum genus, e quo essent astra mentesque", thus showing for certain his knowledge of the fifth body. The reliabi- lity of Cicero's testimony about the fifth body has been questioned recently by H. J. Easterling. On this particular topic, the objections can be put briefly. First, there is no good reason to suppose that Cicero's source for his statement in the Académica is the dialogue On Philosophy ; second, "caeli ardor" is not a good translation of Aristotle's fifth body, whose characteristic was not alöecjöai as the Stoics said, but Aeiôeïv ( De Cáelo A 3, 270 b 23); third, in an extended 22</page><page sequence="11">passage (ii. 42) of the De Natura Deorum , where Aristotle is quoted as believing in the divinity of the stars which inhabit the "aetherial region", it is quite clear that the view attributed to him works with four elements, not five, and the aetherial region means the region of the heavenly fire . Now this last passage is universally attributed to Aristotle's On Philosophy - but with the following reservation. The four-element theory, it is said (e.g. by Jaeger, p. 143, and Cherniss, p. 596), is imposed upon Aristotle by Cicero's Stoic spokesman, who is here citing Aristotle in support of his own theory of divine and fiery stars; for the Stoics, of course, believed in only four elements, and therefore had to force Aristotle into a different key to make him sing in tune with them. Well, this will do, if we have to explain away Cicero's awkward testimony. But the fact remains that Cicero's Stoic spokesman is claiming to derive from Aristotle the thesis that the stars, being the creatures of the pure, fiery aether, are intelligent and divine and move of their own free will. Since we have found reason to think that Aristotle did at one time work with only four elements, we might justifiably dispense with elaborate special hypotheses, and take the evidence of Cicero's Stoic at its face value. At this point it should be added that Aristotle's pupils do not appear to have received his doctrine about the fifth body with much enthusiasm. There is certainly one testimony (Taurus, quoted by John Philoponus De Aeternitate Mundi 520. 18) which tells us that Theophrastus asser- ted that the stars are not made of fire, and which adds the explanation that he thought they are made of the fifth body. But the added explanation may well be wrong, as Steinmetz has suggested (pp. 163-4); in the De Igne 4-7, Theophrastus appears to dispense with the idea of the fifth body in what he says about the sun, and inclines to the view that the sun is made of a specially pure kind of fire. When we come to Strato, the doxographer Aetius tells us unequivocally that he believed the heavens to be made of fire (ii. 11.4 - Strato fr. 84 Wehrli). So we can answer our question now. The doctrine of the fifth element was certainly regarded as a feature of Aristotelianism by the systematic scholars who studied the school-treatises, parti- cularly after the time of Andronicus in the late first century B.C.; and it was vaguely known to Cicero. But it was not always a feature of the cosmology of Aristotle and his pupils; and the Epicureans may well have directed their criticisms against an Aristotelian cosmology which worked with four elements. The last difficulty may now be examined more briefly. It is that Lucretius' polemic is against a theory which says that the stars and the sun are fed by the calor which rises from the middle of the universe, and that the growth of plants is in some way connected with this. Now there is abundant evidence that both of these are Stoic doctrines; and the former proposition was explicitly denied by Aristotle once he had formed the theory of the fifth element (Meteorologica 354 b 32- 355 a 32). Yet it may still be Aristotelian. Aristotle certainly believed in exhalations from the earth; he certainly thought that fire is nourished by moisture; if for a while he held that the sun and the stars are fiery, he may well have believed that they are kept going by warm moist exhala- tions. That is precisely the view for which Cicero's Stoic spokesman claims Aristotle's support in the De Natura Deorum . According to Stobaeus 1. 207. 16 ff. it appears to have been the view of Theophrastus too. I have been unable to find out anything significant about the theory of plant growth mentioned here. It appears to be presupposed by the pseudo-Aris tote lian De Plantis , Book ii; perhaps it was commonplace. It must be concluded that in this passage Lucretius may well have had in mind the cosmology of the Peripatetic school, quite possibly as represented by the Aristotelian dialogue On Philosophy. His target is certainly not any Stoic theory known to us. This negative conclusion is an important one, and strengthens the case presented in the rest of this article. For if Lucretius ever had the Stoic philosophy in mind as a rival to his own, he should have taken note of their characteristic modifications of the Aristotelian cosmology. 23</page><page sequence="12">F. ii. 167-183. Providence This subject will be discussed in section N. G. ii. 251 -293. Free Will and Necessity In the Letter to Menoeceus § 134, Epicurus wrote: "kpeïttov rjv Twnepi Oecov ijúOcú koctoc- KoÀovOeïv Tļ Tcov cpucjiKcov eiiaapuâvi] ÔouÀeúeiv* . Since "euiap^vri" is a word commonly associated with the Stoics, it may be as well to consider briefly whether it was the Stoic con- cept which drew the fire of the Epicureans. The idea gets some support from a similarity, pointed out by Robin, between Lucretius' description of the concept and Stoic definitions of it. Si semper motus conectitur omnis. . .," Lucretius ii . 25 1 ; "quamquam ita sit ut. . .coacta atque conexa sint fato omnia," Aulus Gellius vii. 2. 7, following Chrysippus; and many other Stoic texts in S VF 2. 912 -927. However, there is good ancient authority, accepted by most modern editors, for the view that Epicurus' target was Democritus. Cicero is one who took this view: "Epicurus cum vide- ret. . .nil fore in nostra potestate, quod esset earum (sc. atomorum) motus certus et necessarius, invenit quo modo necessitatem effugeret, quod videlicet Democritum fugerat" (De Natura Deorum ^ The Epicurean Diogenes of Oenoanda was another: "ov yocp too ArjjiOKpiTou tiç ^piļOTjTcci Àóy&lt;p, MT1Õeníav M6V èÀeuOepav cpácTKcov Tcnç &lt;*tÓ|jois Kelviļcrtv eivai ," ktà (fr. 33, col. 2. 3). One may have doubts as to whether Democritus is truly represented as a believer in eiļjocpiaevTļ, and whether perhaps the cpucriKoi mentioned by Epicurus may not be some more recent atomists. But it is certain that there is no good reason for bringing Stoicism into the picture. This was an Atomists dilemma, made sharper by certain ethical and psychological theories of Aristotle (dis- cussed further in the second of my Two Studies in the Greek Atomists). H. ii. 886-972. The Elements of Sensation Epicurean atoms have shape, size and weight, and they move in the void. They have no other properties. All sensible qualities are functions of compounds of atoms. Lucretius demolishes several objections to this theory, including the assertion that the pheno- mena of life and sensation cannot be derivative but must be fundamental. What is it, he asks, that makes people think that a sentient creature cannot come from non-sentient elements? (ii. 886). It is the fact that stones and wood and earth when mixed are (apparently) unable to produce sensa- tion. His answer is that his own theory does not entail that the elements which can produce sensation always do so; it all depends on the invisible shapes, motions, order, position, etc. of the elements. Even logs and sods can produce worms when they are sodden, though we cannot see the crucial rearrangement of elements which brings this about (886-901). He moves on to a positive attack on the alternative hypothesis, which may take one of two forms: (a) that what is sentient is made of sentient elements. He objects to this that the sentient parts of the body are always soft; hence the sentient elements would necessarily be soft, and being soft they could not be permanently durable (902-906; this is a conjectural interpretation of a corrupt text). Grant, however, that they could be durable, the elements must have sensation either like that of a part or like that of the whole organism, and both alternatives are objectionable and unnecessary (907-930). The other possibility is (b) that sensation arises out of non-sentient elements by a change in the elements, "or by some birth, as it were". Lucretius says the way to answer this suggestion 24</page><page sequence="13">is to show that change and birth are always functions of compounds, not of elements. He pro- duces three arguments to show that this applies to sensation, but it is hardly necessary to review them here (931-972). The passage ends with some fun at the expense of these hypotheses. If sensation entails sentient elements, why do laughing and crying not entail laughing and crying elements, and so on? (973-990). There are thus two alternative theories attacked here: (a) that sentient creatures are made of permanently sentient elements, and (b) that they are made of elements which either change from non-sentient to sentient, or else are 'born'. The two alternatives are incompatible. Robin observes that it would be vain to attribute the argument to particular opponents: "mais il me paraît difficile de douter que ces adversaires ne soient pas les Stoïciens, dont le matérialisme vitaliste s'oppose si nettement au matérialisme mécaniste des Epicuriens" (I, p. 332). Munro, Giussani and Bailey find a Stoic theory only in (b); Bailey sees the whole section apart from (b) as directed against Anaxagoras' theory of Homoeomereity. The position of the editors seems particularly incomprehensible here. Lucretius is arguing defensively throughout the passage. He asserts that immutably non-sentient atoms can and do produce sentient compounds. If this assertion is false, then sentient beings are produced either from immutably sentient elements, or by the appearance of sentient elements where none had been before. He strengthens his own assertion by pointing out weaknesses in both of the logi- cally possible alternatives. Hence there is no need to imagine that these alternatives were in fact the property of any particular schools. The words which introduce (a), "ex sensilibus qui sensile posse creari consti taunt," suggest particular adherents; on the other hand the introduc- tion to the allegedly Stoic alternative (b) does not: "quod si forte aliquis dicet. . ." Bailey has to hedge a little: " aliquis will then be some Stoic writer, or possibly in view of the fut. dicet one of his own followers." What is alleged by Munro, Giussani and Bailey to be a Stoic doctrine is that sensation arises either by a change out of the non-sentient or by "some birth, as it were". Munro quoted Plutarch De Stoicorum Repugnantiis 1052 f., according to which the embryo was said to grow in the womb like a plant, but when it was born the pneuma was cooled and hardened and thus changed into an animal. But this is about compounds, and is very nearly compatible with the Epicurean view. Considered as an element, the Stoic pneuma , as the enduring logos spermatikos , was more like the immutably sentient element of Lucretius' first alternative than the mutating element of the second. Giussani and Bailey rightly reject Munro' s citation, but they put nothing whatever in its place. The alleged Stoic theory of the 'birth' of sentient elements, Giussani admits, is an "obscure and fantastic theory of which we know of no other testimony". There is no trace in Lucretius of the Stoic 'tension' doctrine, which Bailey mentions, and no evidence in the Stoic texts for the doctrine of the production of sentient particles, which he finds in Lucretius and attributes to the Stoics. It seems to be nothing but determined prejudice which finds a reference to Stoicism here. I. iii. 307 -322. Character and Philosophy Lucretius argues that since the soul is made of three different elements, and since the propor- tions of the elements make a difference to temperament, it follows that differences in temperament are to some extent given by nature. But ratio , by which he means the Epicurean philosophy, can eliminate all but the merest traces of these differences, so that there is nothing to prevent any man living a life worthy of the gods. 25</page><page sequence="14">These tines, Munro says, "have pointed reference to the great stoical doctrine of the perfect apathy of the wise or good man: Lucretius concedes much to philosophy and reason; but will not allow that they efface all distinctions of natural character". But this is to mistake Lucretius* emphasis. He is saying that philosophy can rectify defi- ciencies of temperament, not entirely, but for all practical purposes; we may be naturally as timid as deer, or as hot-tempered as lions, or as placid as cows, but if we read Epicurus we can all become as rationally calm as a true Epicurean. There is no reference to any Stoic doctrine here, nor to any other rival theory. J. iii. 350-369. The soul , the body and sensation The question is whether the body or only the soul has sensation. The Epicurean doctrine is that the body has sensation, though only when in conjunction with soul. A particular appli- cation of this question concerns the faculty of sight: do our eyes see, or does the mind see through the eyes as if through an open doorway? Lucretius argues against the latter alternative. The whole section is said to be anti-Stoic by Bailey (1051-2). There is good evidence that the Stoics did hold that the soul alone has sensation, in Cicero Tusculans i.46, where the sense-organs are described as "windows of the mind", and in other passages collected in SVF 2. 850, 857-8, 861-2. But the doctrine was not regarded in antiquity as being peculiar to the Stoics. Sextus attributes it to Heraclitus, comparing the sense-organs to windows (Adver- sus Mathematicos vii. 129-130), and also to Strato (ibid. 350). It is possible that the Epicureans might have regarded themselves as differing from Democritus on this point, though owing to the obscurity of Democritus* theory it is hard to be sure. There is evidence that he spoke of the sense-organs as being (or having?) irópoi , which are not so very different from Lucretius' "doors". Lucretius criticizes Democritus by name in the section immediately following. Whatever may be the truth about the earlier Atomists, however, it is clear that this text presents no compelling reason for thinking that the Stoics were in the forefront of Lucretius' mind. K. iii. 425-829. The Survival of the Soul It is claimed by Bailey (p. 1065) that Lucretius' arguments against the immortal soul are in part directed against the Stoics. In general, however, the Stoics were not much interested in the after-life. Emotionally, as Max Pohlenz observes (pp.93, 199), they were "Diesseitsmenschen". It is unlikely there- fore that Lucretius' passionate attack on ideas of survival after death would be construed by his readers as an attack on Stoicism, when there were more obvious targets, such as the Plato- nists and Pythagoreans. Moreover, the Stoics (with some exceptions) believed the soul to survive only for a limited time. In the doxographical tradition, Zeno and Chrysippus count as upholders of the mortal soul (SVF 1. 146; 2.774). But there are no traces in Lucretius of an attack on this theory of limited survival, and his language sometimes makes it clear that he had in mind only two possibilities: either the soul loses its identity at death, or it is immor- tal (iii. 830-1). Posidonius seems to have been an exception to the general rule that the Stoics were not much interested in the after-life, according to Pohlenz (pp. 229-30). But he too accepted that the soul survives only until the ekpyrosis , and Lucretius does not seem to be concerned with 26</page><page sequence="15">any of the peculiarities of Posidonius' eschatology, such as the connexion between the soul and the sun, and the collection of souls in the region of pneuma close to the moon. L. iii. 847 -861. Rebirth Death is nothing to us, since the soul is mortal; we shall not feel anything more after our death than we felt of the Punic War before our birth. Even if our soul can feel something after its separation from the body, this will be nothing to us, since we are precisely a combination of soul and body. Even if the same matter which now composes our soul and body is fortu- itously reassembled some time, it will be nothing to us, since our memory will not be continu- ous. Indeed, this has probably already happened, since time past is infinite; but we do not remember. Rebirth was a Stoic idea ( SVF 1. 109; 2. 623, 627); but it is not necessary to labour the point that it was not peculiar to the Stoics. There is no reason to doubt that the Epicureans were thinking of the Pythagoreans, Plato and perhaps early Aristotle. What was characteristic of the Stoic doctrine was that after the ekpyrosis the world was supposed to be reconstituted in exactly the same form, with all the same people and the same history. Lucretius could have had some fun at the expense of this doctrine. But he did not. M. iv. 823 -857. Teleology The Stoics were enthusiastic about final causes, as Balbus' speech in Cicero's De Natura Deorum ii shows. More will be said about this subject in the next section. The passage now under discussion is less crucial, because no-one doubts that the argument here is equally approp- riate to Aristotle's teleology (Bailey indeed says it is more probable that it is directed against the Stoics, but he gives no reason for thinking so). The present passage is entirely concerned with the 'intrinsic' teleology that is characteristic of Aristotle's philosophy of nature: that is, the doctrine that the parts of an organism are to be explained by the good which they contri- bute by their function to the whole organism. Thus Aristotle asserts precisely what Lucretius denies here, that eyes are for the sake of seeing, legs are for the sake of walking, etc. It should be added also, what the editors seem to have overlooked, that all Lucretius' examples occur in another pre-Stoic text, namely the teleological argument put into Socrates' mouth by Xenophon in Memorabilia i.4: eyes for seeing (§5), legs for walking (§11), hands as tools (§ 11), tongue for speaking (§ 12), ears for hearing (§ 5). No doubt they were all commonplace. N. v. 55-234. Gods and the World Lucretius announces that he will now describe how the world came into being and will perish, how life originated, and speech, and fear of the gods. He will also describe the operations of the sun and the moon, lest anyone should think that they move of their own free will in order to make the crops and the animals grow, and lest we should think they move according to a plan of the gods. People tend to forget that the gods live free from all toil and trouble, and when they do so, then the mystery of the heavens tends to bring back all their old fears again, (v. 55-90) He then asserts that the cosmos and all its parts will perish one day. Perhaps you have religious scruples, and believe that the earth and sun, and all the parts of the cosmos are divine and eternal, and that to doubt it is to repeat the sin of the Giants against the immortals. But in fact the heavenly bodies are a sort of paradigm case of what is inanimate and insensitive, because they have entirely the wrong kind of body. A tree cannot grow in the sky, nor clouds 27</page><page sequence="16">in salt water, nor fish in the fields, nor blood in wood nor sap in stones. So the soul or mind needs a body that consists of sinews and blood: it cannot even exist throughout the human body, let alone outside it. Hence it is quite impossible that the stars should have souls. Moreover the true nature of the gods is such that their abode must be different from this world, (v. 91-155) Lucretius continues with several arguments against the thesis that the world exists for the benefit of man and therefore men ought to praise the work of the gods and recognize that it is immortal, (v. 156-234) The main purpose of this passage, as described by Lucretius, is to attack the view that the cosmos is the work of the gods and is eternal (110-116). He wishes to substitute for this view the Epicurean theory that the cosmos is a natural growth, having a natural origin and end. If one thing is certain about his target, it is that it cannot be "doubtless the Stoics", as Munro carelessly thought. For the Stoics, although they believed the cosmos to be the work of the gods, agreed with the Epicureans that it had a beginning and will have an end. This was pointed out very clearly by Robin, Bignone and others, so that there would be no need to say much more about it if Bailey had not inexcusably glossed over everything they said on the subject. "It is true," says Bailey's commentary (p. 1346), "that the Stoics believed in the ultimate ekpyrosis of the world, but that was not held by them all, and in any case was so far distant that it did not interfere with a practical idea of its immortality. " This is just nonsense. The traditional Hellenistic picture of Stoicism and Aristotelianism contrasted them sharply on this point. Even Cicero, who omits a Peripatetic philosopher from the team in De Natura Deorum , on the ground that the Stoic can speak for the Peripatetic as well, knows well enough that they do not agree about this doctrine. "When your Stoic wise man has spelled all this out syllable by syllable," he says in the Lucullus 119, meaning by "this" the doctrine of the world-soul and ekpyrosis , "Aristotle will come, with a golden stream of oratory, to say that he is crazy: the world never had a beginning. . .and will never collapse and die." So much is clear. The champions of the eternal cosmos were not Stoics but Aristotelians. But the immortality of the world is only one of several elements in the cosmology attacked by Lucretius in this long passage. Are all the elements Aristotelian? One of the elements is this: the arrangement of the heavens is the work of the gods, and to doubt the eternity of the arrangement is to repeat the impiety of the Giants. This is certainly Aristotelian. Cicero's translation of Aristotle's cave-simile, in De Natura Deorum ii. 95-96, is famous: if there were people who had lived all their lives in well-appointed subterranean caves and were at last released to the earth's surface, when they saw the beauty and the regu- larity of the cosmos they would conclude at once that the gods exist and that these great works are the works of gods. Philo tells us that Aristotle condemned the frightful atheism of those who denied the eternity of the cosmos. Both quotations are probably from Aristotle's dialogue On Philosophy (they are fr. 13 and 18 Ross). Another element is that the heavenly bodies are living creatures, having a soul or mind. Again, this is certainly Aristotelian. Moreover, Cicero's quotation from Aristotle, probably again from On Philosophy (it is printed as fr.21 by Ross), shows a close connexion with Lucre- tius' argument which is unlikely to be coincidence. Aristotle argues by analogy: earth produces its creatures, so does water, and so does air; so the fourth element, which is best adapted of them all to produce life, must have its living creatures too - and they must be the stars. Lucre- tius turns the analogy against him: as a matter of fact, he says, what we see is that life occurs in strictly limited conditions, and the analogy of the elements shows how unlikely it is that the stars should be alive. 28</page><page sequence="17">But there are several elements which are more doubtful. Lucretius argues against three propositions which most people would at once say are not Aristotelian: that the gods created the cosmos (156, 161, 174 ff.), that they planned its organization (80-81 etc.), and that it is organized for the benefit of mankind (80, 156 ff.). These three propositions are also attacked earlier in the poem(ii. 167-176). Aristotle's position on these points is not free from ambiguity. It is clear that there was a certain tension in his thinking about the relation between god or gods and the world-order. At his most austere, as everyone knows, he left no room at all for divine providence or planning: the divine movers of the spheres bear no relation to the spheres except that of continually provok- ing them to move, and they bear no relation to the changing sublunary world, the world of mortals, except that ot maintaining the cycle of birth and death through the intermediary of the sun's motions, and possibly that of being objects of remote admiration. Nevertheless, Aristotle's cosmos as a whole was dependent on the divine movers for its continued orderly existence; and it was hard for him and his supporters to describe this depen- dence without using language which suggested a closer, more anthropomorphic relation. This is very clearly to be seen in the pseudo-Aristotelian De Mundo ; and it was almost certainly a feature of the dialogue On Philosophy. There is evidence of the same mode of thought scattered over the Corpus Aristotelicum. "God and nature do nothing pointlessly" is an epitome of the attitude that Lucretius wants to criticize. Solmsen (1951) and De Lacy have both recently defended the view that it was Chrysippus who expounded a cosmology in which man was the focus of all the teleological processes of nature, and therefore Lucretius in this passage must be fighting on his own account against the Stoics, not repeating Epicurus' polemic against the Aristotelians. I dispute this. Even in Aristotle's school-treatises, there are signs here and there of an anthropocentric teleology, notably in a well-known passage in Politics A 8: Aristotle concluded there that nature must have made plants and animals for the sake of man. (I am not convinced by Wie land' s attempt (p. 275) to set this aside: "Denn hier geht es nicht um Naturphilosophie, sondern um die prak- tische Frage danach, wie sich der Mensch in der Welt einrichtet und von den Dingen dieser Welt Gebrauch macht." It seems to me on the contrary that Aristotle's purpose in Politics A is to show that the polis is a society which is produced by nature - and by a nature which transcends human nature.) There is certainly more to be said about this point, but it must be reserved for another place. It has usually been believed that Stoic teleology was universal and anthropo- centric, whereas Aristotle's was limited and specific. It can be argued that the difference was not so clear cut after all, and that Aristotle may have come close to the Stoic position in some of the books, now lost, which he wrote for a wider public. It cannot, however, be supposed that Aristotle ever defended the thesis that the gods created the world. It is well known that this was a subject on which he differed from Plato. He inter- preted the Timaeus literally, as meaning a creation of the cosmos by a god, and he attacked it on this basis. Aristotle's position was well known in the Hellenistic world, too; this was not one of those doctrines which were submerged for a time and then rediscovered. One wonders, nevertheless, how Aristotle treated this subject in On Philosophy. Many scholars (for example Bignone, II p. 525 ff., and Untersteiner, p. xxii) believe that Plato was a spokesman in the dialogue. It is doubtful whether this is so, but it is a more plausible thesis that Plato was a spokesman treated with respect and a large measure of agreement by Aristotle than that he was just an Aunt Sally. Most of the cosmological arguments drawn by our sources from the dialogue aim to prove that the cosmos is the work of gods and will last for ever, a point on which Plato and Aristotle agreed. It is possible that the question of its origin, which divided Aristotle from Plato (at least according to Aristotle's interpretation of Plato), was not pressed. 29</page><page sequence="18">The so-called fragments of the dialogue, collected by Ross, contain both an argument against the creation of the world (it is fr. 20, and it is actually the same argument as that used by Lucretius v. 168-173), and arguments to show that the world must be the work of a craftsman (fr.l2a and 12b, from Sextus). So it is just possible that the Epicureans regarded the dialogue as the major authority on Platonic-Aristotelian cosmology. Bignone (II p. 429) and others have written that the target of Lucretius' polemic against the creation of the world is Plato's Timaeus . I would rather say that it is no single work, nor any single philosopher, but a group of philosophers whom the Epicureans regarded, rightly, as their main opponents. Most of the elements attacked in Lucretius v. 35-234 are contained in the speech given to Socrates in Xenophon's Memorabilia i.4; most of them can be found in Plato, in the Phaedo 96c ff., in the Timaeus , the Philebus 28c ff., and the Laws 889a -899d; most of them can be found in Aristotle's works of natural philosophy, and were probably to be found in his lost dialogue On Philosophy. All of them can be found in all of these texts taken together. There is nothing that must be Stoic, and one major element which cannot be Stoic. 0. v. 306 -350. The Mortality of the Cosmos After his polemic against the eternal cosmos of the Aristotelian world-picture, Lucretius offers positive arguments for the contrary view. The parts of the cosmos are mortal: hence the whole is mortal (235-246). The mortality of each of the four cosmic masses is defended (247-305). Then follows a series of subsidiary arguments, in which references to Stoicism have been seen. First comes a straightforward, though oddly placed, reminder that nothing is so hard that it endures for ever. Next a strange argument to this effect: if the surrounding sky, as some say, gives birth to all things and receives them back again when they perish, then the whole world including the sky must be mortal; for anything that causes other things to grow must itself be diminished thereby, and it must be restored when it receives them back again (318- 323). Giussani sees in this a reference to the Stoic doctrine of ekpyrosis , according to which the world is assumed into the surrounding fire and then reborn from it. The Stoics believed the fire to be immortal; against them Lucretius asserts that its mortality must follow from its changeability. Giussani's view is followed, with differing degrees of emphasis, by Robin and Bailey. The editors point out that there is a clear reference to Pacuvius' Chryses ; indeed the verbal echoes are so close as to place this beyond doubt. The editors assume that Lucretius is aiming at the Stoics through Pacuvius - but this is no more than an assumption. There is nothing in the Lucretius passage which is not in Pacuvius, and not much that is distinctively Stoic in Pacuvius. If Lucretius intended a serious attack on Stoic doctrine, it must be admitted that he chose a strangely oblique approach. If the world had no origin, Lucretius continues, why does history not go back beyond the Trojan War? Why are some of the arts still in their infancy? If you import fires or earthquakes or floods to explain this forgetfulness, you will have to concede that the same type of catastrophe will eventually destroy the world completely (324-350). Later on, Lucretius returns to the same theme, in arguing that the balance of the strife of opposites will not always be maintained (380 ff.). Legend says that fire was once supreme, when Phaethon drove across the world, until Jupiter enabled Phoebus to control the sun-chariot 30</page><page sequence="19">once more (of course, the supremacy of fire, if and when it happened, would have a quite dif- ferent explanation really); and that water once overwhelmed the lives of men (392-415). Some have found references to the Stoic theory of ekpyrosis again here. What is remark- able, however, is how little it is concerned with the Stoics. The theory of periodic catast- rophes is of course an old one; it is as old as Plato's Timaeus 22 c, where fire, coupled with the name of Phaethon, and flood are mentioned, and it probably found a place in Aristotle's On Philosophy (fr. 8 Ross). The Stoic theory of ekpyrosis was a notable contribution to this line of speculation - yet Lucretius, when he wants an example of the triumph of fire, goes to the legend of Phaethon, who does not appear in the Stoic fragments. It seems that Lucretius might never have heard of Stoicism. Conclusion There is no single instance in these passages of Lucretius of an attack which is certainly aimed at the Stoics and could not be aimed at another school of philosophy, at several other schools, or at no school at all. Where it is clear that the attack is upon the theories of natural philosophers, rather than upon the commonplace beliefs of most men, Lucretius turns his atten- tion to the Presocratics or the Platonists and Aristotelians. Some of the views he attacks were held by the Stoics as well as others, but we have found no reason to think that the attack has special reference to the Stoics in these cases. It may be suggested that although no parti- cular passages can be assigned with certainty to the Stoics the case is cumulative: Lucretius attacks theories held by the Stoics in common with others - but only the Stoics held all of them, and therefore they must be the real target. But this suggestion will not stand up to examination. The accumulation of evidence points to the natural philosophy of the Platonists and Aristotelians, rather than to the Stoics. Moreover there are cases which we have pointed out where the Stoic theory is certainly and significantly ignored; passages E and N are the most important of these. Lucretius took very little notice of the Stoics. I believe this is a conclusion of great impor- tance for the history of natural philosophy. It is not a new conclusion, because it was understood by the philosophers and scientists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This may well have been because they did not examine the question with the same apparatus of learning which was later employed, but whatever the reason for it, the position of Lucretius was properly appre- ciated at the beginning of the scientific renaissance, and has been obscured by the mistakes of the last hundred years. For there was a major battle in ancient natural philosophy - a battle which rumbled on into the eighteenth century. There were two sides, opposed to each other (in a quite literal sense) toto cáelo . One side consisted of the Atomists, the other side of Plato and Aristotle and their adherents. They differed from each other in that they took contradictory stands on a number of inter-related points. The Atomists held a discontinuous theory of matter, the Aristotelians believed in a continuum. The Atomists believed in an infinite universe, the Aristotelians in a finite one. The Atomists believed in plural and perishable worlds, the Aristotelians in a single and eternal one. The Atomists tried to explain the origins of living species, the Aristotelians said they are eternal. The Atomists believed in gods who are unconcerned with the cosmos, the Aristotelians believed the cosmos to be dependent on gods. The Atomists believed in mechanical and random causes, the Aristotelians in teleology. In the Hellenistic world, the Epicureans represented the opposition to the Aristotelian world- picture. The Stoics were relatively unimportant in this struggle. They adopted most things 31</page><page sequence="20">from Aristotle; their innovations were on the whole irrelevant and retrogressive. Their charac- teristic theories - ekpyrosis and the exact, predetermined repetition of the cosmic cycle, their crude substitution of the active and passive kinds of matter for Aristotle's eiÕoç and uX tļ , their materialistic account of qualities, their extreme pantheism, and its corollary, divination - these are unproductive digressions. Lucretius, if I am right, ignored them. Wisely, or perhaps just luckily, he avoided these side issues and concentrated his fire on the main enemy: De Rerum Natura is the Atomists' answer to the Aristotelian world-picture.
