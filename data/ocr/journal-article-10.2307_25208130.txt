<plain_text><page sequence="1">565 Art. XVI.?A Theory of Universal Grammar, as applied to a Group of Savage Languages. By R. C. Temple. In reviewing lately Mr. Portman's " Notes on the Languages of tho South Andaman Group of Tribe3," I pointed out that he had used a pamphlet of my own, privately printed in 1883, entitled " A Brief Exposition of a Theory of Universal Grammar," which was specially dosigncd to meet the very difficulties ho had to face in giving a general idea of languages constructed on lines at first sight very different from those on whose structure modern European Grammar is based. I also pointed out that tho pamphlet in question arose out of the practical impossibility of using the usual inflexional system of Grammar, as taught in Europe for the accurate description of a group of agglutinative languages, and that it had its immediate origin in the criticisms of the late Mr. A. J. Ellis, public and private, on an old work of 1877 and certain MSS. by myself and Mr. E. II. Man on the Andamanese speech. Mr. Ellis explained that in order to adequately represent for scientific readers such a form of speech as the Andamanese, " we require new terms and an entirely new set of grammatical conceptions, which shall not bend an agglutinative language to our inflexional translation," and ho asked me accordingly if ii were not possible " to throw over the inflexional treatment of an uninflected language." This, and the further consideration that since every human being speaks with but the one object of communicating his own intelligence to other human beings, the several possible ways of doing this must be based on some general laws applicable to them all, if only one could find them out, j.ii.A.s. 1899 37</page><page sequence="2">566 A THEORY OF UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR, led me to make the attempt to construct a general theory on logical principles, which should abandon the inflexional treatment, its conceptions, and its tonus. Such an attempt involved a wide departure from orthodox grammatical teaching, and I found that Mr. Portman, while adopting tho theory, had been unable to clear himself of the teaching in which ho had been brought up, and had consequently produced a work which was a compromise between the two. His laborious and praiseworthy efforts to adequately represent the Andamanose languages had failed in point of clearness, and my theory was not properly represented in his pages. I therefore promised in the review to revert to the subject again in this Journal, and to give its readers a more extended view of the theory than was then possible. Hence this article. With these few introductory remarks I will proceed at once with my subject, commencing with a general statement of the argumentation on which the theory is based, testing it as a method of clearly presenting a savage group of tongues constructed after the fashion of the Andamaneso by an explanation thereby of the linguistic contents of an entire story, as given by Mr. Portman, viz. " The Andaman Fire Legend," and concluding by a skeleton statement of the theory itself. Premising that I am talking of the conditions of sixteen years ago, I found myself, in building up the theory, compelled, in order to work out the argument logically, to commence where the accepted Grammars ended, viz. at the sentence, defining the sentence as the expression of a complete meaning, and making that the unit of language. Clearly, then, a sentence ma}r consist of one or more expressions of a meaning or ' words,' which I defined as single expressions of a meaning. It can also consist of two separate parts?the subject, i.e., the matter to be discussed or communicated, and the predicate, i.e., the discussion or communication. And when the subject or predicate consists of many words it must contain principal and additional words.</page><page sequence="3">AS APPLIED TO SAVAGE LANGUAGES. 567 This leads to the argument that the components of a sentence are words, placed either in the subjective or predicative part of it, having a relation to each other in that part of principal and subordinate. Therefore, because of such relation, words fulfil functions. The functions of the principal words are to indicate the subject or predicate, and of the subordinate words to illustrate the predicate, or to explain the subje-jt or to illustrate that explanation. Again, as the predicato is the discussion or communication on tho subject, it is capable of extension or completion by complementary words, which form that part of a sentence recognized in the Grammars as ' the object.' This completes the first stage of the argument leading to a direct and simple definition of grammatical terms; but speooh obviously does not stop here, because mankind speaks with a purpose, and the function of his sentences is to indicate that purpose, which must be one of the following in any specified sentence:? (1) affirmation, (2) denial, (3) interrogation, (4) exhortation, (5) information. Now, purpose can be indicated in a sentence by the position of its components, by variation of their forms, or by tho addition of special introductory words. Also, connected purposes can be indicated by connected sentences, placed in tho relation to each other of principal and subordinate, which relation can be expressed by the position of the sentences themselves, by variation of the forms of their components, or by the addition of special words of reference. And a word of reference can act in two ways, either by merely joining sentences, or by substituting itself in tho subordinate sentence for the word in the principal sentence to which it refers. Further, the inter-relation of the words in a sentence can be expressed by the addition of special connecting words, or by variation or correlated variation of form. These considerations complete what may be called the second stage of the argument leading to clear definitions of grammatical terms. The argument thereafter becomes more complicated, taking us into the explanation of</page><page sequence="4">568 A THEORY OF UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR, elliptical, i.e. incompletely expressed, forms of speech, and into those expansions of sentences known as phrases, clauses, and periods. But to keep our minds fixed for the present only on that part of it which leads to plain grammatical definitions, it may be stated now that functionally a word is either? (1) An integer, or a sentence in itself. (2) An indicator, or indicative of the subject or complement (object) of a sentence. (3) An cxplicator, or explanatory of its subject or com plement. (4) Apredicator, or indicative of its predicate. (5) An illustrator, or illustrative of its predicate or com plement, or of the explanation of its subject or complement. (6) A connector, or explanatory of the inter-relation of its components (words). (7) An introducer, or explanatory of its purpose. (8) A referent conjunctor, or explanatory of the inter relation of connected sentences by joining them. (9) A referent substitute, or explanatory of the inter relation of connected sentences by substitution of itself in the subordinate sentence for the word in the principal sentence to which it refers. These, then, are the terms I concocted and the arguments out of which they grew. Of course, grammarians will know that all this is syntax, and I will now explain why I consider that it is far more important to study function than form as essential to the correct apprehension of words, and how to my mind accidence arises properly out of syntax and not the other way round, as we have all been taught. It is obvious that any given word may fulfil one or more or all the functions of words, and that therefore words may be collected into as many classes as there are functions, any individual word being transferable from one class to another and belonging to as many classes as there are functions which it can fulfil. The functions a word fulfils in any particular sentence can be indicated by its position therein</page><page sequence="5">AS APPLIED TO SAVAGE LANGUAGES. 569 without or with variation of form, and, because of this, the form which a word can be made to assume is capable of indicating the class to which it belongs for the nonce. It is further obvious that words transferable from class to class belong primarily to a certain class and secondarily to the others, that a transfer involves the fulfilment of a new function, and that a word in its transferred condition becomes a new word connected with the form fulfilling the primary function, the relation between the forms, i.e. the words, so connected being that of parent and offshoot. Form, therefore, can indicate the class to which a parent word and its offshoots respectively belong. This is tho induction that leads me to argue that form grows out of function, or, to put it in the familiar way, accidence grows out of syntax, because when connected words differ in form they must consist of a principal part or stem, and an additional part or functional affix. The function of the stem is to indicate the meaning of the word, and the function of the affix to modify that meaning with reference to the function of the word. This modification can be expressed by indicating the class to which the word belongs, or by indicating its relation or correlation to the other words in the sentence. But the stem itself may consist of an original meaning and thus be a simple stem, or it may contain a modification of an original meaning and so be a compound stem. A compound stem must consist of a principal part or root and additional parts or radical affixes, the function of the root being to indicate the original meaning of the stem, aud of the radical affixes to indicate the modifications by which the meaning of the root has been changed into the meaning of the stem. Further, since words fulfil functions and belong to classes, they must possess inherent qualities, which can be indicated by qualitative affixes. Thus it is that the affixes determine the forms of words, bringing into existence what is usually called etymology or derivation. They are attachable, separably or inseparably,</page><page sequence="6">570 A THEORY OF UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR, to roots and stems and words by the well-recognized methods of prefixing, infixing, and suffixing, either in their full or in a varied form. It is the method of attaching them by variation of form that brings about inflexion in all its variety of kind. Such is the line which I have long thought inductive argument should take, in order to work out the grammar of any given language or group of languages logically, starting from the base argument that speech is a mode of communication between man and man, expressed through the ear by talking, through the eye by signs, or through the skin by touch, and taking a language to bo a variety or special mode of speech. The grammar, i.e. the exposition of the laws, of any single language seems to me to stop at this point, and to carry the argument further, as one of course must, is to enter the region of Comparative Grammar. In doing so one must start at the same point as before, viz. the sentence, but progress on a different line, because hitherto the effort has been to resolve tho unit of language into its components, and now it has to be considered as being itself a component of something greater, i.e. of a language. To continue the argument. Since a sentence is composed of words placed in a particular order without or with variation of form, its meaning is clearly rendered complete by the combination of the meaniug of its components writh their position or forms or both. Also, since sentences aro the units of languages, words are the components of sentences, and languages are varieties of speech, languages can vary in the forms of their words, or in the position in which their words are placed in the sentence, or in both. And thus are created classes of languages. Again, since the meaning of a sentence may be rendered complete either by the position of its words or by their forms, languages are primarily divisible into syntactical languages, or thoso that express complete meaning by the position of their words; and into formative languages, or those that express complete meaning by the forms of their words. Further, since words</page><page sequence="7">AS APPLIED TO SAVAGE LANGUAGES. 571 are varied in form by the addition of affixes, and since affixes may be attached to words in an altered or unaltered form, formative languages are divisible into agglutinative languages, or those that add affixes without alteration ; and into synthetic languages, or those that add affixes with alteration. And lastly, since affixes may be prefixes, infixes, or suffixes, agglutinative and synthetic languages are each divisible into (1) pre-mutative, or those that prefix their affixes; (2) intro-mutative, or those that infix them ; and (3) post-mutative, or those that suffix them. Thus does it 6cem to me that the inductive argument can be carried onwards to a clear and definite apprehension of the birth and growth of the phenomena presented by the varieties of human speech, i.e. by languages. But as is the case with every other natural growth, no language can have ever been left to develop itself alone, and thus do we got the phenomenon of connected languages, which may bo defined as those that differ from each other by varying the respective forms and positions, but not tho meanings, of their words. And since the variation of form is effected by the addition of altered or unaltered affixes, connected languages can vary the forms of the affixes without materially varying those of tho roots and stems of their words. In this way they become divisible into groups, or those whose stems are common, and into families, or those whose roots are common. It is also against natural conditions for any language to develop only in one direction, or without subjection to outside influences, and so it is that we find languages developing on more than one line and belonging strictly to more than one class, but in every such case the language has what is commonly called its genius or peculiar constitu tion, i.e., it belongs primarily to one class and secondarily to the others. I have always thought, and I believe it could be proved, that every language must conform to some part or other of the theory above indicated in outline, and in that case tho theory would be truly what I have ventured to call</page><page sequence="8">572 A THEORY OF UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR, it?"A Theory of Universal Grammar." That such a theory exists in nature and only awaits unearthing, I have no doubt whatever. Mankind, when untrammelled by ' teaching,' acts on an instinctive assumption of its existence, for children and adults alike always learn a language in the same way if left to themselves. They copy the enunciation of complete sentences from experts in it to start with, learning to divide up and vary the sentences so acquired afterwards, and this is not only the surest but also the quickest way of mastering a foreign tongue correctly. Its rules of grammar, as stated in books about it, are mastered later on, and in every case where they only are studied there comes about that book knowledge of the language, which is everywhere by instinct acknow ledged to be a matter apart from and inferior to the practical or true knowledge. I use the term ' true' here, because, unless this is possessed, whatever knowledge may be acquired fails to fulfil its object of finding a new mode of communicating with one's fellow man. But it seems to me that if the laws laid down in the set Grammars were to follow closely on the laws instinctively obeyed by the untutored man, and to do no violence to what he feels to be the logical sequence of ideas, the divorce between practical and linguistic knowledge?between know ledge b}r the ear and knowledge by the eye?would not be so complete as it is nowadays. And not only that, if the laws could be stated in the manner above suggested, they could be more readily grasped and better retained in the memory, and languages would consequently be more quickly, more thoroughly, and more easily learned, both by children and adult9, than is now practicable. Looked at thus, the matter becomes onp of the greatest practical importance. This is what I have attempted to achieve in stating my theory; but, assuming it to be fundamentally right and correctly worked out, it will be observed that it reverses the accepted order of teaching, alters many accepted definitions, and, while admitting much that is</page><page sequence="9">AS APPLIED TO SAVAGE LANGUAGES. 573 usually taught, it both adds and omits many details. Taken all round, it is a wide departure from orthodox teaching. Hence the interest that Mr. Portman's efforts possess for myself. But, as I have already pointed out in ray review of his book, he has not strictly applied the theory, and has mixed it up in his application with the accepted teaching. I will therefore now put it to the test in my own way, using for the purpose Mr. Portman's sixth chapter on " The Andaman Fire Legend," which he gives in all the five languages of the South Andaman group. The story is in each case a very short one, and is given by Mr. Portman as follows :? THE ANDAMAN FIRE LEGEND. Aka-Beada Language. Interlined Text.

The ancestors thus got fire in Min-tong-tauk village. In making an analysis of the language in which the above story is couched, it is at first all plain sailing, and it will be seen at a glance from any of these sentences that the Andamanese sentence is the expression of a complete meaning, capable at once of being divided into subject and predicate. This can be seen as under, making S. mean that the word is in the subjective, and P. that it is in the predicative, part of the sentence. Aka-Bkaua. Taul-1'oko-tima-len (P.)

The above method of syntactical analysis shows that all the languages arrive at a complete meaning, i.e. construct their sentences, in precisely the same way. In other words, they are all the outcome of the same, habit, of thought. It shows further, that that habit of thought is the simplest possible. Complications or extensions of ideas barely arise, and then only in tho most direct form. E.g., Puluga-Vi toago-choapa (God-his-platform-fire, i.e. the fire from God's platform) and Ongot atyaukat monga, ongot oarotichal-cnate Rokiva-l'artonga-baroija okodalnga-Vare (they fish becoming, they carrying-taking-by Rokwa-rartonga-village-in fire lighting-did, i.e. they became fish and taking (tho fire) to the village of Rokwa-Par tonga lit a fire). The only signs of old habit or use in tho languages are the frequent ellipses, indicating familiarity with them. The analysis also shows the languages to be purely colloquial, and therefore to have never been subjected to the modifications necessary when communication by signs, i.e. by writing, is resorted to. In short, the analysis seems to prove that the languages aro the outcome of minds capable of but a very limited range of thought. Here, then, is one measure of tho " Universal Theory " as a working hypothesis. Leaving the syntax here and passing on to tho accidence according to the Theory, it will bo best to state for the sake of brevity of exposition, that an analysis of the words composing the Andamanese sentences shows that all the languages are agglutinative; i.e., the words are formed by</page><page sequence="17">AS APPLIED TO SAVAGE LANGUAGES. 581 means of affixes to roots and stems without alteration of the radical forms of the affixes. It will also show that, like all other languages, they have not developed solely on one principle, and that rudiments of synthesis, or the attachment of affixes to roots and stems with alteration of form, are also present. Andamanese words ure, therefore, as a rule, easily dis membered, and further examination will show that all the forms of affixes, i.e. prefixes, infixes, and suffixes, are present in them by agglutination. The use of the infixes is to modify the root or stem, and so they are what I have called radical affixes. The use of the prefixes is principally as radical affixes, but also to indicate the functions of the words or their relation to other words. They can, therefore, also be functional affixes. The use of the suffixes is likewise twofold: as functional affixes, or to indicate the inherent qualities of the words, i.e. to show which class they belong to. They are, therefore, either functional or qualitative affixes. With this preliminary information let us set to work to analyze the words in the Legend, omitting proper names for the present, and premising that in the following analysis R. = Root, S. = Stem, P.F. = Functional prefix, P.R. = Radical prefix, I. = Infix, S.F. = Functional suffix, S.Q. = Qualitative suffix.

(7) Jangil (S.). ' the ancestors.' Now these proper names bear out in every respect the conclusions to be drawn from the former analysis, because they are clearly either mere roots or stems, or compounds of roots and stems thrown together by means of infixed affixes, the infixes themselves being in their nature plain functional prefixes of what is usually called a " pronominal character." The sense of the words is also usually immediately apparent, showing the difficulty the speakers have in getting out of the region of concrete into that of abstract ideas?indicating, that is, the ' savage' condition of their minds. But the ' savage' nature of the languages comes out even more clearly if we apply the theory in another way, i.e., if we exclude the proper names and pick out the roots or steins of all sorts to be found in the five versions of the " Fire Legend." This will show that, leaving out persons aud places, the five tribes tell five versions of an abstract story by an effort of memory with tho aid between them of only seveu separate indicators (nouns), seventeen separate predicators (verbs), and eight separate radicals, indicating the other parts of speech. Only once is an explicator (adj.) used in all the versions; only thrice an</page><page sequence="25">AS APPLIED TO SAVAGE LANGUAGES. 589 illustrator (adv.), and then only once in any instance in the same language. No introductory words to sentences are used at all; only one conjunction between words and only two between sentences, referring in each case to what has been already said. There are no forward references, and there is only one referent substitute (pronoun, in this case of the 3rd person). In telling the Legend, we therefore see that, to employ the old familiar phraseology, the Aka-Beada use two nouns, eight verbs, one ref. conj., and one pronoun. The Akar-Bale use five nouns, nine verbs, one adv., one conj., one pron. in two forms. The Puchikwar use one noun (fire), six verbs, one adv., one ref. conj. in two forms, one pron. The Aukau-Juwoi use two nouns, three verbs, one adj., one pron. The Kol use three nouns, seven verbs, one adv., one pron. Poverty of thought and idea could hardly go lower than this. We are really brought face to face with the speech of undeveloped savages. The evidence is as follows:? Taiiles of Roots and Stems. Indicators (Nouns). EngliHli. Aka-ltea&lt;la. Akar-13alc.

To the Andamanese mind roots present themselves as being divided off roughly into classes as under, to use Mr. Portman's classification, which is, of course, an impossible one, according to the general system of grammar he purports to follow. But, as his classification is sufficient for the purpose of illustrating my points, I shall not now disturb it. Mr. Portman's classification is stated by him thus :? The Andamanese roots appear to be divided into five groups, which are as follows :? (1) Names of parts of the body, with special reference to the human body. Roots referring to the human race generally. (2) Names of other natural animate and inanimate objects. (3) Roots which are capable of being converted into either Explicators or Predicators, as well as being Indicators. (4) Pronouns. (5) Postpositions, Adverbs, Conjunctions, Exclamations, Proper Names of Andamanese men and women, the Flower Names given to Andamanese girls, Honorific Names, etc., Particles. Now, with reference to the above statement, the main function of the radical prefixes is to indicate the group to which a root belongs, either primarily or secondarily by implication. In the groups, or in some of them at least, there are sub-groups, e.g., in group 1 we find sub groups, of which the following are samples:? Table of Sun-Groups in Group I. English. Aka-Bendn.

There are, however, radical prefixes, whose function is purely to modify the meaning of a root, and so to form, in combination with the root, a pure stem. Here are instances out of Mr. Portman's book :? Yop(-da) is, in Aka-Beada, ' soft' or ' pliable *; then, a sponge is ot-yop, soft; a cane is auto-yop, pliable; a pencil is aka-yop or auko-yop, pointed; the human body is ab-yop, soft; certain parts of it are ong-yop, soft; fallen trees are ar-yop, rotten; an adze is ig-yop, blunt. Chaurog(-nga) means in Aka-Beada generally ' tie(ing) up.' Unmodified by a radical prefix it refers to the tieing up of bundles of fire\vood or plantains, whence chawog nga(~da), a faggot. But when so modified it can mean as follows: aut-chaurog-nga, tieing up the carcases of dead pigs so that they may be carried on the back; aka-chaurog nga, tieing up jack-fruit into bundles; archaurog-nga, tieing up birds; ong-chaurog-nga, tieing together the feet of little pigs while alive to prevent escape. The anthropomorphism of the Andamanese, already noticed, induces them to refer all words, capable of such reference, directly to themselves, by means of referent prefixes to stems composed of roots plus radical prefixes; thus :? The Head. English. Aka-Beada. Akar-Bale. Puchikwar. Aukau-Juwoi.

And so it is for all the ' persons.' Also when the reference is possible to "persons in the plural," some, but not by any means all, tho Andamanese emphasize the fact of such reference by modifying the form of the radical prefix to indicate it, thus:? Aka-Beada. Akar-Bale. Sing. Plu. Sing. Plu. ot otot aut autot ong oiot aung aungtot aka akat akar akat ab at ap at ig itig id idit ar arat ar arat No such alterations take place in Puchikwar and Aukau Juwoi, except to differentiate ' thy ' from ' your.' Thus: in Puchikwar, ante, sing., is autcl, plu. ; and in Aukau Juwoi autau, sing., is autel, plu.; and.so on. To the differentiating plu. radical prefixes are added, where necessary, functional prefixes, thus :~ English. Aka-Beada. Akar-Bale. Puchikwar. Aukau-Juwoi. our m'otot m'uutot m'aute m'autau your ng'otot ng'autot ng'autel ng autel Another noteworthy fact, again due to anthropomorphism, is that usually the Andamanese languages conceive every word, when possible, as referred to 'the 3rd person,' e.g., ot-chcta-da is strictly not ' head,' but ' his head.' So otot-cheta-da is strictly ' their heads.' And so, in order to express a clear reference to a '3rd person,' where the context renders such necessary, they do so by means of a referent prefix evolved for the purpose, thus :? English. Aka-Beada. Akar-Bale. Puchikwar. Aukau-Juwoi. Kol. Sing. Plu. Sing. Plu. Sing. Plu. Sing. Plu. Sing. Plu. -'s, its ) 1'- 1'- 1'. T- 1'- len'- 1?- len'- 1'- len% his (their) J</page><page sequence="31">AS APPLIED TO SAVAGE LANGUAGES. 595 The last three forms seem to explain the origin of this curious habit, for in thera we find a special referent prefix for ' their,' and so, when it is necessarj' to make ' their9 clearly referent, we find a second prefix le superadded. We can therefore also say that the referent prefix /'- seems to indicate one of the signs of ' growth ' in the languages, as we now have them. Lastly, when tho natural conditions require that an Andamanese should throw into a single expression more than one idea, he does so by direct and simple combination, with the aid of his referent prefix for ' its/ as may be seen from the proper names and some of the compound words in the texts of the Legend. Thus: Taul-l'-okotima, Taul tree-it8-corner, i.e. (the village at) the corner (among) the Taul-trees; Keri-P-ongtauwer, Keri-tree-its-sand, i.e. (the village on) the sand (among) the Keri-trees. So here, again, it appears to me that the languages, even in the complicated forms and usage of the prefixes, show themselves to be purely and directly the expression of 'savage9 thought, affording yet another measure of the Theory as a working hypothesis. Now, of course, the Andamanese go far beyond this skeleton in the details of their speech, but everything else to be found in it seems to me to be a development of these fundamental laws, arising out of a mere following up to a further expansion the ideas contained in thera, or out of the necessities of speech itself. There are no more further 'principles' to explain, so far as I can at present see, and I would refer the reader to Mr. Portman's careful and laborious pages for a proof of the present assertions. I would also take leave to refer him to those pages and to the foregoing observations, should he desire to judge for himself how far the Theory may be called a successful attempt to meet the conditions. I will now proceed to state the Theory in skeleton form, believing that its bones can be clothed with the necessary flesh for every possible language by the process of direct natural development of detail, ? that a clear and fair</page><page sequence="32">596 A THEORY OF UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR, explanation of all the phenomena of speech can be logically deduced from the general principles enunciated therein. It seems to me to be necessary to say very little at present by way of preface. The Theory is based on the one phenomenon, which must of necessity be constant in every variety of speech, viz. the expression of a complete meaning, or, technically, the sentence. Words are then considered as components of tho sentence, firstly as to tho functions performed by them, and next as to the means whereby they can be made to fulfil their functions. Lastly, languages are considered according to their methods of composing sentences and words. This course of reasoning commends itself to my mind as logically correct, and if it be so, must, when properly worked out, explain every phenomenon of speech. Terminology is a matter of convenience, and I have in the exposition of the Theory, changed the familiar terminology of the Grammars of the orthodox sort merely as a con venience. The question presents itself to mo as one of choosing between tho dovising of new terms and the giving of new definitions to well-known old ones, used habitually in other senses. To my own mind it is easior to apprehend and retain in the memory the meaning of a new word than to keep before the mind a new definition of an old and familiar one. Hence my choice. But this is so much a personal matter, that it is a question of indifference to myself which method is adopted. The familiar terminology has accordingly been changed in this wise. The old noun, adjective, verb, adverb, pre position, and conjunction become indicator, explicator, predicator, illustrator, connector, and referent coujunctor, while interjections and pronouns become integers and referent substitutes. Certain classes also of the adverbs are converted into introducers. Gender, number, person, tense, conjugation, and declension all disappear in the general description of kinds of inflexion?the object becomes, the complement of the predicate, and concord becomes correlated variation. Also for obvious reasons subjects,</page><page sequence="33">AS APPLIED TO SAVAGE LANGUAGES. 597 necessarily occupying an important place in Grammars which aim at explaining all that there is to say about a language ? such as its phonology, orthography, and elocution ? are not now considered in the exposition of the Theory. THE SKELETON OF A THEORY OF UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR. Speech is a mode of communication between man and man by expression. Speech may be communicated orally through the ear by talking, optically through the eye by signs, tangibly through the skin by the touch. Languages are varieties of speech. The units of languages are sentences. A sentence is the expression of a complete meaning. A sentence may consist of a single expression of a meaning. A single expression of a meaning is a word. A sentence may also consist of many words. When it consists of more than one word, it has two parts. These parts are the subject and the predicate. The subject of a sentence is the matter communicated or discussed in the sentence. The predicate of a sentence is the com munication or discussion of that matter in the sentence. The subject may consist of one word. It may also consist of many words. When it consists of more than one word, there is a principal word and additional words. The predicate may consist of one word. It may also consist of many words. When it consists of more than one word, there is a principal word and additional words. Therefore the components of a sentence are words placed either in j.r.a.b. 1899. 39</page><page sequence="34">598 A THEORY OF UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR, the subjective or predicative part of it, having a relation to each other in that part. This relation is that of principal and subordinate. Since the words composing the parts of a sentence are placed in a position of relation to each other, they fulfil functions. The function of the principal word of the subject is to indicate the matter communicated or discussed by expressing it. The function of the subordinate words of the subject may be to explain that indication, or to illustrate the explanation of it. The function of the principal word of the predicate is to indicate the communication or discussion of the subject by expressing it. The function of the subordinate words of the predicate may be to illustrate that indication, or to complete it. The predicate may be completed by a word explanatory of the subject or indicative of the complement. Therefore, primarily, the words composing a sentence are either? (1) Indicators, or indicative of the subject. (2) Kxplicatohs, or explanatory of the subject. (3) Prkdigators, or indicative of the predicate. (4) Illustrators, or illustrative of the predicate, or of the explanation of the subject. (5) Complements, or complementary of the predicate. And complements are either indicators or explicators. Therefore also complementary indicators may be explained by explicators, and this explanation may be illustrated by illustrators. And complementary explicators may be illus trated by illustrators. But, since speech is a mode of communication between man and man, mankind speaks with a purpose. The function of sentences is to indicate the purpose of speech. The purpose of speech is either (1) affirmation, (2) denial, (3) interrogation, (4) exhortation, or (5) information. Purpose may be indicated in a sentence by the position of its components, b}' variation of the forms of its com ponents, or by the addition of introductory words to express it Or INTRODUCERS.</page><page sequence="35">AS APPLIED TO SAVAGE LANGUAGES. 599 Also, since the function of sentences is to indicate the purpose of speech, connected purposes may be indicated by connected sentencks. The relation of connected sentences to each other is that of principal and subordinate. This relation may be expressed by the position of the connected sentences, by variation of the forms of their components, or by the addition of referent words expressing it or referents. A referent word may express the inter-relation of connected sentences by conjoining them, or by substituting itself in the subordinate sentence for the word in the principal sentence to which it refers. Referents are there fore conjunctous or substitutes. Also, since the words composing the parts of a sentence are placed in a position of relation to each other, this relation may be expressed in the sentence by the addition of connecting words expressing it or connectors, or by variation of the forms of the words themselves. Also, since predicators are especially connected with indicators; explicators with indicators ; illustrators and complements with predicators; and referent substitutes with their principals; there is an intimate relation between predicator and indicator, indicator and explicator, illustrator and predicator, predicator and complement, referent sub stitute and principal. This intimate relation may be expressed by the addition of connecting words to express it, or by correlated variation in the forms of the especially connected words. Since speech is a mode of communication between man and man by expression, that communication may be made complete without complete expression. Speech may, there fore, be partly expressed, or be partly left unexpressed. And since speech may be partly left unexpressed, referent words may refer to the unexpressed portions, and words may be related to unexpressed words or correlated to them. Referent substitutes may, therefore, indicate the subject of a sentence.</page><page sequence="36">600 A THEORY OF UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR, Again, many words may be used collectively to express the meaning of one word. The collective expression of a single meaning by two or more words is a phrase. The relation of a phrase to the word it represents is that of original and substitute. A phrase, therefore, fulfils the function of its original. Since a phrase is composed of words used collectively to represent a single expression of a meaning, that meaning may be complete in itself. Therefore a phrase may be a sentence. A sentence substituted for a word is a clause. A clause, therefore, fulfils the function of its original. Since clauses represent words, a sentence may be com posed of clauses, or partly of clauses and partly of words. A sentence composed of clauses, or partly of clauses and partly of words, is a period. Therefore a word is functionally either? (1) A sentence in itself or an integer, (2) An essential component of a sentence, or (3) An optional component of a sentence. The essential components of a sentence are (1) in dicators, (2) explicators, (3) predicators, (4) illustrators, (5) complements. And complements are either indicators or explicators. The optional components of a sentence are (1) intro ducers, (2) referents, (3) connectors. And referents are either referent con junctors or referent substitutes. To recapitulate : Functionally a word is either? (1) An integer, or a sentence in itself. (2) An indicator, or indicative of the subject or com plement of a sentence. (3) An bxplicator, or explanatory of its subject or complement. (4) A predicator, or indicative of its predicate.</page><page sequence="37">AS APPLIED TO SAVAGE LANGUAGES. 601 (5) An illustrator, or illustrative of its predicate or complement, or of the explanation of its subject or complement. (6) A connector, or explanatory of the inter-relation of its components. (7) An introducer, or explanatory of its purpose. (8) A referent coNJUKCTOR, or explanatory of the inter-relation of connected sentences by joining them. (9) A referent substitute, or explanatory of the inter-relation of connected sentences by sub stitution of itself in the subordinate sentence for the word in the principal sentence to which it refers. An individual word may fulfil all the functions of words, or it may fulfil only one function, or it may fulfil many functions. When a word can fulfil more than one function, the function it fulfils in a particular sentence is indicated by its position in the sentence, either without variation of form or with variation of form. There are, therefore, classes of words. Since a word may fulfil only one function, there are as many classes as there are functions. Also, since a word may fulfil more than one function, it may belong to as many classes as there are functions which it can fulfil. A word may, therefore, be transferable from one class to another; and this transfer may be effected by its position in the sentence without variation of form, or with variation of form. The class to which a word belongs may, therefore, be indicated by its form. When a word is transferable from one class to another, it belongs primarily to a certain class, and secondarily to other classes. But, since by transfer to another class from the class to which it primarily belongs (with or without variation of form) the word fulfils a new function, it becomes a new word connected with the original word. The relation</page><page sequence="38">602 A THEORY OF UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR, between connected words is that of parent and offshoot. Since the form of a word may indicate its class, both parent and offshoot may assume the forms of the classes to which they respectively belong. When connected words differ in form, they consist of a principal part or stem, and an additional part or functional affix. The function of the stem is to indicate the meaning of the word. The function of the functional affix is to modify that meaning with reference to the function of the word. This modification may be effected by indicating the class to which the word belongs, or by indicating its relation or correlation to the other words in the sentence. A stem may be an original meaning or simple stem, or it may be a modification of an original meaning or compound stem. A compound stem consists of a principal part or root, and additional parts or radical affixes. The function of the root is to indicate the original meaning of the 8tern. The function of the radical affixes is to indicate the modifications by which the meaning of the root has been changed into the meaning of tho stem. Since words fulfil functions and belong to classes, they possess inherent qualities. The inherent qualities of words may be indicated by qualitative affixes. Affixes are, therefore, functional, or indicative of the function of the word to which they are affixed, or of its relation or correlation to the other words in the sentence; radical, or indicative of the modifications of meaning which its root has undergone; qualitative, or indicative of its inherent qualities. Affixes may be? (1) prefixes, or prefixed to the root, stem, or word; (2) infixes, or fixed into the root, stem, or word ; (3) suffixes, or suffixed to the root, stem, or word.</page><page sequence="39">AS APPLIED TO SAVAGE LANGUAGES. 603 Affixes may be attached to roots, stems, or words in their full form, or in a varied form. When there is variation of form, there is inflexion or inseparability of the affix from the root, stem, or word. All the functions of affixes can, therefore, be fulfilled by inflexion; and inflected words may conform to particular kinds of inflexion. Since a sentence is composed of words placed in a particular order, with or without variation of form, the meaning of a sentence is rendered complete by the com bination of the meaning of its components with their position, or with their forms, or partly with their position and partly with their forms. Since sentences are the units of languages, and words are the components of sentences, and since languages are varieties of speech, languages may vary in the forms of their words, or in the position in which their words are placed in the sentence, or partly in the forms and partly in tho position of their words. There are, therefore, classes OF LANGUAGES. Since the meaning of a sentence may be rendered complete either by the position of its words or by their form, languages aro primarily divisible into syntactical languages, or those that express complete meaning by the position of their words; and into formative languages, or those that express complete meaning by the forms of their words. Since words are varied in form by the addition of affixes, and since affixes may be attached to words in an unaltered or altered form, formative languages are divisible into agglutinative languages, or those that add affixes without alteration ; and into synthetic languages, or those that add affixes with alteration. Since affixes may be prefixes, infixes, or suffixes, agglu tinative and synthetic languages are each divisible into (1) pre-mutative languages, or those that prefix their</page><page sequence="40">604 A THEORY OF UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR. affixes; (2) intro-mutative languages, or those that infix their affixes; (3) post-mutativb languages, or those that suffix their affixes. Languages are, therefore, by class either syntactical or formative. And formative languages are either agglutinative or synthetic. And agglutinative and synthetic languages are either pre-mutative, intro-mutative, or post-mutative. A language may belong entirely to one class, or it may belong to more than one class. When a language belongs to more than one class, it belongs primarily to a particular class, and secondarily to other classes. Since the meauing of a sentence is rendered complete by the meaning of its words in combination with their forms or position, languages may be connected languages, or those that vary the forms or the position, without varying the meanings, of their words. Since variation of form is effected by the addition of affixes in an unaltered or altered form, connected languages may vary the affixes without variation of the roots or stems of their words. Connected languages whose sterns are common belong to a group. Connected languages whose roots are common belong to a family; and, therefore, all connected languages belonging to a group belong to the same family.</page></plain_text>
