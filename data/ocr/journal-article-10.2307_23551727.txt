<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEXISM VS. SUPERHUMAN AGENCY IN THE THERAVADA BUDDHIST RITUAL SYSTEM D. Jason Slone and Joel Mort There are currently no fully ordained nuns in the Theravada Buddhist system. The doctrinal reason is because ordination ritual guidelines require the presence of senior nuns (of which, due to the dissolution of the nun orders, there are none) at a female's ordination. A more critical reason offered by feminists is that sexism (tex tual, traditional, and institutional) maintains the status quo. We argue that the Ritual Form Hypothesis of McCauley and Lawson (2002) best explains the con tinued lack of nun ordinations by making claims about cognitive constraints on ritual efficacy. Furthermore we predict that the institutional prevention of full nun ordina tions will persist unless a new superhuman agent (i.e. a new Buddha) emerges with a new doctrine or unless Buddhists discover a different teaching that stipulates new conditions for ordination. Both are unlikely, however, given Theravada's theological conservatism. 1. Introduction Scientists have been criticized for being professionally uninterested in normative issues. A common criticism is that scientists narrowly pur sue what "is," leaving what "ought to be" to philosophers and other humanities scholars (Holton 1978). An even more radical criticism, com ing primarily from postmodernist sociologists of knowledge, is that sci entists actually do not discover facts at all but rather merely construct ideological discourses that allow scientists as members of an elite group to exploit institutional hierarchies for personal gain. Science thus is a social construction of reality that reflects the interests of scientists, not society at large (Foucault 1970, 1972; Latour &amp; Woolgar 1979). However, some actual scientists and philosophers of science have begun to retort. Most forceful in this camp are those in the interdis ciplinary field known as the cognitive sciences, a non-behaviorist approach to the study of human behavior. These scholars have begun to track what "oughts" are possible and plausible given the constraints of human cognition. According to this view, claims about how humans ought to think and act must be informed by what humans are capable and likely of thinking and doing. This might be viewed as a criticism © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2005 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion Also available online - www.brill.nl 17, 134-148</page><page sequence="2">SEXISM VS. SUPERHUMAN AGENCY 135 of a "non-naturalistic" fallacy—that the ought will determine the is (Barkow, Cosmides, &amp; Tooby 1992; Gopnik, Meltzoff, &amp; Kuhl 1999; Pinker 1997, 2002; Ridley 1996; Wilson 1998). Among those challenged by the theories and findings from the cognitive sciences are socio-cultural feminists operating within the paradigm J. Tooby &amp; L. Cosmides (1992) have dubbed the "Standard Social Science Model" (SSSM) of human behavior, which assumes a minimalist domain-general theory of mind. They write, The SSSM denies that 'human nature'—the evolved architecture of the human mind—can play any notable role as a generator of significant organization in human life. In so doing, it. . . relegates the architecture of the human mind to the delimited role of embodying the 'capacity for culture.' [The human mind] is . . . [like] a general-purpose computer. Such a computer doesn't come pre-equipped with its own programs, but instead— and this is the essential point—it obtains the programs that tell it what to do from the outside, from 'culture.' (Tooby &amp; Cosmides 1992, p. 29) In the SSSM all human beings are presumably born equal and inno cent, if not "noble", and therefore concepts like gender, race, class, nationality, etc. are cultural constructions. Therefore prejudices like sex ism, racism, and ethnocentrism can be educated away, if the proper ideas are learned and the correct social policies institutionalized, because sexist people have learned to be so and therefore can be deprogrammed (Alcoff 1994; cf. Pinker 2002). Religious systems, like other cultural ideas and institutions, have been susceptible to such critical analyses. For example, feminist scholars of religion have sought goals like changing religious systems worldwide toward a "post-patriarchal" religion (Christ &amp; Plaskow 1992; Gross 1996; King 1995; Plaskow &amp; Christ 1989; Goldenberg 1979). Buddhism has recendy been subjected to this type of criticism. One of the pre sumably most "sexist" facts in contemporary Buddhism occurs in the Theravada traditions of Southeast Asia: there are no fully ordained Theravada nuns (as recognized by established JVikayas [monastic orders]) and few Southeast Asians seem to be willing to change the status quo. The reason for the absence of nuns in Theravada is contested. One reason is based on a technical matter. No matter how desirable it might be to ordain women, to do so is simply impermissible by the rules of the Bhikkhunivibangha, which states that at least five senior bhikkhunis (nuns) and senior bhikkhus (monks) must be present for the ordination of a new bhikkhuni. Because the bhikkhuni lineage dissolved some time after the 10th century, however, there are no longer any fully ordained bhikkhunis available to perform new ordinations (Falk 2000).</page><page sequence="3">136 D. JASON SLONE AND JOEL MORT A feminist view of the situation argues that adherence to this rule reflects the androcentrism inherent in Southeast Asian attitudes that under-gird patriarchal institutions in either (or both) Southeast Asian culture, or its Indian and/or Chinese heritages, or in Buddhism itself. Among those with the latter view are feminist Buddhists who seek to separate patriarchal practices, presumably introduced by sexist monks in charge of texts and traditions, from the "true" (actual or intended) Buddhism of the historical Buddha some 2500 years ago (Gross 1993, 1996; Kabilsingh 1991). Is "systematic sexism," either traditional or textual, the only expla nation for why Theravada Buddhists by and large refuse to fully ordain nuns or might there be another explanation? We argue, inspired by the explanatory successes elsewhere in the cognitive science of religion, for the latter on two grounds: one substantive and the other theoreti cal. First, despite gender reforms in other religions such as liberal sects of Christianity and Judaism, "systematic sexism" is not a satisfactory explanation in the case of Theravada the because the efforts of femi nists to overturn the status quo have fallen largely on deaf ears. By and large Theravadins seem unwilling, or more accurately, from their view, unable, to go along with the feminists' calls for "Buddhism after patriarchy," to use R. Gross' (1993) phrase. Academic feminist efforts to change or bypass the Vinaya-Pitaka (monastic rules) are chiefly rooted in cultural and textual hermeneutics with the hope being that through re-interpretation of traditions Buddhists will be inspired to reform the system and to proceed with full ordination of women. On the other hand, "social vision" feminists seek to change the patriarchal institu tions of the Theravada system itself by, for example, simply creating new institutions. One such strategy is being employed by small groups of women throughout Southeast Asia who are living as if they were fully ordained nuns—shaving their heads, donning the ascetic robes, and living by the many rules of the Vinaya-Pitaka (Bartholomeusz 1994; Gross 1993; Wijayasundara 1999). Others yet have sought full ordina tion in nun lineages outside of Southeast Asia. For example, the Thai Buddhist feminist C. Kabilsingh has received ordination in a Chinese Buddhist lineage on the grounds that a Sri Lankan Theravada lineage may have been preserved in China and today is active in Korea, Japan, and Vietnam (Kabilsingh 1991). The efforts of these scholars and activists to revive the nun lineage are noble but isolated. The majority of Southeast Asian Theravadins, men and women alike, simply do not support these progressive women. R. Gross's comments on the matter are telling:</page><page sequence="4">SEXISM VS. SUPERHUMAN AGENCY 137 Southeast Asia received the older, Theravada form of Buddhism, often considered to be the most conservative towards women. Though the nuns' order was transmitted to Sri Lanka, and was once strong there, it has died out in all current forms of Theravada Buddhism. Contemporary attempts to revive nuns' ordination lineages are extremely controversial and are often met with extreme skepticism, or even hostility. Furthermore, in Theravada countries, the monastic-lay hierarchy is quite strong and lay Buddhists are not usually expected to be seriously involved in meditation or in philosophical studies of Buddhism. Thus, women's options are quite limited. Women can take on a renunciate's lifestyle, but usually they are not officially recognized as monastics and their status is much lower than that of the monks (Gross 1993: 11). Second, in addition to the fact that most Southeast Asian Theravadins continue to support or at least tolerate the maintenance of the status quo, "sexism" itself does not provide a satisfactory explanation; it merely shifts the burden of what is to be explained. "Sexism" begs the ques tion of why so many people—again, men and women alike—seem so naturally receptive to such ideas and practices in the first place. Epidemiologically oriented scholars of culture have noted that when a cultural representation is held on a widespread basis, scholars should suspect that cognitive constraints are catalytic variables at work because shared cultural representations require cognitive biases for successful transmission (Sperber 1996). In this case explaining the tenacious adher ence to this systematic rule requires identifying the structural constraints that inform individual's judgments about technical matters sensitive to culturally specific religious systems. 2. Cognitive Constraints and Cultural Forms Psychologists have shown that the cognitive representations people employ include information that is both given and assumed, that is, explicit and tacit (Nisbett &amp; Ross 1980). Although "sexism" can mean either to hold androcentric attitudes or to support patriarchal institu tions (Gross 1996), both forms of sexism assume beliefs and desires that include gender-specific aspects. To have beliefs and desires is a quality of an intentional agent, but one need not articulate the tacit informa tion that "sexist people are intentional agents" because the speaker and the listener in a conversation about sexism share the same cognitive assumptions, viz. that intentional agents have beliefs and desires. Human thought is underpinned by a great deal of such tacit infor mation; religious thought is no exception (Boyer 1994, 2001; Lawson &amp; McCauley 1990; McCauley &amp; Lawson 2002). Cognitive representations,</page><page sequence="5">138 D. JASON SLONE AND JOEL MORT including but not limited to those of religious agents, assume a host of information that is non-trivially non-cultural, meaning grounded in domain-specific intuitive ontological representations of the world and its workings (Hirschfeld &amp; Gelman 1990). For example, Christians, Jews, and Muslims represent God as forgiving; a representation that neces sarily results in from tacit inferences about the mental workings of agents, in this case God. For God to be forgiving, God must have beliefs and desires. To have beliefs and desires, God must have a mind. If God has a mind, then God is an intentional agent. In this way, rep resentations of gods, goddesses, and the like are constrained by intu itive inferences about domain-specific ontological kinds in general: agents (Barrett 1999; Barrett &amp; Keil 1996; Boyer 1994, 2001). A good deal of human thought, again religious thought included, involves inferring representations about the world and its workings not just from explicit ideas found in culturally transmitted systems (e.g. the ology) but also from intuitive tacit knowledge. Explicit knowledge includes shared conceptual schemes such as official theological doctrines and other culturally recurring 'folk' ideas like "The gods are watching. . . so you'd better be good". Such knowledge is subject to continual trans formation as it is spread through a population because (among other reasons, such as memory constraints and schematic variations) trans mission involves processes of inferential reasoning by each individual, not exact replication of ideas (Sperber 1996). The influence of intuitive inferential reasoning often results in "theological incorrectness"—hold ing ideas that diverge from official dogma—because tacit knowledge often differs from prescribed knowledge (Slone 2004; cf. Barrett 1999). Generating a full account of the kinds of religious ideas people actu ally have, therefore, requires the gathering of both explicidy held learned ideas as well as the tacit ideas people employ in real-time problem solv ing contexts.' 1 This point has profound methodological consequences for the study of religion. To date, most research in the study of religion is qualitative and hermeneutic. Textual exegesis, interviews, and participation-observation are common methods employed. Yet psychologists have shown that conclusions about human thought, motivation, behavior, etc. based on data gathered by such methods are unreliable because humans have no direct access to their own mental states. Self-reports are themselves interpretations (Nisbett &amp; Ross 1977) and so interpretations of inter pretations if anything move us farther away from the object of inquiry rather than closer to it (Sperber 1975). In contrast, experimental methods allow researchers to unearth tacit mental processes that approximate people's actual thoughts. Therefore an important future development in the study of religion ought to be, in my view, the incorporation of quantitative methods in graduate school religious studies curricula.</page><page sequence="6">SEXISM VS. SUPERHUMAN AGENCY 139 3. Will the Real Buddhists Please Stand Up? Understanding the confluence of the cultural and the cognitive on actual representations offers an approach to religion that helps to explain enig mas in the ethnographic record. Theological incorrectness creates a conceptual problem for the study of religion because if religious ideas that people believe are actually learned from culture institutions then all members of a culture should hold and transmit the ideas reported as institutionally orthodox. The profound contribution of ethnography to the study of religion has been to show that this is emphatically not the case (Slone 2004). There is an old and now fairly well known issue in the study of reli gion about whether or not Theravada Buddhism is a religion because its theology is purportedly non-theistic (Southwold 1978; Spiro 1966). This is really a non-issue since the empirical claim that Buddhism is non-theistic is false. Most scholars familiar with Theravada now know that this godless image of Buddhism was constructed in the modern period (19th-20th c.) largely (though not entirely; see Hilliest 1995) in response to the pressures of colonialism. Reformers, both Western and Eastern, lay and monastic, sought to counter European claims that Buddhism was backward by constructing from philosophical passages in the Abhidharma and elsewhere, a view of the Buddha and of the Dharma that could be in line with science and modernity (Almond 1988; Coleman 2001; Gombrich &amp; Obeyesekere 1988; Lopez 1995b; Prothero 1995; Tweed 1992). Anthropologists of Buddhism have rectified this skewed image of Buddhism over the past few decades by collecting ethnographic data which reveal that Buddhists both conceptually and ritually treat the Buddha and other agents as superhuman, representing him as having abilities like omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence (e.g. Davis 1984; Dharmasena 1991; Lopez 1995a; Reynolds &amp; Reynolds 1982; Schober 1997; Southwold 1984; Spiro 1970; Swearer 1995; Tambiah 1970, 1984; Terwiel 1975). Further, the historian of Buddhism G. Schopen has even shown that since the earliest periods of the tradition monks and nuns have engaged in prototypically religious activities with goals like achieving immortality, acquiring super-powers, and generat ing good luck (Schopen 1997). Similarly, we argue, tacit assumptions that underlie representations of a superhuman Buddha can be gleaned from instances of the con tinued refusal by monks to fully ordain women into the Sangha. Since Theravadins participate in ritual acts that are informed by a shared</page><page sequence="7">140 D. JASON SLONE AND JOEL MORT conceptual scheme that in fact does include superhuman agents, par ticipant-observation and/or scholarly interpretations of texts regarding the nature of the Buddha are not the only means to decipher how Buddhists actually represent the Buddha. In fact such methods, because they tend to employ theoretical assumptions about the 'cultural' origins of thought and, given the tendency toward theological correctness, might obscure how Buddhists actually represent the Buddha. These repre sentations of the Buddha as a superhuman agent can be identified by targeting tacit knowledge about his abilities that Buddhists employ 'on line' in the processes of reasoning solutions to conceptual problems— such as whether or not the Bhikkhuni order can be revived. In short, if he is not a superhuman agent then the rules of ordination he estab lished in the Vinaya-Pitaka ought not to be timelessly binding. In fact, they are for most Buddhists, revealing a tacit bias about his superhuman agency. 4. Superhuman Agency in Religious Rituals From the point of view of the cognitive science of religion what makes people religious is that they act on the presumed existence of super human agents. Attending to superhuman agents involves performing actions that please and persuade them to act on the participant's behalf (in this world and/or in the next). Ritual actions seek to accomplish practical, i.e., life changing, goals. (McCauley &amp; Lawson 2002) Cognitive scientists of religion have put forth two different hypothe ses, each with empirically testable predictions, about certain features of ritual. H. Whitehouse (1995, 2000, 2004) has offered a theory of "modes of religiosity". Broadly, according to Whitehouse's modes theory, cog nitive and cultural forces select for certain religious systems and against others over time. Successful transmission can be achieved in two ways as religious systems can diverge into one of two modes of religiosity along a spectrum of attractor positions. Anchoring one end of the spec trum is the "doctrinal" mode of religiosity. According to Whitehouse, religious systems operating in the doctrinal mode are marked by the following characteristics: They (1) consist of verbalized doctrines (some times codified in texts) (2) transmit ideas through repetition and rou tinization that (3) exploit semantic memory through the use of generalized schemata (4) propagate a universalistic ethos (to a large imagined com munity), (5) are diffuse in solidarity and cohesion, (6) rely on intellectual persuasion for authority of revelation, (7) link ideas logically for coherence,</page><page sequence="8">SEXISM VS. SUPERHUMAN AGENCY 141 (8) demand strict discipline for moral character, (9) widen the scope of the system via proselytization, (10) construct large scale but centralized institutional structures, (11) are led by enduring and dynamic leaders, (12) maintain fairly uniform beliefs and practices, and (13) preserve rigid diachronic features (i.e., groups tend to "break away"). At the other end of the spectrum are religious systems of the "imag istic" mode. Adherents in these systems invoke iconic imagery as the preferred style of codification, rely on spontaneous exegetical reflection, transmit ideas infrequently, use unique schemata for cognitive process ing (exploiting episodic memory), preach a particularistic ethos, encour age communal solidarity, legitimize revelatory authority via emotional and sensual stimulation, link ideas by loose connotations and sponta neous exegetical reflection, allow for some moral indulgence and license, remain localized and small in scale, are led by passive figureheads, reveal variable beliefs and practices, and are diachronically flexible (both incremental change and radical innovation are common). Religious systems tend to fall into one or the other of these two modal attractor positions. Whitehouse believes that empirical predic tions can be made about the dynamics of these systems. For example, his modes theory predicts that there is an inverse relationship between the frequency of a ritual performance and the level of arousal sur rounding the ritual event. Rituals performed frequently generate low levels of arousal, whereas rituals performed infrequently generate high levels of arousal. An example of an infrequently performed, high arousal ritual is full ordination into a Theravadin Buddhist monastic order. This occurs only once in an individual's life and entails great fanfare for the participant, his family, and the community (Swearer 1995). Not only is ordination a low-frequency/high-sensory-pageantry ritual as predicted by Whitehouse's modes theory, it is also what Lawson and McCauley have termed a "special agent ritual" according to their Ritual Form Flypothesis (Lawson &amp; McCauley 1990; McCauley &amp; Lawson 2002). They define rituals as transitive acts that include a superhuman agent somewhere in the formal description of the ritual representation. In addition they divide religious rituals into two types. The difference between the types depends on where in the formal description of the ritual representation—which may include nested rituals informing the ritual being performed—the superhuman agent is located. Lawson and McCauley term this the "Principle of Superhuman Agency". In the fol lowing descriptions a superhuman agent is represented where the aster isk (*) is located. In Special Agent Rituals (hereafter SAR) the superhuman agent is located in the agent slot and in Special Patient/Instrument</page><page sequence="9">142 D. JASON SLONE AND JOEL MORT Rituals (hereafter SPR) the superhuman agent is located in either the action complex slot or the patient slot. Special Agent Ritual: agent* action compkx patient E.G. Senior monk[s] (given special qualities by the Buddha) ordains initiate Special Patient/Instrument Ritual: agent action complex* patient* E.G. Puja: Buddhist makes offering to Buddha Each ritual type follows tacit—because human minds have intuitive rit ual competency—rules about ritual form that constrain and guide per formance (Barrett &amp; Lawson 2001). For example, SARs are performed only once because the agent of the ritual action has qualities informed by a superhuman agent; thus the effects of the rituals are represented as "super-permanent". Moreover, SAR can be reversed (via an "un doing" ritual). In Theravada Buddhism, the super-permanent effects of the ordination ritual can be represented in notions of merit (punna kamma) and in "disrobing". One of the primary motivations for "tak ing up the robes" is to gain merit for oneself or for others, usually par ents or ancestors, and merit has efficacy in other realms of the cosmos (e.g., where ancestors might reside) as well as in one's rebirth. However, once a man becomes a monk, he is not required to remain a monk for life. It is common for Southeast Asian young men to take ordina tion as a cultural rite of passage but then later to disrobe. As mentioned above, ritual officiates can perform special agent rit uals by virtue of having been the patient in a previous enabling, embed ded or nested rituals. For example, only an officially ordained person can perform ordination rituals. That person is recognized as officially ordained by means of his previous ordination ritual, which was per formed by an ordained ritual officiate who was himself ordained by an ordained ritual officiate, and so on. In contrast, SPR are repeatable and non-reversible. They are repeat able since the ritual agents are humans with no qualities informed by superhuman agents and therefore their effects are not super-permanent. Note for example that puja (offerings to the Buddha and other super human agents) and dana (offerings to the Sangha) are performed repeat edly but never reversed. Buddhists don't ritually take back their offerings, but monks disrobe all the time. Unlike cosmogonie myths, it is not turtles all the way down. In SAR the buck stops with the original enabling ritual performed by a foun dational superhuman agent. Notable examples are apostolic succession in Christianity, in which Jesus ordained Peter to be the "Rock" of the church, and the Buddha's ordination of Yasa, the first official bhikkhu</page><page sequence="10">SEXISM VS. SUPERHUMAN AGENCY 143 (Robinson &amp; Johnson 1982). The initial ritual performed by a super human agent begins the continuation of the ordination process by ritual officiates with special qualities conferred via nested enabling rituals. The tacit rules governing ordinations rituals are rigid and eternal. Therefore no matter what sorts of explicit claims participants make about the nature of a foundational agent, in terms of tacit representa tions of ritual actions, in order for SAR within a religious system to be super-permanent those agents must be represented as superhuman agents. By default, the Buddha is represented as a superhuman agent in the Theravada ritual system and since the Buddha is now dead (i.e. parinibbana ["complete extinction"]), by the rules of the established sys tem nuns simply cannot be ordained. This fact helps to account for the rigid refusal to ordain nuns by contemporary Theravada Buddhists better than appeals to socially con structed gender biases. Although it is possible, and likely, that some Buddhists are happy to follow the rules for sexist reasons, a cognitive explanation for the widespread support of the refusal to ordain nuns is that most Buddhists follow tacit rules that conceptually constrain the Theravada ritual system. Gender-biases likely reinforce more basic ten dencies toward structured practices and institutions. 5. Predictions Despite what feminists desire, when it comes to ordaining nuns most Buddhists simply won't disobey the guidelines of the law because the Buddha established the law. If this prediction continues to be confirmed by contemporary developments (or lack of) what can we predict about the possibility that change will occur? As stated before, one strategy for overturning this practice has involved textual criticism. Of course, "what the Buddha taught" (Rahula 1959) is embedded in texts and the historio-theological accuracy of texts is often unreliable. Buddhist texts are no exception. As M. Southwold noted insightfully, we have no idea what the Buddha taught; we only know what Buddhists tell us the Buddha taught (Southwold 1984). However, the problem of textual accuracy and thus historical authen ticity is a problem primarily for theologians and other intellectuals. Though scholars have no idea what the Buddha taught does not mean that Buddhists don't believe that what the texts say is what the Buddha taught. Scholarly postulations don't necessarily influence popular pre sumptions. For this reason we can predict that while textual criticisms</page><page sequence="11">144 D. JASON SLONE AND JOEL MORT might inspire intellectuals, most Theravadins will remain unmoved by reform pleas rooted in textual criticisms. Given the constraints of the Theravada ritual system as established by the Buddha, the perpetual "sexism" of Buddhists reflects simply the application of implicational logic: if nuns are required to perform ordinations and no nuns exist to do so, then no new nuns can be ordained. In fact textual criticism, whose methods are rooted in Biblical scholarship and whose values are rooted in Western modernist socio-political philosophy, might not just fail but also produce a "fundamentalist" backlash as has happened else where in postcolonial regions (Marty &amp; Appleby 1991-1995). Regardless, we think this strategy likely will continue to fail to bring about widespread institutional change. A second strategy for change has been to circumnavigate the rules by seeking ordination elsewhere. Again, a few Southeast Asian women have chosen to be ordained in Buddhist lineages in East Asia. Not sur prisingly, however, most Southeast Asians in the Theravada tradition view these ordinations as inauthentic and choose not to support the nuns (e.g. through dana). This is not surprising given the intense emotions that exclusive commitment to a particular religious system engenders (Atran 2002; Pyysiàinen 2001). Thus while this strategy might solve the problem for individual women, we predict that this strategy will also fail to persuade a critical mass of mainline Theravadins that the nun lineage has been authentically revived. As such those women who choose to live as nuns or take up the robes in foreign lineages likely will con tinue to suffer materially from their status as inauthentic. If these two strategies prove broadly inadequate, is there no hope for reviving the nun lineage? Since Buddhism is a prototypical religious system we predict that widespread change can only come from either a new revelation or from new rules given by a superhuman agent. In the case of the former, possibilities include the discovery of a text that contains different prescriptions given directly from the Buddha. However, this is unlikely given the theological constraints of the Theravada tra dition, namely that there is a single, eternal law taught by the historical Buddha. New Theravada books would, presumably, include the same teachings. Similarly, although an arahat ("perfected being") would not likely gen erate a new teaching, because the arahat s perfect knowledge equates to understanding the truth of the Dharma as taught rather than discover ing a new variant of truth, a future Buddha like Maitteya ("future Buddha") could come to the earth and reign in a new era of Buddhist practice. Of course this is precisely for what many Theravadins are</page><page sequence="12">SEXISM VS. SUPERHUMAN AGENCY 145 anxiously waiting, although maybe not necessarily for reasons having to do with the resolution of the nun issue. 6. Conclusions As noted above, human thought is underpinned by a great deal of such tacit information and religious thought is no exception Therefore a cog nitive approach to the study of religion allows scholars to operate with the assumption that religious people are people. Therefore we can expect Buddhists to behave like people everywhere—they are going to believe in superhuman agents, follow the rules of rituals, and have cer tain expectations about eligibility for monastic ordination. A cognitive approach to religion reveals that all of this is natural (Boyer 1994). Of course, to say that such thoughts and behaviors are natural is not to say that it is justified or even justifiable. Rather, it simply means that these facts follow naturally from what we know about the constraints of human cognition. Therefore normative claims of any kind—feminist claims about religion included—would benefit, in our view, from being grounded in a body of knowledge about human cognition. Otherwise such claims will likely continue to fail those they are meant to serve. As R.N. McCauley has argued eloquently, "If the pursuit of science enables us to devise increasingly better accounts of the way the world is or, at least, to manage things better than our predecessors, then philosophers' normative proposals risk irrelevance, if not irresponsibility, if they insist on employing categories that have become obsolete from the standpoints of explanation and prediction" (McCauley 2004).
