<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE VOICE OF THE INARTICULATE In the past decade several disciplines whose focus is past human society have been extending their range through the adoption of new methodologies and philoso- phies. Archaeology, anthropology, geography, geology, history all show changes from earlier approaches to understanding the past. For the historian of pre-Classical Greece, the developments in two fields are particularly welcome: the new archaeo- logy and the study of oral/literate mentalities each offer insights into features of early Greece which previously have been altogether obscure. Hitherto, however, like the twin tracks of a railroad, these two lines of investi- gation have run parallel with little communication or interchange one with another. A close look at these two lines of research reveals their common interests. At the forefront of the new archaeology is cognitive archaeology, what C. Renfrew has called an archaeology of mind. Going beyond the study of man's intellectual and creative abilities, some scholars maintain that material objects convey clues to the mentality of their makers and users !. The presence of shrines, or of a quantity of weapons, or of a fondness for marine life in the remains of a past culture is a glimpse into the preferences, needs and values of a particular group of people. This is already close to the second line, the study of oral mentality carried on by scholars from such diverse fields as psychiatry, African anthropology, Greek clas- sics, communications, and medieval history. As W. Ong, J. Vansina, E. Havelock and B. Stock argue, the means of communication is far more than a measure of technology. It is a gauge of values, concepts and the basic organization of a socie- ty 2. The differences between orality and literacy are numerous and the mentalities produced by the two modes of communication are clearly distinct. 1 C. Renfrew, Towards an Archaeology of Mind. An Inaugural Lecture at the University of Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1982. « The field is a very wide one, and promises to be one of the growth areas of archaeology in the coming decade ». 24.

Ong, The Presence of the Word , New Haven</page><page sequence="2">182 NOTE E DISCUSSIONI These two lines nearly converge. They can be brought together by means of the material evidence. If the differences between orali ty and literacy are as fundamen- tal as scholars claims, they should make their distinctive marks on all features of a culture. Physical products should reveal the mentality of a society. And there should be an essential difference between the products of a non-literate culture and those of a literate society. In other words, the artefacts should serve the essential purpose of cognitive archaeology. It is not necessary to ask the artefacts to explain the entire institutional structu- re of a society. Nor can it be claimed that the oral or a literate mentality mirrored in the artefacts determines the particular institutions of a culture. The mentality of a people is one factor among many whose relationships comprise and define the nature of the people. Pre-classical Greece is an interesting test case since three points on the oral/lite- rate spectrum are represented. At the mid point of the eighth century B.C., Greece seems to have been completely non-literate; by 700 B.C. literacy was possible for at least some 3. The Mycenaean Greeks had the tool of literacy but it was used in an extremely limited manner. What can we learn from the physical products of the three periods and how do those products compare with one another? 4. Since the characteristics of oral and literate mentalities serve as the foundation for this investigation, it will be useful to summarize the major attributes of each. Sound is the means of communication in an oral culture and the fleeting nature of sound confers certains attributes to normal communication; it is fixed in the present and associated with action. Memory is assisted by certain aids: mnemonic devices such as meter and formulaic language make the telling easier just as knot- ted cords and stringed instruments facilitate recall 5. Accounts as well as the means of communicating tend to be standardized. Situations, themes and problems recur and are recalled as events and actions not abstract principles 6. 1967, and Orality and Literacy: the technologizing of the word, London and New York 1982; J.

Most efforts to date the earliest use of the alphabetic script for the Greek language look to the second half of the eighth century since the earliest surviving Greek inscriptions in the script date to approximately the middle of that century. The recent discovery of a tenth century inscription in the Cypriotic script does not alter the dating of the return of literacy for the mainland. 4 A. L.

Certainly there are specialists in the crafting and preservation of the oral tradition: the degree of specialization in modern, non-literate cultures has been well documented and similar specialization is likely for pre-modern oral societies 8. However, even though it is recalled by specialists, the substance of the tradition is communal knowledge. Oral tradition is a social product; its essential function is conservation of the code of the entire society. Distinctions are minimal; commonality prevails; there is a tendency to homeostasis, that is shaping of the tradition to suit present communal needs 9. The human world is closely related to quasi-human forms of life and it is not surprising to find a tendency to animism in an oral culture: space itself is viewed as inhabited as it is, of course, with « winged words ». This animism fosters a world view that is often polemical, not neutral or impassive 10. Writing systems require a different set of tools: an agreed-upon convention for recording the spoken language, clear knowledge of that convention and preserva- tion of its rules from one generation to the next. Ideas, events, words can be fixed in permanent form if these conditions are met. For the most part, communication is visually transmitted and such control over memory through a durable form imparts a sense of order and mastery. There comes to be a growing separation between subject and object; parts of life are separated from one another and objects become less active, less human-like and even less polemical as visual representations can be disciplined in a way that aural representations can not. « Decontextualization » is the term regularly employed by students of the differences between oral and literate cultures for this process of separation. Literacy need not be a communal possession; it will persist if only a few are literate. As literacy becomes more prevalent, a fundamental change toward know- ledge arises through mòre of the culture group. The permanency of written records enables people « to scrutinise discourse in a different kind of way » which « favo- red the increase in scope of critical activity, and hence of rationality, scepticism and working with a single core image throughout by repeating it in identical or variable settings as the action developes and transforms its meaning ... », 77. 7 Ong, The Presence of the Word. 176. 8 For the Akan states of Ghana specialists include « minstrels, masters of ceremony, royal drummers, royal hornblowers, the king's spokesman, his grave priest, his stool-carrier-chief, female "soulbearers" of the souls of the deceassed queen-mothers, masters of ceremonies to the state-gods, court functionaries, and the administrator of the capital - each of whom had to remember a particular part of the history of the state and transmit it to his or her successor in office ».

Writing favors individual responses to the record so that the individual emerges from the corporate whole 12 . Do the material remains of early Greece « describe » these characteristics? The mid eighth century will serve as the point of reference since it can be defined as non-literate. The other periods will be examined over against the characteristics its products reveal. The evidence for the mid-eighth century is not large, either in quantity or variety 13. Ceramic objects provide the majority of finds. For the present purpose, ceramic objects become especially important only toward the end of the Dark Age when human and animal representations are again used as regular decorative featu- res. In the sub-Mycenaean period, even vegetable forms such as branches, leaves and blossoms slowly disappeared 14 . Metal work is another category of evidence that is continuous from the twelfth through the eighth century. Bronze and iron were used for utilitarian objects and less often more precious metals were fashio- ned into luxury goods. Allocation of the available metal supplies, the ability of craftsmen and find places of objects all reveal something about the mentality of the producers and users of the goods. The most explicit material is the incised or modelled figures of human and animal life that occur with increasing frequency from the late ninth century. There are also the Dark Age structures, settlements and models that, beyond their value as material evidence, reflect the cognitive systems of their creators: « cultures create their own context » which is « reflected in relationships with a landscape » 15. To begin with the most copious evidence, it is the decoration on the mature Geometric pottery that speaks most loudly for its inarticulate makers and users. There were a variety of shapes in use although not the great variety of the Myce- naean Age. After a plunge to 10 shapes in the sub-Mycenaean phase, the number turned upward in the protogeometric phase, growing to 17; new shapes were created throughout the ripe Geometric period ,6. Vessels were organized vertically and horizontally into zones of semicircles, triangles, zigzags, meanders, chevrons, swastikas, and rosettes and an increasing number show an effort to balance the dark and light elements of the vase. Even animate objects were depicted by means of geometric designs. Only bare essentials of human and animal life were shown so that all genres of living things appear quite uniform. It has been argued that the eye 11 Goody, Domestication of the Savage Mind , 37. 12 Ong, Presence of the Word , 54 and Orality and Literacy , 74. 13 Two useful collections of the evidence are R.

Horses were the earliest animals to reappear among the inanimate elements; birds, too, enjoyed an increasingly prominent position and, toward the end of the eighth century, larger, more ferocious creatures grew in popularity. Ritual was the focus of scenes which showed little beyond « general and typical situations » 18. Human figures were frequently shown in mourning; women danced; warriors stood, sometimes with their ships. In particular, death and honoring of the dead occasioned many of the vase paintings and many of the larger Geometric products of Athenian potters were intended as grave markers and grave gifts. An outstanding characteristic of mature Geometric pottery is an attempt to impose order and discipline; the vessels were carefully and minutely zoned. Human existence was not the principal object of the ordering; rather patterned abstractions were of most significance. Men, women and animals were a part of that larger combination of elements but one part. They are bounded by ground lines and panel demarcations, obeying the limits imposed. Still animate creatures were not passive figures; in fact, they alone engaged in activity, something a triangle or semi-circle could not do. The action often focused on death: mourning a dead person, fighting to preserve life or engaging in battle to take life away from someone or something else. It was not a peaceful environment and the figures acted collectively. Rarely did an individual stand out because of physical appearance or unusual behavior. New elements were incorporated as the eighth century progressed. This willin- gness to draw on features from an outside, non-traditional sphere reveals a confi- dence that is demonstrated equally well in the competence of manufacture and decoration of the vessels. The large products of the late eighth century surely were produced by experts, perhaps specialists in this one pursuit only, who were justly proud of their accomplishments. There came to be one main zone, quite out of proportion to the rest of the vessels, rather than a balanced combination of vertical and horizontal zones. Geo- metric designs persisted but became less prominent, secondary in importance to the few figures of the large painted scene. There were no longer crowds of undifferen- tiated people or animals; one horse, two or three humans stepped into the focus of attention. Concurrently, these fewer figures were depicted with greater detail of physiognomy and dress through incision and several colors of paint; not only sex distinctions but individual distinctions were shown. The humans continue to be engaged in action and two new categories of situations appeared. Now began concentration on typical scenes from daily life and, at the same time, the first mythological and legendary pictures started 19. Death did not disappear from view 17 Hampe and Simon, Birth of Greek Art , 157. 18 Schweitzer, Greek Geometric Art , 36. 19 P. G. P.

It is interesting to note that many of these later vases were intended as prizes for the living not grave offerings for the dead 20. These are confident products. They may not always be as successful in terms of their organization as were the earlier products; in fact, chaos is a characteristic of several of the seventh century proto-attic examples. Seemingly, the need to discipli- ne rigorously was no longer felt so strongly. This was not the result of despair; instead, it is a fair conclusion that a sense of order had already been achieved so that experimentation within the larger scheme was now possible. Sculpted figures tell much the same story that can be read on the vases. At first the metal figures were very small - 7 to 10 cm - and they were often part of a larger context such as cauldron handles. Until well into the eighth century details were few - bare physiognomy on almost featureless faces. Not detail but proportion drew the sculptors' interest from an early period in the Dark Age; the parts of the body were ordered one to another much as the zones of the vases were carefully arranged21. Though small, the figures were by no means submissive; they were emphatic, active, often combative; in the better examples, figures were possessed with « an explosive power which seems restrained in the body held back by the ritual geometric constraints ... » 22 . The figures and their actions are typical not particular. While the Olympia charioteers vary as products of different craftsmen, there is no indication that one is Oinomaos. Not only human figures but animals and mythical creatures were increasinlgy common. What is more, the spheres of existence overlapped with one another. At first rendered individually, by the end of the century the earliest group compositions in bronze were produced. Precise identification of the figures is problematic: are the anthropomorphic creatures human or divine? They appear to be ordinary men and women but the Homeric poems shows that divinity was already envisioned in human form. What is the distinction that allows a verdict of « undoubtedly Zeus » 23 for one eighth century figure while others of much the same type are adjudged to be ordinary mortals? There is no easy answer and, for our present purpose, the very closeness between the spheres of gods and men is revealing. This closeness is also attested by find places: most statuettes were found in graves or at sanctuaries, both those of local importance such as Amyclae and those of wider repute, as Olympia, home of the chariot groups 24 € A shift in the proportion of dedications at the two types of sites occurred in the later eighth century: dedications at sanctuaries increased sharply while goods placed in individual graves declined, indicating a value jud- gment of the eighth century dedicators as well as an increase in wealth 25 . 20 A.

As in painted figures, there was more attention paid to details of bodily and facial featu- res and to clothing. At the same time, size increased markedly so that it is appro- priate to speak of monumental sculpture early in the seventh century. Much of the larger sculpture was in stone, a material being put to new architectural uses as well. Finally, while metal figures continued to be associated with other objects, their independent position started to grow to the prominence it would enjoy in the full Classical period. The people who saw themselves in such guises lived together in villages that were often little more than a « chaotic jumble of cottages » 26 . The locations of the clusters are telling: at Zagora on Andros, inhabitants settled on a high headland with precipitous descent to harbours on either side of the promontory. Moreover, they barred access to the settlement with a massive fortification extending across the neck of the promontory, fitting the seven meter thickness with only one gate. At Emporio on Chios, the main settlement (described as « never more than a strag- gling village » 27) was half an hour's walk from the smaller cluster of buildings near the harbour that would become the center of the Classical polis of Chios. The site of Koukounaries at Paros was « out of sight of visitors and was deliberately, like its Mycenaean predecessors, situated as such » 28. At the site of Corinth, there were enough advantages such a spring water and rich clay to draw several groups of settlers 29 . In other words, settlers used the natural advantages of the terrain. Most sites of the eighth century were not planned nor were many of them fortified by man-made walls. However, when walls were constructed - as at Zagora and Old Smyrna - or reused - as at Koukounaries - they were monumental and carefully laid. Within the settlements, most of the buildings were small houses built of mud- brick or, in more prosperous areas, of stone. A single room or two comprised the living quarters for most inhabitants and, within those walls, household crafts were carried on, as loom weights and spindle whorls show. Some differentiation in housing did exist by the later Dark Age. A rectangular building with megaron plan excavated at Emporio has been described as « a palace » or « the residence of the local chief » 30 and it shared a location on the acropolis of the settlement with an altar in the sanctuary of Athena. Large buildings at Zagora and Koukounaries have similarly been described as dwellings of local leaders 31 . Not temples but altars are the persistent physical tokens of religious activity 26 A good overview of architecture and settlement pattern is chapter 12, « Towns and Villa- ges », in J. N. Coldstream, Geometric Greece , London 1977, 303-316. The quotation is from 304. 27 Ibid., 306. 28 D. U.

Beyond these simple constructions, there is little specialized architecture. Simple cists were the most usual form of graves as crema- tion gave way to inhumation in the later Dark Age Wells were constructed and granaries are attested both through ceramic models and excavation. Space for an assembly was available in the early settlements - Zagora and Emporio, for exam- ple, and Dreros on Crete had a deliberately planned agora by the end of the eighth century 34 . Occasionally special establishments were constructed and located accor- ding to the dictates of crafts: Pithecusae in the eighth century had two blacksmith workshops with forges and an adjoining dwelling house on the outskirts of the settlement 35 . However, such specialized structures were exceptional before the seventh century. Perhaps the most apparent observation to be drawn from this evidence concerns the communal nature of life. Rather than living in isolation in single family groups, people clustered together in small villages. The siting of these villages suggests an important reason for banding together: there is safety in num- bers. Using the advantages of natural fortifications or, occasionally, constructing walls implies an abiding sense of insecurity that would not be overcome until the end of the Dark Age. On the other hand, the settlements were permanent not meant to endure for a seasons or two only. Homogeneity is another characteristic of the sites: there were no great differen- ces in houses or graves. One family lived in much the same fashion as the other families in the community. Yet there were some variations. Certains houses may have belonged to a chief whose home was larger and specially placed but in which household crafts were carried on just as they were in the smaller dwellings. Aside from a few special locations such as the altars, there was no hierarchical arrange- ment within the settlements; buildings tended to develop and grow organically in harmony with nature. Nor were human and divine spheres separated from one another. Altars were incorporated into the human cluster not set apart. Another variation can be noted in the grave goods which are appropriate to the dead person - toys for children, jewellery for women, weapons for men and, more generally, richer products for wealthier recipients. There is not, however, great disparity in the nature of the mode of burial. Changes in architecture and the nature of settlements at the end of the eighth century were matters of scale rather than essential form. Settlement size increased significantly along with the rise in population. The peaceful end of the settlement at Koukounaries in the seventh century can be interpreted as movement of people from a remote site to the central location of the rapidly expanding polis of Paros 36 . The habit of the earlier Dark Age of dwelling in mountain eeryies abated although 32 Coldstream, Geometric Greece , 317 and R. A. Tomlinson, Greek Sanctuaries , New York 1976. 33 D. C. Kurtz and J.

Within the settlements, there was an increase in the use of permanent materials for larger structures. The houses of the gods became larger and more durable from the end of the eighth century; if the upper reaches continued to be of timber and mudbrick, stone sockles provided a firmer foundation. There was other architectural speciali- zation as daily affairs of humans were more precisely defined. The agora is one of the first indications of this tendency; a meeting place was marked out in a growing number of settlements from 700 B.C. Even though official buildings came later, the open spaces themselves deomonstrate a degree of planning and societal differentia- tion within the community 37 . In sum, the three categories of evidence tell the following story. In ca. 750 there was little individualization in the products but, from the end of the eighth century, marks of distinction appear in painted, sculpted and constructed objects. A focus on groups of living things rather than single figures was accompanied, in the earlier period, by a mingling of animate with inanimate figures in scenes where humans were rarely the most important element. Toward 700, however, inanimate patterns were distinguished and separated from living things in a new treatment of the surface of vases and in sculptures meant to stand alone. Animals and human were regularly shown in action in mature Geometric art; contests of strength and mourning a dead person were prevalent themes. Later in the century other subjects gained popularity, particularly in the narrative art of the vases. Death receded somewhat from view. Settlement sites that were located so as to facilitate contact between people rather than to seclude one group from others also imply more confidence in dealing with the world. Bearing these conclusions in mind, it may be valuable to add another comparati- ve perspective. Do these same categories of evidence reveal features of the mentali- ty of the late Mycenaean Age? I have long maintained that Mycenaean Greece was not a literate culture in spite of the use of the Linear B script 38 . As A. Heubeck has argued convincingly, the skill of writing was apparently a very recent acquisition in the late thirteenth century mainland 39 . It was employed by a limited group of functionaries for inven- tory of records within the administrative centers. The ability to read and write had not yet spread more widely when the structure of the kingdoms was first shaken, then overturned. Nor does it seem that knowledge of the script penetrated fully even within the administrative centers. Entries on the tablets often combine ideo- grams with syllabograms, representing an item or object as well as describing it. Yet it is obvious that late Bronze Age Greece was not a totally oral culture. Written records were a functional part of the administrative structure, not merely decorative. Mycenaean Greece belongs at neither end of the scale of orali ty-literacy, but at some point between the two. Does the material evidence accord with these conclusions? 37 A. Toynbee, An Ekistical Study of the Hellenic City State, Athens 1971, esp. 41-53. 38 Thomas, « The Mycenaean Domesday Records », in Par Pass 134, 1970, 301-311. 39 Heubeck, « L'origine della lineare B ».</page><page sequence="10">190 NOTE E DISCUSSIONI That evidence is more abundant and varied than it is for the Dark Age. For the sake of comparison, emphasis has been placed on the types also available for the eighth century although related categories have been allowed to speak. The animate beings of the frescoes, for example, accord with the painted decorations of the pottery 40 . Even though the evidence for the Mycenaean Age is greater than it is for the eighth century, painted pottery is especially important in reflecting the mentality of its users. And since many of the examples come from locations other than the palaces, it can be argued that « Especially in the Late period, they may reflect the real interests of the ordinary Mycenaean » 41 . The variety in Mycenaean ware was great. Pottery from Pylos alone attests 80 shapes with variations 42 . Most of the vessels were plain, unadorned and thus identified as everyday utensils. Even the daily crockery was regularly well shaped, well baked and often covered with a good, even slip 43. There are as well 700 examples of pictorial vases from the LH III B and C periods, beginning shortly before 1400 B.C. and extending through the first half of the twelfth century. Though Mycenaean vase painting was influenced by Cretan and Cycladic tradi- tions, it has been concluded that most Mycenaean invention in pictorial composi- tions is independent of outside influence 44 . Arising from a previous non-pictorial tradition, the most interesting examples are judged to come from ca. 1300 to 1 150, that is the height of the mainland kingdoms and the subsequent period of collap- se 45. In many examples, form of vessels and painted decoration accorded harmo- niously. The cuttlefish goblets are a good illustration of harmony between form and decoration 46 . There was little zoning in the Mycenaean ware by comparison with Geometric examples. Ground lines may set a pictorial zone apart from an undecorated foot or neck and occasionally there were vertical demarcations separating the picture into sections. More often than not, however, the artists forgot the ground line so that wheels floated above it, feet sank below. The decorated area was large: regularly two or three creatures or objects moved, strode, swam or flew around the shoulder or pairs of animals or humans looked at one another or at the viewer. There were few crowds. Geometric shapes were employed but as secondary elements or motifs: the background may have a formal ornamental pattern, animals may have patterned 40 E. Vermeule and V.

Only very late in IIIC, however, did overall patterning begin. Birds and fish were the most numerous subjects but horses, bulls, goats, dogs and lions also were shown along with less identifiable creatures such as a goat-bird, perhaps a minotaur, a cat and a dromedary. Some surviving pictures seem drawn from the land of fantasy, like the « juggler » from the « Circus Pot ». Unlike the hybrid creatures of the late eighth century, these earlier figures may be accidental products of reckless, rapid painting 47 . The earliest human figures have been dated to ca. 1360. People were shown in both ritual and ordinary activities 48 . Soldiers appeared with chariots and horses and, from the last period, in combat. Other figures smelled flowers, danced, played the lyre, boxed, leapt over a bull, sat on a campstool. Over the course of the pictorial style, peaceful activities gave way to scenes of warfare. The situations seem to be generic not specific events. By the twelfth century, soldiers with chariots were predominant among representations of humans. The figures are a curious mixture of realism and shorthand techniques. Sex is often shown, fingers and toes can be counted (some humans have more than enough!), tassels reveal the use of greaves, nose bands indicate the method of guiding a horse. Yet the driver of a chariot and his passengers emerge from the pole stay, creatures often float on air, birds fly as well as possible without wings, proportions are often totally unnatural. While many of the examples are entirely successful in the relationship of decora- tion and form, there is little sense of order or discipline. The figures were shown in action but movement is often « a decorative stillness » until the very last period when a new vitality emerged 49 . In this last period too there was a new richness in subject and ornament with details clearly shown in many cases. We note, for example, a penchant for beards and mustaches and even improbable situations were clearly shown as when handless charioteers held reins in their teeth 50. A number of examples, however, show shorthand devices and fillers became more frequent. Local variations in skill and manner are more noticeable than they were earlier. And individualization between like creatures on single vases continued 51 . Such products clearly do not reflect despair of a ruined world. Well executed products fashioned by imaginative painters breathe quite another spirit. The frescoes do not contradict the impression that emerges from the pictorial pottery. The subjects were varied: animals of a number of types were represented both with humans and alone. Architecture and features of nature were indicated 47 Illustration IX. 118 in Vermeule and Karageorghis. 40 While there may be « little overt cult connection ».

Of three goats, two are large and one little; two have eyes and one does not; one has a very long tail and another possesses a short double tail; the horns have varying numbers of curves.</page><page sequence="12">192 NOTE E DISCUSSIONI but as secondary to the main subject of the frescoes-humans. As M. Lang concluded « Certainly the kind of scene which is more exclusively devoted to human activity is the most generally popular at all the mainland sites » 52 Human and divine figures were portrayed 53 but it is not easy to distinguish between them since divinity seems to have been rendered anthropomorphically. Even the animals were « man-oriented ». Differentiation of details is noticeable. Humans were distinguished according to sex, color and apparel. Nor was there uniformity within a single category of sub- ject: the three femáis from the procession scene of the NW slope of Pylos wear skirts with three different color schemes. The fresco from Hall 64 has three diffe- rent kinds of dogs. Most figures were almost life size. Frequently the subjects processed or were marshalled in orderly array. Action was implied but, as on the pictorial pottery, it was never zestful, often less than realistic. Since the frescoes come from the palace centers, the formal nature is not surprising. This is the official world of Mycenean Greece. Mycenaean artisans also represented animal and human figures in various scul- pted forms: stone reliefs; terracotta figurines; life size statues; carved ivories; and metal inlay objects were all products from Late Bronze Age Greece. Except for the ivories, the figures were generally stylized, frozen in position. The small terracottas from Mycenae utilized shorthand devices to indicate bodily form and gesture. The running or charging figures on the bronze daggers don't move. The Korakou figures are flat and have, at best, casual modelling of detail. In earlier and later products, geometric forms were incorporated into the object, as on the stone relifes from Mycenae or on the wings of animals carved in ivory from Spata in Attica and Mycenae. Still, the figures are recognizable as living beings. The artists of the Keos statues indicated bodily forms beneath the skirts, separated the legs and bent the knees on their products. Moreover, there is individualization: some Keos faces smile, some are serious; eyes vary 54. Most Mycenaean sculpture appears to be associated with the palace centers or with cult. The Agia Irini statues were found in a building identified as a temple; the Mycenae figurines came from a room devoted to cult. Tombs have been the source of a majority of the smaller figures, lohn Caskey ventured the conclusion that the largest Keos statues may have been cult images while the others were so numerous that they were probably attendants or votaries of the divinity 55 . The cult association of Mycenaean sculpture may explain its formality 56. Despite its formal nature, however, Mycenaean sculpture emphasized the human, distinguished bet- 52 M.

It is is true that the larger or more elaborate examples are intended to represent deity, a hierarchical ordering can be postulated for Mycenaean society. Hierarchical is an apt description of Late Helladic settlements which were both numerous and varied 57 . Settlements ranged from small villages with low popula- tions to palace centers with hundreds of permanent residents. There was considera- ble variation within the type of settlements. Gla surely served a purpose other than Pylos or Mycenae. Within palace sites differentiation is also clear as the West Building at Pylos illustrates 58 . Some individualization appears even at the village level; House P at Korakou is the « largest, most pretentious of the site » 59 . The central palaces drew settlements to them in several ways. Houses in the vicinity were built as near as possible to the palaces. A system of roads semms to have existed in many regions of the mainland, strengthening the bond between sites. And works projects like that of the Copaic basic must have been directed by a central authority 60. Major centers were regularly fortified, one of many indicators of the Myce- naean military mentality61. Surrounding walls and buildings within both show a monumental character. Both major and minor structures were regularly well con- structed through most of the thirteent century. For Korakou - the type of settle- ment that explains the palace centers 62 - stone foundations were employed for the houses. Though walls were not always parallel, some architectural sophistication is revealed by use of buttresses. The lower town at Pylos had buildings with good stucco floors, solidly built foundations and some spacious rooms 63 . The megaron form with central hearth was usual for houses in the villages where narrow alleys separated one from another. There was little planning; Biegen describes the « free- dom of orientation » of Karakou 64 which was typical of most sites. It is the secular side of life that speaks from the remains. There are cult centers but they are rooms within palaces, as at Mycenae, or altars within the houses, House P at Korakou. Graves, not sanctuaries, are the source of most offerings, a feature that again points to the human focus of attention, even in death. Some Late Helladic settlements fit nicely into the description of eighth century villages: a « chaotic jumble of cottages » using the natural advantages of the ter- 57 R.

Most were not planned or fortified. Village buildings were, almost without exception, dwellings with few differences beyond slightly larger size in a few cases. However the center of Mycenaean civilization was not the village by the Late Helladic phase. Life was directed from administrative centers that were planned, fortified and differentiated according to activity. Whoever coordinated each palace center's functions wielded considerable power over resources and people. I have argued that these coordinators were reliant on their own human strengths, not deities in human guise 65 . The effects of this control were obviously felt by residents of the villages and its magnitude is reflected by the employment of a new tool - the Linear B script. The material objects of the Late Helladic period reveal the two levels of society in possessing characteristics of both an oral and a literate mentality. Living things are just beginning to step out from the abstracted patterns of an earlier tradition; individuals are attempting to disassociate themselves from the crowd. They are engaged in activity although the activities are not always understandable. A curious mix of formalized technique and realism exists. Human, animal, divine and fanta- stic co-exist although many examples show a human focus. A major characteristic of the literate mentality is the emergence of the indivi- dual from the corporate whole 66 . Another is a growing separation between subject and object 67 . Categories emerge from an undifferentiated mass of being as « decon- textualization » proceeds. The Mycenaean products are only just beginning to re- flect this decontextualization. The many enchanting examples of humour or whim- sy on the pictorial pottery are not likely to be deliberately humorous 68 . Rather it was the product of the creative invention that marks an increasingly literate mentali- ty 69 . The process has also been found to produce growing secularisation which would help explain our difficulty in defining divine representations in Mycenaean objects. Just as the administrative structure influenced the subjects of Mycenaean kin- gdoms, so did the administrative tool of writing begin to affect the Mycenaean mentality. Even if there was nothing written beyond lists ... These lists not only 'reflect' certain aspects of the social organ; they also determine other aspects, in that they have certain implicit features [such as hierar- chy and lateral placement] that influence behaviour, as well as other explicit features that prescribe it 70. However, the influence was short-lived. With the disappearance of the tool, so the mentality became attuned to the oral tradition of the Dark Ages. How deeply 65 « The Nature of Mycenaean Kingship », in SMEA 17, 1976, 93-116. 66 Goody, Domestication of the Savage Mind , 102. 67 Ong, Orali ty and Literacy, 105. 68 As Vermeule and Karageorghis conclude « no one could accuse the Mycenaeans of being a humourous people ... », Mycenaean Pictorial Pottery , 111. 69 Goody, Domestication of the Savage Mind. 70 Ibid., 129.</page><page sequence="15">NOTE E DISCUSSIONI 195 entrenched was that oral mentality can be read in the « documents » of the mid eighth century 71 . Only at the end of the eighth century would products begin once more to demonstrate features characteristic of a literate mentality. These products would not, however, duplicate those of the Mycenaean Age. An appreciation of the role of literacy or orality in a culture does not lead to the conclusion that all literate and all non-literate societies are the same. Nor is this an argument that the institutions and values of a society are solely due to the nature of their oral or literate mentality. To the contrary, each society takes its form from the interplay of many factors - social, economic, religious, political, both internal to the society and external - that are themselves specific to a particular time and place. Only one of these factors is the psychodynamics of understanding, the cogni- tive process of the culture of which orality and literacy are part. While not exaggerating the role of a society's habits of mind, it must be granted that they condition man's views of the world and the human role in that world. Inasmuch as institutions rest ultimately on shared definitions of existence, what is good and what is not, mentality does both condition and sustain institutions. Thus, the collective mentality of a society produces not a particular form of economic or judicial behaviour but rather it encourages a type of behaviour in which basic characteristics of the mentality find expression. One would expect, therefore, to find political forms that rest on collective responsibility in an oral society and institutions founded on the principle of individual responsibility in a literate cultu- re. A vase or a sculpted figure will not say « the mentality that produced me created the polis ». It will say « the mentality that fashioned me viewed human beings as essentially similar parts of a common whole. The polis is founded on like beliefs » 72 . To reverse the order of investigation, institutions may help describe a society's position on the oral/literate spectrum although such a description has not been the intent of the present discussion. To use artefacts to such an end, it is essential to differentiate between institutions developed independently by a society and those imposed by another society. The institutions of a primary oral society may be suddenly altered by an outside power. A non-literate society may owe ultimate obedience to a remote monarch who governs through an impersonal bureaucracy. 71 Consequently, it is not with Geometric ware that certain examples of Mycenaean pottery should be compared but rather with proto- Attic or proto-Corinthian ware of ca. 700 B.C. 72 Goody, Domestication of the Savage Mind, 16: « ... it is clear that the adoption of written modes of communication was intrinsic to the development of more wide-ranging, more depersonali- sed and more abstract systems of government; at the same time, the shift from oral intercourse meant assigning less importance to face-to-face situations, whether in the form of the interview or audience, of personal service or national festivals in which renewal of ties of obedience was often as significant as the religious rites ». For another use of the pottery to demonstrate institutions of early Greece see J. N. Col- dstream, « The meaning of the Regional Styles in the Eighth Century B.C. », The Greek Renaissan- ce, 17-25. « Thus not only the poleis but the ethne too find their reflections in the character and quality of the various Late Geometric pottery styles », 24 f.</page><page sequence="16">196 NOTE E DISCUSSIONI Certainly, such impersonal machinery of government is not a likely characteristic of an oral culture. Quite simply, monocausal explanations of cultural forms and cultural changes do not suffice. Recognition that a society is a system composed of interlocking parts and forces is far more accurate 7' One of the features of any system is its mode of thought and communication which are conditioned by and also condition other features of the system. An investigation of the role of orality or literacy in a given culture is an attempt to see how values themselves are conditioned by the means a society employs to remember the sum of its accumulated knowledge. The products of a society are a clue to those collective values. Carol Thomas 73 C.
