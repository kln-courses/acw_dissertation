These</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 393 include areas such as martial law and emergency powers; the regulation of Falungong and other so-designated evil cults; shuanggui, a special form of criminal investigation that is vested in the Communist Party of China (CCP) rather than in the governmental criminal justice system; police stop-and-question powers; para-police; various forms of rehabilitation camps that operated outside the states criminal justice system per se; and the states legal efforts to regulate policy use of coercive interrogation, including torture. What makes these particular aspects of Chinas criminal law system especially interesting is that they exist at the heart of the intersection between the forces of law and the forces of power in China, a place that Sapio, following Giorgio Agamben, calls the "zone of exception." It is here, she argues, that the complex relationship between law and power in the context of the Chinese state is made most visible. What makes these regulatory areas exceptional is that each is a part of the criminal law system but, nevertheless, operates relatively autonomously from the criminal justice framework as laid down principally by the criminal law and the criminal procedure law. Thus, for example, both martial law and declarations of emergency powers involve the suspension of what we might call "ordinary" crimi nal justice procedures. Efforts to regulate falungongy which were latter legally extended to evil cults in general, also involved the articulation of significant deviations from ordinary justice. Because it operates through the Chinese Com munist Party (CCP) rather than the states own police, shanggui is not at all subject to the law regulating the states own criminal justice mechanisms. The polices power to stop and question is not subject to criminal justice procedures because it technically takes hold before the formal criminal justice system is invoked. Para police are private or quasi-private policing bodies that lie outside the ordinary criminal justice system because that system is attached to public or state policing, not private (or even quasi-private) behavior. Rehabilitation camps act primarily as surrogates for the criminal justice system—a form of coercive control that, because it is formally supposed to be attached to relatively minor forms of criminal or illegal behavior, is not thought to be needing of the more protective aspects of the formal criminal justice system. Furthermore, torture and other forms of coercive interrogation are, in fact, illegal, but are as ingrained in police behavior as effec tively to require their own independent soft-regulatory system. As noted above, none of these areas has received anywhere close to the quality of legal investigation provided by this book. The legal history and evolution of these particular regulatory areas are set out and documented in fine detail. In this way alone, the book represents a gold mine for persons wanting to develop their own understanding of these important but overlooked aspects of Chinas criminal justice system. This detail is given shape by framing it in a particular theory of state power adapted from the work of Giorgio Agamben and, in particular, his notion of a “zone of exception." A zone of exception is a regulatory space in which the states</page><page sequence="3">394 China Review International： Vol. 18, No. 3, 2011 laws are conspicuously removed from play. It is, most critically, a normalized space. It is not a normatively surreptitious and clandestine avoidance of the legal norms—an illegality, however tolerated—but it is a normative delineation of the limits of the legal protections a state is willing to bestow on its subjects. Within this space, subjects are reduced to a state that Sapio, again following Agamben, calls "bare life’’ (zoé)y a "condition in which a person is totally at the mercy of raw power” (p. 18). Sapio argues that in China, these zones of exception—these dis tinctly normative limits to legal protections—are much more central to the per petuation of state power than they are in the liberal democracies that Agamben has focused upon. In liberal democracies, these zones of exception are strictly bounded by the static formalisms of positive law. In China, by contrast, they are more dynamic and more nuanced. They are much more symbiotically bound-up with the states living，as opposed to its positive, law. It her explication of the evolutionary history of these particular regulatory areas, she seek to show the uniquely living aspects of Chinas particular deployment of and reliance on these zones of exception. To be honest, this reviewer is quite skeptical of the particular vision of power that informs Sapios narrative. According to this narrative, both power and the state (in this case, the party-state) are treated as omnipotent, anthropomorphic entities. They operate according to coherent desires, and their intentions are just like those of individuals. Insofar as these intentions are concerned, they cannot be constrained: where and when they do not respond to some apparent incursion into their raw might (such as some new piece of legislation), it is simply because they choose not to respond—yet. However, to my mind, the interaction between formal articulations of state authority and actually social-political structuring is much more complex than can be meaningfully captured by this particular construct. Consistent with this perspective, Sapios narratives are state-centric. Her focus is primarily on positive law and other formal articulations of authority that stem from the state itself. She even notes that she "undertook the conscious choice to use public sources of information" (p. 28), and in China such "public sources of information" are almost universally used to express the strategic perspectives of actors associated with the state and the party. She, therefore, does not explore how even within these zones of exception, the raw power of the party-state may be significantly compromised by social dynamics that operate outside the cognitive reach of the modern state. In fairness, narratives founded on a presumption of the absolute power of the party-state, as derived from that states own formal articulation of its authority, are quite common to English-language analysis of China. Sapios deployment of this ubiquitous vision thus works to locate her analysis within this much larger pool of study, which thereby allows for synergy with the larger literature. In any event, the very impressive detail of her investigations and analyses is so robust that it allows for fruitful exploration of possible interpretation and insights that derive from</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 395 other, even contrary, perspectives. As noted above, this reviewer has a vision of the sociological nature of both power and the state that diverges fundamentally from that which informs Sapios narrative. Nevertheless, I found this book immensely insightful and rewarding. It is a must-read for anyone seeking a fuller understand ing of the details and nuances of Chinas particular system of criminal justice, be one Agambenian or otherwise. Michael W. Dowdle Michael W.
