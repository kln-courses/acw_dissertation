Hayiou-Thomas, and Bonamy Oliver Institute of Psychiatry, London Dorothy V. M. Bishop University of Oxford Philip S. Dale University of Missouri-Columbia Robert Plomin Institute of Psychiatry, London The genetic and environmental etiologies of diverse aspects of language ability and disability, including artic- ulation, phonology, grammar, vocabulary, and verbal memory, were investigated in a U.K. sample of 787 pairs of 4.5-year-old same-sex and opposite-sex twins. Moderate genetic influence was found for all aspects of language in the normal range. A similar pattern was found at the low end of the distribution with the exception of two receptive measures. Environmental influence was mainly due to nonshared factors, unique to the individual, with little influence from shared environment for most measures. Genetic and environmental influences on language ability and disability are quantitatively and qualitatively similar for males and females. Language acquisition is remarkable for both its uni- versal patterns and the substantial individual dif- ferences that occur. These are different but complementary aspects of development. A general pattern of development and the variations around it may stem from different sources. Much of the theo- rizing about child language development has fo- cused on the species-universal level of analysis, involving heated discussions on the extent of innate and environmental influences, with a consensus gradually emerging that the relevant issue is not nature versus nurture but rather the process of in- teraction between the two (Elman et al., 1996). This issue is relevant not only for language as a whole but for different components of language, and it is pos- sible that there are linguistic features that are more or less environmentally sensitive (Gleitman, 1988). For example, the use of closed-class morphology in English, which is relatively impoverished but highly irregular, may depend on the caregiver's input more than phonology or syntax, which may be more highly constrained by the maturation of a biologi- cally based innate language acquisition device (Cazden, 1966; Gleitman, 1988; Goad &amp; Ingram, 1987). Herxe again, both theoretical and empirical enquiry into this question have been almost exclu- sively couched in terms of the commonalities in children's development, that is, the means level of analysis. The same question could and should be posed at the individual-differences level of analysis: Not only does a large amount of variation exist in children's language development, but it is this vari- ation that presents practical challenges to speech pathologists and educators (Bates, Dale, &amp; Thal, 1999) Within the domain of individual differences in development, another interesting question is whether common developmental disabilities should be conceptualized as either the extreme end of a normal distribution or as qualitatively different cat- egories. According to one view, at least some forms of language impairment constitute a qualitatively distinct condition specifically associated with the abnormal development of syntax (e.g., Gopnik &amp; Crago, 1991; Van der Lely, Rosen, &amp; McClelland, 1998). Recent evidence from molecular genetics demonstrates that at least one qualitatively distinct subtype of language impairment does have a distinct etiology. A single mutation in the FOXP2 gene ac- counts for language impairment in the famous KE family: All affected members have the same muta- tion in this gene, whereas no unaffected member does (e.g., Lai, Fisher, Hurst, Vargha-Khadem, &amp; Monaco, 2001). However, it is unlikely that FOXP2 is t 2005 by the Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

It is possible that other single gene mutations will be found that underlie other, quali- tatively different, cases of language impairment. An alternative mechanism for language disability is the existence of multiple risk factors of varying effect sizes, some genetic and some environmental, that probabilistically combine to produce language disorder. Different permutations of these multifac- torial risks may account for heterogeneity within developmental language disorders. According to this quantitative trait locus (QTL) perspective, dif- ferent alleles of the same set of genes are responsible for variation across the full range of the distribution (Plomin, DeFries, McClearn, &amp; McGuffin, 2001; Plo- min, Owen, &amp; McGuffin, 1994). Common disorders are thus hypothesized to be the quantitative ex- tremes of the normal range of the trait rather than qualitatively different. Phenotypically, there is sup- port for this position from findings showing that many of the linguistic characteristics of children with language impairment can also be seen to some extent in children with typically developing language (e.g., Bishop, 1997; Bishop, Bright, James, Bishop, &amp; van der Lely, 2000; Leonard, 1998). The discussion on whether common language impairments are qualitatively or quantitatively dif- ferent from the normal range of language variation has primarily centered on specific language impair- ment (SLI), which by most definitions requires at least some discrepancy between language and non- verbal ability (Rice, 2003). How SLI should be de- fined and how "specific" language impairment differs from nonspecific language impairment are challenging and important but currently unresolved questions. The jury is still out as to whether a lan- guage-nonverbal discrepancy is a stable and in- herent part of the disorder (Cole, Dale, &amp; Mills, 1990, 1992), which is reflected in the etiology (Bishop, North, &amp; Donlan, 1995; Hayiou-Thomas, Oliver, &amp; Plomin, in press). Nonetheless, the causes of lan- guage difficulties in children are worth considering, regardless of whether the children fulfill clinical di- agnoses for SLI. Our focus is on these children with low language abilities. The results are relevant for understanding SLI, but only in the context of the resolution of a different debate, namely, whether SLI is a valid and separate category. Genetic methods such as twin studies that com- pare identical and fraternal twins provide a pomeerful tool for understanding individual differences by estimating the proportion of variance that can be attributed to genetic, shared, and nonshared environment factors (Plomin et al., 2001). Only ge- netic and environmental factors that vary in the population are assessed by this method. In complex traits that are likely to be influenced by multiple factors, the genetic component of variance refers to the influence of alleles at all gene loci that affect the trait. The similarity between twins on any particular trait can be due to genetic influences that they have in common, twice as much for identical (monozy- gotic [MZ]) twins as for fraternal twins (dizygotic [DZ]). On the other hand, the similarity may be due to the shared environment, which refers to any en- vironmental influences that contribute to the simi- larity between cotwins. For example, twins experience similar conditions during gestation, have the same socioeconomic status, live in the same family, and usually go to the same school. With re- spect to language, to the extent that both members of the twin pair are exposed to the same quality and similar quantity of linguistic input and share the linguistic traditions and conventions practiced in their home, this might reasonably be expected to increase similarity between them. Nonshared envi- ronment refers to any aspect of environmental in- fluence that makes cotwins different from each other. The differences due to measurement error are also included in this term. Intuitively, nonshared envi- ronmental influences are likely to stem from aspects of environment that are specific to an individual, such as traumas and diseases, idiosyncratic experi- ences, different peers, and differential treatment by the parents. We know relatively little about the specific envi- ronmental influences that contribute to similarities or differences between siblings. Although the ex- amples we gave earlier for candidate shared envi- ronments seem intuitively to be shared by cotwins, this must be empirically tested. Influences that ap- pear to be objectively similar for two children could plausibly be experienced differently because of in- teractions with the children's genetic predispositions and unique experiences, and thus have a differential effect on their development (Plomin et al., 2001). In a review of nearly 100 genetic studies of normal variation in language skills, Stromswold (2001) con- cluded that almost all aspects of language ability, from syntax and semantics to phonology and artic- ulation, are influenced by genetic factors to some extent. However, the studies differ greatly in the extent to which shared environmental influence ap- pears to be important. For example, in the case of articulation, modest genetic influence and substan-</page><page sequence="3">634 Kovas et al. tial shared environmental influence were found in two studies of young children (Matheny &amp; Brugge- mann,1973; Mather. &amp; Black,1984). Genetic influence was substantial and shared environmental influence was negligible for speech production and a nonword repetition task (Bishop et al., 1999). Genetic and shared environmental influences were both moder- ate for phonological awareness (Hohnen &amp; Steven- son, 1999), vocabulary and verbal fluency (Thompson, Detterman, &amp; Plomin, 1991), and grammar (Dale, Dionne, Eley, &amp; Plomin, 2000; Mat- her &amp; Black, 1984; Mittler, 1969). However, not all measures that appear to assess similar abilities have resulted in similar estimates. For example, in con- trast to the moderate genetic effects on syntax re- ported by Dale et al. (2000), the "wug" elicitation task of inflectional morphology (Berko,1958) yielded a modest estimate of genetic influence and substan- tial influence of shared environment (Mather &amp; Black, 1984). This could be due to the different areas of morphosyntax measured by the two tasks, but it could equally be due to differences in the samples or procedures in the two studies. One reason the esti- mates of shared environment have differed so greatly across studies might be the use of the same versus different testers to assess members of twin pairs. For example, if the same parent assesses both twins (Dale et al., 2000), the estimate of shared en- vironment can be inflated. Unfortunately, not all studies provided this information; therefore, it is difficuit to judge whether this methodological dif- ference produced the inconsistencies in results. Fur- thermore, tester bias cannot be the sole explanation of different results across studies, as sometimes the influence of shared environment was moderate even when members of the twin pair were assessed by different testers (e.g., Hohnen &amp; Stevenson, 1999). Estimates of heritability and environmentality can be used to address the second question raised pre- viously, namely, whether the genetic and environ- mental etiology of low performance differs from the etiology of normal variation (Plomin et al., 2001). In the case of language acquisition, there is some indi- cation that genes may play a more important role in low-language performance than in normal ability (Spinath, Price, Dale, &amp; Plomin, 2004). In the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), parent-reported vocabulary and grammatical ability at 2, 3, and 4 years of age yielded slightly higher heritability esti- mates for the bottom 5% and 10% of the distribution than for the whole sample. Although the pattern appears consistent across these ages, it is important to emphasize that these differences in heritability estimates were very small. As with the results for the etiology of language development in the normal range, there is consid- erable variation in results for different aspects of language at the low end of ability, with heritability estimates ranging from 25% to 100% depending on the measures, samples, and methods used (Stromswold, 2001). It is therefore difficult to reach any reliable con- clusions about the etiology of the early development of different domains of language, either for the nor- mal range of ability or the low end of performance. The use of different methods of ascertainment and measures, and children of different and widely var- ying ages makes comparisons among studies diffi- cult. As discussed earlier, another possible source of variation in results is whether the same person as- sesses both members of a twin pair, which may lead to overestimation of twin similarity (particularly for identical twins) and thus distort genetic and envi- ronmental parameter estimates. For most previous studies, however, the main limitation has been small sample size, which results in large standard errors for genetic and environmental parameter estimates. For example, power analysis reveals that sample sizes of 180 pairs of each type of twin are required to attain 80% power simply to detect a typical herita- bility of .40 based on correlations of .60 for MZ twins and .40 for DZ twins (Neale, 1997). Point estimates of heritability based on twin samples of this size have large 95% confidence intervals, and much larger sample sizes are required to compare estimates across measures. Estimates of shared environment require even greater sample sizes (Neale, 1997). These considerations highlight the need for large twin studies of children of the same age with mul- tiple measures of language and different testers for each twin. A recently initiated study by Byrne et al. (2002) that used multiple measures and different testers, but did not yet have a large sample, focused on prereading and related cognitive skills. In a sample of 109 MZ and 106 DZ pairs, preliminary findings showed moderate genetic influences and negligible shared environmental influences on pho- nological awareness, and the opposite pattern for vocabulary, grammar, and morphology in preschool same-sex twins (M age = 58.9 months). Again, there was variability in genetic and environmental influ- ences within what could be considered a single as- pect of language. For example, productive grammar as assessed with a test of grammatical closure showed negligible genetic and moderate shared en- vironmental factors, whereas it showed moderate genetic influences when assessed with a test of pro- ductive morphology. The sample size was too small</page><page sequence="4">Individual Language Measures 635 to compare these estimates, although Byrne et al. reported that further data collection is in progress. Additionally, the focus of their study was on indi- vidual differences in the normal range, and they did not report any results for low performance. The results reported in the present study are from a subsample of TEDS, the largest twin study to in- vestigate diverse aspects of language including articulation, phonology, grammar, vocabulary, and verbal memory in a group of same-age children (4.5 years old), with each cotwin tested by a different tester. We previously reported results of genetic analyses of a general language composite based on these measures that yielded estimates of moderate heritability and shared environmental influence for the normal range of variation in a control sample of 310 twin pairs (Colledge et al., 2002) and for low performance in a sample of 393 twin pairs in which at least one twin was in the lowest 15% of the dis- tribution (Viding et al., 2004). However, the general language factor, as indexed by a first unrotated principal component, accounted for less than half of the variance of the language measures (Hayiou- Thomas et al., 2004), which warrants an examination of the individual language measures. The present study focused on univariate analyses of nine diverse measures of language to investigate the relative contributions of genetic and environ- mental factors to individual differences for both the normal range of variation and the low end of ability. In addition to comparing the etiology of normal variation and low extremes in our sample, we asked whether there are sex differences in the etiology of ability and disability in diverse language domains. Phenotypically, there is a well-established average male disadvantage for many areas of language. For example, girls' articulation was advanced relative to boys' articulation in a study of young twins (Ma- theny &amp; Bruggemann, 1973). Girls also tend to pro- duce language earlier than do boys (Karmiloff &amp; Karmiloff-Smith, 2001) and to acquire vocabulary somewhat faster than boys between the ages of about 14 and 20 months, after which time boys begin to catch up (Huttenlocher, Haight, Bryk, Seltzer, &amp; Ly- ons, 1991). At the low end of performance, too, boys are more likely to have vocabulary delay at age 2 but are nearly as likely as girls to catch up to normal vocabulary levels by age 4 (Dale, Price, Bishop, &amp; Plomin, 2003). In addition, the average male:female ratio in SLI has been estimated as 2.8:1 (Robinson, 1987). However, these findings refer to mean differ- ences between the sexes; our focus is on the etiology of individual differences within the sexes that is, whether the same genetic and environmental factors influence differences in language ability for boys and girls. These etiological factors may be completely different from those that affect mean sex differences (for further discussion of this distinction, see Viding et al., 2004). Previous analysis of the general language com- posite derived from our measures yielded little evi- dence for differences between boys and girls for the estimates of genetic and environmental influence on language impairment (Viding et al., 2004). However, previous studies have not investigated the possibil- ity that sex differences might emerge for some lin- guistic skills but not others. In the current study we included opposite-sex twins to explore sex differ- ences in genetic and environmental influences for each measure, which tests the possibility that such differences exist for some aspects of language but not others. There are three possibilities for the causes of in- dividual differences in boys and girls, regardless of mean differences between the sexes (Neale &amp; Maes, 2003). The first possibility is that different genetic and environmental factors are responsible for indi- vidual differences in language for boys and girls these are called qualitative differences. An example of qualitative sex differences is sex-specific genetic influences that contribute to individual dif- ferences in one sex but not the other. Such sex-spe- cific effects are not limited to genes on the X chromosome but can also involve genes on the au- tosomal chromosomes that affect boys and girls dif- ferently, for example, because the genes interact with sex hormones. The second possibility, not mutually exclusive with the first, is that the same etiological influences affect individual differences in boys and girls but that they do so to a different extent. For example, the same genes may play a greater role in individual differences for boys than girls these are known as quantitative differences. The third possibility is that even if there are mean differences, there are no differences in the etiology of individual differences for boys and girls; the same genes and environments operate to the same extent in both sexes. That is, boys as a group may exhibit a disadvantage in language, but the factors that make one boy different from another boy are the same as those that make one girl different from an- other girl. In summary, the main objectives of this study were: (a) to use the twin method to estimate the ex- tent to which genes and environment influence dif- ferent aspects of language, (b) to investigate genetic and environmental influences on the low-language</page><page sequence="5">636 Kovas et al. extremes of language development as well as on the normal range of variation, and (3) to test whether the same genetic and environmental factors and the same magnitude of genetic and environmental ef- fects influence individual differences in boys and girls, both for the whole sample and for the low- language extremes. Method Participants and Procedure All participants were part of TEDS. This longitu- dinal study involves a representative sample of all twins born in England and Wales in 1994, 1995, and 1996 whose language, cognitive, and behavior de- velopment has been assessed by parental question- naires at 2, 3, and 4 years of age (Trouton, Spinath, &amp; Plomin, 2002). A subsample of TEDS was selected for an in- depth, in-home assessment at 4.5 years of age (herein referred to as the in-home sample). The mean age of the in-home sample was 4 years 6 months (SD = 2 months, range = 4;0-4;11). All participants in the in- home sample were selected to be ethnically White to control for the effect of ethnic stratification in future molecular genetic studies; however, more than 94% of the population of England and Wales is White. The following exclusion criteria were also used: specific medical syndromes such as Down syndrome and other chromosomal anomalies, cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, autism spectrum disor- der, organic brain damage, and extreme outliers for birth weight, gestational age, maternal alcohol con- sumption during pregnancy, and special care after birth. Only participants for whom English was the first language spoken at home were selected. Both same- and opposite-sex twin pairs were included to investigate potential sex differences. As an indication of representativeness of this subsample, maternal education levels were assessed: We found that 32% of mothers with A levels (university entrance quali- fications) were comparable both with the overall TEDS sample (39%) and U.K. Office of National Statistics census data (32%). The purpose of the in-home sample was to in- vestigate impairments in language and cognitive development. To ensure that the sample would contain both a sufficient number of controls (with typical development in these areas) and a substantial number of children with impairment, we used the parental reports obtained at 4 years for the whole TEDS sample as screening tools. We selected 516 twin pairs for the in-home study, in which at least one twin's scores on the screening measures sug- gested the twin was at risk for low language or nonverbal ability. Children were considered at risk for low language ability if they met any of the fol- lowing three criteria: (a) children were in the lowest 5% of the vocabulary distribution as assessed by an upward extension of the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI; Fenson et al., 1994; see also Dionne, Dale, Boivin, &amp; Plomin, 2003), a parent report measure of vocabulary; (b) parents selected one or more of the following descriptions of their child's language: "not yet talking," "talking in one-word utterances," "talking in 2 or 3 word phrases," in response to the question "which of the following best describes the way your child talks?" (from the TEDS parent report booklet); (c) parents indicated concern about their child's speech and language development by selecting the following item: "his/her language is developing slowly" (from the TEDS parent report booklet), and the child scored 4 or less on a parent-administered receptive picture vocabulary test (eight items based on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R), Dunn &amp; Dunn, 1981). The children were considered at risk of poor nonverbal development if they scored in the lowest 5% of the nonverbal ability distribution as assessed by the Parent Report of Children's Abilities (PARCA; Saudino et al., 1998; see also Oliver, Dale, Saudino, Pike, &amp; Plomin, 2002). All the twin pairs in the TEDS sample, in which at least one of the chil- dren met any of the preceding criteria, who had data available at the start of the in-home study were se- lected for the in-home testing. In addition, a control sample of 310 twin pairs was randomly selected from all TEDS twins who did not meet any of the preceding criteria. We excluded 49 pairs from analyses because one or both twins in a pair had missing data or it was discovered at the time of the home visit that they met the exclusion criteria. All analyses described next were performed on data from the remaining sample of 1,574 children who were from 281 MZ pairs, 275 DZ same-sex pairs, and 231 DZ opposite-sex pairs. Procedures Informed consent was obtained in writing from all of the families who agreed to take part in the study. The sessions took approximately lhr 30 min, during which the children were assessed on a battery of verbal and nonverbal tests (the full battery is de- scribed in Colledge et al., 2002). A different tester assessed each member of a twin pair.</page><page sequence="6">Individual Language Measures 637 Measures The verbal battery was chosen with the following criteria in mind: Tests should be suitable for 4.5-year- olds, should show variation across the range of ability at this age, should have established psycho- metric properties, and should differ from each other with respect to the main putative source of variation. Without subscribing to a particular theoretical posi- tion on the structure of the language domain, we aimed at choosing tests that would cover a wide range of the linguistic abilities of 4.5-year-old chil- dren, including phonology, semantics, and grammar. In addition, the measures differ according to whether they primarily assess expressive or recep- tive ability and the demands they make on memory (either working or semantic memory) and metalin- guistic awareness. Some overlap in what these tests measure is inevitable, as they each make demands on overlapping cognitive and performance factors (attention, motivation, memory), and it is never possible to get a completely pure measure of one language component. Consider, for example, Berko's (1958) famous wug test that was devised to measure children's knowledge of morphological rules. In the test children are asked to name pictures of strange animals and people performing unusual actions, using nonsense words. A classic exampIe is the ex- perimenter pointing to a picture saying: "This is a wug. This is another one. Now there are two ." The children are then expected to fill the gap with the appropriate plural ending. Although good perform- ance on this test provides evidence of knowledge of formation rules for verb morphology, poor per- formance could reflect nonmorphological factors, such as difficulty in remembering the nonword that needs to be inflected (weak phonological short-term memory) or expressive phonological impairment. Although one can never completely control for the multiple verbal and nonverbal influences on per- formance of a language test, it is nevertheless pos- sible to choose tests that stress one component of language more than another. This was the aim in the current study, and evidence that it was achieved can be seen from the fact that, for the nine measures we used, the phenotypic intercorrelations are moderate (see the Results section), accounting for approxi- mately 16% of the variance between them and sug- gesting that the tests do measure diverse abilities. Expressive Semantics Three tests were used to index the child's se- mantic skills while minimizing the role of syntax and phonology: the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abil- ities (MSCA) Word Knowledge (McCarthy, 1972), the MSCA Verbal Fluency (McCarthy, 1972), and the Renfrew Bus Story Test (Renfrew, 1997a). MSCA Word Knowledge (McCarthy, 1972) is an expressive test of semantic knowledge. The Picture Vocabulary subtest requires the child to point to the picture corresponding to the word said by the ex- aminer. The Oral Vocabulary subtest requires the child to give an oral definition of 10 words: 2 points are awarded for including utility, salient character- istics, or a good synonym; 1 point for describing a word incompletely or vaguely; and 0 points when no knowledge of the word is indicated. For example, towel would receive 2 points for a response that in- cluded to dry, but only 1 point for use in bathroom. The maximum raw score for this subtest is 20. Only the Oral Vocabulary subtest was used because of a ceil- ing effect in the Picture Vocabulary subtest. Syntactic complexity and phonological accuracy of responses are not taken into account when scoring the Word Knowledge subtest. MSCAVerbal Fluency (McCarthy, 1972) is a test of word generation and semantic knowledge. The child is asked to name as many exampIes of items as possible in a given category within 20 s. There are four categories: things to eat, animals, things to wear, and things to ride, where 1 point is awarded for each acceptable response, with a maximum score of 9 for each category imposed; the maximum possible raw score is therefore 36. This test, unlike MCSA Word Knowledge, stresses speed and flexibility in retriev- ing lexical items from memory. The Renfrew Bus Story test (Renfrew, 1997a) as- sesses ability to give a coherent description of a continuous series of events. The experimenter reads a story from a book with pictures, and the child is then asked to retell the story while looking at the pictures. We used the information score suggested by Renfrew et al. (1997a), which reflects the story content included in the retelling. For example, in the story, a policeman blows his whistle and says, "Stop, bus!" to a runaway anthropomorphic bus. The child would receive 1 point for mentioning the policeman, an additional 1 point for mentioning the whistle, and another 1 point for mentioning that the policeman said "Stop." The information score disregards the grammatical complexity of the child's narrative and is concerned only with the content. Although it is possible to obtain an index of syntactic complexity from the Bus Story, we did not include this in the current analysis, as we believed that the results might be biased in favor of finding commonalities between semantics and syntax if the same narrative</page><page sequence="7">638 Kovas et al. was used to index both domains. Although we have categorized the Bus Story as an expressive semantic test, task demands are considerably more complex than for the Word Knowledge test, insofar as the child has to both understand and retell the story. Thus, this test assesses both expressive and receptive abilities, and makes demands on both semantic and working memory. The Bus Story information score has been shown to be a sensitive index of SLI and a good predictor of outcome in language-impaired children (Bishop &amp; Edmundson, 1987). Expressive Syntax The Renfrew Action Picture test (Renfrew, 1997b), grammar score, is an elicitation task designed to solicit utterances containing different types of grammatical construction. It has been shown to be sensitive to variations in grammatical development in 4-year-olds, and it differentiates children with SLI from typically developing children (Bishop &amp; Ed- mundson, 1987). In this test, the child is presented with 10 picture cards depicting scenes of increasing complexity and is asked to describe each one; the examiner can use a limited number of indirect prompts to encourage a full description. As with the Bus Story, separate information and grammar scores can be derived from the child's response: the infor- mation score is based on the content of the child's response (similar to the Bus Story); the grammar score reflects the use of inflectional morphology and function words. For example, the first card shows a girl cuddling her teddy bear. The maximum information score for this card is 2 points for mentioning cuddle and teddy. The maximum grammar score is l point for using the progressive -ing on cuddling. The information and grammar scores were highly correlated in our sam- ple (.77). However, because we did not want to bias our results in favor of finding associations between syntax and semantics, we used only the grammar measure from this task. The constructions elicited in the Action Picture test are as follows: present parti- ciple -ing; future tense; regular past tense -ed; irreg- ular past tense; regular plural noun -s; irregular plural nouns; possessive -s; nominative pronouns she, he, it; relative pronouns that, which, who; auxiliary is, has, was; passive got, been; coordinating conjunc- tion and; subordinating conjunction because; and de- terminers a, the. Phonological accuracy of utterances is not taken into account when scoring the Action Pictures test (the grammar score), although it must be acknowl- edged that a child with an expressive phonological impairment could be handicapped by problems in producing inflected forms. Receptive Syntax The British Ability Scales Verbal Comprehension subtest (BAS; Elliot, Smith, &amp; McCulloch, 1996) is a test of receptive language. The child is presented with a set of toys and asked to arrange them ac- cording to the examiner's instruction. For example, for the instructions "put the house on each side of the car," the child receives 1 point for a correct re- sponse (no verbal response required), and 0 points for an incorrect response. We used a subscale con- sisting of the last 11 items of the BAS I Verbal Comprehension subscale, which required compre- hension of grammatical morphology and syntax (a maximum raw score of 11 is therefore possible). The scores from the first section of this subtest, which consisted of items requiring only lexical compre- hension, showed a clear ceiling effect and were ex- cluded from further analyses. Verbal Memory Memory for meaningful materials. The MSCA Verbal Memory Words and Sentences (McCarthy, 1972) subtest requires the child to repeat words presented in three- or four-word sequences or sentences. We awarded 1 point for each successfully repeated key word, and a maximum of 30 points is possible on this subtest. Note that performance with the sentence stimuli in this subtest is influenced by receptive and expressive syntactic ability, in addition to the mem- ory requirement. MCSA also includes a Story subtest that requires the repetition of a short story; however, this subtest showed a floor effect and was excluded from further analyses. Phonological short-term memory. The Children's Test of Nonword Repetition (Gathercole &amp; Baddeley, 1996) is a test of phonological working memory in which the child is asked to repeat nonsense words (e.g., skiticult, rubid). This task also makes substan- tial demands on receptive phonological ability as well as expressive phonology. A 20-item version of the test was used, with 10 items at each of the two- and three-syllable lengths based on the pilot work suggesting that longer words produced floor effect at this age. We awarded 1 point for a correct response and 0 points for an incorrect response, with a maxi- mum possible raw score of 20. Because children's articulation at this age is often immature, it was not feasible to adjust scoring to allow for misrepetitions that were consistent with the</page><page sequence="8">Individual Language Measures 639 child's expressive phonological repertoire. Thus, re- sults from this measure are sensitive to articulatory accuracy as well as phonological short-term memory. Receptive Phonology We considered using a test of speech sound dis- crimination to assess basic receptive phonology skills but decided against this on the basis of pilot work that showed that 4-year-olds lacked the necessary attentional skills to complete the kind of multiple- choice test that is typically used in this area. A test of phonological awareness was included in our battery because there is ample evidence that this language skill plays a unique role in literacy devel- opment (Bradley &amp; Bryant, 1983), independent of vocabulary and verbal memory. At the time this study was conceived, there were no good standard- ized tests of phonological awareness suitable for 4-year-olds, and we therefore devised our own ma- terials. The phonological awareness task (based on Bird, Bishop, &amp; Freeman, 1995) is a purely receptive task that does not involve any expressive language from the child but requires the child to judge whether phonemes presented in different word contexts are the same. The test has substantial metalinguistic and memory demands, but every ef- fort is made to reduce the memory load. The child is introduced to puppets and told that the puppets like things that sound like their names. Pictured choice items are named by the experimenter and left in front of the child. The child is required to choose one item from the set of four (two in the practice trials) on the basis of rhyme. After four practice trials with feedback, a further eight items are administered. For example: "Which of these things would Lynn like?" "Chair?" "'Bin?" We awarded 1 point for each cor- rect response, with a maximum possible raw score of 8 points. Expressive Phonology The Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation (Gold- man &amp; Fristoe, 1986) Sounds-in-Words subtest is designed to assess production of specific speech sounds. The child is asked to name pictures depict- ing objects and actions that are familiar to young children. The examiner listens for specific target phonemes most of which are tested for in initial, medial, and final positions and codes these as correct (1 point) or incorrect (O points). Twenty-three simple consonants and 12 blends are tested, with a maximum possible raw score of 74. With the exception of the phonological awareness task, which is based on materials used by Bird et al. (1995), all tasks used in this study are published measures, well established, and widely used. Full information on standardization, reliability, and va- lidity of each test can be found in the published manuals: the MSCA (McCarthy, 1972), the Gold- man-Fristoe Test of Articulation (Goldman &amp; Fris- toe, 1986), the Action Picture test and the Bus Story test from the Renfrew Language Scales (Renfrew, 1997a, 1997b), the Verbal Comprehension subtest from the BAS (Elliot, Smith, &amp; McCulloch, 1997), and the Children's Test of Nonword Repetition (Gather- cole &amp; Baddeley, 1996). Analyses The twin method is based on estimating the rela- tive genetic and shared and nonshared environ- mental components of variance by comparing intraclass correlations for MZ twins who are geneti- cally identical and DZ twins whose genetic related- ness is on average .50. The relatedness for shared (common) environmental influences is assumed to be 1.0 for both MZ and DZ twin pairs who grow up in the same family because they experience similar prenatal and postnatal environments. Thus, if lin- guistic abilities are more similar within MZ twin pairs than within DZ pairs, genetic influences are suggested. Heritability can be estimated as twice the differ- ence in MZ and DZ twin correlations. Shared envi- ronment can be estimated by subtracting the heritability estimate from the MZ correlation, which reflects similarity between twins beyond that ac- counted for by genetic similarity. The remaining proportion of variance, not accounted for by the genetic relation of a twin pair or by the fact that the twins are growing up in the same family, is attrib- uted to nonshared environment but also includes measurement error. Model-fitting analysis is a more comprehensive way of estimating variance compo- nents based on the same principles. Further details of the twin method and its assumptions are described elsewhere (Plomin et al., 2001). Model Fitting Individual Differences Analyses The analyses of individual differences reported in this study employed variations on the full ACE model that apportions the phenotypic variance into</page><page sequence="9">640 Kovas et al. genetic (A), shared environmental (C), and non- shared environmental (E) components, assuming no effects of nonadditive genetics or nonrandom mat- ing. Sex differences in the genetic and environmental parameter estimates were assessed by testing a full sex-limited model and a series of three nested models corresponding to the three alternatives out- lined earlier: qualitative differences, quantitative differences, and no differences. Each of these possi- bilities is associated with a set of parameters in the models. Qualitative differences are reflected in the genetic correlation (rg) between DZ opposite-sex twins. In DZ same-sex pairs, the assumption is that on average the twins share 50% of their varying DNA, and the coefficient of genetic relatedness (the genetic correlation between the two children) is therefore 0.5. If there are qualitative differences in etiology between boys and girls (different genetic and environmental factors), the genetic correlation in DZ opposite-sex twins will be less than 0.5. If there are quantitative differences (the same factors but exerting different magnitudes of effect) rather than qualitative differences, the genetic correlation for DZ opposite-sex pairs will be 0.5, but the parameter estimates for the A, C, and E components will be significantly different for male-male pairs and female-female pairs. If there are no differences be- tween boys and girls, the DZ opposite-sex pairs will have a genetic correlation of 0.5 and the A, C, and E estimates for male-male and female-female pairs will be the same, although the phenotypic variance might nonetheless differ for the two sexes because mean differences are often associated with variance dif- ferences (i.e., higher means have higher variances). The full model allows all parameters to vary: r8 in the DZ opposite-sex twins, and A, C, E, and variance estimates. The first nested model is a common-effects sex-limitation model, which fixes rg to 0.5 in the DZ opposite-sex twins but allows different A, C, E, and variance estimates. The second nested model is a scalar effects sex-limitation model, which constrains the rg in the OZ opposite-sex twins, as well as the A, C, and E parameters, but allows differences in phe- notypic variance between males and females by modeling the variance in one sex to be a scalar multiple of the variance in the other sex. The third and final nested model tests the null hypothesis and constrains all the parameters to be equal for males and females. The ACE parameters and their confidence inter- vals were estimated by fitting the full and nested models to variance-covariance matrices using the model-fitting program Mx (Neale, 1997). The overall fit of each model was evaluated using three indexes. The chi-square statistic, where degrees of freedom equal the number of observed correlations minus the number of estimated parameters, indicates the fit of the full model and tests the fit of nested models, with a lower value indicating better fit (with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in degrees of free- dom between the full and nested models). However, the chi-square statistic is inflated with large sample sizes. The other two indexes Akaike's information criterion (AIC = x2-2 df; Akaike, 1987) and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) give more interpretable estimates of fit for larger samples, with lower values representing better fit- ting models. Extremes Analyses For each of the measures, we defined probands as children who scored more than 1 SD below the sample's mean (15.87% of the whole sample). This cutoff does not correspond to any standard diagnosis of language disability but rather identifies statisti- cally low performance on that measure. The corre- spondence between the cutoffs applied in the current study (based on the distributional properties of our sample) and the published test norms is reported in the Results section. Probandwise concordances (the ratio of the number of probands in concordant pairs to the total number of probands) were calculated separately for each measure and each of the 5 Sex x Zygosity groups. Probandwise concordances represent the risk that a cotwin of a proband is affected (Plomin et al., 2001). Greater MZ than DZ concordances suggest genetic influence, but unlike twin correlations, twin concordances cannot be used to estimate genetic and environmental parameters because they do not in themselves include information about the popula- tion incidence. The liability threshold model, which is a natural extension of quantitative genetic models for quanti- tative traits, is widely used in genetics to analyze concordance data (Sham, 1998). The model assumes an underlying continuous liability that has a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 in the general population. If the liability to a disorder is quantitative rather than categorical, the disorder is assumed to be present in all individuals whose lia- bility is above a certain threshold value and to be absent in all other individuals. The value of the threshold can be estimated from the population fre- quency of the disorder. The liability is not measured directly but is estimated from the observed categor-</page><page sequence="10">Table 1 Means (Standard Devahaons) for the Nane Measures for tSae W7ole Sample and for the Test Norms, and Scores Corresponding to the- 1 SD Cutoff M (SD) Cutoff score at M (SD) for the -1 SD for the from the whole probands in test norms sample the study Bus information 18.3 (7.0) 15.1 (9.9) 5 N= 1,530 AP-Grammar 20 (5.8) 16.4 (7.0) 9 N= 1,515 BAS Comprehensiona 8.5 7.39 5 N= 1,562 Word Knowledgeb 14.5 (2.9) 12.1 (3.4) 8 N= 1,574 Verbal Fluency 11.1 (5.2) 10.9 (6.0) 5 N = 1,574 Verbal Memory 20.1 (6.5) 14.7 (8.2) 6 N = 1,574 Phon. awareness 4.3 (2.2) 2 N = 1,517 GF-ArticulationC 9.5 9 16 N= 1,554 Nonword repetition 12 11.1 (5.4) 5 N= 1,478 Note.

CFor GF- Articulation (Sounds-in-Words Subtest), the statistics refer to the number of errors, the mean score represents approxi- mately the 46th percentile on the normative distribution, and the cutoff of 16 corresponds to approximately the 20th percentile. To allow for comparisons among the different measures, standardizations were carried out sepa- rately for all nine measures using the means and standard deviations of the entire sample (after ex- clusions described in the Method section), so that each test had a mean of O and unit variance for the total sample of 1574. With the exception of the Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation (which was subjected to log transformation), all measures re- ported in this study have unimodal (and in most Individual Language Measures 641 ical data. For the purposes of this study, the data from the entire twin sample were organized into 2 x 2 contingency tables, where cells represent pairs in which both twins are unaffected, both twins are probands, and two discordant cells where Twin 1 or Twin 2 is a proband. These data can be used to quantify genetic and environmental sources of vari- ation in liability in the population. In this study a structural equation model was fit to the contingency tables by maximum likelihood, using the Mx pro- gram to estimate ACE parameters (Neale, 1997). A full sex-limited liability-threshold model and a series of nested models were tested; the full model, common effects model, and scalar effects models used were the same as those used in the individual differences modeling. In addition, the null model in this case equated thresholds for males and females; the threshold corresponds to the proportion of af- fected individuals for the two sexes. Whether the same threshold could be fit for males and for females tested whether rates of disorder differed for males and females. Differences in the results for the extremes analyses and the individual differences analyses were treated as statistically significant when the point parameter estimates for the individual differences analyses fell outside the 95% confidence intervals of the estimate in the extreme analysis. Results To investigate the extent to which the intentional overrepresentation of low-language children in our sample affected the distribution of scores for each measure, descriptive statistics from the total sample of 1,574 children were compared with those from the standardization samples reported in the test manuals (see Table 1). Although means were lower and standard deviations were greater for most of the measures, the means and standard deviations were comparable with the reported norms. These results suggest that although the distribution of most measures was shifted toward the low end, this shift was within 1 SD of the reported norms for 4.5-year- olds. The enrichment of the sample for cases who were at risk for low language was advantageous in terms of increasing the statistical power needed to study language disability in the context of language ability. Table 1 shows the raw scores from each measure corresponding to the -1 SD cutoff for proband se- lection in the present sample. It can be seen that the cutoff for each measure corresponds to between-1 and -2.2 SD in the published norms for the tests.</page><page sequence="11">642 Kovas et al. b .A a d  c g - h | ww w wgFFWw-s w w w w w w w wSvw Figure 1.

Although all children were tested at around 4.5 years of age, the results could be affected even by small differences in age at this important stage of language development. Therefore, the linear effects of age were regressed from these standardized data. Descriptive statistics for the age-regressed scores for the nine measures are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that MZ twins consistently have lower means than do DZ twins, which may be due to greater perinatal complications of MZ twins (Le- nneberg, 1967). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) re- vealed a significant main effect of zygosity for all nine measures favoring DZ twins. However, the ef- fect size (52) of zygosity is small, accounting for be- tween .5% and 1.6% of the variance. Similarly, girls generally performed significantly better than boys for seven of the nine measures. The largest mean sex difference was found for nonword repetition, which accounted for 3.2% of the variance. However, the other significant sex effects were negligible, ac- counting for .2% to .7% of the variance. Sex x Zygosity interaction was not significant for any of the measures. Pairs in which one or both twins scored 3 or more SDs below or above the mean were excluded from further analysis of individual differences (but not extremes) for each individual measure: 1 pair for the Renfrew Bus Story Information test, 14 pairs for the BAS Verbal Comprehension subtest, 14 pairs for the MSCA Word Knowledge subtest, and 3 pairs for the MSCA Verbal Fluency subtest. This exclusion was necessary because extreme scores can lead to distortion of results in correlational analyses. Pairs in which one or both twins had missing data were also excluded from further analysis for each measure. Final numbers of participants included in the genetic anal- yses for each measure are presented in Tables 2 and 4. Phenotypic relationships between the measures have been investigated and described in another TEDS study (Hayiou-Thomas et al., 2004), which fo- cuses on multivariate genetic analysis.

It can be seen from Table 3 that MZ twins performed more similarly than DZ twins on all nine measures, with average MZ and DZ correlations of .55 and .35, respectively. Doubling the difference between the MZ and DZ twin corre- lations suggests an average heritability estimate of .40. Shared environmental influence can be estimat- ed as .15, the extent to which the heritability estimate of .40 does not account for the MZ correlation of .55. The rest of the variance, .45, can be attributed to nonshared environment and measurement error. Generally similar results are found for boys and girls separately, especially when taking into account the smaller sample sizes, suggesting that ACE parameter estimates are similar for boys and girls. Another in- teresting finding is that opposite-sex DZ twins are not less correlated than same-sex DZ twins the average correlation for opposite-sex twins is .32 and the average correlation for same-sex twins is .34. This is consistent with the hypothesis of similar etiologies of individual differences in these measures of lan- guage development for boys and girls. The full sex-limitation model and the reduced models were tested and compared as described in the Analyses subsection. The results of the model fitting are summarized in Table 4. All model com- parisons favored the null model. In other words, fixing ACE parameters and variances to be the same for boys and girls, and fixing the genetic correlation for DZ opposite-twin pairs to .5 resulted in nonsig- nificant changes in the fit of the model. This suggests that the quantity and quality of genetic and envi- ronmental effects are the same in boys and girls. For this reason only the parameter estimates from the null model are presented in Table 4. As suggested by the twin correlations in Table 3, the overall pattern of results suggests that all mea- sured aspects of language are moderately heritable (.29-.53), whereas shared environment has a much smaller influence on these abilities (.06-.26). Non- shared environmental influence is moderate for all measures (.34-.56), which is partly due to the in- clusion of measurement error in this component.

For example, the confidence intervals overlap between the most heritable measure (Bus Story Information test) and the least heritable measure (Action Picture Grammar test), which in- dicates that these heritability estimates do not differ significantly. Therefore, only very broad conclusions can be drawn for these nine language measures: consistent and moderate genetic and nonshared en- vironmental influences, and modest shared envi- ronmental influence. Extremes Analyses Genetic and environmental influences on per- formance at the low end of the distribution were first examined by comparing MZ and DZ probandwise concordances. Table 5 shows that concordances for MZ twins are generally higher than for DZ twins, with the exception of phonological awareness task and BAS Comprehension test. The average MZ and DZ concordances are .51 and .33, respectively, sug- gesting that genetic influence at the low extreme is of a similar magnitude to the results found for indi-</page><page sequence="14">Table 5 Probandwise Twin Concordances and Number of Affected Individuals (Probands) for Verbal Disability at 15 So Cutoff Organized by Sex and Zygosity for the Nine Measures MZ DZ MZm DZm MZf DZf DZopp Bus info. 58% 24% 57% 14% 59% 34% 25% n=100 n=150 n=42 n=43 n=58 n=35 n=72 AP - Grammar 57% 42% 62No 58% 52% 38% 31% n = 105 n = 130 n -55 n=45 n=50 n =26 n =59 BAS Comp. 42% 41% 36% 37% 49% 44% 42% n =90 n= 137 n =45 n =43 n=45 n=32 n -62 Word Know. 62% 36% 60% 45% 63% 27% 35% n=110 n=139 n=53 n=40 n=57 n=30 n=69 Verbal Fluency 55% 26% 54% 29% 57% 33% 21% n = 105 n = 113 n = 59 n = 56 n = 46 n = 30 n = 67 Verbal Memory 47% 34% 41% 47% 54% 34% 25% n = 131 n = 164 n = 68 n = 55 n = 63 n = 29 n = 80 Phon.

Individual Language Measures 645 vidual differences throughout the distribution. Again, results were similar for boys and girls. The full sex-limitation liability threshold model and the reduced models were tested and compared as described in the Analyses subsection. All model comparisons favored the scalar effects sex-limitation model that constrains genetic and environmental parameters to be equal between the sexes. In other words, as was the case for the individual differences analyses, fixing ACE parameters to be the same for boys and girls, and fixing the genetic correlation for DZ opposite-sex twin pairs to .5 resulted in nonsig- nificant changes in the fit, suggesting that the quantity and quality of genetic and environmental effects are the same in boys and girls. However, the thresholds could not be equated for boys and girls, as this resulted in a significantly worsened model fit. These results suggest that although boys are more likely to have a language disability, these mean dif- ferences must be explained by factors other than those that drive individual differences (see the Dis- cussion). Table 6 summarizes the results of the best-fitting scalar models for the low extremes of the nine measures. As expected from the twin concordances in Table 5, the phonological awareness task and BAS Comprehension test show zero heritability estimates. The Bus Story Information and Verbal Fluency tests show substantial heritability, zero shared environ- mental influence, and moderate nonshared envi- ronmental influence. The other five measures show modest to moderate heritability, modest shared en- vironmental influence, and modest to moderate nonshared environmental influence. However, the wide confidence intervals for these measures do not allow for direct comparisons among them and indi- cate that heritability might not be significantly less for the phonological awareness task and BAS Com- prehension test than for the other seven measures. As described in the Analyses section, ACE esti- mates were compared for individual differences and the extremes (see Tables 3 and 5). Despite the ap- parent differences in the estimates for the two anal- yses, heritability estimates from the individual differences analyses never fell outside the confidence intervals of the estimates from the analyses of ex- tremes. Indeed, the point estimates from the two types of analyses were strikingly similar for most</page><page sequence="15">Table 6 Extremes Analyses: Parameter Estimates (and Confidence Intervals) From the Liability-Threshold Model of Best Fit for the Nine Measures x2 df Probability AIC RMSEA a2 c2 e2 Bus story information 19.64 12 .074 -4.361 .033 .69 (.39- .81) .00 (.00 - .23) .31 (.19- .47) AP-Grammar 24.28 12 .019 0.283 .029 .21 (.00-.63) .48 (.13-.72) .30 (.18-.46) BAS Comp. 9.61 12 .651 -14.395 .000 .00 (.00 - .41) .56 (.23 - .67) .44 (.29 - .57) Word Knowledge 13.17 12 .357 - 10.832 .012 .51 (.10-.85) .25 (.00-.58) .24 (.14-.38) Verbal Fluency 20.87 12 .052 - 3.129 .031 .67 (.33-.80) .00 (.00-.27) .33 (.20-.48) Verbal Memory 26.91 12 .008 2.910 .039 .19 (.00-.64) .32 (.00-.56) .49 (.34-.65) Phonological awareness 7.39 12 .831 -16.614 .000 .00 (.00-.39) .22 (.00-.37) .78 (.60-.93) GF-Articulation 13.24 12 .352 -10.760 .011 .36 (.00- .74) .41 (.08 - .70) .22 (.13- .36) Nonword repetition 12.00 12 .446 - 12.000 .015 .41 (.00-.66) .09 (.00-.48) .50 (.33-.69) Note.

The thresholds are not equated for males and females. 646 Kovas et al. measures, with the exception of the two receptive measures. Estimates for shared environment fell just outside the confidence intervals for only one mea- sure (BAS Comprehension). Overall, it can be con- cluded that the ACE estimates for the individual differences and the extremes are similar, at least within the limits of power provided by this largest- yet twin study. In other words, liability to different language disabilities and individual differences in language abilities are influenced by moderate ge- netic influence and modest to moderate shared en- vironmental influence. Figures 2a and 2b summarize the main findings of the study. It should be noted that although the present study is by far the largest twin study of low language performance across several measures within the same sample tested at the same age, the smaller sample size and categorical nature of the data of the liability threshold analysis led to the reduction in power to detect significant effects (Neale, Eaves, &amp; Kendler, 1994). Thus, no direct comparisons across the measures or the two types of analyses are pos- sible. However, the overall pattern of results sug- gests moderate genetic influence and modest to moderate shared environmental influence for most measures, with the possible exception of the two receptive measures (phonological awareness task and BAS Comprehension test) that may be less in- fluenced by genetic factors, particularly at the low extreme of the continuum. It should also be noted that although the broad pattern of A, C, and E esti- mates is similar for the low extremes and the full range of performance, the reduced power for the extremes analyses resulted in more variable esti- mates. Discussion The main objectives of this study were: (a) to use the twin method to estimate the extent to which genes and environment influence different aspects of lan- guage, (b) to investigate genetic and environmental influences on the low-language extremes of language development as well as on the normal range of var- iation, and (c) to explore sex differences in genetic and environmental influences on diverse aspects of language using opposite-sex twins. Overall, the results suggest that such diverse as- pects of language as expressive and receptive grammar, phonology, articulation, lexical knowl- edge, and verbal memory show moderate heritabil- ity and moderate influence of nonshared environment. Shared environmental influence is modest for most measures. The results are similar when only the low end of the continuum is studied, with the possible exception of the two receptive measures (phonological awareness task and BAS Comprehension test). This similarity is consistent with the hypothesis that the same genetic and envi- ronmental influences are involved in shaping indi- vidual differences and differences in liability to a disorder. One important caution in interpreting our find- ings concerns possible heterogeneity in the etiology of low language performance. Our method cannot differentiate between cases whose language prob-</page><page sequence="16">F CuNonshared Environment Shared Environment EGenes | 100%- - 90% - o 80%- - 70%-- DA 0 - 2 o ' | S ' | W 01 O E z = O E L g U m (g &lt; O E z (D L m g Q % &lt; a) &gt; &gt; Language Measures | ClNonshared Environment Shared Environment EGenes Individual Language Measures 647 identical heritabilities and environmentalities could emerge from different sets of genes and environ- ments). It is possible, therefore, that our sample in- cludes cases that represent the low end of the normal continuum as well as cases with single-gene disor- ders (although not FOXP2, as genotyping in our sample did not find a single case of the FOXP2 mu- tation; Meaburn et al., 2002). Although this is logi- cally possible, monogenic disorders are typically extreme and are associated with very high herit- abilities; if such cases were present in our sample we would probably have found higher heritabilities in our extremes analyses. Our results can be compared with previous find- ings from the TEDS sample at 2 and 3 years of age, when the twins' expressive vocabulary and grammar were assessed by their parents. For example, con- sistent with our results, moderate influences of ge- netic factors on expressive grammatical ability were found in 2-year-old twins (Dale et al., 2000; Dionne et al., 2003) and in 3-year-old twins (Dionne et al., 2003). For expressive vocabulary, smaller genetic in- fluences were found at 2 and 3 years (Dionne et al., 2003). Overall, the influences of shared environ- mental factors for both vocabulary and expressive grammar at 2 and 3 years were larger than found in the present study. These differences may reflect a developmental trend by which genetic influences increase and shared environmental differences de- crease with age. Such a trend has been previously reported for general cognitive ability, with increasing heritability for g continuing into adolescence and adulthood (McGue, Bouchard, Iacono, &amp; Lykken, 1993). In the future we plan to test directly whether this longitudinal pattern also holds for language ability, using the longitudinal nature of the data in TEDS. The statistical power granted by the relatively large sample size of this study allows us to conclude with confidence that most aspects of language are moderately influenced by additive genetic effects. However, an even larger sample size would be nec- essary to yield small enough confidence intervals to compare rigorously the estimates for the nine measures. Nevertheless, it is intriguing that the only notable exceptions to the rule of moderate herita- bility were the zero heritability estimates for the phonological awareness and BAS Comprehension measures at the low extreme of ability. We can only speculate about the reasons for this result: The two measures assess different aspects of language and rely on memory and on metalinguistic awareness to a different extent. However, relative to the other seven measures, they pose more selective attention 1 00% 9o% 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% . - oF o o . - o Q 0 O t Q ¢ &gt; D C Q O C E E Co &lt; &gt; O ° ° t: m &lt;X o U S m g Q tlS &lt;: &gt; a) Language Measures Figure2.

If it is the receptive nature of these measures that is associated with negligible genetic influence at the low end, our finding should replicate with other receptive mea- sures in other samples. This would be consistent with the results of a study reported by the SLI Consortium (2002) in which a systematic genome- wide QTL linkage analysis found linkages to specific (and different) loci for two expressive language measures, but no linkage for a receptive measure. A small genetic effect implies a large environmental effect, and an important avenue of exploration would be to identify the environmental mechanisms that may influence specific language abilities. In the case of phonological awareness, for example, a lack of exposure to reading experiences could be a critical factor pushing children into the low end of phono- logical ability (Castles &amp; Coltheart, 2004). Indeed, some candidate environmental factors have been identified in a recent family study (Rutter, Thorpe, Greenwood, Northstone, &amp; Golding, 2003; Thorpe, Rutter, &amp; Greenwood, 2003). Encouraging the child to speak, providing elaborating comments, and reading to the child and talking about the story and illustrations were all found to be significantly related to the child's linguistic ability. Further research is needed to determine whether these factors are of particular importance for receptive language abilities and whether genes and environments interact in such a way that genetic effects can be completely overwhelmed if the quality of the relevant environ- mental factors is very poor. The third aim of this study was to explore sex differences in genetic and environmental influences on language ability and disability. Phenotypically, the present study found evidence of mean differ- ences in language level between the two sexes, but these accounted for only a small proportion of vari- ance in all investigated aspects of language. The genetic analyses complemented this finding across our nine language measures by showing neither qualitative nor quantitative sex differences in the etiology of individual differences. This was true both for the whole sample and the extreme end of the distribution, and it suggests that the same genes and environments affect individual differences in various linguistic abilities in males and females to the same extent. These findings replicate the absence of sex differences in the composite measure (Viding et al., 2004) at the level of each of the individual measures making up the composite measure. The small mean differences observed for males and females, which also lead to overrepresentation of males at the low end of the distribution (as shown in our extremes analyses), may stem from a small mean difference in sex-specific genetic makeup, or from differences in exposure to a particular environmental influence. For example, if talking to the child was found to influence lexical competence in children, we would expect girls to be more lexically competent on aver- age if parents on average talked more to girls than to boys. Alternatively, a biological factor, such as hor- mones, could lead to mean sex differences; for in- stance, it has been hypothesized that gonadal hormones may be implicated in developmental lan- guage disabilities (Tallal, 1991). It is also possible that the observed sex differences are residuals of those found in very early development and are driven by factors affecting the timing of development. This hypothesis can be investigated by looking at the stability of children's performance longitudinally. Some indication of sex differences in transient versus persistent language delay has been found in 2-year- old twins who were assigned to groups on the basis of outcome at 3 and 4 years (Dale et al., 2003). A1- though boys were nearly twice as likely as girls to be in the language-delayed group at 2 years, sex was not found to be a significant predictor of a persistent delay. In other words, although boys are more likely to show early language delay, similar proportions of boys and girls continue to be language delayed at 3 and 4 years. Finally, it is possible that there are sex differences in the etiology of individual differ- ences in language ability but that these are so small that they can only be detected with samples of thousands of twins (Galsworthy, Dionne, Dale, &amp; Plomin, 2000). A general caveat in interpreting our results overall is the possibility that there are twin-specific effects that may limit the generalizability of our findings to singletons. Previous research with toddlers and preschool children has consistently found mean differences between twins and singletons in their linguistic abilities in that twins show a language immaturity of about 3 to 6 months (e.g., Mittler, 1969; Rutter et al., 2003; Thorpe et al., 2003). A small delay in the early language development of twins as compared with singletons was indeed found in TEDS (e.g., Dale et al., 1998). However, no delay was found in the 4-year-old twins in the present study (specifically, in the subgroup of 620 controls) as compared with standardization data of the McCar- thy measure (Colledge et al., 2002). The twins' scores on the Verbal Scale and General Cognitive Scale of the MSCA were comparable to the norms given in</page><page sequence="18">Individual Language Measures 649 the McCarthy manual (Colledge et al., 2002), al- though caution is warranted because the McCarthy norms were obtained more than 30 years ago. Fur- thermore, twins do not seem to show any distinctive pattern of linguistic organization, and the twin-spe- cific delay is similar across different aspects of lan- guage with no differences in this respect between identical and fraternal twins (Mittler, 1969). Determining the extent to which different lin- guistic abilities are influenced by genetic and envi- ronmental factors gives us a starting point for understanding their nature and origin. A logical next step is to determine how diverse aspects of language are related. This question cannot be addressed by univariate genetic analyses; for example, heritabili- ties can be the same for two traits, but completely different sets of genes can affect the two traits. Multivariate genetic analyses are needed to advance our understanding of the extent to which different aspects of language are affected by the same genetic and environmental factors. Further work exploring commonalities and differences in the etiologies of the diverse language abilities discussed in the pre- sent study are reported elsewhere (Hayiou-Thomas et al., 2004). Another direction for future research is multivariate genetic analysis of the links between these different aspects of language and other cognitive domains such as nonverbal ability and disability as well as learning disabilities such as reading and mathematics. For example, the finding of a genetic correlation of .63 between language and nonverbal abilities in 4-year-old twins using the present data set (Colledge et al., 2002) suggests both substantial genetic overlap and language-specific genetic effects. This finding is supported by other TEDS research using parental assessment instru- ments (Dale et al., 2000). In fact, several studies ad- dressing the issue of genetic overlap within and across cognitive domains (reviewed in Plomin &amp; Kovas, in press) consistently find evidence for sub- stantial overlap. Establishing the role of genetic influences in di- verse aspects of language is only a first step that provides a foundation and motivation for molecular genetic studies to find the multiple specific genes involved. Similarly, establishing the relative impor- tance of shared and nonshared environmental in- fluences is just a first step toward future research to identify specific environmental sources of these components of variance. As specific genes and en- vironments are identified, we can begin to under- stand the complex mechanisms through which genotypes interact with the environment to develop into phenotypes.
