Peterson Smith College Emily D. Gerstein Smith College In this archival study, themes of authoritarianism (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, &amp; Sanford, 1950) were content coded in American comic books. Comic books produced during years of relatively high social and economic threat (1978-82 and 1991-92) con- tained more aggressive imagery, more conventional themes, less intraception, and fewer spoken lines by women characters relative to comic books produced during years of rela- tively low threat (1983-90). Unexpectedly, speaking roles for characters of color did not differ due to the influence of threat. Discussion focused on the theoretical relationship between threat and manifestations of authoritarianism at the societal and individual levels. KEY WORDS: authoritarianism, comic books, content analysis, threat In recent years, classic elements of the authoritarian personality (Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, &amp; Sanford, 1950) have been reconceptualized and studied at the individual and societal level. For example, Altemeyer (1988, 1996) demonstrated that scores on authoritarianism were positively correlated with a rel- atively narrow range of life experiences and the belief that the world is an uncon- trolled and dangerous place. Altemeyer suggested that the parents in his sample may have played a part in establishing these correlates by keeping children "tied to a short leash (allowing them to travel) in a relatively small, tight circle" (1996, p. 80). In this way parents may model a fear of the unknown to their offspring (1988, pp. 145-147). These findings could be seen as supporting aspects of 887 0162-895X ? 2005 International Society of Political Psychology Published by Blackwell Publishing.

More recently, Winter (1996, p. 231) schematicized the link between threat and authoritarianism. In his model, social and economic crises make people feel threatened and vulnerable. This threat, in turn, leads to an authoritarian intolerance for ambiguity and its sequelae: interest in aggression, projection of negative impulses onto out-group members, rigid conformity and submission, and anti-intraception. Investigating the specific links between threat and elements of authoritarian- ism remains a compelling task for contemporary researchers. There are currently two major ways to think about the threat-authoritarianism link. Arguments made by Altemeyer (1996) and Winter (1996) suggest that authoritarianism can be con- ceptualized as a dispositional variable that tends to remain at a personal baseline level. However, personal or social threat can increase the baseline for each indi- vidual. This approach to the threat-authoritarianism link might best be investi- gated by personality psychologists who have the conceptual tools to discuss dispositional change. The other major approach to the threat-authoritarianism link is best represented by social psychologists interested in examining how threat might strengthen the relationship between personal authoritarianism and author- itarian attitudes and behaviors. For example, Feldman and Stenner (1997) showed that people who scored high on authoritarianism became more punitive under per- ceived stress whereas individuals who scored low on authoritarianism became less punitive. Similarly, Lavine et al. (1999) found that authoritarian individuals were more likely to vote in the 1996 Presidential election if they received a "threat- related" message rather than a "reward-related" message that tried to convince them of the virtues of voting. In both of these examples the researchers demon- strated the way that threat can tighten the relationship between authoritarian pre- dispositions and behavioral outcomes. Both the personality and social psychological approaches to understanding threat and authoritarianism are not incompatible. It may be that some individuals increase in authoritarianism during times of threat while others do not, but that the rise in the former group increases their chances of expressing authoritarian attitudes or behaviors. Personality and social psychologists working together may offer the clearest insights into how threat affects authoritarianism. In the mean- time, in addition to individual level experiences of threat, broad economic threats have also been linked to societal indicators of authoritarianism. For example, Sales (1972, 1973) found that relatively authoritarian behaviors (such as support for the death penalty) increased in the United States during economic recession (high threat) as compared to periods of economic expansion (low threat). More recently, McCann (1997, 1999) showed that U.S. citizens elected presidents who radiated strength and energy by wide margins during years of high threat, and were more likely to attend churches that rigidly adhered to doctrine as opposed to attending less regimented (but still established) churches. In 1991, Doty,</page><page sequence="3">Threat, Authoritarianism, and Comic Books 889 Peterson, and Winter expanded upon the work of Sales (1972) to examine the threat-authoritarianism link during 1978-1987. They developed archival meas- ures of authoritarian behaviors such as Klu Klux Klan activity. They found that these types of authoritarian behaviors were greater during years of relatively high economic and social threat (1978-1982) compared to years of relatively low threat (1983-1987). In the work of Sales (1972) and Doty et al. (1991), one common finding was the increase in popularity of "powerful" fictional protagonists during times of threat. According to Adorno et al. (1950), someone scoring high on authoritari- anism is concerned with issues of hierarchy and is attracted to people who wield great power. Based on this argument, Sales found that comic strips originating during the high threat 1930s were more likely to feature tough heroes (e.g., Dick Tracy, The Lone Ranger) whereas comic strips in the low threat 1920s featured characters who were not as tough (e.g., Betty Boop). In their conceptual replica- tion, Doty et al. (1991) found similar results (although weaker in magnitude) for "tough and powerful" television protagonists. The current study expands upon both of these papers by examining in-depth the authoritarian content of American comic books-a dynamic industry with at least 70 years of history (Wright, 2001). Comic Books as Popular Culture For the past 40 or so years the superhero genre has dominated the American comic book (Wright, 2001). But this was not always the case-in its history the industry has had success with comic book titles devoted to anthropomorphic animals, crime, horror, humor, romance, war, westerns, and adaptations of liter- ary classics. In the comic book market of today, however, the fantastic exploits and kinetic energy of the superhero reign supreme. As an aspect of popular culture, comic books have always reflected the his- torical time period in which they were produced. For example, Wright (2001) dis- cussed how comics published in the early 1940s featuring Green Lantern reflected key elements of Roosevelt's New Deal in stories about corporate corruption. During World War II, most superheroes (in their fictional exploits) joined the Allied forces; Captain America became one of Marvel Comics' most popular char- acters by fighting Nazis. Many comics in the 1950s contained anti-communist sentiments or gritty depictions of the Korean War. In fact, the House Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC) directly influenced the content of comic books in the early 1950s by sponsoring hearings that attempted to link juvenile delinquency to the influence of comic books. Comic book publishers, bowing to federal and state pressures, imposed standards of self-censorship. As the 1950s came to a close, superhero comics became ideal venues for promotion of good behavior for children and adolescents with their anti-crime storylines and virtu- ous role models.</page><page sequence="4">890 Peterson and Gerstein Hypotheses As it turns out, the superhero genre might be particularly well suited for assessing the threat-authoritarian link because of its clear focus on themes of good and evil. Authoritarian psychology is drawn to such unambiguous distinctions; under threat, comics might reflect a similar desire for such clarity. We hypothe- size that comic books published during times of high societal or economic threat should contain more authoritarian imagery than comic books produced during times of low threat. We focus on elements of authoritarianism identified by Altemeyer (1988) as crucial parts of the syndrome: authoritarian aggression, con- ventionalism, and authoritarian submission. In addition, we examine themes of anti-intraception, or a disinterest in the subjective and tender-minded aspects of human existence. In terms of authoritarian aggression, we argue that a villain symbolizes an out-group member whose criminal activity justifies retaliation on the part of the hero. Therefore, we hypothesized that superhero comics should incorporate more stories featuring overt conflict between heroes and villains during high-threat years as compared with low-threat years. Furthermore, compared with low-threat years, during high-threat years covers of comic books should depict aggressive actions by villains, which legitimizes the comeuppance of the villain in the inte- rior pages of the comic. In terms of conventionalism, we hypothesized that comics published during high-threat periods should feature storylines that disapprove of nonconventional behavior. First, comics published during high-threat years should feature story- lines that moralize about the dangers of illicit drug use and sexual promiscuity. Second, in order to examine conventionalism, we looked at depictions of women and people of color. Women and people of color should play a more prominent and active (as opposed to passive) role in comic books published during times of lower threat; this would reflect a willingness on the part of writers (and the buying public) to incorporate historically nontraditional characters into the superhero genre. Thus, in comics published during high-threat years, women should have fewer speaking roles and be presented in stereotypically conventional ways when compared with depictions of women during low-threat years. Third, people of color should be less visible in comics published during high-threat years relative to low-threat years. In terms of authoritarian submission, we hypothesized that during threaten- ing time periods, as compared to less threatening years, a higher percentage of comics would show greater respect for national authority by avoiding storylines where the integrity of government representatives was questioned. In terms of anti-intraception, comic books written during times of high threat should contain fewer examples of psychological mindedness (the opposite of anti- intraception) on the part of protagonists when compared to comics written during times of low threat. Finally, sales of comic books featuring conventional charac-</page><page sequence="5">Threat, Authoritarianism, and Comic Books 891 ters should increase during years of high threat relative to sales during times of low threat. Method Establishing Periods of High and Low Threat Doty et al. (1991) argued that 1978-82 was a period of relatively high social and economic threat in the United States, whereas 1983-87 was a period of rel- atively low threat. They arrived at this conclusion by examining statistical indic- tor data as well as major news items from both time periods. Using the sources of data that they utilized (i.e., Sourcebook for Criminal Justice Statistics [SCJS] and Statistical Abstract of the United States [SAUS]) it was possible to continue their time line into the 1990s. In addition to the poor economic state of the country during 1978-82 (as shown in Table 1), there were big news items indicative of international political threat between 1978 and 1982. High profile "threatening" events in 1979 included the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, an anti-American revolution in Nicaragua, and the Iran hostage crisis. The economic recovery that began in 1983 seemed to be a turning point toward less threatening times for many in the United States and these years of lower threat probably continued to 1990. Indeed, the major inter- national events of early 1990 were positive ones for U.S. citizens: Germany was Table 1.

However, things turned sour later in the year. In August of 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait, which set the stage for the 1991 U.S.-led war in the Persian Gulf. Throughout the early part of 1991 many citizens feared that the United States was getting involved in another Vietnam. In addition, an economic downturn (e.g., higher inflation and unemployment) was evident throughout the year. During 1991-92 there was significant racial tension in Los Angeles and else- where due to court decisions concerning Rodney King and the police officers accused of beating him. In August of 1992 the worst natural disaster to hit the United States at the time-Hurricane Andrew-devastated the eastern seaboard. Based upon this kind of evidence, it is not unreasonable to label 1991-92 as a period of relatively high threat. The high-threat years probably ended around the time Bill Clinton took office and the economy expanded. After the terrorist attacks of 2001 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the United States is now most likely in a period of high threat. Due to limitations in the comic book data (as explained later), however, it was only possible to examine comics up to 1992. Thus, the second high threat period encompassed a relatively short two years (1991-92). Table 1 supplements anecdotal information with statistical indicator data for the three time periods: high threat (1978-82), low threat (1983-90), and high threat (1991-92). According to oneway ANOVAs, all of the six indicators showed significant differences across the three time periods. The second high-threat period (1991-92) was notable for an increase in criminal activity. For example, the number of bombs detonated in the United States increased significantly during the second high-threat period relative to the other two time periods. Similar (although not as dramatic) findings occurred for the number of violent crimes per- petrated (e.g., murder, rape). Finally, major work stoppages involving more than 1,000 workers were significantly greater during the first threat period (1978-82) relative to the other two time periods. In terms of economic threat, Table 1 shows that changes in the unemploy- ment rate differed across the three time periods. Unemployment rose during 1978-82 and 1991-92, and dropped during the lower threat period of 1983-90. The consumer price index and the prime interest rate were significantly higher in 1978-82 relative to the other two time periods, indicating that inflation was high and it was more expensive to borrow money during the first threat period (1978-82) relative to the other two time periods. The anecdotal evidence and the statistical indicator data suggest that 1978-82 was a period of economic and political threat for U.S. citizens. By contrast, 1983-90 was a relatively unthreatening period. The data for 1991-92 indicated a period of higher social threat, although the economic data were mixed. However, a leading economic indicator (unemployment) increased dramatically in 1991 and then again in 1992. Thus, 1978-82 seems well categorized as a period of high threat, just as 1983-90 seems well categorized as a period of low threat. The years</page><page sequence="7">Threat, Authoritarianism, and Comic Books 893 of 1991-92 can be categorized as a brief period of relatively high threat, although not as threatening as the late 1970s and early 1980s. Comic Books in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s From the period of 1978-92 there were two major publishers of comic books in the United States: DC comics (with characters such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman) and Marvel Comics (with characters such as Captain America, Spider-Man, and the X-Men). Sampling superhero comic books from both DC and Marvel was possible. However, in 1986, editors at DC comics made a major change in their line of superhero books. In effect, most of the plotlines and con- tinuity of the previous 48 years (1938-86) were nullified, and DC's major heroes were "reborn" for the 1980s (Daniels, 1995). This sudden change in creative focus during the middle of the low-threat period (1983-90) made it less desirable to use DC comics in the current study. However, Marvel had its own problems. Beginning in the early 1990s Marvel undertook a series of disastrous business moves that included the attempt to finance the distribution of their own merchandise. In order to finance these new ventures Marvel flooded the market with poorly written and drawn comics, includ- ing the use of gimmicky covers such as holograms to temporarily boost sales (see, Duin &amp; Richardson, 1998, pp. 299-303, for accounts by creators of this time period). By 1996 readership dropped and Marvel had lost over 400 million dollars and declared bankruptcy from which the company, under new creative manage- ment, has apparently recovered. An inspection of Marvel comics beginning around 1993 shows that the style and content of even their core titles deviated from the traditions of Marvel's past. Because the production of Marvel comics during the mid-1990s became increasingly driven by looming financial disaster, we decided to examine comics published up until 1992. Once the decision had been made to study Marvel comics it was necessary to establish the exact titles to sample. We decided to content-code eight comic book titles with a virtually continuous publication record since the early 1960s (as documented by Miller, Thompson, Bickford, &amp; Frankenhoff, 2002). The spe- cific issues examined are listed in the appendix. All of these titles are still pub- lished today and attest to their popularity and influence on the super-hero genre. Content coding all 1,400 or so issues of these eight comic book titles published from 1978 to 1992 would be a daunting task. (Comic books usually come out on a monthly basis; thus, approximately 180 issues of a single title like Captain America appeared between 1978 and 1992.) In order to reduce the enormity of the task we coded only the December issue of each title from 1978-92. For 1991 and 1992 we content-coded an additional comic book for each title. We decided to oversample these two years because this period of threat was so brief. Thus, 136 comic books (120 December issues and 16 additional comics from 1991 and 1992) were scored containing over 3,000</page><page sequence="8">894 Peterson and Gerstein pages of storyline. According to Daniels (1991, p. 231), during the years under scrutiny there was approximately a six-month lag between the writing of a comic book and its appearance on the market. This lag means that the December issue of most comics from this time period was initially developed sometime during the midpoint of the same year. The comics we oversampled from 1991 and 1992 came from the summer of each year (always the August issue when possible). Content Coding of Authoritarianism The sequential nature of comic book storytelling relies on illustration and text to move plots and characterization forward much like comic strips in Sunday newspapers. Each comic book page consists of one or more panels of artwork and/or dialogue. Some artists draw more panels per page than other artists. In order to control for these stylistic differences, we divided the number of images that appeared for a coding theme by the total number of panels used in a comic book. On average the Marvel comic books sampled from 1978 to 1992 contained 118.19 panels each (sd = 27.38). Of these panels, 106.41 (sd = 26.76) featured dialogue, monologue, or exposition in addition to illustration. Counting panels that included the written word was highly reliable across two raters (nearing 100% across comics). For most of the coding categories described below each panel was consid- ered the unit for scoring. Thus, unless described otherwise, a category was scored as either present or absent in each panel of a comic book. The second author content-coded all comic books (in a randomly determined order) for the themes below. (The coding manual is available from the first author.) At the time of coding she was unaware of the exact hypotheses of the study. In order to establish relia- bility data, the first author also coded 48 comics (selected so as to represent each title six times). In all cases, scores for the second author were used during dis- agreements. Percent category agreement (PCA) for each coding category theme was computed using the following formula (Winter, 1973, pp. 248-249): ([2 x number of agreements between author I and author 2 on the presence of a theme in a panel]/[number of times author 1 scored a theme in a panel + number of times author 2 scored a theme in a panel]). Authoritarian Aggression Themes of aggression were scored using two categories. First, the number of panels in a comic book wherein a character was perpetrating violence on another character was counted. Usually this violence involved superheroes and villains fighting each other, but also involved threatening gestures on the part of a hero or villain. PCA was 96%. The second category for aggression was scored using comic book covers. Most covers of superhero comics during this time period depicted physical con-</page><page sequence="9">Threat, Authoritarianism, and Comic Books 895 flict between two or more characters. Often the hero of the title was under extreme duress (e.g., being bludgeoned by an enemy, being held by a mechanical trap). Such instances of aggression by an out-group member (i.e., the villain) were scored as present when the hero was (a) depicted as the recipient of a physical, psychic, or energy attack, (b) trapped, surrounded, held, or otherwise hemmed in by an enemy, or (c) unconscious or otherwise defeated by the villain. In other words, the cover had to clearly depict that the hero was at a tactical disadvantage due to the machinations of a villain. Because this code was simply present or absent for each comic book, it was not necessary to correct for total number of panels. PCA was 88%. Conventionalism Conventional Moralism. Five measures of conventionalism were developed. The first involved the use of alcohol, illicit drugs, or promiscuous sex. If a comic book depicted any of these three things in a clearly negative way conventional moralism was scored as present. In other words, in order to score for this cate- gory of conventionalism, the use of drugs, alcohol, or sex had to be associated with negative repercussions or a moral judgment. We did not score conventional morality by the panel. It occurred infrequently and so we scored it as merely present or absent in the entire comic book. PCA was 66%. Women in speaking roles. The remaining measures of conventionalism con- cerned the depiction of women and people of color. The number of panels in which a female character spoke out loud was scored. Also included in this category of women's voices were instances where women were thinking to themselves, as depicted in thought balloons. We made no distinction between a woman speak- ing in a much larger crowd scene versus a woman who was the sole occupant of a panel. PCA was 98%. In the case of women speaking we corrected scores for the total number of panels in which any character spoke. Thus, scores for women in speaking roles can be conceptualized as the percentage of speaking panels where any women spoke as opposed to panels which featured only men or the omniscient narrator speaking. Portrayals of women as subordinates. Scoring the sheer amount of dialogue or monologue by women in a comic may not necessarily indicate positive por- trayals of women. For example, women may have been depicted as in need of rescue and guidance. In order to examine the depiction of women in these stereo- typically traditional ways we coded the subordination of women. Women's subordination was scored whenever a female character (a) needed comfort from a male character that was not mutual, (b) implicitly trusted the words and decisions of a male character, (c) occupied a clearly subordinate role to a male character (e.g., female secretary to a businessman; female character working to put her husband through law school), or (d) needed to be rescued by a male char- acter. PCA was 80%.</page><page sequence="10">896 Peterson and Gerstein The presence of people of color in speaking roles. We scored the number of panels where a character of color spoke (African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans). Category agreement was 98%. Once again, we corrected these scores by dividing them by the total number of panels in which any character spoke. Authoritarian Submission (Reverse Scored) We had one measure of authoritarian submission that was reverse scored. We content coded any examples of wrong doing by U.S. government representatives. For example, in Captain America #228 a fictional U.S. senator plotted Captain America's demise. This willingness to use a leader of one's country as a per- petrator of evil deeds signaled the opposite of authoritarian submission. In such examples, writers expressed willingness to challenge and critique aspects of U.S. government leaders, practices, ideologies, or goals. Because this category occurred infrequently, we scored it as present or absent in the entire comic book rather than by the panel. PCA was 75%. Anti-Intraception (Reverse Scored) Physical conflict dominates the genre of superhero comics. Nonetheless, there were times of quiet introspection by characters (often indicated in the form of thought balloons rather than dialogue), or moments where one character discussed their emotional or psychological state with another character. Either of these moments would score for intraception; however, intraception was not scored if a protagonist was ruminating on practical problems (e.g., "How can I afford next month's rent?"). PCA for intraception was 83%. Sales of Conventional Comics We had one last assessment of the threat-authoritarianism link that moved away from the content of the comic books to consider sales figures for each title. During the high-threat years we hypothesized that the comic books featuring con- ventional heroes would sell better than books featuring unconventional heroes. Of the eight titles, four featured heroes that might be considered conventional. In a nutshell, these characters represent American virtues such as U.S. patriotism (Captain America), the nuclear family (Fantastic Four), capitalism (Iron Man), and the everyman (Spider-Man). The other four heroes are more unconventional. Among other things, they represent darker, anti-conformist themes such as great rage (Hulk), persecution by society (X-Men), non-Christian deities (Thor), and a vigilante figure (Daredevil) who lives "in (an) amoral urban hell" (Wright, 2001, p. 267). Average yearly sales figures for each comic book title were obtained from Miller et al. (2002). We used their number for "total paid/requested circulation".</page><page sequence="11">Threat, Authoritarianism, and Comic Books 897 Sales data were not always available for each title on any given year so sample size was reduced. Three other points about this data should be made. One, we uncovered a noticeable increase in sales for Hulk in the late 1970s. Further research uncovered the fact that in 1978 the Hulk was featured in a CBS television show lasting for three years, starring Bill Bixby and Lou Ferigno. Because sales of Hulk comic books were heavily influenced by the character's weekly appearances on television, we thought it best to remove Hulk circulation figures from the analyses. Two, we wanted to give each title equal weight in the analyses. This is important because some titles (like Amazing Spider-Man) dra- matically outsold other titles (like Captain America). Because we were interested in the relative health of each title against itself over the high- and low-threat periods, we standardized sales within each comic book title before adding sales for titles together. We standardized sales for each title at M = 50 and SD = 10. Three, we decided not to use sales data for 1992. As a whole, sales figures were dramatically up during this year due to the market manipulation by Marvel dis- cussed earlier. Many of the sales figures in 1992 were clear outliers in the data set. Results Overview of Analyses Chi-Squares were used to examine variables that were assessed as present or absent in the entire comic. Oneway ANOVAs were used to analyze variables assessed as percentages of panels. Finally, a two-way ANOVA (type of hero by time period) was used to assess comic book sales. Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for all of the categories content coded in the comic books. Inferential Statistics Aggression. Table 3 presents results for the aggression items. According to a oneway ANOVA, comic books published during the high-threat years contained a significantly greater percentage of panels devoted to aggression. A t-test showed that a greater percentage of panels depicted aggression during the first high-threat period (.45) relative to the low-threat period (.31). Similarly, the second high- threat period also evidenced more aggressive content (.44) than the low-threat period. As shown in the second half of Table 3, the chi-square analysis of comic book covers was consistent with the t-test results on aggression. Chi-square analyses revealed that more comic book covers featured nonreciprocal aggression on the part of a villain during the high-threat years relative to the low-threat years. Conventionalism. Table 3 shows the results for conventionalism. As indicated by the second Chi-Square, during the high-threat years comic books were mar- ginally more moralistic, depicting storylines where drugs, sex, and alcohol were</page><page sequence="12">898 Peterson and Gerstein Table 2.

A 2 x 2 Chi-Square which combined scores for the two high-threat periods (23%) and compared them to the low-threat period (11%) was significant, Chi- Square = 4.67, p &lt; .05. Table 3 also presents analyses for women and characters of color. As expected, women characters spoke more frequently during the low-threat years relative to the high-threat years. T-tests showed that this difference was mainly driven by the difference between the first high-threat period (18%) relative to the low-threat period (29%). The second high-threat period (24%) split the difference between the two prior time periods and was not significantly different from either. Women were significantly less likely to be depicted in a subordinate way to men during the low-threat years. Instances of subordination occurred significantly less frequently during the low-threat period (3% of panels) when compared to the first (11%) high-threat period and the second (8%) high-threat period. Results for characters of color were marginally significant (p &lt; .10), but not in the expected direction. They spoke in a larger percentage of panels during the second high-threat period (17%) relative to the first high-threat period (8%) and low-threat period (9%). Submission. As shown in the final Chi-Square of Table 3, there was a mar- ginally significant difference in depictions of wrong doing on the part of the U.S. government. As predicted, the highest percentage of such storylines occurred during the low-threat period. A 2 x 2 chi-square which combined scores for the two high-threat periods (7% of comics featured distrust during the combined high- threat years vs. 19% in the low-threat years) was significant, Chi-Square = 4.31, p &lt; .05. Anti-intraception. Table 3 also presents a oneway ANOVA showing a signifi- cant difference in the amount of intraception that appeared during the three time periods. Specifically, t-tests showed fewer instances of intraception during each of the two high-threat periods relative to what appeared in the low-threat period. Comic book sales. Because we did not use 1992 data, we collapsed the 1991 sales data with the 1978-82 sales data. Thus, we conducted a 2 (conventional hero vs. unconventional hero) x 2 (high threat vs. low threat) ANOVA. As expected, there was a significant interaction effect (F[1, 87] = 4.02, p &lt; .05). This interac- tion seemed mainly driven by the unconventional heroes. Sales for the uncon- ventional heroes increased dramatically during the low-threat years (standardized M = 54.24) relative to the high-threat years (M = 43.21) (t[37] = 4.10, p &lt; .001). Sales for the conventional heroes remained flat throughout the two time periods (Ms = 51.18 vs. 48.14 for the low and high-threat years, respectively, t[47] = 1.07, ns). Discussion Comic books written during the high-threat periods focused on aggressive themes and downplayed intraception relative to comics published during the low-</page><page sequence="14">900 Peterson and Gerstein threat years. During the high-threat years women had fewer speaking roles, and when they did appear they acted in more subordinate ways. Comics in the high- threat years featured more moralizing about the negative effects of drugs, sex, and alcohol, and contained fewer storylines featuring government wrong-doing. In addition, when compared against themselves, the unconventional titles sold more copies during the low-threat years relative to the high-threat years, whereas sales for the conventional heroes remained flat. The only variable that did not support hypotheses concerned people of color who had the most speaking lines during 1991-92. Overall, however, the larger pattern of results favored the hypothesis that economic and social threat was related to increased authoritarian themes. Implications for Research on Authoritarianism The lack of hypothesized findings for characters of color was unexpected. It is arguable that characters of color appeared more frequently in 1991 and 1992 due to secular trends. Because the United States is a multicultural society, it may have been increasingly difficult for comic books not to feature characters of color by the 1990s. A more nuanced, qualitative analysis, however, might uncover dif- ferences in how people of color were portrayed during the three time periods. For example, during the low-threat period, an African-American character took over as Iron Man. Tony Stark (the Caucasian inventor of the Iron Man armor) was unable to function as Iron Man and his personal assistant during the first high- threat period, James Rhodey, took on the mantle of the title character. Future qual- itative work of this sort could also explore how Asian Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans were depicted when they made their rare appearances. For an example of this kind of analysis, see Ma (2000, chapter 1) who provided a textual analysis of Asian and Asian-American characters during the Golden Age of comics (1930s-40s). Despite the lack of hypothesized results for characters of color, the bulk of this study dovetails nicely with survey and experimental work exploring the threat-authoritarianism link at the individual level. In current research it is becoming clear that the relationship between threat and the rise of authoritarian sentiment and behavior is complex (e.g., Feldman &amp; Stenner, 1997). Personality psychologists might have the best conceptual models to answer the question of whether threat increases absolute levels of authoritarianism within individuals. On the other hand, social psychologists might be best equipped to examine how threat might serve to strengthen the magnitude of the relationship between authoritar- ian predisposition and behavior. Obviously, the comic book study does not tease out either possibility. It might be that comic book authors, when faced with social and economic threat, expressed authoritarian themes in their fiction due to an overall increase in personal authoritarianism. Alternatively, it might be that comic book readers prefer stories featuring aggression and less intraception during times of social and economic threat. Thus, in some cases, creators might have served</page><page sequence="15">Threat, Authoritarianism, and Comic Books 901 as a conduit for editorial decisions made by executives at Marvel to please fans. (Note that neither of these explanations suggests that all comic book writers and artists became authoritarian during the high-threat periods. In fact, the baseline levels of authoritarianism among creative writers and artists are probably quite low.) At this point this study provides documentation that the content of com- mercially created products is somehow linked to social and economic threat. This opens the door for future studies to examine how authoritarianism and threat might be related in specific ways to marketing decisions, consumer interests, and the creative process. One item that needs discussion at this point is the relative scarcity of women comic book readers and professionals. Current figures are hard to come by, but the writers, artists, and readers of contemporary comic books are overwhelmingly male. This fact may have implications for the current study if the link between threat and authoritarianism is different for men and women. On the one hand, research has found few gender differences in authoritarianism scale scores (e.g., Altemeyer, 1996, p. 41). In addition, men and women mostly share similar pat- terns of correlates with authoritarianism scale scores even on topics where dif- ferent patterns might be expected to exist (e.g., Duncan, Peterson, &amp; Winter, 1997). On the other hand, not every study on authoritarianism reported analyses by gender. Furthermore, Milburn, Conrad, Sala, and Carberry (1995) found that men and women who had "high punishment backgrounds" as children responded differently to a politically based questionnaire. The interactions were complex, and also involved the use of therapy by participants, but, in general, men from high punishment backgrounds endorsed more authoritarian attitudes than low pun- ishment males, whereas the pattern was reversed for women. Milburn et al. (1995) suggested that high-punishment backgrounds in childhood (i.e., living under con- ditions of threat) leads men (as adults) to displace anger outwards whereas women do not. The comic book study, of course, does not deal with individual experi- ences of threat within a family environment. However, to the extent that threat of any kind leads to the expression of authoritarianism, especially among men, then the current findings on comic books may be stronger than the threat- authoritarianism link in other forms of entertainment where men and women par- ticipate equally. For example, to what extent do novels, children's books, and the lyrics of popular songs also increase in authoritarian themes during times of high threat? Establishing such connections would bolster the argument that the threat-authoritarianism link is a robust one. Closing Comment Along with the mass of survey and experimental work conducted on author- itarianism, there now exists a small body of research using archival methods (e.g., Doty et al., 1991; McCann, 1997, 1999; Padgett &amp; Jorgenson, 1982; Sales, 1972, 1973). These data offer a fresh perspective on how authoritarianism manifests at</page><page sequence="16">902 Peterson and Gerstein a societal level, supplementing more traditional research on authoritarian indi- viduals (e.g., Billings, Guastello, &amp; Rieke, 1993; Meloen, Van der Linden, &amp; De Witte, 1996; Peterson, Duncan, &amp; Pang, 2002; Peterson &amp; Dietz, 2000; Smith &amp; Winter, 2002). As argued by Sales (1972), empirical diversity is important for developing a full understanding of complex psychological constructs. When studies that use very different types of methodologies find links between author- itarianism and important phenomena "one can place considerably more confi- dence in each of these investigations-in spite of their separate methodological shortcomings" (Sales, 1972, p. 56). The current study adds further evidence in support of the notion that authoritarian psychology becomes more evident during times of threat.

These comics are available at specialty stores dealing in comic book back issues. The issue numbers represent the December edition of each year beginning with 1978 and ending with 1992. Thus, Amazing Spider-Man #187 was the December, 1978, issue. Number 199 was the December, 1979, issue. In some cases, the December issue could not be located, so we used an issue that was released near the month of December. Usually it was the November issue. The non-December issues are marked in bold. For some Daredevil comics (numbers 155, 161, 167), there were no December cover dates because at the time the title was published bimonthly. Hence, the three November issues were used. Summer issues for the oversampling of the 1991 and 1992 years are placed in parentheses.</page></plain_text>
