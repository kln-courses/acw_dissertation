<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGION AND POLITICS IN THE CAREER OF BADIC AL-ZAMAN AL-HAMADHANI EVERETT K. ROWSON HARVARD UNIVERSITY Claims that the litterateur Badic al-ZamAn al-HamadhAni was a Shicite are based on misinter- pretations of the available evidence. Information from al-HamadhAni's own works makes it clear that he was throughout his life an anti-Shicite Shaficl, and probably an Ashcarite as well. His religious affiliation served him well in his career, as the Shafic! elite of Jurjan, Nishapur, and probably other cities offered him their support. Nowhere was this support more crucial for him than in the celebrated literary contest in which he bested the famed poet and prose stylist Abel Bakr al-Khwarazmi, an ardent Shirite. Al-HamadhAni's account of the events of this debate, and its audience, provides useful evidence for the effect of political and religious affiliation on the literary history of this period. AS THE ORIGINATOR OF THE MAQAMA GENRE, Badi' al-Zaman has enjoyed a great deal of esteem from modern students of Arabic literature. Yet despite the now substantial bibliography on his Maqdmadt,1 sur- prisingly little attention has been paid to the man himself. The extant biographies by al-Tha'alibi and Yaqcit have been repeatedly summarized, but with little sensitivity to their political and religious context; and al-Hamadhani's own Diwan and Rasa'il, although published, have never been critically edited or seri- ously sifted for information about their author.2 This neglect has resulted in the perpetuation of certain errors in the literature, most notably the claim that al-Hamadhani was an adherent of the Shl'a, at least in his early years, or even that he was influenced by the Ismac'li Shl'ite sect; scraps of evidence purportedly supporting this claim have been pulled out of context and misinterpreted, and the more general question of the effect of religious affiliation on the literary world at this time has been obscured.3 The following study is an attempt to sketch the life of al-HamadhanI within its political and religious environment, and show how his lifelong Sunnism, and in particular his adherence to the Shafi'i school of law, provided him with a network of sympathizers and patrons who did much to further his career. Of special significance in this regard is the celebrated literary debate in which he bested his rival Abfi Bakr al-KhwarazmI, and which first brought him fame; despite the existence of a detailed account of this debate from al-Hamadhanl's own pen, it has been virtually ignored by Western scholars and deserves to be better known.4 As al-Khwarazml was an ardent I Recent literature includes: A.

It is such political and religious concerns that will be the focus of this study, rather than literary activity itself, although some idea of the literary taste of the period, and of al- Hamadhani's brilliance, should emerge. I. AL-HAMADHANI S EARLY CAREER Abfi l-Fadl Ahmad b. al-Husayn al-Hamadhani (358-98/968-1008), known as Badi' al-Zaman, the Wonder of the Age, grew up in Hamadhan, where he studied with the noted grammarian Ahmad b. Faris (d. 395/1004). He began his literary career at the age of twenty-two, in 380/990, when he went to Rayy to seek the patronage of the Sahib Ibn 'Abbad, the wazir of the Bfiyid amir Fakhr al-Dawla and the greatest Maecenas of the age. According to his own testimony, it was his father who introduced him at court; but his tutor Ibn Faris may also have exercised influence on his behalf, as he was himself patronized by the Sahib and eventually hired by him as tutor to Fakhr al- Dawla's son Majd al-Dawla.5 At this time the Shicite Bfiyids controlled most of western Iran and Iraq, different members of the family ruling, far from harmoniously, in the three capitals of Baghdad, Shiraz, and Rayy. Fakhr al-Dawla's court in Rayy was the most culturally brilliant of the three, due to the munificence of the Sahib, and was an obvious goal for the aspiring young litterateur from Hamadhan. Like his master, the Sahib was a Shicite; he was also an ardent Mu'tazilite, and had appointed the leading Mu'tazilite theologian of the age, 'Abd al-Jabbar, as qadi in Rayy.6 His literary patronage was, however, by no means restricted by doctrinal considerations; both 'Abd al-Jabbar and Ibn Faris, for example, were Sunni and Shafi'i, although the latter converted to the Malik! school when he moved to Rayy-according to al-Suyftti, because he felt sorry for Malik, who had no adherents there.7 Although al-Hamadhani was apparently well re- ceived by the Sahib, he remained at his court only a few months, before moving on to Jurjan; the reason for his departure is not clear.8 Jurjan was a quasi- independent buffer state situated between the Biyid realms and those of their Sunni rivals further east, the Samanids of Bukhara; a decade before al-Hamadhani's arrival it had fallen under direct Bfiyid control, and was now administered by one of their governors, although its exiled Sunni amir, Qabfis b. Vushmgir, was to regain it a few years later. According to al-Tha'alibi,9 al-Hamadhani spent some time in Jurjan, enjoying close relations (mudckhala) with al-Ismfic- liyya, benefiting from their patronage and profiting from their brilliance. He also gained special favor with Abfi Sa'd Muhammad b. Mansfir-may God Almighty support him!-finding in him a ready mar- ket for his (poetical) wares and profiting abundantly from his well-known habit of extending favor and benefit to worthy men; and when al-Hamadhanli made up his mind to continue on to Nishapur, Abfi Sa'd gave him support for the undertaking, providing for him what he lacked for the journey. It is on the basis of this passage that some scholars have claimed that al-HamadhAni was affiliated with, or at least influenced by, Isma'ili Shicism. But aside from the fact that one would expect the Isma'clis in this period to be referred to as "al-Batiniyya" rather than "al-Ismalliyya," the truth of the matter becomes immediately clear when we consult the Ta'rikh Jurjan of al-Sahmi (d. 427/1036), a biographical dictionary of major personages of the region.

On Ibn Faris, see EI2, s. v. Ibn Faris. The sources say only that al-Hamadhani went to the hadra of the Sahib, but in 380/990 this was in Rayy; see al-'Utbi, Ta'rikh al-Yamini, in the margin of al-Manini, al-Fath al-wahbi (Bulaq, 1286/1869), I, 139. Al-Shak'a (Badic al-Zamcin, 43-46) errs in assuming that the SAhib was at this time still in Isfahan. If we can trust an anecdote in al-Hamadhani's published Diwvn (38), he may have already been introduced to the Sahib as a child of twelve, presumably by his father. 6 EI2, s. vv.

He was a Shaficl, and indeed had married the daughter of Abi Bakr al-Isma'cli (d. 371/ 981, at the age of ninety- four), the late leader of the Shafils in the city. At the time of al-Hamadhani's visit the son of another of Abf Bakr's daughters, Abf Bishr al-Fadl b. Muham- mad, was almost certainly both qddi and ra is of Jurjan, and Abf Bakr's son Abfi Sa'd al-Isma'll, as well as other sons and grandsons, were also important figures who receive lengthy biographies in al-Sahmi's book. 1 Unquestionably, it is this Shafili family named al-Isma'cil and their in-laws to whom al-Tha' alibi refers; we may assume that he knew them well, since he informs us that he finished writing his Yatima in 403/1013 while residing in Jurjan as a guest of Abei Sa'd al-Jilak! (whose generosity to literary men he thus had good reason to praise).' Al-Hamadhani's earliest patrons were thus a Shicite Mu'tazilite and a family of local Shafi'! notables; precisely dated evidence of his own sectarian loyalties, as well as their possible relevance to his career, is lacking before his arrival in Nishapur. Before we turn to this stage of his career, however, it will be useful to summarize the complex political and religious develop- ments in Khurasan during the prior decade. II. POLITICS AND RELIGION IN NISHAPUR Nishapur was the most important provincial city in the realm of the Samanids of Bukhara, and the capital of Khurasan, whose governor was traditionally also the commander of the Samanid armies. The principal enemies of the Samanids were the Bftyid rulers of Rayy, and the main bone of contention the kingdom of Jurjan. After the death of the Bfiyid Rukn al-Dawla in 366/976, his three sons had quarreled, and 'Adud al-Dawla and Mu'ayyid al-Dawla had defeated Fakhr al-Dawla in battle. Fakhr al-Dawla took refuge with the amir of Jurjan, QAbus b. Vushmgir, and when the latter refused to extradite him his brothers came after him. Defeated in battle, both Fakhr al-Dawla and Qabcis fled to Nishapur, while Mu'ayyid al-Dawla, with his wazir the Sahib, took control in Jurjan."2 Shortly before this time, the SAmAnid wazir in Bukhara, Abf I-Husayn al-'Utbi, had dismissed the powerful governor of Nishapur, Abfi I-Hasan al- Simjiri, and replaced him with the Turkish mamluk Abf I-'Abbas Tash. Tash was now ordered to assist QAbfis and Fakhr al-Dawla, and the three set out to besiege Jurjan, but were defeated in battle (371/981) and returned to Nishapur. While awaiting reinforce- ments there, they were disconcerted to hear of the assassination in Bukhara of the wazir al-'Utbi (insti- gated in part, according to one source, by the dis- gruntled ex-governor Abft 1-Hasan). Three wazirs followed in quick succession-al-Muzani, al-FArisi, and Ibn 'Uzayr-and Ibn 'Uzayr, who had been hostile to al-'Utbi, dismissed Tash and restored the army command and governorship of Khurasan to Abfu 1-Hasan, whereupon Tash went into rebellion.13 Soon afterwards, however, both 'Adud al-Dawla and Mu'ayyid al-Dawla died, and the Sahib convinced the notables of the Bfuyid realm to recall Fakhr al-Dawla to Jurjan to assume the amirate. From there, Fakhr al-Dawla offered Tash continued support against Abui l-Hasan, and Tash temporarily reoc- cupied Nishapur. He was soon driven out again, however, and when Fakhr al-Dawla then moved to Rayy, he generously offered Tash the governorship of Jurjan in his place. Tash removed to Jurjan and ruled there as a Buyid dependent for three years, until carried off by the plague in 377/987, when he was replaced by a Bfuyid governor. Abfu l-Hasan retained Nishapur until his death, also in 377/987, when he was succeeded by his son Abu 'All, who was still governor when al-Hamadhani arrived in 382/992.14 The internal factions of the city of Nishapur during this period.have been studied by Richard Bulliet.15 He 10 Al-Sahmi, Ta'rikh Jurjcn (Beirut, 1401/1981), nos. 886 (Abu Sacd al-Jilaki), 98 (Abu Bakr al-Isma'ili), 608 (Abu Bishr al-Fadl b.

Bulliet's</page><page sequence="4">656 Journal of the American Oriental Society 107.4 (1987) has shown how the traditional Hanafi elite was being increasingly challenged by the Shaficis, and how the growing conflict between the two parties was even- tually, in the sixth/twelfth century, to destroy the city altogether. A benchmark of the growing ShAfi'i influence in the late fourth/tenth century was the appointment of ShAfi'i jurisprudents, twice, to the traditionally Hanafi post of qd~l the second of these appointments was in 388/998, and while the first cannot be precisely dated, it was probably made under the governorship of one of the SImjuris.'6 Abfi I-Hasan al-Simjfirl, in particular, seems to have been a sup- porter of the ShAfi'ls, as well as of the Ashcarite theology to which they were increasingly attracted; sometime before 370/980 he acceded to a Shdfi'i request to bring the Ash'arite theologian Ibn Ffirak from Rayy to Nishapur, and built him a madrasa.'7 While the elite of Nishapur was divided between Hanafi and Shdfi'i, at the popular level the real conflict was between the Shi'a and the Karramiyya, according to the geographer al-Muqaddasi, writing in 375/985.18 The fundamentalist Sunni Karramiyya, accused by their opponents of anthropomorphism, seem never to have had much support among the elite of the city, despite a temporary success in later years when the Ghaznavid Mahmfd appointed their leader ra9ls for a time.'9 The situation of their bitter enemies, the Shicites, was more complex, for a number of reasons. Politically, they might be suspected of sym- pathy with their co-religionists, the Bfiyids. Socially, there were presumably difficulties with their participa- tion in the primary intellectual activity of the Sunni elite, the study of Sunni hadfth.20 On the other hand, many of them subscribed to a Mu'tazilite theology, which they shared with a significant proportion of the Hanafi elite, in opposition to the Ash'arism of the Shaficis.2' But the most problematic aspect of their social status was their relationship to the 'Alids. As direct descendents of the Prophet, the 'Alids or sayyids formed a natural aristocracy throughout the Islamic world. Both the Bfiyid and SdmAnid regimes granted them official recognition and certain privileges, and appointed naqibs or "marshals" from among them as their representatives.22 The 'Alids of Nishapur certainly belonged to the elite; to what extent they work is the basis for much of the following analysis. See also H. Halm, Die Ausbreitung der ?dficitischen Rechtschule von den Anfangen bis zum 8./14. Jahrhundert (Wiesbaden, 1974), 42-71. 16 The second Shafii qadi, Abi cUmar (or 'Amr in other sources) al-Bastami, was appointed in 388/998, according to al-Farisi, al-Siydq li-ta'rikh Naysdbar, two MSS in facsimile in R. Frye, ed., The Histories of Nishapur (Cambridge, Mass., 1965), second MS, fol. 2a, and al-Subki, Tabaq~t al-Shdficiyya al-kubrd (Cairo, 1383/1964), IV, 140-43; see also Bulliet, Patricians, 117f. The first Shafifi qd1i, Abi Bakr al-Hiri, was apparently appointed some time before 383/993, the date of al-Hamadhani's debate with al-Khwarazmi, as al-Hamadhani in his account of the debate gives him the title qddi (unlike Abf 'Umar al-Bastami); al-Farisi (second MS, fol. 22ab) and al-Subki (III, 3) give no date; see also Bulliet, Patricians, 93f., 257, and cf. below, note 79.

Muhajir before Abu l-Hasan al-Simjuri in the year 370/980; see his al-Farq bayn al-firaq (Cairo, 1328/ 1910), 213. 20 At least a committed Rdfidite-that is, someone who rejected the caliphates of Abi Bakr and 'Umar and the authority of non-'Alid Companions of the Prophet-would not be expected to participate in the study and transmission of hadith with Sunni isndds; and it should be noted that "Rafidi" rather than "Shi'i" was the term normally employed for accusation or abuse by Sunnis in this period. Theo- logically, the Rafidis were more or less identified with the Imamiyya (Twelvers), although some Zaydis were Rafidis as well (on this, see W. Madelung in EI2, s. v. Imamiya). On the other hand, al-Khatib al-Baghdddi reports meeting in Bagh- dad in 440/1048 the Husaynid Ja'far b. Muhammad b. al-Muzaffar al-Naysabfiri, who transmitted hadith from al-Hakim al-NaysAburi and other Sunnis, and adds: katabtu canhu wa-kdna samdcuhu sahihan wa-kUna yactaqidu madh- hab al-Rdfigda al-Imimiyya (Ta'rikh Baghddd [Cairo, 1931], VII, 236, no. 3728, cited by D.

Whether al-Khatib's juxtaposition of these two statements is meant to convey a sense of incongruity is unclear to me. 21 The correspondences Shafici-Ashcari and Hanafi-Muc- tazili seem to be fairly regular in this period, but there were significant exceptions, at least further west; as noted above, the Muctazilite cAbd al-Jabbatr was a Shafici, for example, and the Ashcarite al-Baqillani was a Maliki; see EI2, s. vv. cAbd al-Djabbar, al-Baqillani. 22 See Bosworth, Ghaznavids, 194-200 (but with insufficient distinction made between cAlids and Shicites); Bulliet, Pat- ricians, 234; and, on the niqdba in Baghdad, Busse, Chalif und Grosskonig, 280-97.</page><page sequence="5">ROWSON: Religion and Politics in the Career of Badi' al-Zamin al-Hamadhini 657 supported the Shl'a is less clear. That many or most did is a reasonable assumption, but there is abundant evidence that at least some did not. In particular, a report in the Ta~rkh-i Bayhaq of Ibn Funduq (d. 565/1170) informs us that in 395/1005 the niqaba of Nishapur was transferred from a Husaynid to a Hasanid family, the latter having the support of the Shdfi'ls; and from notices in the biographical dic- tionaries of Nishapur by al-Hakim and his successor al-Fdris! and elsewhere, it is clear that these Hasanids were themselves Sunnis, and almost exclusively Shafiis. 23 The ousted Husaynid family, who were still in control of the niqdba at the time of al-Hamadhani's debate with al-Khwarazm! in 383/993, were almost certainly Shi'ites, either Zaydi or Imami, and the transfer of the niqaba is probably to be seen as an anti-Shl'ite move, under the militantly Sunni regime of Mahmfid of Ghazna. 4 The Shl'ites in Nishapur had suffered earlier as well, under the pro-Shdfi'!/ Ash'arl Abfi I-Hasan al-Simjfirl, as is indicated by the rubric of a famous letter by the Shl'ite Abfi Bakr al-Khwarazml consoling them in their time of trouble, although the nature of Abfi I-Hasan's attack is unclear, and does not seem to have affected appointments to the niqdba.25 Further evidence for Sunni-Shl'i friction in this period, but suggesting a more conciliatory attitude on the part of the Hanafis, comes from an anecdote in al-Farisi's biography of the Hanafi jurist (and later qddi) Abfi l-'Ald' SA'id b. Muhammad. When he stopped in Baghdad while on pilgrimage in 375/985, Abfi l-'Ala' was rebuked by the caliph for 23 Abi 1-Hasan al-Bayhaqi Ibn Funduq, Ta'rikh-i Bayhaq (Tehran, 1317/ 1938), 54-58, 254f., discussed by Bosworth (Ghaznavids, 196f.) and Kravl dsky ("Untersuchungen," 302, 304). Ibn Funduq says that the Shafifis supported the sons of the Hasanid Abi 'Abdallah al-Husayn b. Da'fd against the Husaynid naqib Abi 'Ali Muhammad b. Muhammad, or against the latter's brother AbQ 'Abdallah, known as Jaw- harak; the deposed Abi 'Ali's son, Abi Ja'far, moved to Mashhad-i Tfis, where he served as naqib for a time, before the family moved permanently to Bayhaq. In a separate anecdote, undated, Ibn Funduq also reports that a further brother of Abi 'Ali and Jawharak, Abi l-Qasim 'Ali, quar- reled for precedence in a procession at Ghazna with another Abi 1-Qasim, naqib in Nishapur, who can be identified as a great-grandson of the Hasanid AbQ 'Abdallah (al-Farisi, second MS, foll. 65b-66a); in this case the sultan Mahmfid, informed that the Husaynid was the more learned of the two men, granted him the precedence. For full references on the Hasanid family, and a genealogical tree, see Bulliet, Pa- tricians, 234-45. According to Ibn al-Jawzi, Muntazam (Hyderabad, 1357-58), VII, 34f., on the authority of al- Hakim, the Hasanid AbQ 'Abdallah (d. 355/966) used to refer to 'Uthman as "the martyred caliph," and to 'A'isha as "the righteous one, daughter of the righteous one (Abi Bakr), the beloved of the beloved of God," both emphatically anti-Shicite statements; and his son, Abi I-Hasan Muham- mad (d. 401/1011), is called both a Shafici and naqib by al-Subki (Tabaqdt, III, 148). Perhaps it was one of the members of this family that the Shicite Abu Bakr al- Khwarazmi had in mind when he penned these lines on an "'cAlawi Nasibi" (an 'Alid hostile to CAli): A sharif whose deed is a base one, A low-minded man in an ancient house, A blemish on our shari Ca, and a victory over us For the Jews and Christians. (Al-Thac alibi, Yatima, IV, 230f.) 24 For a full discussion of this family, descendants of the Husaynid Muhammad Zubara and in later centuries leading Shi'ites in Bayhaq, see Krawulsky, "Untersuchungen," 303-8 and Tabelle I (genealogical tree). AbQ 'Ali's great-grandfather was associated with the Zaydiyya in Tabaristan, his son AbQ Ja'far was naqib in Mashhad (see previous note), and his second cousin Ja'far b. Muhammad b. al-Muzaffar is called a Rafidite by al-Khatib al-Baghdadi (see note 20 above); other evidence for the family's Shi'ite affiliation is more circumstantial or ambiguous. Krawulsky's article is concerned with the roots of Shicism in Bayhaq and Khurasan generally, and she marshals evidence for the suppression of informa- tion on Shi'ites there in the preserved historiography of the fourth/tenth and fifth/eleventh centuries, a question which cannot be discussed in detail here. One piece of evidence which she cites for 'Alid-Shi'ite connections is the construc- tion of a madrasa in Bayhaq for "the 'Alids and their followers, and the Mu'tazilites and Zaydis" (sdddt va-atbd`-i ishdn-rd va-'adliydn va-Zaydiydn-rd) by a certain Abi 1-Qasim 'Ali b. Muhammad (not an 'Alid) ("Untersuchun- gen," 306, citing Ibn Funduq, Thrikh-i Bayhaq, 194f.); she should perhaps have added that this man also constructed madrasas for the Hanafis, Shaficis, and Karramis, and was summoned to Ghazna in 414/1023 and called on the carpet by Mahmfd for hypocrisy: he should have constructed only one madrasa, for the madhhab in which he himself believed (which is unidentified). As for Mahmfid's possible role in the transfer of the niqdba in Nishapur in 395/1005, it should be noted that it was only a few years later that he appointed the rabidly anti-Shi'ite Karram! leader Muhammad b. Ishaq b.

AL-HAMADHANI AND AL-KHWARAZMI IN NISHAPUR According to his own testimony, al-Hamadhdni's primary motivation for visiting Nishapur was to meet the famous litterateur Abf Bakr al-Khwdrazmi.27 Abb Bakr Muhammad b. al-'Abbds al-Khwdrazmi (323- 83/934-93) was at this time the most famous literary figure in the entire East. In a long career he had repeatedly crisscrossed the Islamic world, enjoying the patronage of amirs as far west as the HamdAnid Sayf al-Dawla in Aleppo and as far east as the ShAr of Gharchistan; but he had been favored by no one more generously and more consistently than by the SAhib and his first master 'Adud al-Dawla, whom he visited over the years, separately and together, in their various capitals at Isfahan, Shiraz, Jurjan (after the Bfiyid takeover in 371/981), and Rayy, while maintaining a permanent residence, throughout the latter part of his life, in Nishapur. Al-Khwarazmi was a militant Shicite, and it is striking to note, from his biography in al-Tha'alibl's Yatimat al-dahr, how much better he seems to have got along with his Shl'ite patrons in the West, HamdAnid and Bfiyid, than with the Sunnis of the East; among the latter, we know that he quar- relled with and wrote satirical poems against the SamAnid wazir Abf 'Ali al-Bal'ami in Bukhara, and spent time in prisons in both Sijistan and Gharchistan 28 after satirizing their rulers as well. Al-KhwArazml also had trouble in Nishapur, al- though the details elude us. According to al-Tha'clibi, he had lived prosperously and productively there for some years before Tash's disastrous campaign in Jurjan in 371/981, despite his open support of the Bfyids and scorn for the Samanids. When, however, he exulted too publicly over Tash's defeat, and satir- ized both Tash and the wazir al-'Utbi, the latter, incensed particularly by a poem which may not have been authentic, ordered his imprisonment and con- fiscation of his property. Al-KhwArazmi escaped and fled in disguise to the Sahib in Jurjan; but when al-'Utbi was assassinated, his successor al-Muzani recalled al-Khwdrazmi to Nishapur and restored his property to him. After this, according to al-Tha'Alibi, al-Khwarazmi enjoyed the respect of the governors of Nishapur-that is, of the restored Abf I-Hasan al- Slmjfiri and, from 377/987, his son Abfi 'All until he was confronted with the prodigious talents of Badi' al-Zaman al-HamadhanL.29 Al-Khwarazml's good relations with Abf 'Ali are confirmed by his preserved panegyrics of the gover- nor.30 His difficulties with al-'Utbi and TAsh, on the other hand, are hardly referred to in his extant writ- ings.3' What is reiterated in the rubrics to a number of his published Rasddil is rather his falling out with Abfi I-Hasan al-Simjuri, at some undetermined time but presumably prior to the latter's replacement by Tash; al-Khwarazmi was imprisoned in Nishapur, but man- aged to escape and flee to Rayy, the reason for Abf I-Hasan's displeasure being attributed in the letters 26 Al-Farisi, second MS, fol. 75ab; I follow the interpretation by Bulliet (Patricians, 201-3) of this passage; the "refurbish- ment" is literally the installation (? ittikhddh, nasb) of a chest (? sundiuq) at the tomb. 27 Al-Hamadhani, Rasd'il, 30. Al-Tha'alibi, Yatima, III, 400, compares the position of al-Khwarazmi in Khurasan to that of Ibn Faris in al-Jabal (in a list giving other parallels as well). 28 Al-Thacalibi, Yatima, IV, 194-241; EI2, s.v. al- Khwarazmi. According to al-Hakim (epitome in The His- tories of Nishapur, ed. Frye, fol. 51b) and Ibn Khallikan, Wafaydt al-acydn (Beirut, 1968-72), IV, 400f., al-Khwarazmi was sister's son to the historian al-Tabari; this assertion is questioned by Yaqft, Mu jam al-bulddn (Leipzig, 1866-70), I, 68, who argues that while al-Khwarazmi was a committed Rafidite, al-Tabari, despite accusations hurled at him by the Hanbalites, was not. It may be noted that AbQ 'Ali al- Bal'ami was the man who translated al-Tabari's Ta'rikh into Persian; his quarrel with al-Khwarazmi is reflected in the latter's Rasd'il, 94, 95-97. 29 Al-Tha'alibi, Yatima, IV, 205-9. 30 Al-cUtbi, I, 127, 155. 31 Al-Thacalibi, Yatima, IV, 234f., cites some verses ad- dressed to the Sahib when al-Khwarazmi arrived at his hadra after being attacked by Tash (reading mankiuban [min ]ihat Tdsh] for maktubun in the rubric), but the verses themselves mention only the Al Saman, not al-cUtbi or Thsh. Other verses ( Yatima, IV, 233) rejoice over the defeat of Tash and Fa'iq, and may refer to the battle in Jurjan, although al-cUtbl is not mentioned; there seems to be no subsequent battle in which Tash and Fa'iq were on the same side. The only reference I have found to Tash in the Rasd'il (205, giving only his honorific, Husam al-Dawla) is unfortunately in a corrupt and incomprehensible context.</page><page sequence="7">RowSON: Religion and Politics in the Career of Badi' al-Zamdn al-Hamadhani 659 only in the vaguest terms to some sort of "slander."32 This information could conceivably be a distortion of al-Tha'alibi's similar account of al-Khwarazmi's troubles with Tdsh and flight to Jurjan (the latter being presumably accurate, as al-Tha'Alibi was on the spot at the time); but the repeated references to Abf 1-Hasan in the Rasd'il argue against this, and it seems more likely that al-KhwArazml did in fact at different times offend both governors. He was apparently not in residence at the time Abut I-Hasan attacked the Shl'ites of Nishapur, and whether his own troubles with the man had anything to do with his Shicism is impossible to say.33 Badic al-ZamAn al-HamadhAni arrived in Nishapur from Jurjan in 382/992, having been attacked and robbed on the way by a band of marauding Arabs, as recounted in a letter he wrote back to Abfi Bakr al-Isma'l11's son Abfi Sa'd.34 His subsequent experi- ences with Abfi Bakr al-Khwdrazm! are detailed in another very long letter addressed to an anonymous sayyid, and can be supplemented by a partially independent account from Ibn Funduq's Wishdh al- dumya, preserved by Yaqft.35 Soon after his arrival, al-Hamadhani sent al-Khwarazmr an elegant note, expressing his admiration and his desire for a meeting, and apologizing for his current rather disreputable appearance, a consequence of the robbery. When the two men first met, under unknown circumstances, al-Khwdrazm! observed decorum by standing up when introduced; but al-Hainadhani detected a decided chilli- ness in the air, about which he complained in a subsequent letter to al-Khwarazmi, attributing it, how- ever, again to his lack of appropriate garb. In his reply, al-Khwarazm! refused to apologize for any lack of cordiality, protesting that he showed greater respect to no one than the new arrival, except for the sayyid Abfi l-Barakat al-'Alawl; this man was a Husaynid, although not directly related to the family holding the niqdba, and other than the fact that al-Tha'alibi calls him the imdm of the Shl'a in Nishapur we know very little about him.36 Al-Hamadhani was offended by al-Khwarazmi's let- ter, and, according to his own account, resolved not to pursue the relationship, until he heard that al- Khwarazml was attacking him behind his back. He then sent off another, rather more strongly-worded letter, rebuking al-Khwarazmi for his arrogance, and insisting that all he desired was an amicable exchange of adab.37 Al-Hamadhan! claims to have received no reply to this letter; but Ibn Funduq offers the text of a response from al-Khwarazm! which could hardly be displaced from another context, as it answers al-Haamadhani's charges in his own words.38 Al- Hamadhan! had begun by saying, "I come to the water (shirca) of my lord's friendship, even if it is not pure; and I don the robe of his benevolence, even if it is not cut wide." Al-Khwarazm! retorted that "The water of my friendship with my lord if he comes to it is pure, and the garments of my benevolence if he accepts them are cut wide-but only so long as he does not muddy the water (sharica) with his obstinacy and partisanship (tacassub), and so long as the gar- ments are not burnt up by his unfounded accusations 32 AbQ Bakr al-KhwarazmI, Rasd'il, 8, 9, 89, 94, 98, 99, 126, 208. Another possible allusion to this incident occurs in a letter (85ff.) addressed to the bunddr of Nishapur from Rayy at the time of the Sahib's accession to the vizierate there after the fall of AbQ 1-Fath Ibn al-'Amid, in 366/977, in which al-Khwarazm! mentions his recent comparative lack of success in Khurasan, although stating his intention to return home there soon in any case. 3 There is some justification for placing both these incidents relatively late in the career of AbQ I-Hasan. Prior to the death of Rukn al-Dawla in 366/976, when his son 'Adud al-Dawla was still maintaining a second capital in Shiraz, the latter was in friendly correspondence with AbQ 1-Hasan (see J.-Ch. Burgel, Die Hofkorrespondenz 'Adud ad-Daulas [Wiesbaden, 1965], 30); and at the same time 'Adud al-Dawla was also sending a regular stipend to al-Khwarazmi, who was resident in Nishapur. Under such circumstances, attacks by AbQ I-Hasan on either al-Khwarazmi or the Shicites of Nishapur seem somewhat unlikely. 34 Al-HamadhAni, Rasd'il, 104f., repeated at the beginning of his account of the debate, 30f. His letter to the adib AbQ Nasr b. al-MarzubAn, attributing his move from Jurjan to Khurasan to the displeasure of the "sultan" in Jurjan (ibid., 150-57), is difficult to reconcile with other accounts, and probably refers to a later visit to Jurjan, after it had been restored to Qabis b. Vushmgir. 35 Al-Hamadhani, Rasd'il, 28-34; Yaqut, Mujam al- udaba', II, 178-83. 36Al-Hamadhani, Rasd'il, 30-34; YAqut, Mujam al- udabd', II, 185-90.

He then picked up on al-Hamadhani's disingenuous disclaimer of angling to be received by him, and said, How can one be received who swoops down on us like a predatory eagle, and lands among us like an arrow out of the blue? To require of a man (taklif) what is not in his power is possible according to the madhhab of al-Ash'arl, but my lord has gone beyond his Ash'arite master; for his master required of the incapable what is not in his power because of his incapability, but my lord has required of the ignorant knowledge of the unknowable because of its impos- sibility . 9 There seems to be no good reason for doubting the authenticity of this letter, even if al-Hamadhani him- self omitted any reference to it and it is missing in the published collection of al-Khwarazmi's Rasa'il (as are all his letters to al-Hamadhani). Its claim that al- Hamadhani was an Ash'arite is supported by a state- ment from the lost Tarikh Hamadhlin by Shirawayh b. Shahradar, quoted by Yaqfit, that in addition to being a zealous Sunni (mutaassib li-ahl al-hadith wa 1-sunna) he was accused of Ash'arism.40 Taken in isolation, Shirawayh's statement would not necessarily contradict the claim of some modern scholars that al-Hamadhani was at first a Shicite who only later converted to Sunnism-although this would still seem somewhat unlikely, as al-Hamadhani apparently never returned to Hamadhan after moving east,4' and his brother, who according to Shirawayh became muffti of Hamadhan, was certainly a Sunni, as was his tutor Ibn Faris, despite patronage by the Shi'ite SAhib. But in the light of al-Khwarazmi's letter, any claim for al-Hamadhani's Shi'ism must rest on more compelling evidence than we in fact have, as will be seen below. If al-Hamadhani was a committed ShAfi'i from his youth, he shared his convictions with his hosts from the Ismacili and Jilaki families in Jurjan. In Nishapur, the late leader of the Shaficis, occupying a place analogous to that of Abfi Bakr al-Ismaili in Jurjan, had been Abfi Sahl al-Su'lfiki (296-369/909-980); and it is this man's son and successor, Abf l-Tayyib al-Su'lfiki, whom we find as al-Hamadhani's most frequent correspondent in his Rasd'il.42 It seems quite likely that al-Hamadhani arrived in Nishapur with letters of introduction from the Isma'ilis to the Su'lfikis; in any case, he became acquainted with Abuf l-Tayyib fairly soon, as it was in the latter's home that a face-to-face meeting with Abfi Bakr al-Khwarazmi was now arranged. Al-Khwarazmi, however, failed to 43 appear. At this point the sayyid Abfi 'Ali proposed to host a meeting himself. According to al-Hamadhani, it took further pressure from the sayyid Abfi 1-Husayn to convince al-Khwarazmi to attend, and it was Abfi 1-Husayn who finally officiated as host. Ibn Funduq, on the other hand, while commenting that "al-Badi' al-Hamadhani was supported by a group from the elite of Nishapur who had a grudge against Abfi Bakr," does not mention Abfi 1-Husayn at all, and puts the meeting under the auspices of Abfi 'Ali, whom he calls the naqib al-siyfda bi-Naysabir." The latter is the Husaynid Abu 'Ali Muhammad b. abi 1-Husayn Muhammad of the Zubara family who, according to Ibn Funduq in the Tarikh-i Bayhaq, was to be replaced in the niqdba twelve years later by a (Sunni) Hasanid, with the connivance of the Shafi'is; the sayyid Abfi 1-Husayn is probably his father, him- self formerly naqib, for whom we have no dates but whose own father died in 376/986 at the age of fifty- eight.45 Although there is no direct evidence for the 39 On the Ashcarite view of taklif, according to which God's omnipotence includes the power to require of man what he does not predestine him to accomplish, see al- Ash'ari, K. al-Luma', ed. and trans. R. J. McCarthy, The Theology of al-Ashcari (Beirut, 1953), paragraph 134; idem, K. al-Ibdna 'an usul al-diydna, Eng. trans. W. C. Klein (New Haven, 1940), 111. 40 Yaqit, Mu jam al-udabd', II, 161 f. It is likely that Shirawayh's "ahl al-hadith wal-sunna" refers specifically to the ShAfiis; the phrase is often so used by Eastern authors in this period (in distinction to "ahl al-ra'y," the Hanafis); see, e.g., al-Farisi, second MS, fol. 80a, and al-Subki, Tabaqat, III, 59. 41 In a letter home to his father (Rasd'il, 371f.), al- Hamadhan! says that he has been away from home for eleven years (twelve in the parallel text in al-Tha'alibi, Yatima, IV, 280). 42 Bulliet, Patricians, 115-33, and references there; al- Hamadhani, Rasd'il, 106-28, 194-206, 249-52, 289-91, 352- 57, 431-42. 43 Al-HamadhAni, Rasd'il, 36-39. 44 Al-Hamadhani, Rasd'il, 39f.; Yaqfit, Mucjam al-udabd', II, 174. Ibn Funduq's reference to the group with a grudge against al-Khwarazmi is a paraphrase of a similar comment in al-Thaclibi, Yatima, IV, 208f. 45 Ibn Funduq, Tdrikh-i Bayhaq, 55f., 255; al-Hakim, epitome in The Histories of Nishapur, foll. 53b (AbQ</page><page sequence="9">RowsoN: Religion and Politics in the Career of Badi' al-Zamain al-Hamadhiini 661 Shi'ism of either of these men, such evidence for both earlier and later members of the family makes it likely.46 In any case, Abf Bakr al-Khwarazmi would presumably have considered any 'Alid, and especially a Shi'ite one, a more congenial and less biassed host for a confrontation with al-Hamadhani than Abf l-Tayyib al-Sucliki, and he did show up. At this first encounter, whose audience is uniden- tified, al-Hamadhani offered al-Khwarazmi his choice of field for competition-prose or poetry, memory or extemporaneous composition (badiha). Al-Khwarazmi opted for the latter, and turned to the host to provide a known line of poetry on whose meter and rhyme the extemporaneously written verses were to be based. Before he could do so, however, al-Hamadhani inter- rupted, and with what seems to be fully characteristic cockiness proposed himself to extemporize, "in a single breath," a poetical paraphrase of a thirty-line poem by al-Khwarazmi, following its meaning line by line while using none of its phraseology; if the audience could tell which poem was al-Khwarazmi's and which al-Hamadhani's, the latter would concede the debate. Al-Khwarazmi quickly rejected this proposal, however, and the host provided the requisite line for both men to work from. Al-Hamadhani cites his own extem- poraneously written verses, which include insults against al-Khwarazmi and praise of their 'Alid host; but he says that al-Khwarazmi then refused to recite the verses he had written as al-Hamadhani puts it, "being averse to proving less intelligent than a cat, who produces/defecates (tuhdithu, a pun) and then covers." Al-Khwarazmi then counterproposed a contest in extemporaneous oral composition, and each poet pro- duced an appropriate satire of the other. Al-Khwa- razmi's quibbles with al-Hamadhani's use of poetic license were effectively refuted by the latter; and when he interrupted al-Hamadhani at the very beginning of the next round to object, quite unjustifiably, to his use of a word, al-Khwarazmi lost the support of his audience. He then also lost his temper, and the debate degenerated into name calling; but even in this al- Khwarazmi could not match his opponent's verbal dexterity and wit. The antagonists calmed down while a song was sung, but then set to again. After another round of abuse, and another song, the party broke 47 up. Ibn Funduq asserts that opinion was divided over who had won the debate. Al-Hamadhan! himself, not surprisingly, professes to have been astounded to hear that al-KhwArazmi was claiming victory, but adds that, out of consideration for al-KhwArazmi's age, he went to him to apologize, and accepted his invita- tion to stay for dinner. This was not, however, the end of the story. Shortly thereafter, according to al-Hamadhani, al-Khwarazmi sent him a letter com- plaining of the circulation of biassed reports that he had lost the debate, and insisting on a rematch in the salon of one of the town leaders, to be witnessed by the general public. After a further exchange of acri- monious letters, a meeting was arranged in the home of the wazir Abf 1-Qasim. Ibn Funduq's account omits any reference to al-Khwarazmi's letter of chal- lenge, stating rather that "one of the important per- sonages had a grudge against al-Khwarazmi and arranged a gathering at the home of al-shaykh al-sayyid Abf l-Qasim al-wazir."48 IV. THE GREAT DEBATE What makes this second and decisive encounter particularly instructive for our purposes is the detail of al-Hamadhani's account, which includes the names of the most eminent guests, as well as their order I-Husayn Muhammad), 54a (his father AbO Muhammad Yahya), 47b (AbQ Muhammad's father AbQ 1-Husayn Mu- hammad); al-Sam'ani, K. al-Ansdb (Hyderabad, 1382-98/ 1962-78), VI, 245-50; and cf. notes 23 and 24 above. Ibn Funduq's report (254f.) placing AbO I-Husayn Muhammad in the time of the SamAnid Nasr II (301-31/914-42) is manifestly a confusion with his grandfather, also AbQ 1-Husayn Muhammad. The isolated report in Ibn 'Inaba, CUmdat al-tflib (Najaf, 1386/1961), 347, that the wife of the younger AbQ 1-Husayn Muhammad and mother of AbO 'Ali and his brothers was Badi' al-Zaman al-Hamadhani's daughter 'A'isha, can be safely rejected on chronological grounds. 46 See note 24 above. 47 Al-HamadhAni, Rasd'il, 40-52; Yaqft, Mujam al- udabd', II, 174-79. 48Al-HamadhAni, Rasd'il, 52-57; Yaqfit, Mu jam al- udabd', II, 179. The identity of AbQ I-QAsim is unclear. He is probably the AbO l-Qasim al-Hasan b. 'Abdallah al-Mustawfli al-wazir mentioned, with no further information, by al- Thacalibi, Yatima, IV, 450; al-'Utbi, II, 87-90, gives a panegyric by him of the sultan Mahmfid, written a few years later on the occasion of the defeat of the Karakhanids at Balkh. There is no indication, however, that this man was a sayyid. Al-Tha'alibi (ibid.) also mentions an AbQ l-Qasim al-'Alawi, who is perhaps to be identified with the younger brother of the naqib AbO CAli (see note 23 above); Ibn Funduq may have simply confused the two.</page><page sequence="10">662 Journal of the American Oriental Society 107.4 (1987) of arrival. He was himself the first to arrive, followed by the imam Abf l-Tayyib and the sayyid Abf l-Husayn 9 the son of apostleship and imamate, who dwelt in the land of inspiration and sat in the court of prophet- hood, a man of literary accomplishment, polished speech, and impeccable fairness. He arrived early intentionally, and began to fight shy of this worthy [myself] "with two swords," because of a false story and misleading account which had been given him. Realizing this, I said, "My lord sayyid, if others walk in their tashayyuc on two feet, I fly with two wings; and if others show their devotion to the Noble House (ahl al-bayt) with coy glances, I display mine with a radiant countenance. Let not, then, any suspected slight lead you to slight proper decorum yourself. Moreover, I have written odes in praise of the family of the Prophet-may God bless him and give him peace!-which have joined the hems of land and sea, ridden the tongues of men to their destination, travelled through the lands with no need for pro- visions, and flown to the horizons with no use of feet. I will gladly present my wares before you, gentlemen, and without charge; for I have recited them for the other world, not this one, and treasured them up for pious, not worldly, motives. Asked by Abft al-Husayn for an example, al- Hamadhani recited the following qasida:50 O travellers, on whose night-encampment Time has pitched his tents, What lovely lavender in a garden you were, now become wormwood- From a calamity in which the religion manifested the Signs of the End: One spattered with the blood of prophethood, who had struck with the hand of imamate, Minced by the sharp swordblades, as they forced on him the cup of death. He was prevented from reaching the water, although it lay close at hand.5' Ibn Hind52 set up his head above the people like a signpost; And that sweet mouth, which the Prophet used to kiss, to assuage his hurts- Ibn Hind struck it with his rod, in his boundless wickedness, And sang his song over him, refilling his cup with wine. Yet religion remains bright and shining, and justice adorned with a mole and a beauty mark. Woe to him who turned his back on the Book, putting this world before him! He will surely bite his fingers with regret, when regret helps him nothing, And the penalty he has incurred will bring him its evil consequence! In pursuit of their revenge, the Bani Umayya dese- crated the sacred precinct, Until they had settled their scores for the Day of Badr, and usurped the rule;53 They cursed the Commander of the Faithful with public proclamations like the call to prayer.54 Why does the sky not fall prostrate? Why do the clouds not pour out their tears? Why do the mountains not tumble? Why does the spirit not perish? Damnation circled their necks like a dove's collar, 49 Al-HamadhAni, Rasd'il, 57f. 50 For this lament on the martyrdom of al-Husayn at Karbalad' (61/680), I follow the text in the published Rasd'il, 58-61. The version in the published Diwdn, 76f., has numerous variants, and is followed by a four-line poem expressing the opposite sentiments, praising the Umayyads generally and Yazid and Mu'awiya in particular, "which some say was composed by al-Khwarazmi and attributed by him to al-Hamadhani, in order to defame him." 5' See al-Tabarl, Ta'rikh (Leiden, 1897-1901), II, 312. 52 I.e., the caliph Yazid b. Mu'awiya b. abi Sufyan, whose paternal grandmother was Hind, mentioned here because of her notoriety for having savagely eaten the liver of the slain Hamza, the Prophet's uncle, at the battle of Uhud (see EI2, s.v. Hind bint 'Utba). For Yazid's behavior when al-Husayn's head was brought to him in Damascus, see al-Tabarl, II, 282f. 5 In 64/683 Yazid's general Husayn b. Numayr, besieging the rival caliph 'Abdallah b. al-Zubayr in Mecca, bombarded the city, and the Ka'ba caught fire and burned; a second successful siege under 'Abd al-Malik's general al-Hajjaj b. Yfsuf in 72-3/692 resulted in the death of Ibn al-Zubayr and the consolidation of Umayyad rule; see al-Tabari, II, 424-27, 829-30, 844-50. The interpretation of these events as revenge for the defeat of Mu'awiya's father Abi Sufyan by Muhammad at the battle of Badr (2/624) is a typically Shicite one. 54 On the public cursing of cAli under Mucawiya and later Umayyads, see H.

This qasida, and its context, have been variously evaluated. Writing in 1959, Mustafa al-Shak'a took it to mean that al-Hamadhani, noticing the presence of some important Shi'ites, recited his ode to win their sympathy and prevent their supporting the Shicite al-Khwarazmi for factional reasons.57 More recently, James Monroe has argued against this that al- Hamadhani's Shicite profession is quite explicit both to the audience of the majlis and to the reader of his Rascdil; moreover, since any attempt to conciliate a few Shicites would have risked alienating the Sunnis present, Monroe has concluded that the vast majority of those present were Shi'ites.58 While it cannot be ruled out that other, unnamed guests were already present when al-Hamadhani re- cited his ode, most of the elite had not yet arrived, and the only audience we know of consisted of the obscure Abfi l-Qatsim, the 'Alid Abf 1-Husayn, and the ShAfi'i Abf 1-Tayyib. Moreover, the poem is itself not so very Shicite. It makes no reference to the Imams (twelve or any other number), and indicates no hostility toward the caliphs AbQ Bakr and 'cUmar (that is, RAfidism). It expresses regret for the Prophet's family, sorrow at the tragedy of Karbala', and hostility to the Umayyads; but the same could be said of much Sunni writing at this time, and particularly so in the East. One may compare, for example, al-Subki's long defense of al-Hakim al-NaysAbirl (d. 405/1014), the Shafi'i author of the Ta'rikh Naysdbar, against a charge of Shicism and RAfidism. Although granting that al-Hakim's inclination toward 'All may have exceeded that demanded by the sharica, and noting persistent reports of his extreme disparagement of Mu'awiya, al-Subki shows from the man's own writ- ings that he recognized the respective merits (taft/il) of the first four caliphs in their standard Sunni (and historical) order, and stresses his close links with the consistently anti-Shicite Ash'arites.59 Al-HamadhAni did not seriously compromise his Sunnism, then, by reciting an elegy over the martyr al-Husayn and thereby neutralizing the hostility of a (possible Rafidite) 'Alid, although the lack of a larger Sunni audience may have encouraged him to go further in explicitly stating his "tashayyu"' than he otherwise would have. This interpretation of the in- cident, which is roughly al-Shak'a's, is also that of Ibn Funduq, who states simply that "al-Badi' tried to Al-batil, epithet of Fatima, daughter of the Prophet and mother of al-Husayn. 56 Ka'b b. Mama al-Iyadl was a pre-Islamic figure famed for his generosity, and in particular for giving water to a companion and himself dying of thirst as result. See Ibn 'Abd Rabbih, al-'Iqd al-farid (Cairo, 1359/1940) 1, 339; Abi l-Faraj al-Isfahani, Aghfini (Bulaq, 1285) XV, 95, 97; al- Tha'alibi, Thimcr al-quluib (Cairo, 1326/ 1908), 98f. 57 Al-Shak'a, Badi'al-Zamfin, 191 f. 58Monroe, Art of Badi' al-Zamfin, 53f., 170-75. Al- Hamadhani, who died relatively young, did not collect and publish his own epistles, although he probably did assume their ultimate publication; according to Ibn Khallikan, I, 129, the man who did collect them was Abu Sa'd 'Abd al-RahmAn b. Dust (d. 431/1040), an important (Hanafi) litterateur in Nishapur; on him, see al-Tha'alibi, Yatima, IV, 425-29; al-FArisi, first MS, fol. 42a, and second MS, fol. 89b; al-Kutubi, Fawdt al-wafaydt (Beirut, 1973-74), II, 264f. Ibn Khallikan also reports on the authority of Ibn Dust that al-Hamadhani was buried prematurely after suffering a stroke. 59 Al-Subki, Tabaqfit, IV, 155-71, replying specifically to accusations by the Zahirite Muhammad b.

Krawulsky ("Unter- suchungen," 301f.) sees a process of "de-Shi'itization" in the preserved epitomes and continuations of al-Hakim's Ta'rikh Naysfibizr, as a partial explanation for the dearth of cor- roboratory information on the Nishapuri Shi'ites (actually 'Alids assumed to be Shi'ites) catalogued by Ibn Funduq. Al-Hakim certainly did include Shl'ites in his book (be- sides the Husaynid Zubara family, we find Abi Bakr al-Khwarazmi, for example; see note 28 above), but given the state of the evidence it is difficult to say more than that he was perhaps less enthusiastic than some of his Shafi'l- Ashcari colleagues in exerting the pressure on the Shicite community (whatever its size or status) that was clearly there.</page><page sequence="12">664 Journal of the American Oriental Society 107.4 (1987) win over (istamcla qaib) the sayyid Abf 1-Husayn with a qasida which he recited in praise of the Noble House. ,,60 It was after this that the other guests began to arrive. Al-HamadhAni lists the first group in the fol- lowing order;61 I have added brief identifications from various prosopographical sources. Al-shavkh Abi 'Umar al-Bastami. He was Abi l-Tayyib al-Su'lfki's son-in-law, and his heir as leader of the Shafi'is in Nishapur. He was subsequently appointed qid1 of Nishapur, in 388/998, and al-Subk! reports that the Shaficis were overjoyed and sent their thanks to the sultan (Mahmid b. Sebuktegin), pre- sumably because the qacdcd of Nishapur was tradition- ally held by a Hanafl.62 Al-qddi Abi Nasr. Abi Nasr b. Sahl was a Hanafi and the leading Mu'tazilite of Nishapur; he had also been, at some time, qfidi. Shortly after this gathering he left on pilgrimage. Al-Hamadhani's Rasd'il include a stinging rebuke addressed to him for an act of discourtesy.63 Al-shaykh Abi Sa'id Muhammad b. Armak. Uniden- tified. Abi 1-Qasim b. Habib. He is the author of the well- known K. al-'Uqalf' al-majdnin. According to al- Suyfiti, he was first a Karrami and then a dedicated Shafi'i. Al-Sahmi reports that he went to Jurjan in 389/999, where Abu Sa'd al-Isma'ili and his sons recorded hadith from him. He died in 406/1016, and Abu 'Umar al-Bastami prayed at his funeral.64 Al-faqih Abi I-Haytham. He was a Hanafi, and held the qa~d1' of Nishapur from 392/1002 to 405/1015. He died in 406/1016.65 Al-shaykh Abi Nasr b. al-Marzuban. He appears in al-Tha'alibi's Yatimat al-dahr as an important adib, but his legal school is not indicated.66 Associates (ashab) of al-imiim Abi I-Tayyib al-ustcdh. Associates of al-ustcdh al-fiidil Abi l-Hasan al-MWsar- jisi. He was a prominent teacher of Shafi'c fiqh, and lived 308-84/920-94.67 Associates of al-ustddh Abf 'Umar al-Bastami. A'-shaykh Aba SacId al-Hamadhani (so in the Rasadil; in Yaqft, Abi Sa'd). Unless this is Badic al-Zaman's own brother Abi Sa'd (and there seems to be no evidence that he ever visited Nishapur), he is uniden- tified.68 This predominantly Shafici group of personages was followed by another party, whom al-Hamadhani identifies only as "boorish louts," and who advanced to the center and even the front (sadr) of the room, before being forced back to the back rows ("where the shoes were lined up"). They turned out to be, of course, the associates of al-Khwarazmi. While the accuracy of al-Hamadhani's description of them may be doubted, it seems relatively unlikely that he would have referred in this way to any persons of major stature in the community. Al-Khwarazmi himself was 60 Yaqut, Mu'jam al-udabd', II, 179. 61 Al-Hamadhani, Rasc 9il, 61-63; Yaqut, Mu'jam al- udabc', II, 179-80. 62 Abu 'cUmar (or 'Amr) Muhammad b. al-Husayn al- Bastami (d. 408/1017): Bulliet, Patricians, 117f., 132, and references there; al-Subki, IV, 140-43. Ibn Funduq gives him the title qcdi, whereas al-Hamadhani calls him al-shaykh and refers to him as a hakim, a word whose precise meaning here is unclear. In general, al-Hamadhani seems to use contem- porary titles, while those in Ibn Funduq are retrospective. 63 Abu Nasr Muhammad b. Muhammad b.

Al- Hamadhani now gave him his choice of field in which to compete; but when al-Khwarazmi chose grammar, he refused to agree unless al-Khwarazmi first conceded improvisation, recitation, memory, and epistolography (tarassul). This al-Khwarazmi refused to do, and there was general consternation until the ustfidh Abfi 'Umar intervened and remonstrated with him, saying, "You, sir, are the adib of Khurasan and the shaykh of these lands, and it is in the fields which this young man has enumerated that we have believed you to be the unrivalled master. Your unwillingness to compete with him in them will only raise doubts and suspicions."70 Unexpectedly, al-Khwarazmi then said, "I concede memory." Delighted, al-Hamadhani added that if he would only concede improvisation and epistolography as well, they could get on to the fields in which al-Khwarazmi excelled grammar, lexicon, prosody, proverbs, and poetry. But al-Khwarazmi replied, "I have no intention of conceding epistolography, and I have not conceded memory." Yet when challenged to recite fifty verses twice (?), he did again concede 71 memory. They then passed on to oral improvisation. One of the company offered a model line, and al-KhwArazmi extemporized verses in praise of the qddi (Abfi Nasr) and disparagement of his opponent. When al- Hamadhani criticized his diction in these verses, and was supported by the assembly, al-KhwArazmi de- fended some of his word choices and denied having said others; but while they were still wrangling on this point, the rest of the guests arrived. These were, again in the order reported by al-Hamadhan":E Al-ra'is Abi Ja'far. This is Abfi Ja'far al-Mikall (d. 388/998), the rais of Nishapur and a member of the most distinguished family in the city. Besides monopolizing the riyfsa for a century, the MIkalls were important both as patrons of literature and as poets in their own right; socially, they apparently stood above the rest of the local Hanafi and ShAfi'! elite, and despite frequent mention of them in numer- ous sources, their legal school seems to be nowhere explicitly indicated, although they were probably Hanafis. Al-Hamadhani's Rasd'il include several let- ters to AbQ Ja'far, as well as others to his cousin the ra is AbQ Nasr Ahmad b. 'All, and there are pane- gyrics of AbQ Ja'far in his Diwfin as well.73 Al-qddi AbQ Bakr al-Hirl. He was a ShAfi'! with Ash'arite connections, and lived 325-421/936-1030. He was the only other ShAfi' besides AbQ 'cUmar al-BastAml to hold the qaddk' of Nishapur in the fourth/tenth and fifth/ eleventh centuries, although his tenure in the office cannot be precisely dated. Al-HamadhAnl later quarrelled with him, as we know 69 Al-HamadhAni, Rasd'il, 63f. 70 Al-HamadhAni, Rasd'il, 64-66. Al-HamadhAni was at this time (383/993, according to Ibn Funduq) twenty-five; al-Khwarazm! was sixty. 7' Al-HamadhAni, Ras6'il, 66f. I am not sure how to interpret al-HamadhAni's challenge to al-Khwarazmi to "recite to us from your side fifty lines twice, so that I may then recite to you twenty verses from my side twenty times." According to several sources, al-Khwarazmi was in fact particularly famous for his powers of memory; see, e.g., al-Hakim apud al-Safadi, al- Wfifi bi-l- Wafayct, III (Damas- cus, 1953), 192, and the well-known story in Ibn Khallikan (IV, 401) according to which al-Khwarazmi came to the SAhib's court (at Arrajan) and, when told that an adib could not be admitted unless he had memorized 20,000 verses from the poetry of the Arabs (shicr al-'arab), asked whether they should be verses by men or verses by women-at which point the Sahib said, "This must be Abi Bakr al-Khwarazmi!"5 and admitted him. 72 Al-HamadhAni, Rasc 9il, 67-69; Yaquit, Mu'jam al- udabd9, II, 180. 73 Abu Ja'far Muhammad b.

According to al-Sam'ani, Abu Ja'far was a pupil of the Hanafi QAdi 1-Haramayn (Abu 1-Husayn Ahmad b. Muhammad, d. 351/962), which would suggest that he was a Hanafi, although he and his entire family studied hadith with both Hanafis and Shafi'is.

Ahmad.74 Al-shaykh Abi Zakariyya'. This is the form of the name given by Yaqit. The Rasfi9il have Abi Zakar- iyya' al-Hirl, reading for the previous name Ab&amp; Bakr al-Harbi instead of al-Hirl. I have found no Abi Bakr al-Harbi, and no Abf ZakariyyA' al-Hiri. Abi Bakr al-Hiri is well known, and perhaps we should read here Abi ZakariyyA' al-Harbi. In fact, al-Farisi mentions an Abfi ZakariyyA' YahyA b. Isma'il b. YahyA b. ZakariyyA' b. Harb, a rich man who died in 394/1004; his legal school is not given." A group of worthy men, and a number of scoundrels, including Abi Rashid al-mutakallim. This is presum- ably the well-known Mu'tazilite Sa'id b. Muhammad b. Sa'id al-NaysAbfirl. Al-HamadhAni comments that his presence protected the meeting against the jinx that comes with anything too perfect ('ayn al-kamail).7" With these arrivals the party was complete, and Abu Ja'far took his place at the sadr. Putting aside the previous dispute over oral improvisation, he proposed instead a contest in extemporaneous written composi- tion. Al-HamadhAni reproduces the panegyric of the ra'is which he composed, but dismisses al-Khwarazmi's composition as doggerel without quoting it. Al- Khwarazml lost further ground through ill-founded and easily refuted criticisms of al-Hamadhani's verses, and the assembly gave the latter the palm in badiha. Next came epistolography. Anxious to show off his virtuosity, al-HamadhAni proposed such tests as com- posing a letter whose response was the same text read backwards, or a letter entirely devoid of the definite article, or a letter which when read diagonally yielded verses. Al-Khwarazmi dismissed all this as verbal jugglery (shacbadha), and insisted on competing in conventional tarassul. One of the company threw out a topic debased coinage, slow trade, shortages, and high prices and al-Khwarazmi produced a conven- tional letter; al-Hamadhani, however, composed his backwards, beginning with its final word and ending with its first, and again was declared winner. For the next subject, lexicon (lugha), each of the contestants proposed a chapter from a standard lexico- graphical work for the other to recite from memory. Al-Hamadhani also won this contest handily. Al- Khwarazmi's further inability to reel off the requisite details in the next subject, prosody, completed the rout, and the party began to break up. Al-Khwarazmi suffered a fainting spell-which he claimed was due to the heat-and then the rivals joined the elite members of the audience (not further identified) for a meal, at which they again engaged in name calling, this time with alliteration. When al-Hamadhani finally made his departure from the hall, according to his own account, he was received by a mixed group of people (apparently the general public who had witnessed the debate) with cheers and kisses; al-Khwarazmi, how- ever, refused to come out until night had fallen, when he could slip away unobserved.77 Ibn Funduq, paraphrasing al-HamadhAni, substi- tutes for his "mixed group of people" the "ashdb al-AShfici," and whether he has concrete evidence for this identification or is merely drawing inferences from internal indications as is in fact being done here there seems little doubt that Shafi'i solidarity contributed appreciably to al-Hamadhani's victory. The Shicite presence at the debate is problematical, and named Shafi'is in attendance outnumber named Hanafis. Of the latter, al-HamadhAni insulted the Mu'tazilite Abf Rashid in his account of the meeting, and attacked the Mu'tazilite qddi Abf Nasr elsewhere, once in a letter to him rebuking him for not standing up when al-Hamadhani entered a room, and again, with a sideswipe (istitrcd), in a hijcd attacking someone else for the same discourtesy:78 I came in upon that emissary-worthless, Boorish, ignorant and stupid- I swear, if he were a penis, He would belong to Abi Nasr b. Sahl! It is true that the Hanafi and future qddi Abf 1-Haytham escapes unscathed, and that al-Hamadhani violently attacked the Shafi'i qdidI al-Hiri in a letter to the Hanafi qdid Abf l-Qatsim 'Ali b. Ahmad (who was apparently absent from the debate)-although at 74 AbQ Bakr Ahmad b. al-Hasan al-Hiri al-Harashi: Bulliet, Patricians, 93-99; al-FArisi, second MS, fol. 22ab; al-Sam'ani, IV 122-24, 327f.; al-Subki, IV, 6-7.

Judging from these two incidents, as well as al-Hamadhani's reaction to his first introduction to AbQ Bakr al-Khwarazmi, he seems to have been particularly sensitive about how he was received in company.</page><page sequence="15">ROWSON: Religion and Politics in the Career of Badi al-Zamin al-Hamadhtini 667 another time he was willing to compose a qasida for al-Hiri as a reply to a panegyric sent him from the son of the qadd of Herat.9 But one need not expect evidence of total hostility to the Hanafis in order to claim ShAfi'! bias; and in fact al-Hamadhani seems to have reserved his hostility, not for Hanafis in general, but for Mu'tazilites, a position according with his reputed Ash'arism.80 Al-HamadhAni, Rasd'il, 162-75; Diwdn, 6f. The qadd Abfi l-Q5,sim was the son of the Qadi 1-Haramayn, and died in 402/1011 (al-Farisl, first MS, fol. 1 lOb, and second MS, fol. 61a). It seems impossible to establish a satisfactory chron- ology of the qddis of Nishapur from the meager information offered by our sources, despite valiant attempts by Bulliet (Patricians, 256-59) and Halm (Ausbreitung, 67-70). If we consider only the Hanafl holders of the office, there are few problems, despite a dearth of dates. After the death of the Qadl 1-Haramayn in 351/962, we must fit in Abfi cAll al-Hasan al-Bayhaqi (d. 359/970), Abfi I-Qasim al-Bahill (d. 378/988), and Abfi Nasr b. Sahl (d. 388/998, and given the title al-qddi by al-Hamadhani at the debate in 383/993), as well as the QAdi 1-Haramayn's son Abi l-Qasim (d. 402/1012, not present at the debate). Al-Farisi's statement (first MS, fol. 61a) that the latter served after his father does not necessarily imply immediate succession, but his further assertion that Abfi I-Qasim was in turn replaced by (cuzila bi-) Abf1 l-'Alad' SA'id does. Abf1 l-'Alad' (who also did not attend the debate) was appointed in 377/987, and was replaced in 392/1002 by his teacher AbCi 1-Haytham (present at the debate but called only al-faqih by al-Hamadhani) (al-Farisl, first MS, fols. 86a- 87a, second MS, fol. 117a). The difficulty comes in fitting the two Shafi'l qddis, Abti Bakr al-Hiri and Abi 'cUmar al-Bastami, into the succession. Al-Farisi (second MS, fol. 2a) dates AbCi 'Umar's appointment to 388/998 (al-Hamadhani calls him simply al-shaykh at the debate), and Bulliet con- siders this a brief, politically dictated intrusion into the tenure of Abfi l-'Alad'; Halm suggests that Abfi 'Umar may have been a deputy (nadib). For Abfi Bakr (whom al- Hamadhani calls al-qddi) we have no dates, and Bulliet would put his tenure before that of Abui l-'Alad', sometime during AbQ I-Hasan al-Simjfiri's first governorship of Khurasan. Yet al-Hamadhani's letter, certainly written no earlier than 382/992, the date of his arrival in Nishapur, makes it clear that al-Hiri was acting as qddi at the time, while the son of the Qadi 1-Haramayn, to whom the letter is addressed, may well have been "emeritus." Al-Hamadhani's complaint, as eventually emerges in the letter, is about rental of a garden, in which he claims to have been cheated out of five thousand dirhams; but what is interesting in this context is the letter's opening paragraph: When injustice comes-may God prolong the qddi's life!-from the majlis al-qada', the only higher author- ity to which to appeal is the lord of the qddis (lam tarqa illd ilh sayyid al-quddh)-I would not restrict his lordship only to the judges (hukkam), rather than all mankind, were it not that (the judges) are associ- ated with him (ittisdluhum bi-sababihi) and share his title (ittisdmuhum bi-laqabihi). They, the qadds, are marked with his brand (ittasama bi-simatihi), cadging on his portion (mutataffilin 'ala qismatihi). Can their hides compare with his in soundness, their nobility with his in venerability, or their new-found mun- ificence with his established pattern? So let them enjoy the names (asmfi) and him the meanings (ma'cni)! They can continue to have the appearances (zawdhir), while he retains the essence (jawdhir)! It is not remarkable that they should be called "qddis": not every liquid is water, nor every roof a sky, nor every life that of the two 'Umars [AbQ Bakr and 'Umar], nor every qddi the QAdi l-Haramayn [father of the addressee]. Vengeance for the qa~dd'! How cheaply has it been sold, and how quickly lost! Base men have been clothed with it before the emptying of the lands and death of excellent men (would necessitate that) . . . One has been appointed to the qadd' who possesses none of its instruments except a beard, and knows none of its procedures except isolated eccentric opinion ... I cannot solve the riddle posed by this letter, and the fact that al-Sam'ani, while making Abfi cUmar al-BastAmi qddi of Nishapur in 388 (II, 232), also calls AbQ Bakr al-Hril the last Shafici qddi of Nishapur (IV, 123), suggests that some of our information is simply wrong. Could Abfi cAli al-Simjfiri have appointed Abfi Bakr qddi during the period when he was in rebellion against his SamAnid overlord (at the time of, and briefly after, the debate), and AbQ l-cAla' Sacid been subsequently reinstated by Mahmfid of Ghazna? If Abfi Bakr's appointment was irregular in some such way, al- Subki's remarks (III, 59) on the general rejoicing over the later appointment of AbQ cUmar (by Mahmud) make more sense. 80 Cf., for example, the line (Diwdn, 73) (A girl) with eyes which are weak (i.e., languid, dacufa t) Like the madhhab of the Muctazila. It is also the SAhib's Muctazilism which al-Hamadhani has in mind in the following line (Diwdn, 59; al-Thacalibi, Yatima, IV, 300): A night like its memory, like its meaning, like its name (i.e., black), Like the religion (din) of Ibn cAbbad, like the rout of Fa'iq.</page><page sequence="16">668 Journal of the American Oriental Society 107.4 (1987) All this is not to deny that al-Hamadhani's dazzling virtuosity did in fact overshadow al-KhwArazmi's more conventional talents (and the latter's age may have impeded the quickness and sharpness of memory which he needed above all in such a situation). The above summary of their debate hardly does justice to its literary merits; but a full translation of al-Hamadhani's very long account (fifty-six pages in the glossed 1890 edition of the Rasd'il) would have helped little in this respect, as the verbal pyrotechnics which were of the essence are precisely what a translation cannot convey. Furthermore, a public debate of this sort, with its emphasis on extemporaneous invention, was not ex- pected to produce the finest work of which a lit- terateur was capable, and if the impression given here is one of value accorded to cleverness at the expense of beauty, there are greater beauties to be found elsewhere in the works of both men. Before leaving the debate, we may note a few members of the elite who were not present (assuming that they were too eminent for al-Hamadhani not to have named them had they attended it). It is not remarkable that the governor of Khurasan, Abfi 'Ali al-Simjfirl, did not attend; he was out of Nishapur more often than not for military reasons (at this time he was in the process of raising a rebellion against his SamAnid overlord, which two years later was to end in his defeat), and his position was in any case more a "federal" than a local one, so that his concern for local cultural affairs was perhaps somewhat limited.' Rather more surprising is the absence, on the Hanafi side, of the qadd Abfi I-Qasim 'All b. Ahmad (d. 402/1011), and on the Shafi'c side, of al-Hakim Ibn al-Bayyi' (d. 405/1014), the author of the Ta'rikh Naysi bar. Also missing, presumably, was the Karrami leader Abfi Bakr Ibn Mahmashadh, whose day of glory was yet to come, when he was raised to the riyisa and initiated a Shicite persecution, and whom al-Hamadhani begged in a letter to maintain the 82 peace. But the most unexpected absence is that of the Hanafi qddi Abfi l-'Ala' Sa'id b. Muhammad (343- 431/954-1040),83 the man who had excused himself to the caliph in Baghdad for forbidding the refurbish- ment of the tomb of Harfin al-Rashid. In addition to learning fiqh from the qadds Abfi Nasr b. Sahl (according to some sources, his maternal grandfather) and Abfi I-Haytham, Abfi l-'Ala' had in his youth studied adab with Abfi Bakr al-Khwarazml, and would seem to have been the latter's natural ally; yet al- Hamadhani could hardly have failed to record his presence at the debate if he had been there. So perhaps the house was even more stacked in al- Hamadhani's favor than at first appears. V. THE AFTERMATH OF THE DEBATE According to al-Tha'alibi and later authors, Abf Bakr al-Khwarazml went into a decline after the humiliation of the debate, and was dead within the year. In the meantime, however, his problems with al-Hamadhani were not entirely over, as is clear from (This line comes from a panegyric of Khalaf b. Ahmad, the amir of Sijistan, and was written shortly after the debate. The most recent of the eunuch Fad'iq's defeats-of which there were many-was at that time either one by the SAmanid al-Radi the previous year, or one which he shared with his new ally AbQ 'All al-Slmjfuri in RamadAn 383; see al-'Utbi, I, 178, 189.) Al-Hamadhani's sentiments towards the Sahib may be contrasted with those of AbQ Bakr al-Khwarazml, who described him in a panegyric (al-Thacalibi, Yatima, IV, 214) as One whose deeds support Unity and Justice (i.e., Muctazilism) And whose fine qualities awake the sleeping heights of honor. On anti-Mu'tazilism in al-HamadhAni's testament, see also below. The violent (and of course elegant) diatribe against the Muctazila put in the mouth of a madman in Basra in al-Maqdma al-MWristdniyya (al-Hamadhand, Maqamat [Beirut, 1889], 119-25) should certainly, pace Monroe (74f.), be taken as expressing the author's own sentiments. 81 But not non-existent: see the paean of his concern for learning in the introduction to al-Husayn b. IbrAhim al- NAtill's revision of the Arabic translation of Dioscorides' Materia Medica, commissioned by AbQ 'All and completed in Samarqand in RamadAn 380/990 (M. M. Sadek, "Notes on the Introduction and Colophon of the Leiden Manuscript of Dioscorides' 'De Materia Medica'," International Journal of Middle East Studies 10 [1979], 345-54). 82 Abfi Bakr Muhammad b.

Writing to an anonymous correspondent, for example, al- HamadhAni responded to al-KhwArazmi's criticism of his Maqacmct by attacking his verses, in a short letter which may be quoted in full as an example of al- Hamadhani's epistolary style: You have asked-may God give you a long and pleasant life-about al-Khwarazmi and his poetry. My response is that I find one verse so touching that if it were seen in a dream it would require the major ablution, followed immediately by another (so bad that) its very touch when read out would destroy one's ritual purity. By my life! if these two verses (baytayn) were two figs (tinayn-same ductus), they would not grow in the same ground, and if they were two dates, they would not be gathered from the same branch! As it is, it is hard to believe that they are two verses springing (yasdurd) from the same breast (sadr), produced (yutbafi) by the same talent (tab'), poured from the mold of the same heart (qdlab qaib), or carried by the breath of the same soul (nafasay nafs). A poet may be sometimes fat and sometimes thin, and a speaker may speak well and then badly-but not like what one sees in the poetry of Abfi Bakr! But I would not have revealed these secrets, torn aside these veils, and pointed out his shame (',ir) and defect (`awfr) were it not for reports reaching me of his objections to what I have dictated, and his ready criticism of what I have recited, of the maqdmdt of al-Iskandari, saying that this is all I can do and the most I can achieve. If this worthy man were more just, he would test his own talents on five maqfimdt, or ten lying fictions (muftarayfit), and then present them to men's ears and hearts, and display them before their eyes and minds. If they then received and accepted them, rather than rejecting and attacking them, he could object and criticize us and our dicta- tion, inflicting as many wounds as he liked; but if his effort was unsuccessful and his limitations became apparent, he would then acknowledge that someone who can dictate four hundred maqdmfit on beggary, no two of them alike in either form or content, while he is himself incapable of producing even a tenth of them, has every right to expose his faults!84 In another letter, addressed to Abfi l-Tayyib al- Suulfik! from Sarakhs, where al-Hamadhani had apparently been cordially received by the governor Abfi 'Ali al-SimjuMr, he complained that al-Khwarazm! was even then still claiming victory over him, and declared that if he was so foolish as to desire yet another rematch he had his shoe ready (with which to beat him). He then launched into an elaborate disquisi- tion on the differences between himself and al- KhwArazmi, in origin, complexion, habits, and every other way, including that "he claims to be a Talibi, and accuses me of being a NAsibl; but God curse the lesser of us in devotion to the Noble House, and the greater of us in hostility to the truth."85 A NAsibi was someone who declared his hostility to 'All b. abi Talib, as his opposite number, a Rafidl, was a Shicite who rejected the Sunni caliphs Abfi Bakr and 'Umar; at this period the two terms were the usual pejoratives directed by Shicis and Sunnis against each other. Al-Hamadhani in fact defended himself against the epithet "Nasibi" in a qasida preserved in his Diwain,86 which begins: They say to me, "You do not love the Wasi ['Ali];" But I say, "Dust in the mouth of the liar!" I love the Prophet and the Prophet's family, And most of all the clan of Abf Talib. I render the Companions the devotion they are due, And I follow the prescribed way (sanan). If devotion to all of these is nasb, Then I am, as they claim, a Nisibi; And if devotion to the Wasl is rafd, Then may I never cease to be a Rafidite! The sectarian aspect of al-Hamadhani's quarrel with al-KhwArazml is even more explicit in an urrjuza, preserved in Yaqfit, which he wrote in praise of the 84 Al-HamadhAni, Rasd'il, 389f. This early reference by al-HamadhAni to his Maqfimdt is in harmony with the account in al-Thacalibi (Yatima, IV, 257), who mentions his composition of "four hundred maqdmfit on beggary attri- buted to Abi 1-Fath al-Iskandari" after his arrival in Nish- apur but before his debate with al-KhwArazml. Recent scho- lars are surely right in refusing to take the number four hundred too seriously, and it is to be noted that of the fifty- two maqtimit we have, at least the six in which Khalaf b. Ahmad, the amir of Sijistan, is praised must be posterior in date to these references. Al-HamadhAni repeats his challenge, to another opponent, in a later letter as well (Rasdfil, 516). 85 Al-Hamadhani, Rasfiil, 194-206. Abfi 'Ali stopped in Sarakhs on his way to obey a summons from his Samanid lord for assistance against the Karakhanids, who had tem- porarily taken Bukhara; he was, however, playing a double game, and never made it further than Marw (al-'Utbi, I, 171-75). 86 Al-Hamadhani, Diwdn, 8.</page><page sequence="18">670 Journal of the American Oriental Society 107.4 (1987) Companions, in response to a poem attacking them by the Rafidite al-Khwarazmi.87 It begins: I am grieved and anxious, because of a venomous cursing slanderer Of the Pious Ancestors and the Companions: evil hear, evil say! Have a mind, great men of the Shl'a, to the com- munity of Islam and the sharica: Is this the kind of slander permitted even against the infidels or the churchgoers? How then against one who was true to (saddaqa) the Prophet's mission and supported the religion in every way, And for whom God saved us his reward? Surely he was the True Ore (al-Siddiq: the caliph Abfi Bakr)! A long panegyric of Abfi Bakr follows, in which al-Hamadhani stresses 'All's devotion to him; he then turns his sights on al-Khwarazmi, calls him a dog and a catamite, and avers: The Commander of the Faithful, the Well-Approved (al-Murtahdc-'All), and Ja'far al-SAdiq, or Mfisa 1-Rida- If they could hear your foui slurs, they would not hold back from you their unsheathed swords. Al-Hamadhani then praises 'Umar, defends 'Uthman and 'A'isha against al-Khwarazml's attacks, and ends his poem with scabrous abuse of his opponent. Al-Hamadhani's hostility to Abfi Bakr al-Khwar- azmi was not, however, boundless, and his Rasd'il also include a shaming rebuke of someone who had written him to congratulate him on al-Khwarazmi's illness, in which he protested his respect for al-Khwarazmi de- spite all their differences.89 Then, when al-Khwarazmi died, al-HamadhAni elegized him in verses lamenting the bad feeling between them , and playing on the proverb "The field is clear, (birds,) so (feel free to) lay eggs and chirp!": They say, "You must be pleased at his death!" But I say, "Dust in the mouth of one so pleased! His enmity grieved me, but what is past cannot be mended." And people say, "The field is clear!" So it is, by my life!, but only for misery; I can lay eggs, but only sterile ones, and I can chirp, but only to one who will not answer.9 VI. AL-HAMADHANI S LATER CAREER Abfi Bakr al-Khwarazmi died in late 383/993, at just the time the rebellious Abfi 'All al-Simjfirl was losing his first battle to the Samanid defender Sebuk- tegin and his son Mahmfid.91 Mahmfid then replaced the rebel as Commander of the Samanid armies, and Nishapur changed hands between the two several times in the next two years, before Abfi 'All was deci- sively defeated and Mahmfid's power in Khurasan firmly consolidated.92 The following decade witnessed the crumbling of the Samanid dynasty, whose lands were divided between the Karakhanids in Transoxania and Mahmfid in Khurasan, with his capital at Ghazna. The numerous semi-independent dynasties on the fringes of Khurasan, in Sijistan, Gharchistan, and elsewhere, mostly survived for a few years, before being absorbed into Mahmfid's Ghaznavid empire; and Qabfis b. Vushmgir, after an exile lasting eighteen years, regained his throne in Jurjan.93 His fame now established, and "the field clear," al-Hamadhani spent much of this period travelling widely in Khurasan, Sijistan, and Ghazna, enjoying the patronage of "every king, amir, wazir, and ra9fs," according to al-Tha'alibl.94 It is impossible, and hardly 87 Yaqfit, Mucjam al-udabd', II, 196-200. 88 Ja'far al-Sadiq was the sixth Imam of the Imamiyya; the seventh and eighth were Mfisa 1-Kazim and 'All al-Rida. I know of no "MWisa l-Rid.a." Constraints of meter and rhyme preclude any simply emendation here; whether a flaunted ignorance of the names of the Shi'ite Imams was al- Hamadhani's intention I cannot say. 89 Al-Hamadhani, Rasf'il, 186f. 90 Al-Hamadhani, Diwfn, 12; al-Tha'Alibi, Yatima, IV, 209. On the proverb, see al-Maydani, Majma' al-amthfl (Cairo, 1342), I, 219. Al-Tha'alibi states that this elegy included yet another slander of al-Khwarazmi; perhaps the reference is to the line I have been burdened with as much sadness for you As your son has been burdened with cash (? smit) -if this is what the line in fact means. 9' Al-Khwarazmi died in Shawwal (al-Tha'alibi, Yatima, IV, 209) or Ramadan (Ibn Khallikan, IV, 402) of 383; Abci 'Ali was defeated at the Battle of Farwana in Ramadan 383 (al-'Utbi, I, 189). 92 Al-'Utbi, I, 189-220. 93 On Qabfis's restoration to Jurjan in 388/998, see al-'Utbi, I, 389-97. 94 Al-Thacalibi, Yatima, IV, 258.</page><page sequence="19">RowSON: Religion and Politics in the Career of Badi' al-Zamdn al-Hamadhdnf 671 necessary, to trace these travels in sequence, but from al-Hamadhani's letters and poems we can identify some of his patrons. He addressed several panegyrics to the amir Abfi 'All al-Simjfrli before his fall,95 and years later praised the sultan Mahmfid in Ghazna;96 he also addressed both letters and panegyrics to the amirs Abfi I-Harith al-Farlighfin! in Juzjan,97 Qabfis b. Vushmgir in Jurjan (after his restoration),98 and Khalaf b. Ahmad (who is praised in six of the Ma- qdimct as well) in Sijistan." All these rulers were Sunnis, Mahmfid fanatically so. Qabfis, whom al- Hamadhani may well have known in Nishapur before his restoration to Jurjan, was celebrated for his prose style, and his Rasacil include a clearly anti-Rafidite epistle on the first four caliphs, in which Abfi Bakr and 'Umar are praised, 'Uthman condemned, and 'All treated neutrally.'00 Of identifiable wazirs, aside from early panegyrics to the Sahib in Rayy, al-Hamadhani addressed pan- egyrics to the Samanid wazir Ibn abi Zayd (assas- sinated 386/996),101 and corresponded with Mahmfid's first wazir Abf l-'Abbas al-Isfarayini (d. 404/1014); in a letter addressed to the latter from Herat, he con- gratulated Mahmfid on his victory over the Kara- khanids, declaring it a victory "which has preserved the splendor of the sharlca and the life of the sunna," and calling Herat "the particular supporter of this dynasty" (shl'at hddhihi l-dawla)-and then asking for tax relief for the city.'02 Amirs and wazirs represented the "federal" and most prestigious level of al-Hamadhani's celebrity, but he did not ignore the local notables, especially in the Nishapur area, which he continued to revisit throughout his life. Besides letters to the ra'is AbQ Ja'far al-Mikall'03 and his cousin the ra9is Abfi Nasr, 104 we may note especially his poems to the Husaynid Abf Ja'far al-Tfisi, who built a palace in Nishapur which the poets competed in describing; one of al-Hamadhani's panegyrics of him begins: Despite my belief in Sunnism (ictiqadi lil-tasannun) I am a Rafidite in my devotion to you. Commenting on this verse as quoted by the historian al-'Utbi in the Ta'rikh al- Yamini, al-Manini cites the following line attributed to al-Shaficl himself: If love for the family of Muhammad is raft, Then let men and jinn bear witness that I am a RAfidite.'05 Passages from two of al-Hamadhani's letters to Nishapuri notables have been cited by James Monroe as evidence for his Shl'ism. In one of them, a letter of condolence, al-Hamadhan! says (Monroe's transla- tion): "May God be content with His deposit, and with us, the group of His Shl'a.''l06 But just before this passage al-Hamadhani has said that he has lost his heart and liver at the deceased's grave (rams), and it is to the latter and its occupant that the pronouns refer: "May God be content with its deposit, and with us, the group of his [the departed's] shica." Further- more, the letter is in fact addressed to al-ustddh Abf Bakr Muhammad b. Ishaq, who was none other than Ibn Mahmashadh, the leader of the Karramiyya in Nishapur and violent enemy of the Shicites.107 It 9 Al-Hamadhani, Diwdn, 4-6 (cf. al-cUtbi, I, 157-62), 15 (cf. al-Thac'Alibl, Yatima, IV, 294), 29f., 41f. 96 Diwdn, 78f.

I would suggest: I had some requests to make (of you) in the days of the tashayyu'; but when the exalted order came to me to return, these requests remained unexpressed. These requests, now expressed, concern a protege of al-Hamadhani's who was en route from Herat to Nishapur, and a legal case involving the deputy of the ShAfici qadi Abfi 'Umar al-BastAmi, although the rhetorical style of the letter and the lack of a context in which to place it make it impossible to be more precise. The "exalted order" was very likely a summons from a patron, ordering al-Hamadhani back to his adopted home in Herat after a visit to Nishapur; the "tashayyu"' may refer generally to factionalism in Nishapur, or perhaps specifically to Shl'ite distur- bances there, but certainly does not mean "when I was a Shl'ite."' Al-HamadhAni's patron in Herat may have been the ra'is, Abfi 'Amir 'Adnan b. Muhammad al-Dabbi, to whom he addressed numerous panegyrics and epistles.110 One of the latter, probably written late in al-Hamadhani's life, is of particular interest here."'1 Al-Hamadhani reports with alarm that a friend of his has heard in the market in Herat a boy declaiming that Muhammad and 'Ali cursed Taym and 'Adi (the clans of Abuf Bakr and 'Umar); fearing for Herat, he complains that this "kalima," that is, Rafidism, ruins any town it enters: Nishapur is in economic straits, and suffers riots once or twice a year, and Quhistan is given over to fighting and rapine. Satan will not seize Herat all at once: Look at Kufa, whose boundaries were traced by the Commander of the Faithful 'Umar b. al-Khattab (may God be pleased with him!). Rejection (of Abfi Bakr and 'Umar: rafd) did not appear there suddenly, nor did irreligion (ilhdd) descend with one blow. The beginning was lamentation over al-Husayn b. 'Ali (may God be pleased with the two of them!), which no one would object to. Then they took up Mu'awiya: some abominated him, others were more tolerant. Then they went on to 'Uthman, and were instinctively repelled and turned their ears away. That generation passed away amidst the clash of battle, and they were followed by another, which did not observe the limits in this matter, and whose ripened abuse reached to the two shaykhs (may God be pleased with them!). See what a brand was kindled then! The letter ends with imprecations against the Rafidites and a plea that the ra'is see to the protection of Herat from this Satanic invasion. It is unknown when al-HamadhAni settled in Herat, but al-Tha' alibi informs us that he married the daughter of Abfi 'Ali al-Husayn b. Muhammad al- Khushnami, a local dihqan there, and with his help acquired rich estates in the neighborhood.112 This man, whose legal school is unknown, had been a trusted associate of Abfi 'Ali al-Simjufri, probably from the days when the latter had been governor of Herat, before succeeding his father to the governor- ship of Khurasan; and one might speculate that al-Hamadhani was first introduced to his future father- in-law by either al-Simjfiri or the Shafi'l community in Nishapur.113 Al-Hamadhani died in Herat in 398/1008, barely forty years old. Appended to his collected Rasa'il is the text of his will, which includes a conventional Sunni profession of faith, with particular emphasis on the punishment of the tomb (denied by the Mu'taz- ilites), and the stipulation that he be prayed over by 108 The word is ambiguous in any case, and al-HamadhAni does use it on occasion to refer to the Shi'a, as in his reference (in a letter to Abfi Ja'far al-Tfisi, an 'Alid) to "the imfm claimed by the Shi'a and denied by the shari'a' (Rasfi'il, 411; al-Tha'alibi, Yatima, IV, 270). 109 Monroe, 54; Rasf'il, 122-25: wa-kanat fi nafsi hdjatun ictamadtu bNhW ayydm al-tashayyu'fa-lammfi talaqqfini l-amr al-'fcli bil-ruji' baqiyat hfijatifi nafsi. 110 Diwin, 46f., 81; Rasf'il, 177-81, 212-14, 279-86, 412- 14, 421-28, 429-31.

His fame rests on his amazing command of language, on his ability to turn prose into music, and, especially, on his happy invention of a genre especially suited to show off his talents, the maqama. His Sunnism, Shafi'ism, and perhaps Ash'arism affected, not his writing, but his career. Leaving the Shl'ite Bfyid domains in his youth, never to return, he headed for the more congenial atmosphere of the staunchly Sunni East, where his ShAfi'ism, as well as his talent, assured him of a welcome among the elite of Jurjan and Nishapur. The opportunity to enlist the latter against the celebrated, venerable, but (to them) unfortunately Shl'ite Abfi Bakr al-Khwarazml must have been a godsend; and after this signal victory his Shafi'i elite connections continued to serve him well, in a spec- tacular, if lamentably short, career. 114 Al-HamadhAni, Rasd'il, 534-37.</page></plain_text>
