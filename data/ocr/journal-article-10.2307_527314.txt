<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON THE ANALYSIS OF GENESIS I,-XXXI,* BY BENJAMIN W. BACON, Oswego, N. Y. In the so-called Urgeschichte, Gen. I.-xnii., the analysis of Budde,t if taken with a grain of salt derived from Kuenen,t seems to the present writer on the whole a true one. If the poetic structure discovered by Prof. Briggs8 in Gen. I. really exists, this lends additional force to the argument that this chapter, in other respects so strongly contrasting with the usual style of P, was not original with him, but worked over and incorporated from J2. For elsewhere in the priestly document there is not one trace of poetry discoverable, either in thought or struc- ture. A further bit of evidence in favor of Budde's J2 (considered by him to have employed Elohim previous to Gen. iv. 26--cf. ver. 25) may be derived from Deut. Iv. 32 sqq., where indeed Elohim in 33 sq. may be accounted for by translating a God; but not in ver. 32. Here the most probable explanation to my mind, in view of the general practice of D), is a retained peculiarity of the source, and so also in 33 sq. There being absolutely no trace of P in D, this reference may accordingly be taken as evidence for an underlying elohistic J2 in Gen. I.Il In Gen. vI. 4 I regard the first two clauses 3-,N .... D*~; " as due to supplementary redaction in place of a simple, 3 tl , an interpolation intended to explain the Nephilim of Num. xiii. 33. But the original writer was not giving an aetiology of Nephilim, but of Gibborim, for the identifying of whom with the Nephilim there is not only no evidence, but ver. 4b indicates them to have been quite a different class from the Nephilim, and by no means necessarily of gigantic stature. Cf. x. 8 sqq. with Num. xm. 33. In the latter passage the Nephilim appear to be E's parallel to J's beni-Anak of vs. 22,32. At least there can be no certainty that any mention of Nephilim occurs in J, and the superfluity if not the disagreement of this clause with the latter part of the verse, together with the extreme awkwardness of its position, seem to be against it. When J relates the birth of a person or class of persons of importance he says, "- took to wife - and went in unto - and she (they) bare a child (children) unto him" (them), and then proceeds to tell what became of the child * A series of sketches preliminary to the author's new analysis of Gen.

Iv. 1,25; xxxvIII. 2 sq., etc. He does not interrupt or antici- pate this natural order by inserting in advance what the child is going to be after it is born, nor other information which has nothing to do with the story of the birth, but tells his story connectedly. Read now vI. 1-4 as the aetiology of the Gibborim, of whom Nimrod is one mentioned later, and omit ver. 3 (according to Budde displaced from after IIn. 21), and the disturbing clauses at the beginning of ver. 4, inserting a simple 1 after "?, or "9 t , and we have just what J uniformly writes in such cases: "The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose. And the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children unto them; the same were the Gibborimr which were of old, the men of renown." Kautzsch and Socin* call attention to the fact that x. lb is probably from J2 and argue thence that Ix. 18sq. = R. Insert, however, x. lb between ix. 19a and 19b and there is no occasion for rejecting anything but 18b. From vs. 8,13,15 it may perhaps be inferred that in J2 the sons of Ham were a triad, Cush, Mizraim, and Canaan. For the analysis of ch. xv. see HEBRAICA, VII. 1. Chapters xx.-xxII. are admitted by all critics to have undergone harmonistic treatment by JE only less severe than that of ch. xv. where E's narrative is first introduced. Omissions occur not only after xx. 2 (cf. vs. 6b,17 sq), but in ch. xxI. the substance of xxvi. 12-25 (J) has fallen out between vs. 21 and 22, as appears from ver. 25. The aetiology of Beersheba is retained, perhaps because it differs in its etymology from that of ch. xxvi. It has repeatedly been remarked, however, that portions of the last verses (32b,33) do not fit this narrative. Yah- weh, ver. 33, might be explained as a scribal alteration. Not so, however, 32b, which assumes that Beersheba is not in the land of the Philistines, but that Abimelech and Phicol have come away from their own land. This is in accord with xxvI. 26 sq., but not with xx. 15; xxI. 22 sq. and 34. The subject of the verbs in ver. 33 is also curiously wanting. But to attribute 32b sq. to R is a mere subterfuge; there is no motive for interpolation. To the above objections to 32b, 33 in their present position I will add that 31 and 32a are equally inappropriate. The etymology led up to in vs. 28-30 is based upon yt:l in the sense of "' seven." Abraham obtains the well for "value received," and in token hereof should name it "Well of the Seven," otherwise the "seven " lambs are not the "witness" they are intended to be (ver. 30). If now we are suddenly put on another track, and find that the well was not called the well of the seven but "the Well of the Oath, * Die Genesis, p. 17, notes 28 and 30.</page><page sequence="3">224 HEBRAICA. because there they sware both of them," it leaves the expected etymology from Yg? "seven" hanging in mid-air. Ver. 32a again is here a mere repeti- tion of ver. 27, which does not need to be repeated, because in 28 sqq. we have passed on to a new theme. Finally the form of ver. 31 is decidedly characteristic of J. The remedy for all this is a simple transposition of vs. 31-33 into the place of xxvI. 33, and of xxvI. 33 into this place. The missing subject of ver. 33 is therefore Isaac; the play upon "sware," ver. 31, finds its necessary antecedent in xxvi. 31; the returning into the land of the Philis uines finds its condition prece- dent in xxvI. 26; the "' calling on the niame of Yahlwell;" ver. 33, and the p- p ')I, ver. 31, find their explanation in the fact that these verses are taken from the J version of the Beersheba-saga. On the other hand xxvI. 33 correspondingly fits, both in style and content, with equal exactness between xxi. 30 and 34. With regard to ch. xxiI. I have only possibilities to suggest. Ver. 14 is universally acknowledged to have suffered alteration, and "Moriah," ver. 2, is of course dependent upon the altered situation andl etymology. "Yahweh," v. 11, and the supplementary second appearance of the angel, vs. 15-18, are of course due also to the Jehovistic redactor, and furnish additional evidence of the UTmdeu- tung the whole chapter has undergone. Nevertheless it is certain that the altera- tion of ver. 14 was, as usual, only superficial; for ver. 8 leads up to a derivation from the stem 7Or") and the saying, 14b, cannot have been manufactured. Unless the redactor was unusually fortunate in finding one exactly suited to his purpose, we must suppose that he found it in the original. Again, if he had been manufacturing an etymology for Moriah" he surely would have made a better fit than Yahweh-yireh, a lucus a non lucendo which surpasses even the etymological wonders of J and E. May we not suppose that his work was mainly a mere alter- ation of Yahweh to Elohim, as elsewhere (cf. ver. 11), so that the saying, 14b, was originally of E's well-known Mounrt of God where "he is seen " by Moses and the people, Ex. III. 6; xxiv. 11; and sought, if not seen, by Elijah, I Kgs. xix. 13 (cf. Ex. II. 6).* The transformation to "Mount of Yahweh " then immediately suggested "Moriah l" (Ex. xv. 17), in place of the name of a land which must originally have stood in ver. 2. What then was this '" land" where the " mount of God " was ? Assuredly "the land of the Negeb," Gen. XXIV. 62; Num. XIII. 29. For a long time, mistaking the origin of " Moriahl" for a phonetic modifica- tion, I had sought to connect it with Moreh, xlIi. 6 (J), Judg. Vii. 1, or with "~Mr" , but met the objection that the hill of Moreh (Shechem) cannot possibly be called a "land," whereas "land of the Amorite " is too general, and "land of ilamor" very unlikely. A further objection not to be disregarded is the carrying * I suspect that the number 40 in xIx. 8 has been conformed to Ex. xxxIv. 28.</page><page sequence="4">NOTES ON THE ANALYSIS OF GENESIS I.?-XXXI. 225 of the wood. Carrying wood from Beersheba to Shechem or any part of the "hill country of the Amorites" is worse than "carrying coals to Newcastle."' Not so if Abraham journeyed southward to the " Mount of God." The graphic imagina- tion of the narrator depicts before his mind's eye the sandy, rocky, treeless wastes of the southern Negeb. Else why does he speak of the wood at all ? If he simply did not think, he simply would have kept silence. What now did Abraham, according to the original ver. 14a, "call the name of that place "'? for the characteristic form of the half verse indicates that again nothing is altered here but the mere name itself. In view of ver. 8, which assuredly leads up to an original etymology from O") , and of 14b, which with the mere alteration of Elohim to Yahweh I judge to be original, I would suggest as possible, El-roi, and that we have-or should have-here E's parallel to the etymology of J in xvrI. 13. True J is there aetiologizing on the name of the deity of a certain locality, whereas here it is the locality itself, perhaps the altar itself,* whose name is accounted for. But this is exactly the practice of E. He calls "the place" or "the pillar "' El-Bethel, or El-Elohai-lsrael (cf. xxxln.20; xxxv. 7). I venture therefore to think that E may have written in ver. 14, "So Abraham called the name of that place El-roi; as it is said to this day, In the mount of God it shall be provided."t A very important consequence of this conjecture is the implied location of Horeb near Beer-lahai-roi. A priori this would be far from an unlikely scene for E's setting of the single incident he relates of Isaac, cf. xxv. lb (J). My analy- sis of Exodus leads me to the belief that Sinai (J) and Horeb (E) are by no means identical in location, and that Horeb at least must be looked for in the Negeb. We shall understand then why Moses should "lead the flock to the further side of the wilderness" (from Cush) since he aimed at the oasis which had been the home of Isaac; and why Israel on their way to Kadesh from Egypt and Shur should come to Iloreb the mount of God, if this was "between Kadesh and Bered," "in the way to Shur," xvr. 7,14. We shall understand the seeming interchangeableness of Massah and Meribah, Kadesh, Rephidim and Horeb, in Ex. XVlI.; Num. xx., etc.; and why Amalek who "dwelt in the land of the Negeb," Num. xIII. 29, should come to attack Israel there. Abraham's three days' journey from Beer- sheba, xxII. 4, agrees also with Hagar's wandering. It disagrees entirely to be sure with I Kgs. XIx. 8. But I think there is reason to suspect the genuineness of these forty days and nights, or to doubt whether they were days and nights of travel. Further explanations and evidence will be found in my "Bibles within the * 0190l" in the pregnant sense, "the (sacred) place." + Doubtless the sense of the saying was that of the margin, R.V., "He shall be seen" (of. xvr. 13 and the conjectural reading of Well., Comp. d. Hex.); but E naturally prefers a less anthropomorphic sense and interprets as ver. 8 requires. *7</page><page sequence="5">226 HEBRAICA. Bible "' (Student Pub. Co., Hartford, Conn.), soon to appear, and in the series of articles in Journal of Bibl. Lit., x. sqq., on "JE in the Middle Books." If the present conjecture bears the weight of adverse criticism, a very welcome light will be thrown upon E's whole narrative of the Exodus; "Horeb, the mount of God," Ex. III. 1, will receive the preliminary explanation of which it now stands in so much need, and even the critic who demands as the original scene of Gen. xxIi., jedenfalls eine beriihmte Menschenopferstitte, will perhaps find satisfaction. For the analysis of ch. xxvii. see HEBRAICA, VII. 2. In my opinion Kautzsch and Socin are right in their analysis of ch. xxvii. and xxIx. 1-14. Kuenen's objections to xxviii. 13-16 = J, are not conclusive, especially if, as I conceive, this passage has been taken from its original position in the connection of xxxv. 14 and transferred hither by JE. The linguistics of ver. 14, f11~ , , n5ft~ , and the doctrinal standpoint of ver. 16, which is not of an editorial nature, but leads up to the naming, ver. 19, speak strongly for J. On the other hand, ver. 15 cannot be assigned to J as in Kautzsch and Socin, for it follows, item by item, ver. 20, which is certainly (xxxI. 13; xxxv. 3) E's. The only obstacle to understanding J's Bethel story to have occupied originally the position where the fragment xxxv. 14 still remains, is thus removed. P had then, no doubt, authority for placing his Bethel theophany after the return from Paddan-aram, and so Hos. xII. 5 [4]. The division of Kautzsch and Socin in xxix. 14 is to be preferred to Dill- mann's. Cf. Gen. II. 23. None of the analyses of JE in the latter part of chs. xxx. and xxxI. are acknowledged to be completely satisfactory, even by the analyzers themselves. I may be permitted therefore to present one which in some respects may possess advantages. In ch. xxx. vs. 32 and 33 are, as Wellhausen points out (Jahrb. f. D. Th. xxI. 428 sqq.), in flagrant contradiction to both what precedes and what fol- lows. The sense of ver. 31 is unmistakably this (cf. Dillmann, Genesiss, p. 341), "Thou shalt not give me aught now; hereafter, when certain lambs to be speci- fied are born, they shall be mine " (ver. 39 sq.). In ver. 32 Jacob proposes on the contrary to sever out the speckled and spotted now and take them (" it shall be my hire "). The sense of the last clause of ver. 32 is not to be obliterated by connect- ing it with ver. 33 (Dillmann), for the sentence produced is too awkward (cf. Kautzsch and Socin, p. 67, note 125), nor can it be assumed, with Kautzsch and Socin, that the words are merely an ancient gloss, for which there is no sufficient ground. On the contrary ver. 33 agrees exactly in conception and language with 32 (both have the phrase "speckled and spotted among the goats and black among</page><page sequence="6">NOTES ON THE ANALYSIS OF GENESIS I.-XXXI. 227 the sheep"; elsewhere different language is employed), and both agree with xxxI. 8a, which must be the ultimate determinator of what E had. Vs. 32 and 33 taken together are perfectly in order and comprehensible. Jacob takes, as xxxI. 8 says, "the speckled "; and Laban may see for himself when he comes "to-morrow" or '" in the future" that Jacob has taken none but "the speckled." This agrees neither with 31 (" thou shalt not give me aught ") nor with 35 (Laban separates the flock); but it is self-consistent and agrees with xxxI. 8. We may therefore safely regard the whole of 32 sq. as E's. Vs. 34-36 are then just as certainly J's, for here we have a different object in view in the separation, one which in all these verses is identical. Laban removes the parti-colored animals, and removes them a long distance, to prevent intercourse between the herds; quite a different matter from Jacob's mere setting apart the speckled for his own. Vs. 37 and 38a again contain Jacob's counter-move by which Laban's cunning is over-matched. He overcomes the obstacle of distance. There is not only the immediate connection of the sense to show that this passage belongs with 34-36, but its whole spirit of diamond cut diamond over-reaching on Jacob's part is con- trary to E's representation; for in E Jacob's position is that of injured innocence. God interposes on his behalf and "suffers not Laban to hurt him" (xxxi. 7), while Jacob himself is the J* p ~t of xxv. 27, "the man of simple integrity." But 38b, from ilift , "in the watering-troughs," on, is clearly E's duplicate of 38a and 39 (J). In ver. 41 (J) we have "in the gutters" simply, to which Rje has added here the parallel expression of E, by way of explanation of the unusual tlo'"t , "gutters," of J. Still more striking is the reduplication of the last clause of ver. 38 compared with the first of ver. 39. The latter verse is clearly connected with J's account (ver. 37) of Jacob's trick. Vs. 41 and 42 are also manifestly a part of the same story, and the latter verses make plain the reason of the first and last clauses of ver. 40, viz., Jacob has now charge of an exclusively white flock, and has obtained control of the color of the progeny; hence, having secured a flock of parti-colored lambs, he does not permit them to mingle indis- criminately with the white (Heb.  laban) flock of Laban, and so take the chances of further parti-colored births, but adopts the (in the author's eyes) surer means of the rods, allowing the progeny to resume their natural white color only when the flock are in poor condition. Laban, three days' journey distant, does not realize what is happening. Ver. 43 also is clearly J's not only on account of fl5 and "!3. but from the connection with xxxII. 4sq. Only the middle clause of ver. 40 stands out in irreconcilable incongruity with this representation. How indeed is Jacob to "set the faces of the flocks" in any given direction ? and what is it expected to accomplish when the parti-colored flock is three days' jour- ney off ? And, finally, what is the use of it when Jacob has already attained his purposes by another and easier method ? The answer is, The middle clause of</page><page sequence="7">228 HEBRAICA. ver. 40 belongs to E; and to this the language again corresponds. It is not the "speckled and spotted" (E under Laban's first agreement) nor "the ringstraked, speckled and spotted" (J), but "the ringstraked and all the black " (E under Laban's second agreement. Cf. xxxI. 8b). Thus the fragments of E in ch. xxx. agree with the rdsumb of the story in xxxI. 7 sqq. E related a changing of Jacob's wages with the final result that not merely "the stronger were Jacob's and the feebler Laban's," ver. 42 (J), but all the flock of Laban became Jacob's, xxxI. 9 (E). Laban assigned him the speckled; then God caused all the flock to bear speckled. He offered him the ringstraked; the whole progeny was ring- straked. Jacob's effort in his own behalf is confined to setting the two kinds of sheep opposite one another "at the watering-troughs" where it could easily be done (38b,40, middle clause). Critics are for the most part quite agreed upon the analysis of xxxI. 1-18. The only questions in debate are as to the possible interpolation of vs. 3,10,12. Vs. 1 and 2 are easily seen to be doublets, the former J's, the latter E's (cf. ver. 5). Ver. 3 is referred to by xxxII. 9, but this latter is itself an interpolated passage, and ver. 3 is excluded by ver. 1, which supplies the motive for Jacob's return. A didactic interest has supplemented this comparatively unworthy motive by a special divine direction. Ver. 12 interrupts the necessary connection of ver. 11 with 13 and is in the highest degree malapropos. The language too heaps together adjectives which in E must have applied only in separate instances; "ringstraked " at one time, "speckled and grisled " at another. The matter may perhaps have been derived from E's story of the acquisition of the flock, but in its present position ver. 12 must be due to didactic interpolation. The same remarks apply of course to ver. 10. With the exception of ver. 18 (P) the rest of vs. 1-20 is indisputably E's; but the middle clause of ver. 21 is a new beginning, dupli- cating the first clause, and 25a is a more remarkable doublet of 23b. Ver. 25b too comes in too late after ver. 24 to belong to E. Ver. 27 also not only duplicates vet. 26, but brings into striking contrast its different expression for denoting the stealthy flight of Jacob (ver. 26, "didst steal my heart ;" v. 27, " didst steal me "'). All these phenomena are rightly noted by the later critics and the indicated frag- ments assigned to J. Also the gap in ver. 25, where the name of "the mountain" has been omitted, doubtless in deference to E's narrative which made Mt. Gilead the scene of both camps. In connection herewith, however, it should be noted that only in the J passages in the complicated mosaic at the end of the chapter is there an apparent attempt to furnish an etymology for two places; E's narrative confining itself to the name Gal-eed (Gilead). Observe also that ver. 31 stands in the worst possible connection with its present context, "Wherefore hast thou stolen my gods ?-Because I was afraid," etc. The verse contains really the answer, not to the question which stands immediately before it, but to that of ver. 27 (J), "Wherefore didst thou flee secretly ?" On the other hand, by withdrawing</page><page sequence="8">NOTES ON THE ANALYSIS OF GENESIS I.-XXXI. 229 ver. 31, we bring ver. 32 into a better connection after ver. 30. The 1"KI of LXX. at the beginning of ver. 32 may then well be genuine, and marks the beginning of Jacob's answer in E. Both matter and language show that the succeeding verses down to ver. 42 are E's. A single clause, "and into the tent of the two maidservants," has been supplemented in ver. 33, as the last clause of the verse shows; but the mere par- allelism of vs. 38 and 41 (Well.) without any trace of divergence in the conception, is scarcely sufficient to suggest the presence of J. Not until we reach ver. 43 can there be any reasonable doubt of E as the author, but here the impression is very strong upon my mind that the debate between Laban and Jacob in E reaches a conclusion with Jacob's triumphant rejoinder of ver. 42; and that ver. 43 is the answer to Jacob's imputation in ver. 31 (J). In E the teraphim are the matter of prime importance. It seems to be J who brings the daughters into the front rank of controversy, and instead of Laban appearing in rather humiliating colors, discomfited and put to shame by Jacob, himself and his gods turned to ridicule by Rachel, in J it is Laban who makes decidedly the best appearance, acting a really generous part (vs. 27,43 sq.), while Jacob presents a rather sorry excuse for his flight from a shadow (ver. 31). Ver. 44 is evidently concerned to furnish an etymology for Gilead (Gal-eed) for "f) ?)"!) "it shall be for a witness" can only refer to some substantive now missing. A clause has been omitted which, as the evidently contem- plated etymology suggests, can only have been j ;7 JI "and make a heap" (Olshausen, Dillmann), in spite of Kautzsch and Socin. The verse thus stands connected with vs. 46-50, where the etymology is developed according to J's style, returning to the word played upon and concluding with his regular "3'.L a-f1~ lp-' "Therefore was the name of it called Gal-eed" (48b). In this passage (vs. 46-50) there has been considerable alteration, transposition and interpolation, as has long been recognized; yet the main characteristics of language are J's, and the subject of the covenant, ver. 50, again agrees with the topic of discussion in vs. 27,31 and 43 (J), and contrasts with that of E, vs. 32-42, 52. Moreover it is Laban who seems to have the best of the argument in these verses of J, and hence Laban also who naturally takes the initiative in the sugges- tion of the covenant; for as Laban undertakes to tell the meaning of the cairn in vs. 48 sqq., it must be Laban, and not "Jacob" as in the present text, who says to his brethren, "Gather stones," etc. Ver. 47 is either, as Wellhausen says, "a very superfluous exhibition of learning" on the part of some interpolator, or else has been removed from between 53a and 53b, and perhaps altered in the process. At any rate it has no place alongside of ver. 48 and is much more than superfluous where it stands. Ver. 48b, the formula with which J's aetiological narratives regularly conclude, can of course originally have stood nowhere but after ver. 50, this verse itself being separated from its true connection with 48a, as has long</page><page sequence="9">230 HEBRAICA. been recognized, by the intruder ver. 49. Finally gtib "God" in ver. 50 is easily recognized as a subject wrongly supplied by some glossator, since it destroys the sense of the narrative. It is not God (Elohim), but the cairn (gal), which is to be the witness (ed) between the parties to the covenant; else the etymology is lost. It is easy simply to banish ver. 49 from the text as an interloper. Undoubt- edly it is in a wrong position and has occasioned the straying of 48b; but the language agrees with the style of J, and one cannot forget the significant gap in ver. 25, where Jacob's camp was also located by J, but in a different place from Laban's. There were then two names of places in J's narrative. Did not each have its aetiology ? And what other place more likely to be associated with Ramoth-Gilead in this connection than the famous Mizpah of Gilead ? It seems to me not at all impossible that in J this verse may have followed upon the story of vs. 48-50 somewhat as follows. [And Jacob set up a stone in the place where he had pitched his tent] and called it Mizpah (Sam. 03 0, LXX. Maca~va), for he said, Yahweh watch (Mi tsaphah) between me and thee when we are hidden one from the other." The erection of maggeboth or "pillars" is comparatively exceptional in J in contrast with E, but there is abundant evidence in xxxv. 14 and Josh. Iv. 20 that they are not unknown to this writer, as erections of the patriarchs, or at least of Jacob. The curious variants of Sam. and LXX. can scarcely be accounted for save as traces of an original play upon the name fi3 i ham-maggebah "the pillar," which can only have stood in the original J (cf. Well. I. p. 432, note). Is it possible that J was again indulging in a word play, connecting maggebah with the stem g through the resemblance of  and g ? Vs. 51-54 are again another story of the covenant at Gilead with a different motive (establishment of a boundary line) and a second covenant feast (cf. vs. 46 and 54). Vs. 51 sq. labor under a load of interpolation in the shape of harmonistic redaction which has introduced both cairn and pillar where only one can be intended. That the one which originally stood in E's narrative was, in spite of Kautzsch and Socin, the cairn (gal), and not the pillar (mae ebah), should be sufficiently clear from the fact alone that E is obviously giving also, as J has given already, vs. 48 sq., an etymology of Gilead (Gal-ed, not maggebah-ed); but there is additional evidence that the cairn belongs here and the pillar is interpolated, in the fact that in the single instance passed over by the interpolator (middle of ver. 52), it is the cairn which stands by itself and not the pillar. It becomes apparent from this that 51-54 must be regarded as E's story of the covenant at Gilead. But certainly the favorite maggebah of E was not left out of this story to appear only in J. No, E also attributes the pillar to Jacob and the cairn to Laban, but here it is naturally Jacob who takes the initiative (vs. 45 and 54), as seems most appropriate after Jacob's speech in ver. 42. The redaction of E's narrative</page><page sequence="10">NOTES ON THE ANALYSIS OF GENESIS [.-XXXI. 231 included beside the introduction of "the pillar " in vs. 51 sq., the supplementation of ver. 53a with the superfluous clause "the God of their father," which contra- dicts E in Josh. xxIV. 2; and perhaps also the removal (and alteration ?) of ver. 47 from between 53a and 53b. With this restoration but few words are lacking to make the narratives of both J and E in ch. xxxI. fairly complete; a result not only gratifying in itself, but corresponding to the procedure of JE as developed in the close inspection of other passages where the strands of J and E are most intimately interwoven. The above analysis of chs. xxx. and xxxI., as well as the suggestions upon previous passages of difficulty, will prove, let us hope, not barren of valuable deductions and inferences for the historical critic. An improved analysis of the succeeding chapters, especially in Exodus, will certainly afford important results.</page></plain_text>
