<plain_text><page sequence="1">? The Poetics of Physicality ? BY Annalisa GOLDONI * ?Poetics? is a loose and wide word, referring to explicated theories, intentions, proposals on the meaning and function of poetry and of writing at large. It is maybe because of such an unbounded range of choices that so many collections on the subject bear the neutral and uncommitted title of ? Statements on Poetry and Poetics ?. Such a lack of definite boundaries makes me feel free to draw upon all kind of sources, poems included ; while, of course, I will mention the difference in the materials used. That sound is inherent to the language of poetry is a widespread notion, accepted by poets and critics alike, and so is the notion that sound and sense (if not meaning) are strictly related ? all the way from Poe to Jakobson. That sound is coming from the body is not so easily accepted or taken into account, at least it hasn't been in the past. No revolution could be made in American poetry without rethink ing a whole cultural approach to the body. Such a revolution was made by Walt Whitman, who, in search of a ? body beautiful?, also looked for a body in poetry. He opened the road, and his directions have been followed and developed by our contempora ries. As in Western culture the primacy of the soul over the body weakened and the soul itself was fragmented into an endless series of regenerative definitions and concepts, such as that of * Universite de Rome REVUE FRANQAISE D'ETUDES AMERICAINES</page><page sequence="2">38 ANNALISA GOLDONI psyche or personality; once the religious meaning of ? soul? had vanished, the body ? as in a scale ? rose in value, and came to include qualities previously attributed to the soul. The self, though struggling not to be identified with body alone, could no longer deny their close kinship. The story of American poetry could be read as the story of the presence and absence of the body, of its praise and refusal, of its building and dismantling ? of the struggle the poetic language has undergone in order to articulate it. It's no surprise to detect in Puritan culture a banishment of the physical stance in man. As we know, literature itself was conside red useless, since it could give no contribution to economic prospe rity, nor was it apt, owing to its vagrancy, to approach God, while even blasphemous in its attempt at creation. It was barely tolera ted when in form of prayer or sermon. The body, as the siege of all earthly passions, of mortality and corruption, was unavoidably antithetic to the divine, and could be mentioned only in despise, contrasted with the better half of man, the soul. A faithful repro duction of this vision is Anne Bradstreet's poem ? The Flesh and the Spirit? allegorized as two sisters born of different fathers : Adam and God. This is the official view, and it isn't surprising. Poetry can work more subtly with its keen tool, language, so as to modify the overt message, even at times with the author unaware. It's what happens with Edward Taylor, who displays the rhetoric and the sensuous sounds of enflamed passion to address God, thus making his language almost acceptable and lawful (I say "almost", because after all he didn't feel safe enough to pu blish). Shall I not smell Thy sweet, oh! Sharon's rose ? Shall not mine eye salute Thy beauty? Why? Shall Thy sweet leaves their beauteous sweets upclose ? As half ashamed my sight should on them lie ? (from ? The Reflection ?) His voluptuous imagery is common to all baroque religious poetry and art, as one can see in Bernini's sculpture of the Ecstasis of St.Teresa, where sacred and profane are perfectly juxtaposed under the seal of Eros. Untouched by problems of sin and morality, Edgar Allan Poe's poetry has been regarded, along with his tales, as anomalous when compared with the mainstream, and it has been shunned and despised by critics (though a surprising number of people learned it by heart). By now it is an unerasable feature of American N? 44 - AVRIL 1990</page><page sequence="3">THE POETICS OF PHYSICALITY 39 tradition: a hyperconcentration of melancholy musical effects (Whitman spoke superciliously of a ? morbid musicality ?), a kitsch beauty at once seducing and repelling, shamelessly appealing to our hidden longings. It has been said in hate that Poe's poetry could be enjoyed and even understood better by persons totally ignorant of the English language. That declaration of hate can be reverted to the praise of his pioneer research into the dramatical import of voice sounds, and into the role they play in shaping the meaning. Speaking about ? The Raven ? and his choice of the refrain: That such a clause, to have force, must be sonorous and suscepti ble of protracted emphasis, admitted no doubt: and these consi derations inevitably led me to the long o as the most sonorous vowel, in connection with r as the most producible consonant. (? The Philosophy of Composition ?). and speaking in ? The Rationale of Verse ? about Latin prosody : The philosophy of the rule "a vowel before two consonants is long" lies simply in the physical difficulty of giving voice to such syllabes ? of performing the lingual evolutions necessary for their utterance. Besides associating the composition of good poetry with the easiness by which certain sounds are produced, and besides choo sing carefully among those words that do not interfere with the rhythm, Poe also devotes the keenest attention to a close corres pondence between eye and ear so that spatial and sound forms do not fight one against the other. Poe's accent on the physiological nature of sounds and of the emotions they produce and play upon does not lead, as we well know, to a revaluation of the body as a subject for poetry. Not much description is allowed for anyway, and what finds a way to the surface is seldom more than a couple of eyes. His vague attention, though, becomes an obsession when focused on the fictitious women he evokes over and over again. As in the tales, here too they are figures of death; as a matter of fact, they are already dead in most cases, and survive only as objects of mour ning for the poetic ?I?. Even when literally alive, as the addres see of the ?Sonnet to Helen?, they are frozen into beautiful motionless statues. Poe's accounting for such a massacre is groun ded on the role he attributes to poetry : that of leading to spiritual elevation, which is to be attained through the most moving of subject themes : the death of a beautiful woman : an event which REVUE FRANQAISE D'ETUDES AMERICAINES</page><page sequence="4">40 ANNALISA GOLDONI is a source of pleasurable sadness for the reader. The result is another version of vampirism, where spirit thrives on the death of the (female) body. If the body in Poe is death, in Whitman it's life ? and all pervasive. In the Preface of 1876 he declares that his original project had been of two books: ?the book of the body and exis tence ?, and ?the book of the soul?, which he never wrote. It's too easy to say that Leaves of Grass is a hymn to the human body ? so frequent is the mentioning of it and the celebration, so thickly is the poem peopled by physical metaphors. Inside the endless series of men and women entering the catalogues which are meant to build an exhaustive image of America, Whitman never fails to mention their flesh : a color of hair, sweating armpits, or muscular torsoes, always looking toward the healthy, free "body beautiful" as a model. In his pantheism, he gives even aerial nature bodily attributes and substance; of the wind he makes a naked (male) body, back at last to the original innocence, free of imposed shame (section 24 of ? Song of Myself ? : ? Winds whose soft-tickling geni tals rub against me... ?). The old dichotomy between soul and body he solves through language, insisting on their complementarity. But if he speaks more often in defense of the body, it is also because the soul doesn't need an advocate. In section 5 of ? Song of Myself? he represents the union of the two as a sexual encounter : I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you, And you must not be abased to the other. I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning, How you settled your head athwart my hip and gently turn'd over upon me, And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart, And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held my feet. Whitman's representational choice gives dominance to the body in several ways: because the soul too, here, is corporeal; because the union between the two is sexual; and also because the ?I? addresses the soul, marking the difference and the priority (see the opening of ? Song of Myself? as well: ?I loafe and invite my soul?). N? 44 - AVRIL 1990</page><page sequence="5">THE POETICS OF PHYSICALITY 41 Very early, in the Preface of 1855, Whitman sketches a theory of language in which total communication is accomplished through verbal and non-verbal signs alike: ... and your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in every motion and joint of your body. In the 1867 edition, as the work of art grows ? itself an organism ? the first Inscription is ? One's-Self I Sing?, and in establishing the dignity and complexity of the body in all of its parts (certainly a declaration unprecedented); Whitman puts such a view side by side with the equal consideration and celebration of the individual and the mass, of the sexes, of Spirit, so stating and stressing the role of the body in a (utopian) democratic world ? extending the notion of democracy to a pervasive episteme, an all encompassing structure. His way of versification is also included, of course. Charles Olson said of Whitman that ? he gave us hope ?, which is true also of the way his preaching on self-reliance goes into the materic substance of his poetry: his long free lines giving voice to the free developing of physicality, spreading at ease, unbound by conventional metrics, unhindered by syntactic hierar chies. I believe that we cannot witness a comparable interest, and hope, in the body until the middle of this century. To ? repossess the body? was the first target of the Feminist movement in the Sixties, and it is no surprise that the search for identity has since required a strong dramatization of the body. Women's poetry is looking for, or to pose it better, working toward a language ? close to the body ?, even in syntax and grammar: a language able to move away (for instance) from the oppositional structures infor ming the linguistic and conceptual logic of a male-centered culture, the same culture which built the dichotomy body/soul. It isn't an easy and smooth process : Adrienne Rich, who repre sents today the harbinger of self-assurance, occasionally to the edge of propaganda, speaks of her early wary approaches to her own internal conflicts : ?In those years, formalism was part of the strategy ? like asbestos gloves, it allowed me to handle materials I couldn't pick up barehanded ?. This is a metaphor close to the object of the search ; and metaphors are, of course, what we expect as the most perceptible presence of the body in the language of poetry. It is often the privileged image of movement which points to the REVUE FRANQAISE D'ETUDES AMERICAINES</page><page sequence="6">42 ANNALISA GOLDONI stage to reach, to the coming out from a static pattern of stereo types and conditioning. We see Rich at the beginning of her career presenting a woman who sits still, her hands alone going to and fro under the weight of her nuptial ring; embroidering the proud, prancing tigers on a tapestry (?Aunt Jennifer's Tigers ?, 1951); while a visible change we'll find in ?Diving into the Wreck?, written some twenty years later : This is the place. And I am here, the mermaid whose dark hair streams black, the merman in his armed body We circle silently about the wreck we dive into the hold. I am she: I am he Movement as a synonym for liberation is, in women's poetry, a conquered image, never pre-existent or given. The dark, almost unreadable syntax of Sylvia Plath shows it very clearly ? and it is no paradox ? over and over again. See, for example, ? Ariel?, where horse and girl in acceleration become one, their physicality emerges divested of weight, while backward forces try to hold them: Nigger-eye Berries cast dark Hooks ? Black sweet blood mouthfuls, Shadows. In Plath, any action coming from the outside world is violence, even when it is officially offered as reconstruction and recomposi tion; especially when it comes from physicians and psychiatrists, the ones who, in her metaphors, want to seam and glue the crevices and fractures of the body. But it is precisely through those crevices that Plath depicts the production of the voice, because it is only by destroying the perfected, closed image which others have created and imposed upon the self, that the substance of the original self may, though at risk, be attained. Mutilation and dismembering, traditionally conceived of as the concrete equivalent of loss of identity, is again faced in Denise Levertov's poetry as a necessary stage toward the rebirth of rela tional roles, of which body metaphors are meant as literal intensi fications : N? 44 - AVRIL 1990</page><page sequence="7">THE POETICS OF PHYSICALITY 43 After I had cut off my hands and grown new ones something my former hands had longed for came and asked to be rocked. After my plucked out eyes had withered, and new ones grown something my former eyes had wept for came asking to be pitied. (?Intrusion ?) The study of the body touches upon other areas than those traditionally occupied by poetry. Events involving deeply the self, such as birth and delivery, are explored both as referents and as metaphors. Motherhood becomes a dramatic dynamic relationship, which sharply departs from the conventional, fixed image of topical art ? all the way from Raffaello's benign and stolid Madonnas to Whistler's stern and flat profile of his ? Mother ?. In a short piece of poetic prose, Levertov works on the familiar metaphor of the parental poet, making it literal, envisioning the poet in labor as a unifier of the three lives involved in the event: The poet is in labor. [...] and she knows the head is out then, and the child is pushing and sliding out of her, insistent, a poem. The poet is a father. [...] into this alien human scene emerges, slime-covered, skinny-legged, with a head of fine black hair, the remote consequence of a dream of his, acted out nine months before, the rhythm that became words, the words that were spoken, written down. The poet is being born. Blind, he neverthe less is aware of a new world around him, the walls of the womb are gone, something harsh enter his nose and mouth and lungs, and he uses it to call out the world with what he finds is his voice. (from ? The Poet in the World ?, 1967) And it is relevant that she alternates here feminine and mascu line pronouns, developing in her own way Whitman's defense of plurality. The logic of poetry being emotional, not intellectual, its origins are always connected to a physical experience, and its constant listening to the unconscious has been investigated with keen awa reness by women poets. We can see a similar concern also in the so-called Black Moun tain poets, to whom Levertov is related, and especially in the works of Robert Duncan and Charles Olson. In principle, poetry still retains strong imprints of its oral birth ; much more so than prose. That makes for a sound pattern prior to REVUE FRANQAISE D'ETUDES AMERICAINES</page><page sequence="8">44 ANNALISA GOLDONI a visual pattern. Sound is present both in the overall structure as well as in the most minimal tissue of poetic speech, and esta blishes a continuity between body and text. Such general conti nuity may take different shapes and reverberations : it may repre sent only a segment of a wider continuity, up to and including, in a visionary poet like Duncan, the realm of metaphysics : Figure 1 The vowels are physical corridors of the imagination emitting passionately breaths of flame. In a poem the vowels appear like the flutterings of an owl caught in a web and give aweful intimations of eternal life (from ? An Owl Is An Only Bird Of In Duncan's universe, the effort to make all elements interact leads to relate the smallest to the largest; leads to see in the rhythmic unit of the poem a direct correspondence to the systole and diastole of the heart, to the flow of the tides, to the move ments of sun and moon. Yet, he doesn't advocate a passive recep tion, since he well perceives the danger of incantatory rhythms : namely, the abolition of consciousness. Rather, he works toward a mediation ? a dynamic sharing of the multiple forces at play in a poem, which is an event born out of culture and nature, out of conscious and unconscious : There have been poets for whom this rise and fall, the mothering swell and ebb, was all. Amoebic intelligences, dwelling in the memorial of tidal voice, they arouse in our awake minds a spell, so that we let our awareness go in the urgent wave of the verse [...]. Our consciousness, and the poem as a supreme effort of consciousness, comes in a dancing organization between personal and cosmic identity. (from ? Towards an Open Universe ?, 1966) The awareness of the organic roots of language is reached through the mediation of highly polished and distant cultures. One of his most suggestive statements draws upon Dante's De Vulgari Eloquentia, and defines a primary language of poetry as the one issuing from the playful gibberish of very small children, uttered ? for the love of it?, in imitating the sounds received from the body of their nurses: ?milk?. Secondary (in Dante it meant ? coming after in time ?) to this language based on the pleasure N? 44 - AVRIL 1990</page><page sequence="9">THE POETICS OF PHYSICALITY 45 principle, is the superimposed, grammatical one, based on alert study and achieved through painstaking effort. Duncan's discrimination is very close to the one made by Olson in ? Human Universe ? (1951) between speech and logos. In that essay Olson stresses the divarication which has developed between the two in the Judeo-Christian tradition, all at the expense of speech, and to the advantage of predetermined, orderly forms. In exploratory poetry, even minimal technical considerations are of great import and lead to expansion. In his seminal essay ? Projec tive Verse ? (1950), Charles Olson maintains that poetry starts in the syllable, ?incest of mind and ear ?, so hinting to a dynamics which grows out of the imaginative fusion of body and mind, and goes toward the unfolding of the poem as a total experience. In Olson, the poem comes to life only in breath, which establishes the rhythm. The communicative chain devised by him is very similar to the one elaborated by Jakobson; but in ? Projective Verse ? the body is not considered merely as a vehicle; it is also an originator, the center of the chain (but ? process ? is a better name for it) being not the message but what he calls the energy, transferred from the poem via poem to the reader, and undergoing substantial transformations in the passage. As he sees it, poetry is a shared experience of writer (? which makes him a hearer and viceversa ?) and reader, both drawing deeply upon the generative mind of the body. The projective poet should go: down through the workings of his own throat to that place where breath comes from, where breath has its beginnings, where drama has to come from, where, the coincidence is, all act springs. The alertness to the physical quality of both author's and rea der's experiences accounts for the extreme attention the projecti vists and experimentalists in general have devoted to the spatia lity of the poem. Thinking in anthropomorphic, organic terms, Levertov speaks of the "profile" a poem may offer to our eyes if we follow down the text the outsketch provided by the variations in linelength: ? These changes could be recorded in graph form by some instru ment, as heartbeats or brain waves are graphed?. (?On the Function of the Line ?). When confronted with poetry, we combine the reading of any written text (our eyes going from left to right line after line downward) with the "reading" or reception of a pictorial image (our eyes trying at first to take it in as a whole). We even feel REVUE FRANQAISE D'ETUDES AMERICAINES</page><page sequence="10">46 ANNALISA GOLDONI that there is a diverting interruption in our experience of the poem when the text is so long as to continue for more than one page, and we are obliged to turn leaf in order to see the end of it. The autor's experimental use of space obliges to rediscover the familiar mechanisms of reading; the text, in disarranging the expected geometries, invites comparison and confrontation, contri butes to mobility in perception and participation. It asks the reader to acknowledge space as a symbolic system of communica tion, where even blanks speak : they tell of time (in visualizing the duration of a pause); they tell of their own physicality, that is of their working as distancers; they reveal the autonomous values of the units so isolated through the blank frames; they tell of silences (themselves connected with sound). Parallel to what hap pens in contemporary music, in poetry too silence is no longer regarded only as negative, as a mark of absence, but it is conside red an entity in itself, a language with a complex code which requires careful listening. That's why Duncan speaks of ?lines of silence ? rather than of ? blanks ? or ? stanza breaks ?, stating its dignity in versification. The view that space organization of the lines is the linguistic equivalent of the musical score is by now a familiar one. This view hints to the intermediate quality of the written text, projected toward the performance. Among the projectivists, who yet share a common allegiance to Olson's manifesto, the research on the physical space of poetry leads to very different proceedings and results, according to the individual voices. So much so that we are able to recognize at first glance Olson's long sweeping lines moving across the page, accele rating and decelerating through the heavy use of indentations; even at time spreading all around in order to create the experience of simultaneity in building his ? maps ? of times and spaces appa rently remote from each other. Quite the opposite method we find in Creeley's short lines, where there is a strong stress on the beginnings. The sense of variation and movement is given solely by the syncopated breath rhythm inside a very compact space design. Because in Creeley's poetry there is a conspicuous lack of circumstantial frames (historical, cultural, geographic contexts, etc.), it is easy to detect the plural presence of the body, which stands out in full view as a perpetual source of wonder. The body is often a primary instrument of research, and the senses appear as cognitive tools; but it is also the object of the search, whose knowledge is to be conquered piece by piece, until the fragments make a whole; and/or it is questioned in its relation to the self, to the other. And the question is: to what extent the body is the N? 44 - AVRIL 1990</page><page sequence="11">THE POETICS OF PHYSICALITY 47 measure, the touchstone, of which Creeley gives a double defini tion : ? Something by which all else can be measured ?. Something by which to measure all else. (? The Touchstone ?, from Later, 1979) Like other poets we have seen, Creeley too sings the body as a source of language. And reciprocally, language itself is fleshy, yielding its humanity in communication only, hard as it is at times to achieve it: There are words voluptuous as the flesh in its moisture, its warmth. Tangible, they tell the reassurances, the comforts, of being human. Not to speak them makes abstract all desire and its death at last. (? Love ?, from Later) American culture has been growing up in many traditions, many more and more at variance than American people have been willing to acknowledge. Each tradition has implied a different approach to the body. Puritanism, slavery, the dream of success and the myth of efficiency had all, each in its own peculiar way, pushed culture away from the complex texture of the real body: by making it sinful and dejectable, by making it "invisible" (as Ralph Ellison accurately put it); by building an unnatural, disfigu red image of the body as a perfectly operating machine ? an image inflated by advertising and split into hundreds of specializa tions : sex-, work-, feeding-machine, etc. What remained of Whit man in the common tradition was the "body beautifur tag, devoid of the contents he had given it, which were made out of strength as well as of weakness, of health and infirmity, of sex, race, individuality. The battle for or against the body is now fought on the field of REVUE FRANQAISE D'ETUDES AMERICAINES</page><page sequence="12">48 ANNALISA GOLDONI language ? the caring language of poetry versus the cynical language of selling: ?
