<plain_text><page sequence="1">R. E. W. Adams University of Texas at San Antonio Norman Hammond Rutgers University New Brunswick, New Jersey A survey of publications in Maya archaeology in the quinquennium 1976-1980 shows a high rate of production of both monographs and papers, embodying radical changes in knowledge of ancient Maya subsistence, settle- ments, social structure, and intellectual superstructure. Traditional mono- graphs as well as extensive interim reports convey detailed information on surveys and excavations, while specialized seminars have joined periodic congresses and continuing journal publication as vehicles for topical papers. The review examines major publications by geographical area, and then analyzes current knowledge of several key topics in Maya archaeology. A Review Article Introduction We propose in this article to survey the major publi- cations in the field of Maya archaeology during the quin- quennium 1976-1980; eschewing comprehensiveness, we shall concentrate on monographic studies and a se- lected group of papers. As an aid to ourselves and the reader we have roughly tabulated the published material (TABLE 1), to serve as a guide both to the nature of the literature and the extent of our selectivity. At least 63 monographs and 200 papers were published on Maya archaeology during this period, a total of some 9,800 pages: a wider cast of the definitional net would enlarge this considerably. Our intention is to make a selective survey of this literature and a critical review of major contributions, and thereby to indicate some of the main trends within the field. One of us has previously surveyed in an article the period 1958-1968 in Maya archaeology;1 that article was more an intellectual history of the subject than this present paper, which is rather a critical biblio- graphic review. We hope, however, that the two articles will be compatible, and for a recent masterly summary of developments in Maya archaeology we refer the reader also to G. R. Willey's 1979 Huxley Lecture.2 1.

Reports have appeared on 23 sites (FIG. 1), embodied in 31 volumes of single or grouped mon- ographs; some are the initial volumes of continuing se- ries, such as those on Altun Ha, Seibal, and Tonina. The geographical distribution of these publications is roughly proportionate to the size of the respective areas involved, the number of sites, and the archaeological effort ex- pended in each. Many of the papers in journals precede, complement, or supplement the monographs, and we will consider these under topical headings after examining the monographs themselves.

Of the two volumes on the sculptures, by V. Garth Norman,4 the second appeared in 1976. The monuments are illustrated carefully and exhaustively by both artifi- cially-lit photographs and high-quality line drawings de- rived from them, while Norrnan's text is descriptive and of first-order analysis. Because this is the largest corpus of Izapan sculpture known the publication has already had considerable im- pact on studies of early Maya and trans-isthmian art styles and their iconography. Norman has unfortunately ignored the accumulating and convincing evidence of the past twenty years of historicism in Mesoamerican sculpture: the latest research by David Grove suggests that even the early Olmec named and memorialized their rulers. Nor- man presumes that Izapan art is entirely religious, sym- bolic and cosmological in intent, and there is no attempt to deal with any other iconographic possiblities, even though Maya art, for example, demonstrably combines historicism with religious symbolism. Norman thus de- pends heavily on the dated (though often insightful) ideas of Seler in dealing with Izapan icongraphy. Nevertheless, these volumes, together with the forthcoming studies of the important Classic and Postclassic developments at Izapa, will make a major contribution to Mesoamerican studies; the later occupation is intimately involved with the development of plumbate pottery as a widespread and popular Postclassic trade good, for which Izapa seems to have been a major center of manufacture.5 Abaj Takalik, excavated by John A. Graham and the late Robert F. Heizer, has produced a long sequence of ceramics, architecture and sculpture so far reported only in preliminary form.6 The most striking aspect of the sequence is that it includes Olmec, Izapan, and early Classic Maya sculptural styles, with the latter two over- lapping in time to some extent, and the presence of at Izapa, Chiapas, Mexico.

The developmental implications include a possibly independent and at least more indirect connection between the Olmec-derived Iz- apan style and that of emergent Classic Maya art. Maya Highlands The major project at Kaminaljuyu has so far yielded six volumes, totalling some 2,800 pages, of which two volumes were early interim reports issued before 1976; there has also been a welcome republication of the orig- inal 1946 Carnegie monograph by Kidder, Jennings, and Shook in the new series format. The four volumes noted here present data on ceramics,7 the settlement-pattern excavations,8 relationships with Teotihuacan,9 and an overall interpretation.l° A major problem in using any of the volumes is their axiomatic assumption that the chiefdom model of sociopolitical structure is the only possible interpretation of the data. The ceramics volume, edited by Ronald Weathering- ton, exemplifies the strengths and weaknesses of the whole series: the acquisition of a massive data base, but a blinkered approach to its use. First the good points: foremost is the solid accomplishment of typological de- scription and arrangement of over one million sherds into chronological order. Some 2300 years are spanned by the definition of 20 wares, 51 types, and 85 binomial type-varieties. Analysis was done on an attribute basis, and the decision was taken to analyze only rim sherds; here things began to go wrong. Keypunching and coding of the data in terrns of 17 attributes per sherd were so cumbersome that the process restricted the size of the total sample that was fully analyzed; that sample ulti- mately comprised only about 6% of the rim sherds and a much smaller percentage of the total number, neither forrning a statistically random sample. The taxonomic descriptions are also less than satisfactory: not all types or varieties are illustrated, there is no cross-indexing, and there is not even a comprehensive list of type-variety names. The comparative notes for the taxonomic units are not systematic nor always complete. Illustrations are 7. R. K.

The comparative statements at the ceramic-complex level are sketchy. Weatherington's spatial analysis of the ceramics is based on an uncritical acceptance of the "chiefdom'' model; thus, ceramic manifestations of lineages and moieties are discussed with the credulity of true faith rather than the critical skepticism of true science. What is more, the analysis is difficult to use either for com- parisons or for further work in the Valley of Guatemala, and is a strong argument, by example, against mechan- istic and denatured types of analysis and the abdication of analytical decisions to a card-sorter or computer. Elsewhere in the volume Dora Gonzalez and Weath- erington deal convincingly with incense-burner types at Kaminaljuyu, demonstrating that a better way of doing things was possible, and Joseph Lischka makes a very neat and stimulating analysis of Middle Classic ceramics. Figurines are briefly presented with little comparative data. Some of the best work on ceramics (and in other parts of the project) is on the topic of ethnographic analogies and continuities in Guatemala. Dean Arnold presents a fascinating study of modern pottery-making, while Pru- dence Rice performs an incredibly complex analysis of white-ware preclassic ceramics and concludes that oc- cupational specialization was involved, partly on grounds of ethnographic comparison. A series of technical reports ends the volume in a somewhat disconnected way. The settlement-pattern volume is a presentation of basic excavation data from test-pits and some work on small structures, and is again a group of monographs by various authors. James Fitting presents the research de- sign for random-sampling of the site, and demonstrates that the 520 test pits were indeed randomly distributed. He claims a 2% sample of the surface deposits, which is correct as far as it goes; but it might also be argued that the correct sampling universe is the total theoretical volume of deposits, and in this case only .00018% was actually excavated, a vanishing small sample (2310 cu. m.) compared with the 12,623,636 cu. m. of theoretical total deposits. Fitting summarizes an immense amount of data both visually and narratively in a reasonably ac- cessible form, while Joseph Michels and Weatherington in another substantial monograph give the pit-by-pit ar- tifact inventories and ceramic dating. Unfortunately the assessments do not deal with all ceramic complexes, lat- est complex present, etc., and although the printout tables in the appendix to the report may contain this informa- tion, they are remarkably obscure. In the same volume, Nancy Stenholm defines a house with great prolixity and reports on a single example ex- cavated at Kaminaljuyu. John Reynolds summarizes the residential architecture of the site, but his discussion is unfortunately distorted by the initial assumption of a chiefdom model, complete with status competition among local chiefdoms. Michels presents a set of maps summarizing settlement history by phase, which are use- ful distribution plots of deposit occurrence. Brian Hayden reports on two ethnographic households, one from the Valley of Guatemala, and this interesting study is leaned upon by most of the other authors as a primary form of ethnographic analogy. Since much more data of this sort were accessible to and gathered by the project, it is puz- zling why it was not used. Teotihuacan and Kaminaljuyu, edited by William Sanders and Michels, is again a collection of monographs and by far the most interesting of the series. Charles Cheek reports on excavations in two of the major mound groups at Kaminaljuyu, including the Teotihuacan-influ- enced architecture in the so-called acropolis. Both groups have long cultural sequences that include a strong Teo- tihuacan presence in the period 400-600 A.C. that cor- relates with the famous Mounds A and B excavated in the 1940s by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Cheek sees Teotihuacan presence reflected in architec- ture, tombs, ceramics and caches, and in terms of an acculturation model: unlike many of the other contribu- tors to the series, he presents the data before advancing an interpretation, and is both clearer and more . . convlnclng. Kenneth Brown reports on data gathered in brief ex- cavations at Solano and Frutal, two sites in the southern Valley of Guatemala. Half of the monograph presents the data, while the other half is an over-long, incredibly complex and involuted argument for a port-of-trade ex- planation of the Teotihuacan presence at Kaminaljuyu. Some distortions result from this approach. For example, the assertion that Frutal was at one point equal in size to Kaminaljuyu simply does not stand up toW examination of the maps. Frutal has five courtyard groups of archi- tecture (in terms of the rank-order model) while Kamin- aljuyu has at least 18, with 300 structures, and many more groups may have been destroyed in the late 18th century when Guatemala City was founded on its present site. Sanders succinctly summarizes the Kaminaljuyu data and the differences between that site and Teotihuacan, and, noting the ethnographic situation of Arab traders in Hausa areas of Nigeria, argues that Teotihuacan long- distance traders may have achieved equivalent positions and married into high-status local families at Kaminal-</page><page sequence="6">492 Maya Archaeology, 1976-1980: a Review of Major PublicationslAdams and Hammond juyu. Counter-arguments and rebuttals of this model are advanced by Brown, Sanders, and Cheek, all of whom maintain their basic positions. Michels summarizes his chiefdom/moiety/lineage reconstruction and then deals with Teotihuacan influence within that context, in which it is seen as a purely trading relationship. The test for the hypotheses of Michels and Brown is ultimately that the chiefdom model does not deal adequately with the data; the port-of-trade model is similarly inadequate. In both cases one has to select supporting data. Much the best case is made by Cheek with his adaptation of a parity-of-culture model originally propounded by Kent Flannery for Oaxaca. The most provocative of the four volumes reviewed here is that by Michels on The Kaminaljuyu Chiefdom, which is at first sight an impressive exposition derived from a massive data base. As with so many of the other studies, however, this book is written in such a way that it is nearly impossible to make any independent assess- ment of the validity of the conclusions. The assumption that we are dealing with a chiefdom is woven into data presentation and reconstruction of the evolutionary pro- cess, and no alternative is really considered. A chiefdom level of organization is flatly stated to be "the most appropriate model" (p. 33). Michels maps the distribu- tion of the mound groups for each period and the shifts of lineages, on the basis of occupation data. Truly in- credible assumptions are made about the data to create these maps: for example, Michels says (p. 76) that he "arbitrarily chose to interpret a trace as indicating the presence at that site of at least 1 hectare of nucleated settlement". Apparent incongruities are created also, so that on p. 89, 1 hectare of settlement is calculated as representing 280 persons per sq. km., while on p. 92, 111 persons per sq. km. are stated to be the norm. At one point it is argued that burial practices indicate con- tinuity, and then elsewhere that the burials at Mounds A and B represent cultural intrusions. Michels continues this tour de force of closed logic to the end. The Kaminaljuyu Project operated under the handicap of salvaging archaeological data in the face of urban development, and as directors Sanders and Michels had to make many decisions on what to dig and what to leave to be destroyed. They made choices that many, more culture-history-oriented archaeologists would not have, but even so managed to accumulate and analyze a vast body of information: 10,000 pages of field notes lie be- hind the 740 published pages of the settlement-pattern volume alone. Large numbers of workers were involved for a decade, and it is perhaps not surprising that the reports are sometimes incongruent while being frustrating in their single-mindedness of interpretation and paradox- ically disconnected. Overall, the lack of conclusive treat- ment of the major problem of Teotihuacan influence or presence is bothersome after the expenditure of so much money and effort. The site of Chalchuapa in western El Salvador, a rela- tively short distance east of Kaminaljuyu, is reported on in three volumes edited by Robert J. Sharer, the project director. 11 Sharer and his colleagues competently present and analyze data gathered from surface survey, from excavations, and on sculptured monuments, special de- posits, artifacts, figurines, and pottery. Chalchuapa was an early settlement, established in the latter part of the Early Preclassic, ca. 1200 B.C., and remained occupied until the Spanish conquest ca. 1526 A.C. It comprises some 145 structures large and small, set in characteristic Maya courtyard groups. Ceramics, lithics, figurines, and other artifacts are organized into separate sequences of complexes on independent sched- ules: there are thus 10 ceramic complexes, 6 of archi- tecture, 3 for figurines, and 3 for chipped stone among a total of 33 for the entire site, and periodization is by absolute time in each case rather than by reference to a master ceramic sequence. Sharer's analysis of the pottery and Sheets's of the lithics are especially valuable, and Sheets's study is also noteworthy for the sample size and the clarity of rationale. Data presentation is excellent and the conclusions reasonable. In culture-historical terms the hiatus in 200-300 A.C. caused by the eruption of the volcano Ilopango is the most striking event documented. After the hiatus Chal- chuapa, which had hitherto been part of Mesoamerica, became more culturally allied with lower Central Amer- ica to the east. The early presence of Olmec influence ca. 900 B.C. iS interesting, and explained in terms of a trade model (although this ignores the possible evidence for Olmec militarism in the fortifications of Los Naranjos in Honduras, still further removed from the Olmec heart- land). All in all, this is a most satisfactory report in terms of quality, both of data and of publication. At the western end of the Maya highlands in Chiapas, the site of Tonina has been excavated by the French Mission in Mexico and the first of two volumes of the final report, by Becquelin and Baudez, has been pub- lished.12 The site comprises some 10 courtyard groups, of which 4 were excavated. The project was approached with the notion that the temples were lineage shrines associated with the stone sculptures that depict martial scenes, and 21 tombs were excavated. 11. R. J.

While much of the material will follow in volume 2, the first is, despite omissions and some in- accuracies in the maps, useful, well put together and very nicely published. Although first occupied in the middle part of the Late Preclassic, ca. 1 A.C., Tonina seems to fit with Chinkultic, Palenque and Lubaantun as an elite administrative center flourishing only in the Late Classic (600-900 A.C.). Late classic pottery constitutes over 92% of the sample, and a stela with a clear Initial Series of 10.4.0.0.0. (909 A.C.) iS, with one possible exception, the latest known. Ball's report on the highland site of Chinkultic, also in Chiapas, is much more than the ceramic study that it purports to be.13 Ball does indeed concentrate on the pottery, which he divides into three phases, but he also draws a great deal of culture history from it. A short occupation during the Protoclassic period correlates with some reused fragments of Izapa-style sculpture, then a long hiatus is followed by a Late Classic florescence and the expansion of Chinkultic to seven courtyard groups in size. The nearby cenote proved to have been the site of ritual activities. The Late Classic pottery is succinctly described in type-variety terms that permit rapid com- parative study, and several appended papers add to the general archaeology of the site. Two very valuable monographs have been published by a research group from the Centre National de la Re- cherche Scientifique of France. They deal with the results of archaeological survey and excavation in the Rio Chixoy zone north of Rabinal in Alta Verapaz, Guate- mala. The first monograph by Alain Ichon is the report on the survey and is highly professional and thorough. The second volume is the multi-authored report on the intensive excavations at the protohistoric site of Cauinal, which is a city mentioned in the Popol Vuh, the great religious historical chronicle of the highland Maya. Thor- ough excavation of nearly all major structures, and many of the minor ones, has yielded an immensely detailed body of data on religious practices, architecture, pottery, settlement patterns, and the like. The report is well il- lustrated, organized, and printed. In its quality and quan- tity of data it is a fitting complement to A. L. Smith's great reconnaissance work. The two major books on Utatlan, the protohistoric capital of the Quiche, appeared respectively before and after the period under review; they should, however, be noted as dealing with a blend of ethnohistoric, ethnographic, and archaeological evi- dence on this important highland Maya group. 14 Central Lowlands Working from the highland margin northwards, Salinas de los Nueve Cerros is reported on in a neat, short mon- ograph. 15 The small center was apparently established by at least 250 B.C. to exploit the nearby mineral salt de- posits. The site lies on the southern margin of the low- lands, 30 km. from the nearest major mountain range and thus transitional in its ecology. It was occupied until ca. 900 A.C., at which time the Maya collapse removed the market for its salt. On the SE periphery of the lowlands both Copan and Quirigua have been excavated. Continuing work at Copan has so far been reported only in papers that deal mainly with the settlement pattern (see below). The first volume of the final report on Quirigua comprises accounts of the first four seasons with summaries of aims and results. 16 A final site map accompanies the volume. The project concentrated on working out a site sequence, which seems to run from Late Preclassic to Early Postclassic, with an emphatic Late Classic florescence and a weak Early Classic matching that at many central lowland cen- ters. The pottery sequence has, notably, no polychrome tradition. The famous monuments were thoroughly ex- amined, recorded, renumbered, and treated against li- chen. The late Linton Satterthwaite, Jr., in one of his last papers, deals with the reassessed text of Altar L, while Kelley's earlier work on the dynastic texts is being fol- lowed up and correlated with the building phases, which in the Late Classic seem to include the construction of defensive, or at least defensible, structures. Ashmore is able to define various districts around Quirigua, which in their size and organization appear similar to those 14.

The overall excellence of the reports and their preliminary nature whet the appetite for more. The Pasion River site of Seibal, excavated between 1964 and 1968, is represented by the second volume of the final report, a collection of three monographs. 17 Willey' s study of the artifacts is descriptive, comparative, and contextual, and he expresses dissatisfaction with the prevalent classifications, which mix functional and de- scriptive categories. In its excellent illustrations and me- ticulously noted quantitative and provenience data, Willey's report is part of the necessary progress towards a more rational analysis of artifacts (such as is being developed presently at Colha, Belize) and the needed body of comparative data. The two other monographs in the Seibal volume report reconnaissance at two sites on the Pasion, Cancuen up- stream from Seibal and Itzan downstream near the con- fluence with the Chixoy. Cancuen is a mainly Late Classic center of a size equal to about nine courtyard groups with 22 monuments, which falls into the same late-rising category as Tonina (see above). Itzan, near Altar de Sacrificios, is also apparently late, of 4-5 court- yard groups in size, and with 24 stone monuments, most of them carved. Unfortunately, the immense and crucial mass of ma- terial from Tikal remains unpublished, although two vol- umes of final reports now in press should appear by mid-1983. An interim report on the work at El Mirador, on the other hand, illustrates the hazards of over-hasty publication.18 The volume is a collection of papers re- porting on the field seasons of 1978 and 1979, led by R. Matheny and B. Dahlin. The map of the site is essentially unchanged from that published by its discoverer, Ian Graham, in 1967. The ceramics are analyzed in rather a haphazard manner, with sample sizes not being given for taxonomic units; since the argued Preclassic date for the site's massive structures comes largely from the ce- ramic data, it deserves to be better documented. What is more, while the rescuing of data from looters' pits and trenches is admirable, it means that stratigraphic control is less certain and dating more suspect. The incoherence of the overall research design is re- flected in the report on the bajo excavations, in which anomalous and ambiguous data are presented with sur- prisingly confident conclusions. Mirador is said to be the largest known Maya site, to be mainly Late Preclassic in florescence, to have no evidence for raised/channeled 17. G. R.

For (;entral Belize two important and well-produced monographs have appeared:l9 the late James Gifford's Barton Ramie ceramics report (brought to fruition by Carol Gifford, Robert Sharer, Joseph Ball, and others) complements the 1965 excavation report, in which only an outline was presented of what was at the time the longest ceramic sequence in the lowlands. The initial section in which Gifford's theories about ceramic clas- sification and the development of the type-variety method are published will be of enduring use to students of the history of Maya archaeology. The small coastal-plain site of Altun Ha, east of Barton Ramie, was excavated in 1964-1970 by David M. Pen- dergast, working with a minimal professional crew and a team of permanent Maya laborers from Socotz who must by now be among the most experienced excavators in the entire field (many of them are still working, at Lamanai). The first volume of the final report is devoted entirely to architectural stratigraphy and associated bur- ials and caches in Group A, one of the two main plazas of the small ceremonial precinct. The description and recording (with excellent plans and profiles by Stanley Loten, and superb artifact illustrations) are meticulous, but Pendergast eschews interpretation almost entirely in this volume: the complete report, which will be of major significance, should enable the wealth of carefully ob- served detail to be seen in proper perspective. A number of preliminary papers and a short monograph on the "Sun God's Tomb'' in Structure B-4 lie outside the period of this review, but have already established the importance of the site for the study of the Classic period in the eastern lowlands. Many sites in the central lowlands have been remapped and their monuments thoroughly recorded for the Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions by Ian Graham and Eric von Euw. The project has so far issued eight fas- cicles, which include the Peten sites of Naranjo, Yax- chilan, Chunhuitz, Ixkun, Ucanal, Ixtutz, Itzimte, and Xultun, together with Xunantunich in Belize . 20 The 19.

The site maps are accurate and useful, and the photographs and draw- ings of sculpture and hieroglyphic texts (the latter from controlled-light photographs) are superb; the achievement is one of which the spiritual father of the project, Alfred Maudslay, would be proud. If we leave this substantial body of publication so rapidly, it is because there is little to offer except praise and encouragement. The large number of projects recently underway in northern Belize has begun to manifest itself in the pub- lished record. The earliest of these projects, the Corozal Project, carried out a regional survey of the entire zone north of latitude 18°N in 1973-74, and the first two of its interim reports were published prior to 1976. 21 They and the 1976 report each present annual accounts of sur- vey and excavation results, including site maps, exca- vation plans and sections with detailed excavation reports and preliminary ceramic assessments. (The 1976 report also includes the first account of the monuments and site of Nim li punit in southern Belize). The monographs can be characterized as supremely data-oriented, with masses of detailed information that is often disparate and frus- trating in its lack of conclusions, but which thus reflects the methodological and intellectual difficulties of ar- chaeological fieldwork and some of its rewards. Sites covered include Nohmul, San Estevan, Colha, Santa Rita, Chowacol and Cuello. Hammond introduces each of these interim reports with a summary of research de- sign and an overview of results, but leaves theory and interpretation to papers that have appeared concurrently in various journals; the final data presentations, analyses, and interpretations will appear in the summary mono- graph. The work at Cuello was continued in a subsequent project, discussed below in the topical section, the long ceramic sequence from the site, amplifying that estab- lished for the region as a whole by the addition of an Early Preclassic phase, has been studied by Pring, who also published a valuable volume of illustrations defining Museum: Cambridge 1977); I.

Colha is a large chert-tool factory site, originally located and mapped by the Corozal Project and excavated and analyzed by Richard Wilk; his data have since been superseded by the massive testing, excavation, and sur- vey programs directed by T. Hester, H. Shafer, and J. Eaton.23 The late Donald Crabtree aided in orienting the replication experiments at Colha, which are reported on briefly. Data on the Classic collapse (an intrusion from the north), on craft specialization, and on economic net- works have also come from the project. The Cerros Project summaries are mainly in the form of papers by D. Freidel which advance a trade-fair model on the basis of the Late Preclassic data indicating that Cerros, on the coast, was a port. Evidence of intensive agriculture, and of early iconography in the stucco dec- oration of monumental architecture has come from the project. 24 No formal interim reports have been published. Lamanai is a site with a long Preclassic sequence and a late and intensive Postclassic occupation. Pendergast has summarized the data from the 1974-1980 seasons in a paper that emphasizes the site's size and colossal public architecture even in the Late Preclassic, and the important documentation of Postclassic occupation through the mid-seventeenth century, including an epi- 22.

The basic ceramic sequence is elab- orated by Ball in the type-variety format, a clear, sub- stantial analysis with useful comparative statements and full illustration.26 The sequence starts ca. 600 B.C. with Mamom-sphere pottery and ends with a brief Postclassic phase ca. 1000 A.C. The complex and sophisticated architecture, dating mainly from the Late Classic (600-900 A.C.) iS clearly analyzed by Potter in his report on excavations at Becan and Chicanna and his survey of the known architecture in the Rio Bec and Chenes zones.27 Potter masterfully summarizes an enormous body of material, and concludes that there is no essential difference between the two styles, which he argues should be amalgamated as a Cen- tral Yucatecan Style. Webster's monograph on the defensive earthworks at Becan indicates that they are not Late Classic in date, as had long been assumed, but Early Classic or even (more precisely, as we now know) Late Preclassic, ca. 250 A.c.).28 He succinctly compares the Rio Bec area data with that from other Maya fortified sites and argues for the importance of warfare as a major factor in the evolution and emergence of Maya civilization. Supplementary short descriptive monographs have ap- peared on the Preclassic architecture of Becan and orl the stone tools from that site.29 Turner has summarized his work on the surrounding countryside and its agricultural terraces in several papers and a monograph is in press.30 25.

Adams has published two long papers attempting to syn- thesize the archaeology of the region in terms of cultural evolution and settlement patterns,31 and Adams and Smith have suggested that a feudal order of society pos- sibly existed there in the Late Classic on the evidence of settlement pattern.32 A stimulating and original study of central and southern lowland sites by Marcus advances a view of settlement pattern that links the distribution of emblem glyphs to a perceived "insider" model, in which four "regional capitals" headed site hierarchies with four levels of im- portance.33 The book is well illustrated and organized, with complex data and arguments that are plausible in many respects. Marcus's "emic" model is one that can be tested against those constructed using nearest-neighbor statistics or rank-order/rank-size analyses; the fit is not, in fact, very good, since these latter methods produce many more putative Late and Terminal Classic states and capitals than are allowed for in the formality of Marcus's model. There are, however, some grounds for accom- modation and adjustment in all of the models, and as data accumulate it may be that a synthetic compromise will appear. Northern Lowlands Various surveys of parts of the northern area, including its coastline, have been published. Eaton has produced a fascinating account of the archaeology of the coast from Laguna Terminos north and east beyond Rio Lagartos, having walked or canoed the entire distance, some 800 km.34 He recorded sites not only in the beach zone but in the adjacent inland swamps also; the sites include Pre- classic shell middens and fishing hamlets as well as salt- production centers. Unfortunately this publication is a truncated version of the original account, from which editing has removed valuable data as well as much of Eaton's interpretation. A companion monograph in the same volume by Ball presents a type-variety analysis of the pottery collected by Eaton and constructs a sequence 31. R. E. W.

A contrasting survey, long awaited, is H. E. D. Pol- lock's study of the sites and architecture of the Puuc zone.35 His fieldwork was carried out in the 1930s for the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and this is now nearly the last of the great reports of that estimable ar- chaeological research group. Some 7,000 sq. km. and 140 sites are reported on, with reliable and very well done maps and a characteristically meticulous and de- tailed architectural analysis of buildings within specific sites. The book is excellently printed and illustrated. It lacks much theoretical orientation and there is little at- tempt to elicit patterns from the data beyond the most conservative regularities, but Pollock and his colleagues have once more provided the necessary massive data sample for such theoretical exercises as rank ordering and rank sizing. A slim conference volume on the Puuc adds little that is new; the major point of interest is the agreement of all contributors that Toltec Chichen chronologically over- laps the Puuc centers, a suggestion made by Pollock at least 20 years ago.36 One fascicle of the Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic In- scriptions has been published on material in the region, covering monuments at Itzimte, Pixoy, and Tzum.37 The Archaeological Atlas of Yucatan is another welcome pub- lication, even though it fails to live up to its promise in some ways.38 The maps are based on the 1:1,000,000 Universal Transverse Mercator Series for Yucatan, with the archaeological data superimposed; an accompanying volume explains how the Atlas was produced and how to use it. The sites of Yucatan are divided into four hierarchical categories on the basis of extent and volume of architecture: this arrangement turns out to be amaz- ingly close to the sysem of rank ordering worked out independently for the Rio Bec and Peten zones. The four ranks are plotted on the maps, and considerable discus- sion is given to the settlement pattern, to the integrative device of sacbeob (raised causeways), and to the impli- cations of states of a larger than regional size. 35.

KurJack, Atlas Arqueologico del Estado de Yucatan (INAH: Mexico 1980). Where the Atlas falls short is in the failure to produce at least some site plans by photogrammetric techniques, which would surely work in the low bush country of Yucatan. At least the major fortification features of Uxmal and Chichen Itza might have been tentatively sketched out: they are visible at Uxmal in air photos other than those published. While the authors claim that all 1100 of the sites registered and located could not be published as plans in the Atlas, a fair enough admission, surely representative examples of each of the four ranks, and newly-discovered sites, would have been useful. More detailed analysis and commentary on the air photos published would also have been useful; these quib- bles aside, however, the Atlas is overall a creditable achievement. The final report has now appeared on the intensive architectural excavation of the Monjas, a major palace structure at Chichen Itza, carried out in the 1930s;39 its author, John Bolles, went on to make a career in archi- tecture and has now returned to complete his early en- deavor. The book is spotty in quality: while it is replete with Bolles's own valuable and detailed drawings, plans and photos, the text (produced largely by editorial as- sistants) is rather uninformed and uninformative. De- scription is by architectonic unit rather than building phase and functional complex. However, visual data such as the Puuc-style mural painting of a battle, as well as the architectural detail, make one grateful for Bolles's evident sense of obligation to publish his records. A lengthy and useful study of Jaina figurines is mainly oriented to stylistic description and comparison.40 Corson has done great service in this attempt to salvage some- thing from the haphazard and poorly recorded excava- tions on the cemetery island of Jaina; some 500 figurines were studied in Mexican museum collections, an addi- tional 100 in foreign museums, and about 50 in private collections. All seem to have been from burials, and support Corson's conclusion that the figurines are essen- tially part of a regional mortuary complex. The site of Dzibilchaltun just north of Merida was excavated for nine years, and analysis has gone on for much longer. The settlement-pattern study was published some years ago by Kurjack, and now the main site map and the first volume of excavation reports have appeared. The base map, covering some 19 sq. km., records around 8,400 structures, ranging in size from single room houses 39. J. S.

Although incomplete in the sense that it did not cover the 50 sq. km. intended, and leaves out zones that were undoubtedly part of the site's sustaining area, this is one of the few adequate maps of a major site in northern Yucatan. The forthcoming map of the Komchen zone based on more recent survey will be a useful and welcome addition to it. The volume on excavations, architecture, dating, caches, and burials is jointly authored by E. Wyllys An- drews IV and V, and is the first of several.42 Descriptive presentation is competently handled, and the dating sec- tion, a major revision of the previously-advanced site chronology, brings Dzibilchaltun more into line with other Maya lowland sequences while retaining the unu- sual period terminology. Discussion of the important cor- relation question is cogent and conservative: Andrews V concludes that somewhat ambivalent evidence from the site leans towards the 1 1. 16.0.0.0. correlation. The ear- lier exaggerated population estimates of up to 250,000 are laid quietly to rest by omission, and by Kurjack and Garza's paper published elsewhere indicating a maximum Late Classic population of probably much less than 42,000.43 Dzibilchaltun thus joins the mainstream of Maya cities, more intelligible but no longer unique, and this first volume on its archaeology is a well-produced mine of information. Three small fortified sites in the north of Yucatan are reported by David Webster, who carried out surveys and test excavations.44 Cuca and Chacchob are not far from Dzibilchaltun, while Dzonot Ake is off to the NE. All have fortified keeps with major architecture inside the interior wall, and all of the fortifications seem to date 41. G. E. Stuart, J. C. Scheffler, E. B. Kurjack, and J. W.

Webster analyzes the processual possibilities in the light of the known patterns of Maya warfare, and compares these small centers of elite class refuge to larger sites, both fortified and undefended. The large and important site of Coba (about 18 court- yard groups in size) has been excavated by the Mexican Directorate of Prehispanic Monuments, under the direc- tion of Norberto Gonzalez C. The best summary of the site's characteristics thus far is the paper by Piedad Pen- iche R. and William Folan;4s Coba, set between and around lakes (which may be partly artificial), was a re- gional capital linked to many of its subsidiary centers by the famous network of raised causeways. Foundation in the Preclassic was followed by a Late Classic climax when the population is estimated at ca. 55,000, and when close dynastic ties with centers in Peten existed, although Coba in its northern location was quite distinct in its regionalism. Occupation continued into the Postclassic. Another paper by Folan and others relates the settle- ment pattern and social structure to the observed modern distribution of economically-important trees,46 a plausi- ble if somewhat long conceptual leap. We look forward with anticipation to other studies from this rich and idio- syncratic site. Topical Studies A number of multi-authored volumes have been pub- lished that incorporate the results both of fieldwork and theoretical reassessment of the trajectory of Maya culture history. Most of these have been the concrete end-prod- ucts of conferences, either sessions at general meetings or seminars held to examine a specific problem in depth. For most of the topics discussed below a single book or monograph has appeared, which is considered along with relevant journal contributions. Early Man The first well-dated early-man site in the Maya Area, Los Tapiales in the western highlands of Guatemala, was reported early in the decade and published in 1977. Sub- sequent field work by Kenneth Brown in the Quiche region has shown that numerous aceramic sites exist with characteristic obsidian or chert tools, indicating a wide- 45. P. Peniche Rivero and W.

(radiocarbon years).48 In coastal Belize a 1980 survey by MacNeish, Wilkerson, and Nelken-Terner lo- cated more than 100 aceramic sites, and a sequence of five periods from 9000-2000 b.c. has been suggested by them on the basis of stone-tool typology.49 An initial phase has fishtailed points similar to those from El Inga and Madden Lake, followed by a phase with huge chert blades, then a third marked by stone bowls that suggest an element of sedentism. The fourth phase is suggested as having more developed sedentism and seasonality, including exploitation of marine resources, and the fifth has chipped and ground stone tools closely similar to those of the documented sedentary farmers of the Swasey phase at Cuello, which begins ca. 2000 b.c. Thus, in less than a decade, the entire span of the Maya Area from northern Yucatan through the rainforest zone to the volcanic highlands of southern Guatemala has ac- quired a preceramic and at least partly pre-agricultural past. The implications of this long occupation of the lowlands for theories depicting the Maya as late arrivals in an unsuitable environment are profound: the Maya Area now has as respectable an Archaic sequence as many parts of the New World, and hopes of locating Pleistocene sites are correspondingly higher than they have been for many years. Origins of Maya Civilization Lacking the dramatic appeal of the Classic collapse, the rise of Maya civilization has attracted far less spec- ulation. That a society complex enough to be called civ- ilized existed in the lowlands from the 3rd century A.C. Onwards had long been accepted, and its evolution from a village-farming base was also common ground between all parties. What debate there was centered on the ap- parent speed with which Preclassic village culture, be- ginning only in the mid-lst millennium B.C., had risen to the level of civilization: some scholars (the "highland school") felt that this could only have come about by stimulus diffusion from the longer-occupied and more 47.

A School of American Research Advanced Seminar held in 1974 concluded that the first settlers had entered the lowlands from Chiapas, Guatemala, and Salvador early in the 1st millennium B.C., with a probable move- ment east from the Olmec area into the Usumacinta basin at the same period.50 While there was still a fair chance that the immediate emergence of Classic civilization had been stimulated by immigration from highland Salvador (perhaps as a result of the Ilopango eruption), Late Pre- classic Maya society was also a fairly complex recipient of these external stimuli, with the innate capacity to utilize them. The principal developments since this consensus was established have been the extension back in time of the lowland Preclassic, allowing a much longer and more gradual emergence of complex society without the need for outside stimuli to explain it, and the recognition that Late Preclassic Maya culture had already attained the level of civilization, so that the transition into the Classic was one of cosmetic rather than substantive changes a little additional frosting on an already rather large and solid cake. The lowland Maya culture sequence, which the work of Willey and his colleagues at Barton Ramie, Altar de Sacrificios, and Seibal had extended back into the early Middle Preclassic, with radiocarbon dates in the 7th-8th centuries b.c., was extended further by the discovery of an Early Preclassic occupation at Cuello, Belize, strati- fied below Middle and Late Preclassic and palpably an- cestral to them.51 More than 30 radiocarbon dates from Cuello suggest that this Swasey phase spanned the period 2000-1000 b.c. in radiocarbon years (2500-1300 s.c.on the bristlecone pine calibration curve, in solar/calendar years), and that the Middle Preclassic began around 1000 b.c. New dating of the early Jenney Creek phase at Barton Ramie corroborated this chronology, and the stratigraphic primacy of Swasey over Mamom and Xe-like early Mid- dle Preclassic was confirmed in 1980 excavations at Colha, 27 km. to the SE.52 When Pring first defined the Swasey phase on the basis of the pottery from Cuello, he did not see enough jus- 50.

The greater pottery corpus recovered in the 1978-80 excavations at Cuello, and the unpublished for- mal and functional analyses carried out by Laura Kosa- kowsky have now suggested some criteria for division, including the late appearance of dichrome and negative- resist decorative techniques. Another tentative suggestion has been the definition of a ceramic complex intermediate in age between Swasey and Mamom, conflating the final part of the Swasey phase with its innovative pottery and the initial part of the Middle Preclassic with its apparent ties to the Xe ceramic sphere of the Peten. Both we (REWA and NH) and the Cuello Project and Colha Proj- ect ceramists (Laura Kosakowsky and Fred Valdez, Jr.) are essentially in agreement over this proposal. Even if it is adopted, however, some major Swasey pottery types continue into the new complex, and the rate of change in pottery design during the Early Preclassic still remains markedly less rapid than it became later. Data from a number of sites have emphasized the extent of Olmec penetration east into the lowland Maya regions during the Middle Preclassic: along the Pacific coast the art of Izapa, Abaj Takalik and Chalchuapa show Olmec presence or influence, as may the defenses of Los Nar- anjos, while in the Peten-Belize region a cache of jades at Seibal, several blue jades of possible Olmec origin at Cuello, and the sculptures from Tenosique and Xoc (the latter now looted) indicate Olmec movement of some kind up the Usumacinta basin and across the watershed into the Hondo drainage. A more diffuse Olmecoid influence has been seen in Late Preclassic jade pendants of "bib-head" type from Chichen Itza, Cerros, and Nohmul, and a superb blue jade head of certain Olmec origin was found on Cozumel, albeit in a Late Classic grave. While not all of the pub- lications indicating this Olmec impact on the Maya, as the latter society began its rise to complexity, appeared within our review period, those that have recently been published have filled out and clarified greatly a picture hitherto obscured by paucity of data.53 While as long ago as the mid- 1960s Thompson realized that the Late Preclassic led directly into the Classic with- out any sudden increase in cultural complexity, the extent to which Preclassic Maya culture was organized was still not clear. Recent excavations at Lamanai, Mirador, 53. Norman, op. cit. (in note 4); Graham, op. cit. (in note 6); Sharer, op. cit. (in note 11); Willey, op. cit. (in note 17) 97-98; N.

Hammond, "Preclassic to Postclassic in northern Belize,'' Antiquity 48 (1974) 177-189. Cuello, Cerros, and other sites have demonstrated that massive public buildings were being constructed;54 that organized ceremonial precincts including ball courts forrned the centers of densely populated sites; and that intensive agriculture on raised fields formed at least part of the subsistence framework. 55 The extent of a coherent, complex, and widely-accepted iconography56 on both public buildings and private possessions such as jades attests to the intellectual unity and sophistication of Late Preclassic culture to the extent that "Preclassic Maya civilization is no longer a contradiction in terrns: the outward and visible signs of Classic civilization emerge from an already complex society".57 The Late Preclassic and its roots in the Middle Preclassic promise to be one of the major foci of Maya research in the 1980s. Protoclassic The 'Protoclassic' has always been rather difficult to define, partly because it implicitly meant different things to different workers, but these differences were nowhere made explicit. Willey notes chronological, cultural, and developmental interpretations of the term, and attempts to blend them into a "time of stabilization and crystal- lization" in which "certain cultural forms take on a def- inite 'Classic' appearance" in the period 50 B.C.-250 A.C.58 Within this englobing definition some centers in the Belize borderlands also possessed pottery of the Floral Park complex, which circumstance has been interpreted as marking direct influence and even immigration from the highlands of Salvador. More generally, the Proto- classic saw population maxima and architectural climaxes at a number of sites but identical phenomena occurred at sites where a coeval Late Preclassic occupation existed. The Protoclassic has been rather neglected in print during our review period, apart from two papers by Pring59 (of which one documented the distribution of Floral Park ceramics and argued for an indigenous low- land origin for the ceramic complex as such; the other 54.

This weakening, together with the rise of externally oriented maritime trade routes, led to internal disjunction and susceptibility to outside intervention. Hosler, Sabloff, and Runge63 use a similar model of interlinked trade, resources, external pressure, and elite prestige activities, operating in a context of rising pop- ulation density, to formulate a mathematical simulation that juggles five major variables. They conclude that the growth of a non-agricultural artisan class concentrated in dense suburbs around the ceremonial precincts may have led to overstress, at least locally, on the production and availability of food. A fourth paper in the same volume, by Harrison,64 presents a more ecologically-determined model in which the use of bajo swamps for intensive agriculture was overtaken by silting resulting from overuse of upland milpa land in the face of population pressure. Harrison revives the notion that the bajos were in fact lakes in the Classic period. A later paper by Puleston65 takes an anti-materialist view, pointing out that the Classic collapse was spaced at ca. 13 katuns from the "hiatus" of intermitted cere- monial activity in the late Early Classic, and also 13 katuns before the reputed Itza abandonment of Chichen Itza, which was in turn a similar period away from the fall of Mayapan. Puleston suggested that this cyclical disaster was recognized by the Classic Maya, and became a self-fulfilling prophecy as the unlucky Katun 11 Ahau again came round. Although such fatalism may seem bizarre to us, we know from such later native sources as the Books of Chilam Balam how history and prophecy melded one into the other so that past and future met indivisibly in the present. Cowgill66 reexamines the possibility that warfare be- tween competing Maya polities for hegemony in the for- est zone might have been responsible for the disruptions that caused the system failure of the Classic collapse. He brings in documentary parallels from Imperial China and 63. D. Hosler, J. A. Sabloff, and D.

We feel that this neglect is partly because it is being seen as merely a synonym for the Terminal Preclassic, and partly be- cause professional opinion has shifted away from the notion of direct Salvadorean immigration as an explan- atory mechanism, and towards the idea that the emergent lowland Maya polities drew in disparate artistic stimuli from the highlands, along with more concrete trade goods, and recombined them into a purely lowland ce- ramic style of limited social and spatial distribution. The clear non-congruence between the Protoclassic manifes- tation and the emergence of major centers (such as Tikal and Lamanai) in the terminal Preclassic has removed much of the explanatory value of the Protoclassic as a factor in the creation of Classic Maya civilization, and, in spite of recent renewed discussion, we feel that it is a concept that has outlived its useful span. Collapse The disintegration of Classic Maya civilization in the 8th and 9th centuries A.C. was the subject of a major edited volume in 1973, and subsequent studies have been new departures from the consensus that it embodied. Three papers in the homenaje for Sir Eric Thompson60 employ a systems approach in slightly different ways, and are discussed below. Systems theory, it should be noted, although popular in European and highland Me- soamerican prehistory from the late 1960s onwards, was late in influencing Mayanists. Culbert61 presents Maya culture as a growth system, with a craft production-exchange loop as the deviation- amplifying mechanism leading to increased specialization of producers and the settlements that they lived in; col- lapse was caused by "overshoot", a rate of growth ex- ceeding the rate of increase in subsistence production. Sharer62 employs the opposition of internal versus ex- ternal systems coupled with a stress:response model. He postulates awareness of increased population pressure on subsistence production, but a faulty response that in- vested effort in supernatural appeals and at the same time 60. T. P.

He does not argue for war as a prime mover, but as a destabilizing factor, and to that extent makes a plausible case. Yet another view of the collapse is taken by Hamblin and Pitcher,67 who reassert Eric Thompson's theory of social disintegration, and suggest peasant rebellion against the ruling elite as the principal factor in the collapse. Apart from Puleston's thesis, which looks into the Maya mind for an explanation of why this burgeoning civilization fell apart, none of the more recent models advances beyond the general ambit of Willey and Shimkin's final summary of possible causes in the 1973 volume.68 Studies of the collapse do have to consider a number of well-documented factors high population size and density, increasing social distance in burial pomp between the upper and lower layers in the social pyramidS increasing difference in health status between rulers and ruled indicated by their skeletons, progressive cessation of the erection of dynastic monuments, and final aban- donment of most if not all sites in the tropical forest zone. Population growth followed by rapid depopulation sug- gests overstrain of the subsistence system, either in pro- ductivity or in the managerial apparatus used to get food from producer to consumer in an urbanizing society. Both systems modeling and computer simulation seem likely to have a future in manipulating the several interdepen- dent variables that are gradually becoming better defined in studies of the Classic collapse. Agriculture The new orthodoxy in the field of prehistoric Maya subsistence is codified in Prehispanic Maya Agricul- ture, 69 deriving from a symposium held at the 1976 Paris Congress of Americanists, but with some excision and considerable revision of papers. The current view of an- cient Maya economics, that agnculture was intensive, organized, and probably permanent rather than shifting, is largely the result of work by the contributors to the book published throughout the 1970s, although the stim- ulus to reassess the "milpa model" of shifting swidden farming and dispersed rural settlement, which character- ized the work of Morley and Thompson70 and which was 67.

Three separate summaries, by David R. Harris, Gordon R. Willey, and the editors of the volume, look at all sides of the problem.The consensus is that the Maya employed a range of intensive and extensive tactics to support in- creasingly dense populations from the Late Preclassic onwards. Intensive techniques included the construction of artificial econiches to convert marginal environments into useful ones, the two most striking being the canal- ization and draining of river margins and bajo swamps to create raised and channeled fields (and also fish farms), and the terracing of steep and shallow hill slopes to direct drainage, trap silt, and create fertile areas for cultivation. The shallow slope terracing, however, is not actually necessary, and the interspersion of dwelling compounds suggests rather a planned demarcation of the cleared land and an obvious intention to keep it cleared and in per- manent rotation. The swidden cultivation of milpas tem- porarily cut from the forest is also admitted, with various suggestions about more intensive labor input and crop extraction that will remain archaeologically unprovable. Wiseman advances a model of the "artificial rain forest" in which a high proportion of economically useful trees is sustained by selective culling or positive tending: this approximates to the ruinal recognized by botanists, and its clustering around residential sites is circumstantial evidence for its usefulness to the Maya. The especial utility of the ramon (breadnut) tree as a subsistence sta- ple, here advanced again by Dennis E. Puleston, is not generally accepted although its supplementary use is thought likely. A comparison of Tikal with three coeval Asian tropical forest centers (Angkor, Anuradhapura, and Prambanan) by Bennet Bronson is a welcome broadening of the otherwise narrow focus on the Maya, while within that focus the startling evidence of urban density at Chun- chucmil, in an arid part of the northern Yucatan Penin- sula, is a timely reminder that explanations of Maya settlement pattern must be sought in other fields besides subsistence studies. As a summary of the present mildly radical position of some Mayanists the book is admirable; the savage 71. R. F. Carr and J. E. Hazard, Map of the Ruins of Tikal, El Peten, Guatemala.

Three major sec- tions deal with the theoretical and time-space frameworks within which the topic is studied, regional data syntheses, and various model analogues that might be used to ex- plain the observed data. There is a summarizing review of the rest of the volume by Gordon R. Willey. The book summarizes current knowledge up to the date of the seminar in late 1977, with an historical review of the development of Maya settlement studies by Ashmore and Willey, a discussion of theoretical and methodolog- ical problems by Ashmore, and an outline of geography and chronology by Hammond and Ashmore that includes a synoptic chart of correlated ceramic sequences com- piled by Ball. Two other papers in this section are a minutely-detailed analysis of Group 7F-1 at Tikal, in- terpreted by Haviland as a "dower house" for a deposed lineage of former rulers, and a highly original use of volumetrics to produce a rank-ordering of ceremonial centers based on their architectural mass and layout, by Turner, Turner, and Adams. The regional syntheses cover the Peten, Belize, the Southeast (lower Motagua basin), central Yucatan with south Campeche, southern Quintana Roo, and the north- ern Yucatan Peninsula. Most of them draw theoretical conclusions from the data presented, and several inter- esting ways of looking at the materials are introduced. The overall time span covered is from the Early Preclassic of the second millennium b . c . (radiocarbon years) through the Late Postclassic of the 15th century A.C., with an inevitable concentration on the Late Classic of 600-900 A.C., from which most of the extant settlement data come. The three analogical papers use respectively a model of feudal society derived from medieval history, ethno- graphic analogy with the Baganda of East Africa, and a pilgrimage-fair model invoking a political manipulation of dispersed residence. Willey in his conclusion considers that neither of the first two gives enough emphasis to trade as a dynamic factor in the development of Maya society, although it has also been overemphasized in the past as a prime mover. Willey's view is that complex society emerged without trade being a crucial factor, but that in the Late Classic differentiation between centers, and particularly the rapid growth of some, was a result of their commercial importance. The parallels with the Mediterranean entrepots such as Genoa and Venice in the 16th century remains unremarked by any of the con- tributors: the fashion for citing Fernand Braudel's work on this period has not yet swept the Maya lowlands. This volume apart, the period 1976-1980 has seen few significant publications on settlement patterns as such, although settlement forms part of the subject-matter of many of the site monographs discussed above. Probably review by Sanders is a cogent restatement of the con- servative position, which Harrison and Turner again re- fute in their reply to him.72 A major advance since the publication of the volume has been the use of synthetic-aperture sidelooking air- borne radar to detect patterns of ancient canals and raised- field complexes in Peten and northern Belize. Five areas in which man-made alteration of wetlands was detected by radar have been confirmed by ground checks, and a detailed comparison by Vernon Scarborough of surface phenomena, many modern, with the radar data around Cerros, northern Belize, suggests that about 25% of de- tected patterns are of prehispanic Maya origin.73 Well-preserved carbonized plant remains have been reported for the first time from the tropical forest zone of the Maya lowlands, including a sequence of maize types documenting the manipulation of Zea mays over the period 2000 b.c. (radiocarbon years) to 200 A.C.; a small-cobbed popcorn, comparable with that found by MacNeish at the same period in highland Mexico, de- veloped by the end of the Late Preclassic into a larger and presumably more productive flint corn comparable with the Nal-Tel of the Classic period.74 The use of flo- tation at Cuello, northern Belize, resulted also in the recovery of cotton from the Late Preclassic period, a variety of tree crops throughout the Preclassic, and rinds that may be attributable to the husk and bean of cacao from the Early Preclassic onwards. The positive identi- fication of a complete cacao bean advanced in preliminary reports, however, is currently considered doubtful. The overall range of plants exploited by the Preclassic Maya was, as might have been expected, close to that docu- mented for later penods; beans and ramon have not yet been recovered.

The icon- ographic-epigraphic study by Marcus78 seeks to relate settlement pattern to an ideal model of political organization. Important papers include those by D. S. Rice on the Middle Preclassic settlement of northeast Peten, and by Henderson et al. on the peripheral Valley of Naco; in northern Yucatan there are those by Andrews V and Kurjack on boundary maintenance at some sites in NW Yucatan, by Webster on three walled sites further to the east, and by Folan and others on the distribution of eco- nomically useful trees relative to socially stratified set- tlement at Coba.79 Several recent studies by Rice and Rice of the Peten savannas80 have shown only marginal use, mainly at the Late Classic population maximum, with a preference for small mosaic areas of interdigitating savanna and forest over larger open savanna areas. Some water-management features have been located, but a prin- cipal use for the grasslands may well have been the em- parkment of deer. Preliminary reports have appeared on the settlement pattern studies of Quirigua and Copan,81 in which the respective difficulties of deep enshrouding alluvium and a narrow valley environment are discussed.

Social Organization For some years past it has been generally recognized that Classic Maya society was stratified and secular: the priest-peasant structure idealized by Thompson and Mor- ley has failed to match the range of recent evidence dem- onstrating that a complex hierarchical composition existed. The history of the priest-peasant model has now been analyzed by Becker,82 who attributes its success to Thompson's personal character and literary persuasive- ness. The new model of Maya society began to emerge in the 1960s with the epigraphic breakthroughs of Pros- kouriakoff and Berlin,83 demonstrating a dynastic and secular historical content to the monumental inscriptions, while the dense semi-urban populations indicated by the Tikal survey84 required a different explanatory model from the "empty town" one compatible with the Thomp- son-Morley vision of society Recognition of occupational specialization within the middle levels of ancient Maya society came in the early 1970s in papers by Adams and Becker,85 and field data in the period under review have continued to confirm the importance of specialized and probably fulltime occu- pations. The massive chert-tool workshops at Colha, northern Belize, have been intensively studied by Hester and his associates, while an obsidian worker's shop at nearby El Pozito has also been excavated.86 The intro- 82.

Ceramic produc- tion and trade have been the focus of several projects, most still awaiting publication at the end of 1980. An early application of neutron-activation analysis to the identification of local pottery production at Lubaantun, and a diachronic study of whiteware production in the Valley of Guatemala appeared during the review period,88 but some of Rand's and Bishop's pioneering work on ceramics from the Palenque region had already been pub- lished before 1976, while the major study on Fine Paste wares in the Usumacinta basin was still in press in 1980. The relationship between settlement and social struc- ture has been examined closely by Haviland, using the Tikal data: his analyses of the non-elite Group 2G-1 and the elite "dower house" Group 7F-1 have circulated among scholars and been used in general discussions for some years. The only publications to appear within our review period, however, are a discussion of Tikal elite genealogies and the analysis of Group 7F- 1 . 89 Haviland's model of Tikal society as patrilineal, patrilocal, and pa- triarchal has been current for more than a decade: the recent studies by Jones of the Late Classic rulers of Tikal and Coggins of the Middle Classic succession both con- firm and amplify the model in its elite sector.90 A major series of studies on Palenque, including de- cipherments of substantial royal genealogies from the Cross Group temples and the Temple of the Inscriptions, has appeared in the successive volumes of the Mesa Re- donda de Palenque, privately produced by Merle Greene Robertson but now usefully reissued by the University of Texas Press.91 The most active contributors have been Schele, Mathews, and Lounsbury, who have together elucidated a dynastic history for Palenque spanning the 7th and 8th centuries A.C., with a recorded but partly mythical account for earlier periods. A long-drawn-out dispute with Ruz,92 the excavator of the tomb under the Temple of the Inscriptions, over the age of the ruler buried there (identified as Lord Shield Pacal by the Schele group and attributed an age of 83 at death) has not yet been resolved by reanalysis of the skeletal remains, al- though the death of Ruz has ended the argument. Among the important conclusions of the Schele group is the identification of a female ruler at Palenque, as opposed to the succession of a male through his mother, as ad- duced at Tikal; whether Lady Zac Kuk was a unique instance of female rulership among the Maya remains to be seen. , . C eramles Maya archaeologists continue to work within the con- ceptual framework of the type:variety system, an hier- archical model based on surface finish, color, and treatment of the vessel that was adopted for the Maya lowlands in the mid-1960s,93 and which began to have an impact on the monographic literature in the early 1970s. Since Adams's Altar de Sacrificios report the format for type description has been refined by Sabloff at Seibal94 by the addition of principal identifying modes that bring back one of the advantages of modal analysis as practiced by earlier workers. A lumping approach to ceramic groups was suggested by Hammond in the Lu- baantun report.95 Since 1976 the most important publication in the field of Maya ceramic studies has been Gifford's long-awaited 87.

The 1976 monograph presents not only the type descriptions and comparative material, but also a selection of Gifford's theoretical writings on ceramics; the Barton Ramie sequence itself is the key to the Belize Valley chronology (which subsequent excavation sug- gests begins with early Jenney Creek before 1000 b.c. [radiocarbon years]), and it has close parallels with the sequence in northern Belize elucidated by Pring.98 In northern Belize an Early Preclassic was identified at the Cuello site,99 with associated ceramics of the Swasey complex which are clearly ancestral to the succeeding Lopez Mamom. Indigenous development of Maya low- land ceramics from at least the early 2nd millennium b.c. is indicated by the Cuello sequence, but the ultimate origin of Maya ceramic technology remains unknown. The presence of a preceramic period in the lowlands makes autochthonous development a possibility. In general, the time has come for a reassessment of the type:variety schema, both in its overall utility and in the validity of its constituent assumptions. Many typolog- ical and chronological differences between sites may be a result less of real distinctions than a lack of direct comparison of adequate collections. The regional ce- ramics conferences now in the planning stage should be of great value in consolidating the knowledge of Maya pottery that has been gained over the past 15 years. Lithics Although most site monographs had traditionally in- cluded a section on chipped-stone tools, only complete tools and ceremonial objects such as "eccentric flints" were accorded serious attention, and the studies were morphological rather than functional in emphasis. The first use-wear studies of Maya "flint" (actually chert) tools were carried out by Richard Wilk in the early 1970s on some of Willey's material from Barton Ramie and Seibal, and were published during the review period.l°° Wilk also carried out a pioneering intensive study of a single chert-tool workshop, Structure 100 at Colha, northern Belize, including a consideration of core-re- duction strategies and debitage analysis. l°l The discovery of Colha, described by the late Donald Crabtree as "one of the most important lithic sites in the World," led to the first conference specifically devoted to Maya lithic studies, held in Belize and partly at Colha in 1976. This meeting in turn led to the current major project at Colha, the first intensive study of a chert-factory site. 102 Among the important results so far is the demonstration that pro- duction had reached industrial levels of output as early as the Late Preclassic (400 b.c.-250 A.C.), and prelim- inary reports have outlined a detailed occupation se- quence and established that large quantities of tools were exported into neighboring parts of Belize. Sheets' s intensive study of the highland obsidian-based industry of Chalchuapa was published in 1977, and is important for its descriptive and methodological clar- ity;l03 obsidian industries from lowland sites published include those from Seiball04 and northern Campeche.l°5 Trade A focus both on the mechanisms and the materials of ancient Maya exchange systems has been apparent throughout the 1970s. In the first half of the decade im- portant publications included Rathje's influential model of negative resources as the mover in establishing com- plex social administration, the preliminary volume of the Cozumel report, testing an explicit model of trade facil- ities and their relation to political power, and the general volume Ancient Civilization and Trade, which included both general models and specific discussions relevant to Maya prehistory. 106 100.

The detection of trade networks by source character- ization of obsidian has continued to make progress: the obsidian-trade model advanced by Hammond in 1972 has continued to be confirmed in its essentials, with modi- fication and refinement by the author and others. 109 Source analyses from a preceramic site in the highland zone demonstrate long-distance procurement at an early period,ll° while increasingly precise definition of source characteristics has also continued with the work of Stross, Asaro, Michel, and their associates.1ll The volume on the Belize lithics conference includes several studies of obsidian trade, including a detailed account of Palenque obsidians by Johnson. 112 Consideration of the individual site reports collectively indicates a Middle Preclassic use of the San Martin Jilotepeque source NW of Guatemala City, with a branching net of distribution routes into the lowlands that is essentially congruent with that already known for the Late Preclassic and later dispersal of El Lamberg-Karlovsky, eds., Ancient Civilization and Trade (University of New Mexico Press: Albuquerque 1975). 107.

The complementarity of the over- land-riverine Chayal network to the riverine-coastal Ixte- peque distribution route to the east is borne out by recent work. Finally, a very useful collection of republished papers on Mesoamerican obsidian includes some Maya material and a comprehensive bibliography.ll3 Although Maya trade patterns have thus been further documented, there has been little advance in the theo- retical consideration of exchange during the review pe- riod; probably the most significant move has been the explicit recognition of the importance of marine routes around the Yucatan Peninsula in Preclassic and Classic times, and the role of seaborne commerce, exemplified in the "maritime adaptations" of a symposium volume edited by Stark and Voorhies.ll4 Warfare The notion of warfare as an adaptive mechanism in the development of complex societies dates back to at least the late l9th century, while the existence of conflict among the Classic Maya was simply assumed by early explorers such as John Lloyd Stephens as an explanation for apparently defensive constructions at sites such as Copan and Tulum. While an historicist interpretation of Classic monuments and inscriptions held sway, so also did a view of ancient Maya society that drew many of its notions from the better-known civilizations of the Middle East and Mediterranean zone. A technical discussion of military iconography was published in 1932 by Follett, and the discovery of the Becan fortifications and the Bonampak murals with their lively battle scene amplified the range of knowledge,lls but over the same period the idealistic vision of Maya culture developed by J. E. S. Thompsonll6 led to an accepted model of a peaceful theocratic society which prevailed in the later 1940s and 1950s. The existence of Postclassic warfare was acknowledged and attributed to cultural intrusion from highland Mesoamerica. One result was the assumption that manifestations of conflict in the 113. T. R .

The exclusion of warfare from Classic Maya culture led to its being considered as only an explanation for specific events, such as the "collapse" at the end of the Classic,ll7 and not as part of the deep structure of the processes that had resulted in the emergence and flo- rescence of Classic civilization. Such ideas were, how- ever, being advanced in the late 1960s by Carneiro1l8 and others, and when field investigations at Becan dem- onstrated that the massive moat there dated to the early Classic or earlier, they were swiftly adopted. The emergence of warfare as a prime mover, albeit primus inter pares, in the emergence of Maya civilization is principally the work of Webster, 1 19 who excavated the Becan defences in 1970. He sees it as "an essential factor in the political definition of the various subregions of the lowlands . . directly related to the ability of a number of organizational centers not only to expand successfully but to assimilate defeated groups under their own political control'',120 essentially a restatement of Carneiro's cir- cumscription hypothesis. Similarly, Webster's model for the development of a militarily powerful elite, with tem- porary role adoption becoming both permanent and he- reditary, derives from the documented rise of the lugal in third-millennium Mesopotamia. In both cases Webster challenges, by going beyond, the idealized model of Maya culture and shows that its apparent uniqueness was illusory: the Maya are not an exception to the general rule of "cultural causality and law" propounded by Julian H. Steward in 1949. Webster's two publications appeared at the beginning of the quinquennium under consideration in this review: other contributors to The Origins of Maya Civilizationl21 were immediately persuaded of the validity of his thesis and modified their published post-seminar views to em- brace it. Adams122 argues for warfare as being an aris- tocratic occupation unrelated to the basic structure of 117. J. A. Sabloff and G. R.

While admitting that massive investment in fortifications is incongruent with such a model, Adams maintains that in general "there is no indication of highly organized state-level warfare with standing armies, sophisticated tactics, and anything ap- proaching large-scale casualties' s . 123 Demarestl24 argues that Webster's and Adams's views can be productively reconciled by regarding warfare on this limited scale as a deviation-amplifying rather than a homeostatic subsystem, "a crucial factor in reinforcing the prestige and power of local chiefs-thereby precip- itating the rise of more complex state-like political or- ganization,''l25 reflecting Webster'sl26 observation that small-scale conflict may nevertheless have major con- sequences. Demarest also introduces the idea of differing intensities of conflict varying with the closeness of re- lationship between groups, suggesting that within the southern lowlands there was a community of culture that resulted in warfare, although fierce and endemic, being kept at a level that did not disrupt the stability of society (thereby echoing Adams's interpretation), while between larger regions, such as the Peten and the Rio Bec zone, warfare was open, savage, and unrestrained. Such an interpretation would perhaps explain the ex- istence of the Becan fortifications, while in so doing it implicitly introduces the concept of interregional conflict into the model of emerging Classic civilization an idea not incompatible with Ball's model of fissioning groups populating the lowlands rapidly during the Middle and Late Preclassic. If anything, Demarest's model suggests that the Choloid and Yucatec divisions of the lowland Maya, separated from a common stock centuries earlier, came into collision in the central lowlands towards the end of the Late Preclassic; other evidence indicates a northward expansion of the Choloid peoples during the Middle Classic, followed in the Terminal Classic by a reciprocal southward movement of Yucatec population and culture as the Peten polities collapsed. The detection of defensive walls at several Classic sites in Yucatanl27 suggests that conflict in that region was also becoming severe enough for investment in permanent defenses to 123.

Overall, the past five years' publications have shown that warfare has rapidly become an accepted part of our range of considered topics. Evidence for its existence has been diligently pursued in field survey, and the impli- cations of conflict both for the evolution and the disso- lution of Classic Maya society continue to be explored. lconography As with our understanding of some important features of the ancient Maya infrastructure, that of the icono- graphic codes that expressed the ideas of Classic society has undergone a revolution in the 1970s. Monumental sculpture had already in the 1960s been recognized as secular and dynastic in its content and motivation, as a result of the historical interpretation of the inscriptions on stelae, altars, and other public monuments engendered by Proskouriakoff and Berlin.128 A major shift in the availability of material came about in the 1970s as moves to halt the looting of monuments began to take effect (and the number of monuments left to loot declined dras- tically), and the looter/dealer/collector complex began instead to concentrate on portable antiquities, especially figured polychrome vessels of Late Classic date. The destruction of sites in search of well-stocked tombs has exceeded even the damage done by monument looters; it has brought on to the market and to the attention of those scholars who deal with unprovenanced material several thousand vessels, mainly cylinder vases with wrap-around scenes. Numerous faked or heavily re- painted vases have also aITived on museum shelves and in print, and the prospect of inadvertently using unreal data is beginning to worry some scholars. The major contributor to the study of iconography on unprovenanced vases has been Michael D. Coe, whose three books of 1973, 1975 and 1978129 form a coherent body of iconographic theory. Coe's premise, outlined in the first volume and elaborated with further illustration in the others, is that the scenes depicted on vases, many of which were assumed to be genre depictions of ancient Maya life, are in fact episodes from a lost set of myths and show events in the underworld. The Popol Vuh of the highland Quiche Maya is seen as a surviving fragment 128. Proskouriakoff, op. cit. (in note 83); Berlin, op. cit. (in note 83). 129. M. D. Coe, The Maya Scribe and His World (Grolier Club: New York 1973); idem, Classic Maya Pottery at Dumbarton Oaks (Dum- barton Oaks: Washington, D.C. 1975); idem, Lords of the Underworld (Princeton University Press: Princeton 1978). of this epic cycle, and Coe has shown that many of the vase-paintings are congruent with events described in the Popol Vuh. He has also examined the painted glyphs around the rims of many vessels, and shown that a limited range of signs is used in what he calls the "Primary Standard Sequence"; this sequence, he argues, is likely to have been part of a funerary text or incantation. It does not appear on the monuments in historical texts, and to that extent Coe's assertion is borne out. Certainly the late Sir Eric Thompson's opinion that the glyphs on vases were meaningless decoration can no longer be sustained, and Coe's chthonic interpretation of the subject-matter of the scenes is the most plausible yet advanced. A carefully-documented argument that some vessels, nevertheless, depicted human and historical events has been made by Adams, using the noted "Altar Vase" and 17 associated vessels from a legitimately-excavated dou- ble burial at Altar de Sacrificios as evidence. 130 Properly documented vessels are of inestimable value, both be- cause of their undoubted genuineness and because of their associated finds and circumstances of burial. For the "Altar Vase" a combined historical and mythical mean- ing seems likely, while the manufacture of the vessel for use in the specific funeral ritual during which it was buried is certain. Jacinto Quirarte, in the tradition of art history, has suggested that vase paintings include not only specific reference to events in lost epics, but that general depic- tions of underworld activities are also shown: a class of vessels with processions of deities and supernaturals com- bines animal and human figures and attributes in varying combinations . 131 Vase painting apart, the major studies of Classic Maya iconography have been carried out either at Palenque or by scholars involved in the successive Mesas Redondas de Palenque. Merle Greene Robertson has been an in- fluential figure in stimulating both trends, and Linda Schele, Peter Mathews, and Floyd Lounsbury the leading students of the iconographic-epigraphic complex of Late Classic royal art at Palenque. A major result of this con- centration on a single site with abundant sculptural and textual evidence in situ has been the suggested record of a dynasty, some of whose rulers can be given Maya names close to those to which they may originally have answered: Pacal, "shield", whose name is represented 130.

The mythic nature of the dynasty's ancestors, and the enrollment of the gods into the iconographic underwriting of its rule, are among other important findings. The existence of a Late Preclassic iconography of an elaborate nature, closely related to that of the Classic period and with origins in a Middle Preclassic substratum best known at present from Olmec art, has been dem- onstrated in findings at several sites in northern Belize, including Cerros, Cuello, Lamanai, and Nohmul;132 at Cerros and Lamanai substantial architecture with mod- eled stucco ornament in the form of deity masks has been uncovered, and at Lamanai133 and at El Mirador134 in NE Peten massive pyramids more than 33 m. high have been firmly dated to the Late Preclassic. The Preclassic origins of Classic Maya iconography promise to be one of the more popular and productive of research areas in the 1980s. Writing While numerous papers have dealt with the subject- matter of Maya inscriptions in recent years, including further calendric studies (of which the paper by Closs reaffirming the essential validity of the Thompson cor- relation should be notedl35) and decipherments of dy- nastic texts, there has been little published on the nature of the script itself. The major contribution has been David Kelley's Deciphering The Maya Script, a portmanteau of chapters and articles composed over a period of years, and in some cases reworked from his published pieces of the early 1960s. 136 The reworking has been successful, however, and the book hangs together reasonably well. The two major sections deal with the decipherment of specific glyphs and with general problems in decipher- ment. In the first section, numbers, being certain and uncontroversial, are dealt with in half a dozen pages, while the correlation question is introduced by outlining the entire range of logically feasible (and some illogically suggested) schemes and noting which are incompatible with specific criteria. Kelley makes it clear that docu- mentary evidence and the astronomical data in the Dres- 132. Freidel, op. cit. (in note 24); Hammond, 1974 and 1980 op. cit. (in note 53); Pendergast, op. cit.

He strives so hard to be impartial that his own opinions (otherwise well-known) fail to emerge, although the acute observation that "it is surprising how little solid information is available . . about Maya astronomy''137 which appears some pages later, betokens a welcome sobriety. His matching of the Paris Codex zodiac with the earlier sculptural material on the Monjas at Chichen Itza is persuasive, and his sifting of the accumulative contributions of Seler, Schellhas, Zimmerman, Thomp- son, and others in the section on deities is thorough (though with a surprising lack of reference to Thompson' s study of Itzam Na). As one of the principal advocates of a phonetic struc- ture in Maya writing, Kelley's views are of considerable interest. While much of this section of the book is devoted to criticism of Thompson's work, the position presented by Kelley is less extreme than might be expected. He feels that few glyphs apart from the numbers can be divorced from the linguistic background of the writers; that the Maya script, in fact, was language-bound and could not be used for cross-linguistic purposes (unlike the ideographic-pictographic script of the Mixtecs and Aztecs, which was, he feels, a deliberate construction for linking disparate monolingual peoples within the Mexican highland oikumene). Nevertheless, Kelley agrees that much of the script is logographic, but not acrophonic, and that the mixture of phonetic and logo- graphic elements, in which many very common gra- phemes are used non-phonetically, accords with Knorosov's theoretical premise that Maya writing is a "naturally formed code". Long and well-illustrated sec- tions dealing with grammar, structural analysis, and his- torical data ensure that Kelley' s book will remain a standard source on Maya writing for decades, worthy of being shelved alongside the works of Morley, Thompson, and Ian Graham. Archaeoastronomy No synthesizing study of Maya astronomy has ap- peared since Thompson's paper for the Royal Society in 1974:138 the status quo, which has persisted since then, is that accurate observation of the Moon and Venus is demonstrated by the codices, especially the Dresden, and the probable origin in the Classic period of that docu- ment' s style corroborates the evidence of the monumental 137.

The sun was also observed, the length of the solar year built into the Classic Maya calendar, and the sun's trajectory across the sky from east to west made the major axis of Maya cosmography, as discussed by Brotherston and by Coggins. 139 North and south are better seen as the "right" and "left" sides of that trajectory, and the solar circuit is completed by the night transit through the un- derworld to the gates of dawn. The structure of the Tikal twin-pyramid groups may reflect this concept;140 the im- plications of such a vertical-circle model for cosmo- graphic interpretations based on a quadripartite horizontal . . clrca .e are serlous. The changing orientation of buildings at Maya sites in accordance with a progressive shift in some astronomical or magnetic phenomenon used as a marker has been noted at several sites, following Fuson's original observations on Chichen Itza and the detection of the same change in superimposed houses at Nohmul.14l The use of a mag- netic "compass" by the Preclassic and later Maya for such purposes is possible, on the Olmec evidence, but so far lacks positive proof. Astronomy and cosmography were inextricably fused in the Maya mind. The most recent and ambitious ex- amination of the astronomical identities of Mesoamerican (including Maya) gods is that by Kelley,142 which goes far beyond the bounds of current consensus. He suggests that gods were named from their "birth-dates" in the 260-day cycle of the Sacred Round, in a cycle beginning on 12 Lamat 1 Pop, and that the intervals from that base date were such as to match "approximately or exactly with the synodic periods of the various planets or phase phenomena of the Moon," so "that certain calendar names with notable connections to specific Mesoameri- can gods lie from the base at intervals that are associated astronomically with the cycles of specific planets". On this basis he links Quetzalcoatl with Mercury rather than Venus, and conjoins the feathered serpent with the 139. G.

In all three cases these iden- tifications presuppose observations of the planets in ques- tion, and in this assertion Kelley departs radically from Thompson and from the most recent paper by Lounsbury, (itself a valuable rescension of Maya numeration, nu- merology, and calendric computation with a useful ex- egesis of the relevant material in the Dresden Codex). 143 Mars is identified with the sky peccary, lord of the month Zip in the Dresden Codex, while Venus, the best-attested of the planets in the Maya codices, Kelley links to a range of Aztec gods and also Hun Ahau of the Yucatec chthonic pantheon. Other sections consider lunar and eclipse deities and solar gods, with a discussion of the dating of the suc- cessive World Ages and a suggestion that Chimalpahin avoided a clash with the Inquisition by shifting his dates for the ages in a way that only the initiate would see through. Kelley's overall thesis is that the Mesoamerican calendar was the invention of a single mind, and not simply an accretion of folk methods of measuring time given a civilized gloss. The invisible phenomenon of conjunction rather than the visible one of heliacal rising is the vital criterion, pace Thompson, and both the in- tervals and the geometry of eclipses were understood to a far greater extent than has been supposed. The eclipse and Venus tables in the Dresden Codex cannot be seen as Late Classic or post-Classic achievements, but as tardy survivals of a long-established cosmogony. Kelley's ar- gument, with weak links that even its author acknowl- edges, is a complex and profound one that must receive serious scrutiny in the future. Discussion Several trends and changes are noteworthy beyond those commented on above. Before 1960, the field was dominated by Harvard-trained personnel and those who had worked for the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Division of Historical Research (housed on the Harvard campus adjacent to the Peabody Museum). 144 One change is the transition to the post-Carnegie generation: while many senior Mayanists still active worked with the Car- negie group in one way or another, the dispersion of that group and the continued entry of new blood from uni- versities and institutions not previously engaged in the 143.

(in note 1).</page><page sequence="26">512 Maya Archaeology, 1976-1980: a Review of Major PublicationslAdams and Hammond field have led to a diversity of views and approaches and the establishment of Maya studies at centers across the country. This diversity is reflected in the publications of the past quinquennium. There is also a greater sophis- tication in theory, field techniques, and analytical meth- ods: the introduction of airborne radar scanning in survey, Harris matrices in stratigraphic recording, rank-ordering in urban studies, and use-wear detection in lithic analysis, together with the institution of experimental replication of features and controlled experiments in subsistence studies, have greatly broadened the resources available to the Maya archaeologist. The use of general systems theory, computer simulation, numerical indexing and extrapolation, and more precise work in ethnohistory and the use of analogy, have all strengthened the theoretical base. In addition to these outsider approaches, advances in the understanding of Maya texts have led both to fur- ther decipherment and to the use of textual material for interpreting settlement and social structure. The broader, less coherently focused approach engen- dered by this new diversity has stimulated new ways of reaching consensus and achieving interaction: scholarly meetings have continued to fulfill their traditional func- tion of providing a general forum, but more important in some ways has been the series of intensive and tightly focused small symposia, archetypal among which are the School of American Research Advanced Seminars which have yielded a sequence of books examining the origins and collapse of Maya civilization and lowland settlement patterns; scrutiny of the Postclassic period is the next topic due. As important a feature of recent publications as the formal and often overdue final report has been the interim report: these have become increasingly common, longer, and more detailed, with a production quality ranging from samizdat to final book form. Such interim reports are usually produced six to 12 months after the end of field work, and often comprise a series of data-oriented papers with an interpretive summary. While their hazards in- clude hasty editing, dim illustrations, and lack of con- clusiveness in data analysis or theoretical formulation, the development is laudable for placing recent material in the public record, and for making quantities of research data available years before the final report. Less desirable is the in-house, unrefereed final report: at this level the tolerable inadequacies of the interim report become unacceptable, with rambling pages of dis- cussion and data that should have been summarized or mercilessly edited. A final report should undergo the most careful scrutiny to achieve as high a quality of presentation, analysis, interpretation and illustration as possible: comparison of the classic monographs of the Carnegie Institution of Washington with some recent products is soberly instructive. There are, however, plenty of reports that maintain a high standard and give hope for the future in spite of the appalling increase in publishing costs. While Camegie-style monographs now seem likely to be replaced by data-file references or mi- crofiches supplementing a short letter-press synthesis of a project's results, archaeologists are still managing to disseminate their data and ideas ever more frequently and voluminously, if the publications of the past five years are anything to go by.145 145.
