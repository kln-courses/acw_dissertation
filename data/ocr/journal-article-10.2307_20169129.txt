<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Early Greek P?lladion: Two Bronze Statuettes in America Beth Cohen This study focuses on the only two Archaic Palladia in American museums. Significantly, both these small bronzes, which stand on bases and may recall lost early cult statues, wear the low-crested, open-faced Illyrian helmet?a contem porary casque of male warriors. This helmet, unusual for a female character, distinguishes these Athena statuettes from depictions of the Archaic Athenian goddess wearing an invented, so-called Attic helmet with a high crest. Athena in an Illyrian helmet?an ancient tradition that apparently began on the Peloponnesos and spread to northern Greece? may have persisted in local cult imagery even as the Athenian typology became canonical for this omnipresent goddess. The legendary Palladion was a protective talisman sacred to Athena that was originally housed in the goddess's temple at Troy.1 The Trojan Palladion's supposedly long and complex ancient history as well as its presumed visual appearance are recorded variously in Classical texts. According to Apollodoros, this primitive image, which fell from the sky, safeguarded the city from defeat until the Greek warriors Odysseus and Diomedes stole it.2 From Augustan times comes Vergil's famous description of the Palladion as a statue of Athena, whose awesome power was revealed after the theft: . . . salt sweat poured across its body and quivering flames blazed from its staring eyes; and then, amazingly, three times the goddess herself sprang from the ground with trembling shaft and shield.3 A picture of how Classical Greek and Roman artists visualized the legendary Trojan Palladion emerges from depictions of its theft preserved in vase painting, sculpture, and wall painting.4 Although details vary, these artists generally represented the Palladion as a small, hieratic statue depicting the helmeted goddess Athena standing with both feet together and wearing a long dress, carrying a shield, and brandishing a spear. Cult images with palladion-like features also appear in the context of other Trojan stories, including the rape of Kassandra (cf. fig. 9) and Menelaos's pursuit of Helen after the Trojan war.5 In such representations, Classical artists tended to construct purposely old-fashioned-looking cult statues that probably evoked primitive images from generations past still to be seen in the ancient world.6 In nineteenth-century scholarship, the term pal ladion was inclusively applied to all rigid, early images of a helmeted, armed human figure wearing a long dress. This class was generally identified with Athena even though several female deities, including Artemis and Aphrodite, could bear a shield and spear, and the male deity Apollo could also bear the arms of a Greek warrior while wearing a long garment.7 The known findspots in Greece and Sicily of bronze statuettes of palladion type, dating from the seventh to the sixth century B.c., suggest that these bronzes were generally dedicated in sanctuaries,8 and thus they have often been believed to be reflections of now-lost cult images rather than direct representations of a deity. By the end of the sixth century, palladion statuettes were supplanted by a sculpturally more advanced type?somewhat arbitrarily distinguished as promachos (warlike) in modern scholarship?that depicts the armed goddess Athena striding into battle in an active pose.9 The present study will examine the only two bronze palladion statuettes from Archaic Greece in the collections of American museums (figs. 1-6). Earlier scholarship on small bronze palladia has generally been concerned with either stylistic and typological analysis or their associations with lost cult images. Beyond reconsidering these widely discussed aspects, my particular focus will be to shed new light on the way the statuettes in America are armed?a feature of critical importance in the art and cult of early Greece. The bronze statuette at the Walters Art Gallery since 1929 (figs. 1-3) has become well known through The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery 55/56 (1997/1998) 11</page><page sequence="2">Figs. 1-3.

Sackler Museum by Jerome B. Spier in memory of George Hanfmann in 1984 (figs. 4-6). Harvard's palladion, which is only 8.6 cm high, appears to have been made in Thessaly before the middle of the sixth century B.c.12 Publication of Harvard's unusual statuette invites taking a fresh look at the Walters bronze. The Walters statuette (figs. 1-3), solid cast together with its three-tiered base, now has a dark brown patina, with traces of lighter brown, red, and green in pitted areas. The frontal female divinity in this helmeted image wears a sleeved tunic and stands with her feet together; her arms, raised to bear shield and spear, are now denuded of separately fashioned military para phernalia. The goddess's spear arm is bent sharply upward; the missing weapon was originally inserted through a hole in the clenched right fist. Devoid of the shield, her now-exposed left arm is unnaturally short and extends forward at an exceptionally high level, making the figure's upper torso appear lopsided. An open-faced helmet reveals the highly plastic features of this palladion's face, which together with the battle-ready position of her arms imparts an air of eager alertness to this otherwise motionless figure. Her bulging almond-shaped eyes, framed by heavy upper and lower lids, are set beneath a strongly arched brow; her pointed nose, projecting directly from the brow, stops just short of her pursed lips. No visible locks of long hair extend beneath her helmet. This palladion's skin-tight garment conforms to the well-modeled breasts and buttocks of her otherwise slab-like body. Oddly, the neckline is not delineated, in contrast to the edges of the garment's short sleeves and the bottom of its skirt, arcing over the palladion's feet. The goddess's waist is girded by a heavy belt, 12</page><page sequence="3">Figs. 4-6. Bronze palladion statuette of Athena. Greek, Thessalian. Cambridge, Mass., inv. 1984.818, Gift of Jerome B. Spier in honor of Professor George Hanfmann. Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Harvard University, decorated with a row of circles bounded by straight lines and (presumably) tied with its ends hanging at the front. The Harvard statuette (figs. 4-6), which is also solid cast together with a base, has a green patina, with areas of brown, particularly in indented gashes on the body, on the left arm and on the base. This rigidly erect, angular little figure is as foresquare in conception as its simple low base. The palla dion's helmeted head is far too large for its body. No locks of hair from a female coiffure pro trude beneath the lower edge of the open-faced helmet, and the face, which is rudimentarily indi cated, is hardly feminine, save for its lack of a beard. The straight nose and projecting ridge of the brow are the most prominent facial features. The mouth is but a gash above the heavy, squared off chin. This palladion's sleeved tunic extends clear down to the base?the statuette has no feet. The front and side profiles of the body are so flat that its rounded buttocks are the most pronounced anatomical feature. As in all examples of the palladion type, the deity's arms obviously are positioned to bear now-lost weapons. The spear arm is extended laterally at shoulder height and bent upward in a sharp angle at the elbow. Originally, insertion of a spear through a hole in the right hand suggested a clenched fist, though fingers are not indicated. The left forearm, which would have carried a shield, is broken off. (A small mound on the right side of the statuette might be a female breast; the figure's flat left side would have been hidden by the shield.) The Walters and Harvard bronzes are notably related by their open-faced helmets with low crests, Fig. 7. Bronze Illyrian helmet. Greek, from Olympia. Olympia Museum, inv.

Rome, Museo Nazionale di Villa Giulia, inv. 22679. both of which, as I shall discuss shortly, are identifiable as models of the Illyrian type (fig. 7). Although the shields and spears of palladia tend to be lost, their helmets normally are preserved and thus today con stitute a telling component of these armed images. An examination focusing on helmet fashions of other palladia will show how these Illyrian-helmeted stat uettes stand apart from the Archaic Athenian arming of Athena that ultimately dominated the typology of such small bronzes. As we shall see, their divergence underscores the signifi cance of early regional traditions but does not necessarily bring into question the identification of these statuettes as the goddess Athena. Greek helmets and the palladion In an ancient society where warriors are normally men, arming a female figure in art necessarily results in an imaginary construction. And the armor and weapons in ancient depictions, themselves, correspond to roughly the following four categories, which may sometimes be combined within a given representation and are now often difficult to distinguish from each other: 1) historicizing forms of armor and weapons that evoke ages past, 2) contemporary battle armor and weapons, 3) contemporary parade armor and weapons, and 4) fantastic armor and weapons. The first preserved armed palladia in the art of historical Greece during the early Iron Age belong to the seventh century B.c., a time by which armorers had become masters of their craft, and metal helmets and body armor had become essential Greek military equipment (fig. 8).'3 During this century, divine and leg endary characters from Greek myth also began to achieve clearer defini tion in visual art.14 It is important to remember, ^v 9 Fig. 9.

Map of Greek world, 7th-5th century B.c. however, that Athena was not armed in the art of Athens until the second quarter of the sixth century B.c., though armed goddesses had by that time long played a role in art and cult throughout the Greek world.15 Yet the Archaic Athenian Athena, the most well known and influential embodiment of an armed goddess, has become the paradigmatic type against which all others are measured (fig. 9). In sixth-century Athens, when Athena finally carries a round shield (hoplon) and wields a spear like a Greek warrior (hoplite), the rest of her panoply hardly consists of contemporary military equipment. The goddess's appearance is richly attested in Attic black figure vase painting (fig. 9). Instead of a hoplite's form-fitting metal corslet she wears the Homeric aegis, a protective goatskin of Zeus, often represented in art as a scaley, snake-edged cape.16 Athena's shield or, later on, her aegis often bears an apotropaic gorgoneion, the severed head of the Gorgon Medusa (fig. 9), bestowed upon the goddess by the legendary hero Perseus.17 Athena's special helmet?an open casque that leaves both the goddess's face and her ears exposed?becomes emblematic; its modern name is the Attic helmet. In Greek art before the Late Archaic period, Athena's Attic helmet is always fitted with a high crest (figs. 9 and 11-15).18 No Attic helmets from the early sixth century have ever been found, and there is no evidence that this exceptionally open type was employed by contemporary warriors in battle.19 Significantly, the early examples are known solely from representations in art, where the Attic helmet served as headgear for female warriors, and, as I shall discuss in greater detail elsewhere, there is reason to believe this helmet type must initially have been invented specifically for purposes of Athenian cult. Several models of the so-called Attic helmet appear in Archaic vase painting and sculpture;20 the one most relevant for palladia has a neck guard (but usually no cheek guards) and is surmounted by a high crest (figs. 11-15). Archaic images of Athena from other parts of Greece (fig. 10) were overwhelmingly influenced by the Athenian typology for this warrior goddess. Sixth century bronze palladia from Sicily, as well as Messenia (figs. 11 and 12) in the Peloponnesos, for example, wear the aegis.21 The extraordinarily well preserved statuette from the sanctuary of Athena Alea at Tegea 15</page><page sequence="6">Figs. 11 and 12. Bronze palladion statuette of Athena. Greek, from Nisi, near Kalamata. Mor?anwelz, Mus?e Royal de Mariemont, inv. B 31. in Boeotia (fig. 13), which is still outfitted with shield and spear and may reflect the local cult statue, wears a gorgoneion upon her breast.22 But, most significantly, for virtually all Archaic Greek palladia, including the above mentioned examples, an open helmet of Attic type with a neck guard and a stilted high crest of prodigious proportions becomes the canonical headgear. Thus in these statuettes both the face and ears of the helmeted female deity are fully exposed, and her long hair falls onto her back or shoulders from beneath the awesome helmet. The only Archaic bronze statuette of a palladion found on the Athenian Acropolis has neither aegis nor gorgoneion (figs. 14 and 15). Its shield and spear are missing now, but despite the bronze's badly damaged face, an Attic helmet in a model with a neck guard and a high crest can clearly be made out on the palladion's head. At the back, the tail of the crest hangs to just below shoulder level upon the goddess's mass of wavy long hair. Both findspot and helmet fashion unequiv ocably associate this palladion statuette with Athena. This early Athenian image of the armed goddess dates Fig. 13. Bronze palladion statuette of Athena. Greek, from Tegea. Athens, National Archaeological Museum, inv. 14828. to the second quarter of the sixth century B.c., and it has been linked by Hans Georg Niemeyer with a lost early cult statue on the Acropolis itself.25 This spare palladion statuette anticipates some later representations of primitive palladion statues in ancient art by the sig nificant restriction of its panoply to (now-lost) spear and shield, and helmet. Even more than Athenas in full Attic regalia, the Acropolis statuette bespeaks the essential Athenian transformation of an armed cult type already associated with the warrior goddess. The panhellenic success of the open Attic helmet in visually establishing an immediately recognizable persona for Athena as armed goddess, with or without the presence of other attributes, can best be appreciated by contrasting palladia that either precede the Athenian typology or remain unswayed by it. These unusual images include the first preserved bronze statuette of a palladion (figs. 16 and 17), which stands 14.5 cm high on a .5 cm base and dates to the early seventh century B.c.; it was found in the Sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia in the Peloponnesos (fig. 10)?the 16</page><page sequence="7">Figs. 14 and 15. Bronze palladion statuette of Athena (side and rear views). Greek, from the Athenian Akropolis. Athens, National Archaeological Museum, inv. 6450. preeminent site for dedications of battle armor and weapons until the end of the Archaic period.24 Although the Olympia statuette's once-inset spear and shield-bearing left forearm are lost, its crested helmet, a closed casque known as the Corinthian type, modeled and cast as an integral part of the head (the norm in small bronzes),25 is well preserved. The Corin thian helmet, which may have borne the same name in antiquity, is the predominant type actually worn by contemporary Greek warriors, and examples have been found in abundance at the Olympia sanctuary.26 This technologically sophisticated helmet was generally raised from a single sheet of bronze to fit over and shield the entire head, masking the face. Even the nose was covered by a metal guard. Both the invention of the Corinthian helmet, perhaps in Corinth itself, during the late eighth century and its long-lived popularity all over the Greek world throughout the Archaic period have been asso ciated with the utilization of the phalanx in Greek warfare and, thereby, with the level of protection desired by early Archaic hoplites fighting in the line.27 Figs. 16 and 17. Bronze palladion statuette (of Athena?). Greek, from Olympia. Olympia Museum, inv. B 4500. As Emil Kunze has pointed out, the Olympia statuette's carefully rendered Corinthian helmet (figs. 16 and 17) has a straight-sided profile like early models of the type and precise details that also recall preserved specimens. Even the horsehair from which an actual helmet crest would have been made is suggested by incised lines along the outer border of its low bronze crest (the rear lower end of the crest is broken off). This statuette's helmet has a peculiar feature, however ?a pair of sculpted human ears. These strongly projecting ears seem to be a response to the casque's physical strictures: wearing a Corinthian helmet was not only hot and uncomfortable but impaired one's hearing.28 The ears of the palladion's Corinthian helmet visually ameliorate the remoteness of a votive image with a forbiddingly masked face that otherwise would also appear deaf to the dedicator's prayers. Although real helmets can also bear elaborate repouss? decoration, this uncommon eared model was surely the inspiration of a resourceful sculptor to function in a particular cult context.29 17</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 18. Rape of Kassandra, drawing of bronze shieldband relief. Greek, from Olympia. Olympia Museum [After E. Kunze, Archaisclie Schildb?nde, Olympische Forschungen, II (Berlin, 1950), pi. 7, I e.] Concealed beneath a Corinthian helmet, the Olympia palladion's face hardly exudes femininity, and no long locks of hair clearly denoting a female fall below the casque. Thus, not only has this Corinthian-helmeted palladion's identification as Athena been questioned, but also the very gender of the deity represented.50 While subsequent examples of the palladion also assume the frontal, battle-ready pose, they do not wear the helmet of Corinthian type. And the rarity of Corinthian helmets in later representations of armed female figures suggests that a closed casque worn down over the face may have been considered inappropriate for them.31 In fact, this shortcoming of the mask-like Corinthian helmet in art and cult seems to be specif ically addressed by the open Attic helmet characteristic of the Archaic Athenian Athena. An alternative helmet solution appears in repouss? reliefs on bronze shieldbands of the early sixth century B.c. found at Olympia: depictions of the rape of Kassandra from the cult statue of Athena, which employ the palladion type for the image of the now long-haired war goddess (fig. 18).32 Here Athena clearly wields a spear and bears a round shield (hoplon) just like a Greek hoplite, and her helmet is of a different type: an open-faced casque with long, angular cheek pieces that extend straight down to below the level of the neck guard. Kunze observed, ". . . on our reliefs Athena unmistakably wears an 'Illyrian helmet'."33 As in the case of the Olympia bronze statuette, the type of helmet worn by the palladion of the shieldbands has been adapted directly from a con temporary casque of the male warrior (fig. 7). The so-called Illyrian helmet, which was roughly contem poraneous with the Corinthian, apparently developed on the Peloponnesos, perhaps in the late eighth or early seventh century B.c., but then spread northward through Greece and up into ancient Illyria (located along the east shore of the Ionian and Adriatic Seas, today including Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Albania; fig. 10), where the helmet appears to have had its greatest popularity.34 Yet the preserved specimens include examples dedicated in the sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia.35 The Illyrian helmet, while affording greater comfort and freedom than the Corinthian, provided less protection in battle. Furthermore, preserved models document that early Illyrian helmets were often constructed from two separate halves (fig. 7) and thus were always fitted with a low crest running along the central axis to fortify and conceal the weak join.36 Perhaps under the sway of this initial functional requirement low crests continued to be preferred on the Illyrian helmet.37 The Illyrian helmet of Athena as represented on shieldbands (fig. 18), however, always has a high crest rather than a low one. Perhaps the high crest was bestowed upon Athena's helmet as a commanding badge of military honor in visual art. This feature, which, as we have seen, will also be standard for the Attic-helmeted goddess (figs. 9 and 11-15), may have been inspired by fancy helmets devised for now-lost cult images (cf. figs. 13-15).38 In any event, the makers of the shieldbands draw an aesthetic distinction between helmet fashions appropriate for males and females. For example, in the Kassandra scene, the helmet of the male warrior Ajax of Lokri is always a mask like closed Corinthian type with a low crest, while the helmet of Athena is always an open Illyrian type with a high crest (fig. 18).39 Although her ears may still be covered by the casque, the face of an armed goddess outfitted with an Illyrian helmet is exposed.40 This important precedent for representing Athena in an Illyrian helmet brings the statuettes in America into the picture. Significantly, on the Harvard palladion (figs. 4-6), despite the statuette's highly rudimentary form, the rendering of its Illyrian helmet clearly corresponds to real models?from a squared-off opening for the face with no nose guard, an inward-curving profile, and outward flange at the lower back to its low crest; the tail is now broken off. On each side of the little helmet, a vertical indentation in the lower edge even distinguishes between the neck guard and cheek pieces. The distinctive casque suggests a relative date for the Harvard palladion: its rather evolved 18</page><page sequence="9">Figs. 19 and 20. Bronze palladion statuette (of Athena?). Greek, from Thessaly. Athens, National Archaeological Museum, inv. 11715. form corresponds to the second or middle type of Illyrian helmet, which was produced from the late seventh to the mid-sixth century B.c.41 Although the Harvard statuette can hardly be far in date from the above-mentioned Peloponnesian shield band reliefs (fig. 18), its strongest association is with the great bronze palladion statuette with an Illyrian helmet from Thessaly, now in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens (figs. 19 and 20).42 The Thessalian statuette, standing 28.1 cm high?more than three times the size of the one at Harvard (figs. 4-6)?is generally placed early in the first half of the sixth century B.c.43 Despite differences in scale and quality, noteworthy similarit?s between these two statuettes include the sharply angular positioning of their spear arms, their simple clinging tunics that appear to have short sleeves, their square, heavy-jawed faces beneath open-faced helmets, and their lack of visible locks of hair. In the case of the large statuette, a clear demarcation of female breasts leaves no doubt about the gender of the beardless, helmeted, and (originally) armed human figure. Fig. 21. Bronze Illyrian helmet and gold mask. Macedonian, from Chalkidike. Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery, ace. nos. 54.2456 and 57.1944. Yet the markedly curvaceous profile of the Harvard statuette's helmet (fig. 5) suggests that this more primitive-looking bronze should be the later of the two. The currency of the Illyrian helmet in the northern reaches of Greece by the later sixth century is attested by the well-known burials of warriors in bronze Illyrian helmets and hammered gold facial masks at Sindos near Salonika in Macedonia (fig. 10). And, fortuitously, a similar gold mask and bronze Illyrian helmet from a burial in nearby Chalkidike are in the Walters Art Gallery (fig. 21); according to Dorothy Kent Hill, "By adding the mask, one turned the [battle] helmet into a grotesque effigy of the deceased, creating a substitute sepulchral image of the warrior."44 For the modern viewer, save for their lack of staring eyes, these severely minimalist faces with big noses and arching brows topped by real helmets also evoke early cult images of a warrior deity. Both the large statuette from Thessaly in Athens (figs. 19 and 20) and the small Harvard bronze (figs. 4-6) wear ordinary models of Illyrian helmets with low 19</page><page sequence="10">crests rather than the high, stilted crests emblematic of Athena. And, on first impression, these Thessalian palladia seem to be straightforward cult products from this northerly region of Greece (fig. 10) that depict the local warrior goddess outfitted with a local helmet. Nonetheless, in the case of the large Thessalian bronze, although the abstraction and angularity of its form may recall the Daedalic style of the seventh century, Claude Rolley has recognized a Peloponnesian influence in its strong, carefully modeled facial features and large, wide-open eyes.45 Rolley has labeled the large Thessalian palladion simply a "helmeted goddess" perhaps because no attribute seems to specifically identify her as Athena46?at least according to the Archaic Athenian visual definition. As we have seen on the shieldband (fig. 18), however, an early Archaic tradition in the Peloponnesos clearly outfitted the armed Athena with an Illyrian helmet, and this tradition may have been current in Greece, as was the helmet itself, before the adoption of the goddess's full Attic panoply in the sixth century B.c. In my view, both of these unusual Illyrian-helmeted statuettes represent Athena;47 as the evidence discussed here suggests, they translated a Peloponnesian typology into an idiom well suited to life, death, and cult in northern Greece. In earlier publications, the headgear of the Walters palladion (figs. 1-3) has been described only in vague terms, either simply as a "helmet," as a "clinging helmet with crest," or as "tight-fitting, with a large crest."48 The casque encircles the goddess's head, covering her ears but leaving her face free. It has a low crest, cut in a vertical edge at the front,49 that runs along the central axis. No detailing indicates the stuff of the crest (cf. fig. 17); its tail is broken off at the lower back. This palladion's open-faced helmet with a low crest must surely be the Illyrian type, though its facial opening and cheekpieces are imprecisely rendered as curved rather than angular. The helmet's brow arches upward slightly at the center, perhaps suggesting the central join on an early model constructed from two pieces (cf. fig. 7).50 As will be discussed further below, given her date to well within the second half of the sixth century, and thus well after the widespread adoption of Athena's standard panoply, the Walters palladion is the most surprising of the Illyrian-helmeted images. Said to come from Sparta, this statuette appears to be a late embodiment of the early Archaic Peloponnesian tradition of showing the armed goddess in an Illyrian helmet (fig. 18) and, thereby, invites speculation about whether the small bronze palladion was intended to evoke a venerable cult image. The anatomy of palladion statuettes and their bases It is significant that the Walters palladion (figs. 1-3) was cast together with a rectangular base consisting of three graduated tiers of bronze. First, beyond the statuette's reputed Spartan provenance and Illyrian helmet, its base provides further evidence for an association with the Peloponnesos. Humphrey Payne, followed by Hill, cited the stepped base as typical of Peloponnesian statuettes from Laconia and Messenia (figs. 10-12).51 The most well articulated stepped base of a small Archaic bronze belongs to the beautiful Laconian Artemis in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (fig. 22). This bronze goddess stands 17.6 cm high on her impressive 1.6 cm base. Generally dated to circa 525 B.c., the Boston statuette has been believed to reflect a somewhat earlier cult image and its base an actual statue base. According to Marion True, "the recessed steps of the plinth are clearly architectural, adding a dimension of grandeur to the diminutive figure of the goddess that is unusual for a bronze votive statuette of this period_"52 The cheerful and wide-eyed Walters palladion, standing erect and oriented with strict frontality on her base, seems a country cousin of the gracious and refined Boston Artemis, with whom she is surely contemporary. Midway along the formal, stylistic, and qualitative spectrum between the Walters statuette (figs. 1-3) and the Boston Artemis (fig. 22) stands the distinctive bronze palladion in the Mus?e Royal de Mariemont, Morlanwelz (figs. 11 and 12). The 19-cm-high Mariemont statuette, which also has a stepped base, is reputed to have been found at Nisi near Kalamata in Messenia and is also generally dated in the second half of the sixth century B.c.53 Recently, Maria Papili grouped the Walters bronze with Messenian rather than Laconian products.54 And, in fact, the Messenian bronze at Mariemont provides the closest parallel for a summarily rendered, relatively flat stepped base, though here the base is in two rather than three degrees. Comparable as well are the Mariemont and Walters statuettes' large heads with exceptionally alert facial expressions empowered by staring almond shaped eyes, their somewhat top-heavy proportions with too-slender hips and waists bound by belts decorated with circles,55 and the upward arc of their garments' long skirts that reveals the front part of their bare feet.56 However, the long-haired Mariemont palladion, in her fancy Attic helmet with a towering high crest and scaley aegis,57 betrays the influence of the elaborate Athenian panoply for an armed Athena, 20</page><page sequence="11">while the Walters palladion, with her low-crested Illyrian helmet, does not. The Walters statuette departs from both the Mariemont Athena and the Boston Artemis in her far more slender and somewhat abstracted body type, from which the buttocks and breasts protrude markedly in profile view. Several other bronze palladia, such as an example reputedly from Piraeus (Attica) in the B?hrle collection, Zurich, and one in the Mus?es Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire, Brussels, have even more exaggeratedly abstracted or plank-like physiques.58 Anatomically abstracted statuettes, whether plank-like or columnar, have frequently been interpreted as evocations of early aniconic or barely worked wooden cult images, traditionally referred to in modern scholar ship by the term xoanon; in antiquity, like the Trojan Palladion, primitive xoana were often believed to have fallen from the sky as gifts of the gods.59 In early Greek cult, xoana must have co-existed with fully sculpted figures, and the veneration of both could include ritual adornment that increased their anthropomorphic qualities. Images were often bedecked with cloth garments and sashes, gold jewelry and, when appropriate, even armor.60 Something of this practice may be reflected in early palladion statuettes from Crete and Sicily that have been preserved along with separately fashioned helmets, which fit on their heads.61 And several features of the Walters palladion may recall venerable, ritually bedecked cult images more than monolithic statues: Witness the broad, heavy belt around her waist, her sleeved, tight-fitting tunic, which differs from the prevailing Peloponnesian fashion in sculpted female dress of a sleeveless peplos with a short overfall and a skirt that falls in soft folds (cf. fig. 22),62 not to mention the Illyrian helmet with a low crest upon her head. Interestingly, the helmeted Walters palladion (figs. 1-3) is one of several, including the Harvard (figs. 4-6) and large Thessalian examples (figs. 19 and 20) as well as the Corinthian helmet wearer from Olympia (figs. 16 and 17), that lack visible hair. Although I do not believe the detail to be an indication of gender, in each case it is difficult to determine whether or not it implies that the goddess's long hair is bound up beneath the military headgear,63 and whether this lack reflects an analogous feature of an early helmeted cult image, or whether it is simply an omission by the statuette's craftsman. Interestingly, the awkward positioning of the Walters statuette's now-exposed shield arm brings to mind the strikingly high and sharply raking angle at which some palladia depicted in ancient painting and intaglio as well as on coinage hold their shields.64 The little Harvard palladion (figs. 4-6) is both less sculpturally refined and less anthropomorphically developed than the Walters example. Its frontally ori ented, shaft-like body topped by a large head recalls the Archaic Greek herm, recently described by Christopher Faraone as "really nothing more than a decapitated head stuck on a pole."65 Although this palladion's lack of feet probably results from its maker's limited facility and/or the minimal effort he was willing to expend on a small votive, this lack might also reflect the nature of a partially shaft-like early cult image?perhaps even one that was draped in an unbelted long tunic, outfitted with shield and spear, crowned with an Illyrian helmet, and erected upon a base. While their body types, dress, and bases enhance the supposition that the Walters and Harvard palla dion statuettes (figs. 1-6) bear a strong relationship to early cult types ?and formal links with venerable embodiments of a deity would surely have heightened a dedica tion's power?it would be far from the mark to read each of these small bronze statuettes as a literal copy of one sacred palladion in particular. Classical texts and modern archaeology have both revealed the diverse materials and technologies employed for early Greek cult images, which included raw and carved wood, wood sheathed with sheets of hammered bronze (sphyre latori), wood covered by sheets of gold along with elements of ivory or marble, precious stones and exotic woods, all ivory, and, by the second half of the sixth century, hollow-cast bronze.66 Such composite or monolithic images were set up Fig. 22.

Pierce Fund. 21</page><page sequence="12">on separately fashioned bases, often of stone or marble.67 The variety of materials and colors that could have been displayed by even a small early Greek cult image would have had a far different aesthetic and emotional impact on the ancient viewer than the once lustrously golden-hued little metal dedications that now serve to evoke for the modern viewer what has been lost. As wearers of Illyrian helmets with low crests, the Harvard and Baltimore bronzes count among the most unusual of preserved palladion statuettes. It is remarkable that neither of them has the Attic helmet with high crest that, as an attribute of the goddess Athena, becomes a canonical feature in this genre of small bronze throughout most of the sixth century B.c. The two palladion statuettes in America, thereby, play a vital role in expanding our understanding of Archaic cult imagery in the far-flung regional centers of early Greece. New York, New York Notes 1. I owe thanks to the following friends and colleagues: to Joan R. Mertens for reading this article in draft and making many valuable suggestions, to Annie Verbanck-Pi?rard for information on the palladion statuette in the Mus?e de Mariemont, Mor?anwelz (figs. 11-12); to Maria Jos? Strazzulla and H.A. Shapiro for references from European libraries; to the staffs of the Museum at Olympia and the National Archaeological Museum in Athens for allowing me to examine fragile objects in their collections; to William D.E. Coulson and the American School of Classical Studies in Athens for facilitating permits for work in Greek museums; and, finally, for suggesting that I publish the bronze statuettes in the Arthur M. Sackler Museum of Harvard University (figs. 4-6) and the Walters Art Gallery (figs. 1-3) and making them available for study, as well as for their patience during an unexpected delay in the completion of this article, my heartfelt gratitude goes to David G.

There is little basis for Ridgway's conclusion that the missing spear "was not brandished but held upright." 24. Olympia Museum, inv. B 4500. Kunze: "'Palladion,'" 160-63.

Perhaps the form referred to by Herodotos, 4.180; see the seminal study by Kukahn, Der Griechische Helm, particularly 22-23, 24-29, and 50-51, on the fact that helmet crests, made from emphemeral materials, are known only from representations in art. Over 200 examples of Corinthian helmets have been found at Olympia: Kunze, "'Palladion'," 56-116; see also H. Pflug, "Korinthische Helme," in Antike Helme, 65-99. 27.

Hanson, ed., Hoplites: The Classical Greek Battle Experience (London, 1991) 63-84, including the tendency to lighten armor in late Archaic times; cf. A.M. Snodgrass, "The Hoplite Reform and History," Journal of Hellenic Studies, 85 (1965), 110-22, regarding the old debate of whether the armor or the tactics came first. 28.

Yalouris, Olympia: The Museum and the Sanctuary (Athens, 1989), 69, 73, and 71, fig. c; for the seventh-century Cretan helmet with hair, beard, and human ears in relief, Hamburg, Museum f?r Kunst und Gewerbe, inv. 1970,26d, and other elaborate helmets from Afrati, see H. Hoff mann, Early Cretan Armorers (Mainz, 1972) 1-2, 5 and pi. 12,1-3, also pis. 1-6, 14-17; and Herodotos, 7.76, for helmets with ox ears and horns. 30. Kunze, "'Palladion'," 161, questions the identification of the Olympia palladion as Athena, and even as female, citing an inad equate indication of female breasts. For identification of this statuette as either Athena, Aphrodite, or Artemis, see Yalouris, Olympia, 73-74; in P. Demargne, The Birth of Greek Art, trans. S. Gilbert and J. Emmons (New York, 1964), figs. 407-409, the statuette is called only an Archaic palladion; for identification as Athena, Floren, Archaische Plastik, 231. 31.

On the Corinthian helmet as battle mask see, recently, M. Shanks, "Art and Archaeology of Embodiment: Some Aspects of Archaic Greece," Cambridge Archaeological Journal, 5:2 (1995), 217, 219. Beginning in the Late Archaic period, the Corinthian helmet worn pushed up atop the head becomes popular in Greek art not only for warriors, Snodgrass, Arms and Armour, 93-94, but also for Amazons, see, e.g., red-figure volute-krater by Euphronios, Arezzo, Museo Archeologico Nazionale G.C.

Farnell, The Cults of the Greek States, I (Chicago, rpt. 1971 [1896]), 335. On the problematic nature of the term, see A.A. Donahue, Xoana and the Origins of Greek Sculpture (Atlanta, 1988), and on differences between literary sources and early Greek sculpture, see also S.P. Morris, Daidalos and the Origins of Greek Art (Princeton, 1992), particularly 237-56. 60. On the clothing and adornment of cult statues see, recently, Stewart, Greek Sculpture, 104, and, on the olive-wood Athena Polias in Athens, recently, Ridgway in Neils, ed., Goddess and Polis, 120, 122, 124; for the addition of a helmet, see J.H. Kroll, "The Ancient Image of Athena Polias," Hesperia, Suppl. 20 (1982), 69-70. 61. For the statuettes with separate helmets from Himera and Gortyn, see notes 8 and 24 above. 62.

Cf. E.B. Harrison's explanation of the construction of the early Greek female garment which appears to have been closer to a chiton, "Notes on Daedalic Dress," Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 36 (1977) 37-48; see also, particularly on the tightness of female garments in visual representations, E.B. Harrison, "The Dress of the Archaic Greek Korai," in D. Buitron Oliver, ed., New Perspectives in Early Greek Art (Washington, D.C., 1991), 217-39. I would like to thank Evelyn Harrison for a discussion of Greek dress. For the sake of clarity the word "tunic" is employed in this article for a long garment without an overfall. Niemeyer, Promachos, 23 and n. 41, suggests the Walters palladion may reflect the Athena Chalkioikos at Sparta; see note 66 below. 63.
