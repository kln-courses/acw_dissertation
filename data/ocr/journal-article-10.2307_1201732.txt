<plain_text><page sequence="1">Schleiermacher and Feuerbach on the Intentionality of Religious Consciousness Robert Williams I dispute the contention that Feuerbach represents the logical working out of the meaning and implications of Schleiermacher's thought. I want to make a beginning in this dispute by focusing on two issues: the so-called subjectivism of Schleiermacher and the subsequent and alleged replacement of God by man as the real subject of theological discourse. I shall develop these issues in a brief account of Feuerbach's basic thesis, namely, anthropologism, and show that this thesis is open to serious objection. Then I shall attempt to show that a radically and fundamentally different meaning and logic is to be found in Schleier- macher, and, in particular, that Schleiermacher presents a version of Anselm's ontological argument which obviates the charge of a reduction of theology to anthropology and which shows that Schleiermacher's thought transcends anthropologism. I. FEUERBACH'S REDUCTION OF THEOLOGY TO ANTHROPOLOGY Feuerbach's reduction of theology to anthropology is a special applica- tion of his general contention that metaphysics is reducible to psy- chology. At the heart of this contention is Feuerbach's claim that consciousness attains no higher level, no form of existence higher than or greater than human existence, to wit, the generic nature of the human species. Idealism's thesis that there is no object without a subject is reduced to an anthropological thesis that all being and truth are relative to the human subject. This relativism is best characterized as anthropologism: man in the generic sense is the measure of all things.' 424 1 Ludwig Feuerbach, Das Wesen des Christentums, English translation: The Essence of Christianity, trans.

Such a reconstruction is necessary because Feuerbach writes in an aphoristic, unsystematic style. As Kamenka has observed, this is a literary rather than phil- osophical style, and its imprecision impairs the philosophical value of Feuerbach's writings.3 I would add that it impairs the philosophical quality as well, for this imprecision conceals some serious difficulties and inconsistencies in Feuerbach's central contentions. Feuerbach's Theory of Consciousness Feuerbach maintains that "consciousness in the strict sense exists only where a being has its species, its essential nature, as its object."4 By this he means that consciousness is essentially a social consciousness of kind, or species consciousness (Gattungsbewusstsein). The species consciousness is both common to all members of the species and is shared by all who recognize other members of the species to be of the same kind. The species consciousness supports and embraces the distinctions and contrasts comprising consciousness, namely, the differentiation of 'inner' and 'outer,' and the distinction between 'self' and 'other.' Only if consciousness has its essential, generic nature for its object can it transcend its limiting individual particularity and become conscious of things other than itself. If consciousness were to lack the differentiation into inner and outer, it would not be con- sciousness in the strict sense, but only an animal consciousness or instinct. In this case there is no distinction between inner and outer, and life is an undifferentiated, indivisible whole. Animal consciousness cannot transcend this lack of differentiation and become a self-con- sciousness or a consciousness of other things besides self. Such a 425 lation, hereafter referred to as EOC. I have taken the term "anthropologism" from Edmund Husserl, who uses it to designate psychologism in its species-relative version (cf. Edmund Husserl, Logical Investigations, trans. J. N.

But without a consciousness of the essential nature of the species-the generic nature-no self-consciousness is distinguishable or possible. The consciousness of the species is the precondition of self-consciousness and of the consciousness of things other than self. Human consciousness is a species consciousness; it is essentially social and universal. By virtue of his generic nature, man is both I and Thou. He can put himself in place of another by virtue of the fact that his species-his universal, essential being-and not merely his particular individuality, is an object for him. The contrast between I and Thou, between I and other being, presupposes the underlying identity of the generic nature. Those capacities which make man what he is and differentiate man from lower animals (thought and language) are "true functions of the species." 5 The social consciousness of species underlies all cultural phenomena, so that wherever thought and lan- guage are present the consciousness of the species must also be present. In contrast, a caterpillar has a mere instinct, and this instinct is a function of a limited species nature: "The limit of the nature is also the limit of consciousness. The consciousness of a caterpillar, whose life is confined to a particular species of plant, does not extend itself beyond this narrow domain." 6 However, since the caterpillar is not conscious of his essential species nature, he is not aware of his limitations; for him the leaf on which he sits is "a world, an infinite space." 7 A caterpillar is not troubled by this, for, "to a limited being, its limited understanding is not felt to be a limitation."'8 In order to be aware of his limits, a caterpillar would have to be aware of his species nature-which is impossible, for then he would have ceased to be a caterpillar. To man, a caterpillar appears limited, for "every limit of a being exists only for another being who is outside and above him." 9 In comparison with the caterpillar, man has his generic species nature as an object for consciousness, and so he can transcend his limited individual particularity and be conscious of things other than himself. Because man is able to transcend the limits of mere individ- uality, Feuerbach calls human consciousness infinite. However, despite 5 Ibid., p. 2. 6 Ibid. 7 Ibid., p. 8. 8 Ibid. 9 "Jede Schranke eines Wesens existiert nur fuer ein andres Wesen ausser und ueber ihm" (ibid., p. 7). 426</page><page sequence="4">Schleiermacher and Feuerbach his capacity for self-transcendence, man cannot transcend his generic nature, any more than a caterpillar can transcend his generic nature.10 Man can transcend and surpass his individuality, but he cannot surpass his generic nature. The infinity to which human consciousness can attain is an anthropological-social infinity, namely, the universality of the species nature. The consciousness which attains infinity is only a human consciousness, and the infinite attained by consciousness is only the infinity of the generic species nature. The objective, essential nature of the species is the highest object to which the species consciousness can attain. Consequently, there is no greater contrast in consciousness than that between the individual and the species nature: all consciousness of difference is merely an internal differentiation of the species con- sciousness. "Whatever kind of object ... we are at any time conscious of, we are always at the same time conscious of our own nature; we can affirm nothing without affirming ourselves." 11 From these con- siderations, Feuerbach derives his axiom which presides over the reduction of theology to anthropology, namely, the object of any subject is nothing more than the species nature of the subject taken objectively.12 Feuerbach applies this axiom in his contention that consciousness is its own infinite: "The consciousness of the infinite is nothing else but the consciousness of the infinity of consciousness; or, in the con- sciousness of the infinite, the conscious subject has for his object the infinity of his own generic nature." 13 The generic nature is the 'infinite' for generic consciousness; it is the highest object to which generic consciousness can attain. For the human species therefore, the generic nature itself is the attainable infinite, or "that than which nothing greater can be conceived": "No being can deny itself, i.e., its own nature. No being is a limited one to itself. Rather, every being in and by itself is infinite-has its God, its highest conceivable being in itself." 14 Consequently, the contrast between God and man, between infinite and finite, is reducible to "a differencing of man within his 10 "The limit of nature is also the limit of consciousness .. ." (ibid., p. 2). It is not consciousness which determines for itself its nature, but rather the objective nature that determines consciousness, hence: "Man cannot get beyond his true nature" (ibid., p.

This means that "God" is only another word for generic human nature. If this contention be granted, then any representation of" God" as other than or greater than man is merely the self-depreciation and alienation of man from his essential species nature. Religion would be merely a state of alienation of man from himself, which is to be overcome by bringing to light the latent identity between man and the religious object and reducing theology to anthropology.'6 Critical Evaluation Feuerbach's basic axiom-the object of any subject is merely the nature of the subject taken objectively-is a classic statement of anthropologism, or the theory that truth is relative to man in the generic sense. In other words, it is the theory that man is the measure of all things. However, in view of Husserl's discussion and criticisms, the theory is open to serious objections, the most serious being incoherence. 1'7 Husserl's arguments are too numerous and detailed to be repeated at length here, but he advances some considerations which are especially illuminating. The central objection is that psychologism, or its species- relative version-anthropologism-makes questions of truth and validity dependent on questions of fact. But facts are contingent; their opposite involves no contradiction. To assert that truth is relative to man is to make truth dependent on the fact of existence of the human species. But the nonexistence of the species is possible and involves no con- tradiction. It follows from this theory that if there were no human species, no human constitution, there would be no truth. This assertion means that it would then be true that there is no truth. But this assertion is absurd; it is self-contradictory. For some truth is' presupposed in making the claim that there is no truth. The absurdity of the theory consists in making the being for whom truth exists, the presupposition of the true 15 Ibid., p. 33 (cf. pp. I3-14)- 16 "The absolute to man is his own nature. The power of the object over him therefore is the power of his own nature" (ibid., p. 5). 17 Husserl writes: "That an assertion is 'self-canceling,' is 'logically absurd,' means that its particular content (sense, meaning) contradicts the general demands of its own, pertinent meaning-categories, contradicts what has its general root in the general meaning of those categories ... any theory is logically absurd which deduces logical principles from any matters of fact" (pp. 144-45; cf. also p. I 17). 428</page><page sequence="6">Schleiermacher and Feuerbach judgment of its own nonexistence. Husserl indicates that it is a "flat contradiction that the truth-conditioning and therefore existent con- stitution should condition the truth (among other truths) of its own nonexistence." 18 These remarks bring to light an ambiguity in Feuerbach's contention that every being is in itself infinite and so has its God, its highest conceivable being in itself. Feuerbach actually used Anselm's formula, "something than which nothing greater can be conceived," and he accepts the logic and validity of Anselm's argument. But he psy- chologizes it; it proves the existence of the highest being attainable by human consciousness-man.19 The conclusion of the argument is accepted, but its meaning is made relative to man, and this means that the entire argument is qualified by and made dependent upon a fact- man's existence. Now if the existence of the human species is a fact, then its nonexistence is possible. But this possible nonexistence con- tradicts the sense of Anselm's formula, for possible nonexistence is completely excluded by "something than which nothing greater can be conceived." Moreover, here is one truth which is not relative to man: a being whose nonexistence is impossible would exist whether or not there is a contingent human constitution. On the other hand, if Feuerbach is serious in his identification of man with "something than which nothing greater can be conceived," then he is speaking about something whose nonexistence is impossible. But is he then speaking about man? About a being who is what he eats? Surely not. If Feuerbach's ideal humanity cannot cease to exist, it would be independent of all material conditions. It would then be vulnerable to Marx's objection that Feuerbach's ideal humanity is a piece of theological-metaphysical mystification, a hypostatized ideal of bourgeois autonomy.20 Stated rigorously in these terms, Feuerbach's social infinite, or finite-infinite man, is a contradictory concept. There are good reasons for rejecting Feuerbach's thesis that the object of any subject is merely the nature of the subject taken objectively. 18 Ibid., p. 142. 19 EOC, p. 36. 20 Cf. Marx's "Theses on Feuerbach," in On Religion, ed. K. Marx and F. Engels (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1966), pp. 62-63. Marx's point is that such a secular ideal is a contradiction. If the ideal is merely secular, then revolutionary action is called for in order to implement it. Such action follows from the secular nature of the ideal. If the ideal is not secular, then it is a piece of metaphysics and is mystifying. Feuerbach's arguments against metaphysics and theology are turned against him: " Once the earthly family is discovered to be the secret of the holy family, the former must then itself be criticized in theory and revolutionized in practice" (thesis 4). 429</page><page sequence="7">The Journal of Religion But when it is stripped of this all-encompassing, reductive principle, Feuerbach's anthropologism is merely one more rival metaphysical scheme which has to make its case just like all the others, namely, by appeal to original evidence and by its cogent and coherent explanations of things. Moreover, he would have to show, and not merely assume, that God and man are related as species to individual. Despite his studies in religion, Feuerbach did not do justice to or successfully comprehend the original phenomena and evidence of religious con- sciousness.21 We shall now seek to show that his account of religious consciousness does not successfully portray or represent, much less "logically develop "-the thought of Schleiermacher. II. SCHLEIERMACHER ON RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS AND ITS OBJECT Schleiermacher never formulated a comprehensive or systematic account of self-consciousness. However, in his later writings-the Glaubenslehre, and the lectures on Dialektik and Psychologie-he was working toward a unified, comprehensive view. I have attempted elsewhere a summary of Schleiermacher's theory of consciousness, and on the basis of these labors I offer the following abbreviated account.22 I shall seek to show that feeling should not be understood in a merely 21 As Barth has written: "We have heard something quite extraordinarily, almost nauseatingly trivial" (EOC, p. xix). The second half of Barth's assessment-that Feuerbach's crude representation of theology directs a crucial question to the theology of his (Feuerbach's) day-is questionable, not because Feuerbach does not raise a crucial question, but because Barth makes it appear as only a question for the theology of Feuerbach's day. On the contrary. Feuerbach opposes theology as such, not merely the theology of his day, or the theology of Schleiermacher: "Feeling has been adduced only as an example. It is the same with every other power, faculty, potentiality, reality, which is defined as the essential organ of any object. What is the subjective expression of a nature is simultaneously the objective expression. Man cannot get beyond his true nature" (EOC, p. I i). If Feuerbach's reduction of theology to anthropology succeeds, it succeeds against theology as such, even if that theology rests its case on revelation. For no matter what the repository of revelation is, Feuerbach's question becomes a crucial one when it is asked how revelation is apprehended concretely by man. Failure to deal with the question gives theology the appearance of a pure essentialism which is abstract and lacks existential matrices. Such a theology would itself be vulnerable to Feuerbach's charge that the real subject of religion is man. We shall show that Schleiermacher has a way of meeting this issue which Barth does not appreciate or realize. 22 Robert Williams, " Consciousness and Redemption in the Thought of Friedrich Schleiermacher" (Th.D. diss., Union Theological Seminary, 1971). A version is to be published by E. J. Brill. 430</page><page sequence="8">Schleiermacher and Feuerbach subjective, psychological sense, in which it is nonsignificative and refers to nothing besides or beyond itself. Rather, what Schleiermacher means by feeling is something very close to phenomenology's concept of the subject-relative life World. In addition, I shall seek to show that Schleiermacher's account of the feeling of utter dependence constitutes a kind of existential proof, or an existential version of Anselm's onto- logical proof, for the existence of God. Moreover, Schleiermacher's proof is to be found in similar formulations in contemporary phenom- enological philosophy of religion and has its historical roots in the Augustinian tradition. Schleiermacher's Account of Feeling, or Immediate Self-Consciousness In the Glaubenslehre Schleiermacher identifies feeling (Gefuehl) with immediate self-consciousness.23 This identification excludes a Leibnizian contention that feeling is subliminal, occurring below the level of consciousness or apperception.24 More important, such an identification means that feeling is consciousness as such. Feeling is not ethical subjectivity, cognitive-theoretical subjectivity, or emotional subjectivity. It is subjectivity as such, consciousness itself, the common generic element present in all the more determinate and specific forms. Feeling, or consciousness as such, is the organ of receptivity, or man's openness to and immediate union with being. Consequently, feeling is not merely one aspect of human existence among others, rather feeling (= consciousness) is global human existence as a psychophysical totality in its lived union with and interaction with the World: "What we here call feeling is the immediate presence of the whole undivided being, both spiritual and sensible, the unity of the person with his spiritual and sensible world." 25 Schleiermacher could cite his friend Steffens with approval, for he himself had written: "Every feeling is the immediate co-existence of the individual with the whole."26 23 Friedrich Schleiermacher, Der christliche Glaube, hrsg.

Its existence as well as its social, intersubjective character are taken for granted. Such original accept- ance of the World is prior to all attempts to know it in the theoretical sense, or to prove its "dubitable" character by comparing it with ideal truths, such as those dealt with in mathematics and geometry. Schleiermacher makes this same point in his distinction between immediate self-consciousness and reflective, objectifying consciousness. Feeling refers not to a concept or a relation between concepts; rather, it refers to concrete relationships between man and World: "What I understand by the pious feeling does not at all proceed from representa- tion [Vorstellung] but rather is the original expression of an immediate existential relation [ein unmittelbares Existentialverhaeltnis]." 28 Both practical activity and cognitive activity are derivative, specific functions which are grounded in and mediated by feeling, that is, the concrete, lived interaction between subject and World: If in general the immediate self-consciousness is the mediating link between moments in which knowing predominates and moments in which doing predominates.., .it will belong to piety [a modification of feeling] to stimulate and arouse knowing and doing, so that every moment in which piety predominates will include one or the other of the two in germ.... Consequently, there are a knowing and doing which belong to piety, but neither of the two constitutes the essence of piety; rather they belong to it only insofar as the stimulated feeling comes to rest in a thought which fixes it, or in an action which expresses it.29 However, it would be a serious mistake to think that feeling is merely a first, but vanishing or ultimately dispensable, moment in the more specific, explicit-but also more circumscribed-activities of knowing or doing. Feeling in its concrete interactions with the life World not 432 27 Edmund Husserl, The Crisis of European Science and Transcendental Phenomenology, trans. David Carr, Northwestern Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy, pt. 3A (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 1970). Husserl characterizes the life world as subject relative, intuitable in principle, in contrast to the nonintuitable ideal-logical substructions of Galilean science. The life world rep- resents a "natural attitude" in that it is constantly presupposed and taken for granted without question, even by scientists and philosophers (cf. n. 33 below). 28 Friedrich Schleiermacher, Sendschreiben an Luecke, hrsg.

Also cited in Gl., Redeker ed., p. 21 n. 29 GI., par. 3-4.</page><page sequence="10">Schleiermacher and Feuerbach only gives rise to knowing and doing, but also accompanies these other, more specialized functions: "Every impulse which tends toward perception and cognition, which has the attributes, essence, and nature of things for its object, begins with a stimulation [Erregung] of self- consciousness, which then accompanies the operations of cognition.... Wherever there is an objective representation, there is always a stim- ulated self-consciousness. . . . From this follows the possibility of pious consciousness in every moment -of objective consciousness, and the possibility of a perfected world consciousness in every moment of pious self-consciousness."'' 30 Feeling is related to the more specific, circumscribed functions of knowing and doing as a horizon is to a foreground.31 Whenever knowing or doing predominate, feeling "retreats" behind them and mediates the transition between them. Feeling is both the general organ of receptivity, of openness to and apprehension of being, and the accompanying mediator of the other functions of the subject. Schleiermacher's meaning parallels an independent and somewhat clearer statement of Husserl: "This life world constantly functions as the subsoil, a source of pre-logical validities which act as grounds for the logical ones, for theoretical truths." 32 Feeling and its life World, as "subject-relative," should not be dismissed as "merely subjective," or regarded as something to be overcome on some higher "objective" level. They are not dispensable for man as such, although abstractions from them are always possible and serve to demarcate various regions of being and action. But even in such abstractions, feeling and the life World continue to function as the constantly presupposed subsoil of meaning and validity: " While the natural scientist is thus interested in the objective [truth], and is involved in his activity, the subject- relative is, on the other hand, still functioning for him, not as something irrelevant that must be passed through, but as that which ultimately grounds the theoretical-logical ontic .validity for all objective verifica- tion, i.e., as the source of self-evidence, the source of verification." 33 433 30 Ibid., par. 46. 31 Ibid., par. 3.2. 32 Husserl, p. 124. 33 Ibid., p. 126. Alfred Schutz, a student of Husserl, expresses and illustrates this point nicely when he writes: " If we retain the natural attitude as men among other men, the existence of Others is no more questionable to us than the existence of an outer world. We are simply born into a world of Others, and as long as we stick to the natural attitude we have no doubt that intelligent fellow-men do exist. Only if radical solipsists or behaviorists demand proof of this fact does it turn out that the existence of intelligent fellow-men is a 'soft datum' and incapable of verification</page><page sequence="11">The Journal of Religion However, feeling is not merely a subsoil or accompanying factor, for there are moments in which feeling itself occupies the foreground of life and predominates over the other functions. In such cases there occurs a global awareness of oneself in the immediate presence of whole, undivided being.34 Some of these moments are religious in nature, namely, when feeling becomes specially modified and qualified as the feeling of utter dependence. Before we examine the feeling of utter dependence, we should note that feeling and piety or pious feeling are not synonymous. Rather piety is one determination of feeling among others. Among the other specific and determinate modes of feeling are included the following: social feelings, that is, those of an intersubjective nature, such as sympathy, compassion, joy, honor, and on a more anonymous level, a feeling of patriotism. In addition there is personal or private feeling, including pleasure and pain as well as bodily feeling.35 Schleiermacher also indicates that feeling accompanies the process of cognition as the "feeling of convic- tion" (Ueberzeugungsgefuehl), which expresses the position and attitude of the subject about the specific process of cognition.36 Consequently, while piety is a "determination of feeling," not all feeling is piety.37 Being self-conscious is not entirely synonymous with being pious, although the pious feeling of utter dependence is a determinate mode of immediate self-consciousness. For Schleiermacher, therefore, it is simply not true that feeling as such is religious or itself divine, nor does feeling comprise both the subjective and the objective aspects of any experience. Feeling, as the general organ of receptivity, is the openness of the subject toward, and the original medium of apprehension of, all being. Feeling undergoes an internal differentiation (Russell). But in their natural attitude even those thinkers do not doubt this "soft datum." Otherwise they could not meet others in congresses where it is reciprocally proved that the intelligence of the Other is a questionable fact" (" Scheler's Theory of Intersubjectivity and the General Thesis of the Alter Ego," Collected Papers [The Hague: Martinus Nijhof, 1967], I:I68). 34 GI., par. 3.2. 35 Ibid., pars. 3-6; underlying both personal and social feeling is the consciousness of the species. This list is not exhaustive; nowhere better than here in this unstructured assemblage of terms does the lack of a systematic, comprehensive theory of con- sciousness on Schleiermacher's part become more obvious, and more frustrating. 36 Ibid., par. 5.2. This concept is discussed further in the Dialektik. (There are two editions of Schleiermacher's lectures on Dialektik.

Is not the nature of feeling in general also the nature of every special feeling, be its object what it may ? What then makes this feeling religious ? A given object ? Not at all; for this object is itself a religious one only when it is not the object of the cold understanding or memory, but of feeling.... Thus feeling is pronounced to be religious simply because it is feeling; the ground of religiousness is in its own nature . . . But is not feeling thereby declared to be itself the absolute, the divine ? 39 Feuerbach conveniently and irresponsibly ignores Schleiermacher's point that feeling exhibits a coherent, organized pattern, to wit, it is human reality itself in a general, global form. The various determinate modes of feeling represent various modes of human existence as it is conditioned and qualified by the various entities comprising reality as a whole. The social, personal, cognitive, and religious feelings are not mere nonsignificative accidental facts to be explained by a trans- cendent, objectifying theory of species consciousness. Nor are they disorders to be cured or dissolved by therapy. They are the already- significative, coherent modes of human reality in its interactions with 38 Gi., Ist ed., Anmerkung Io: "The self-consciousness is just as manifold as is life. By the same right that one divides living being itself into higher and lower classes, one must also assume higher and lower grades [Stufen] of self-consciousness" (D. Carl Stange, "Einleitung," in Schleiermachers Glaubenslehre, Abteilung I [Leipzig: A. Deichert, 190o]). 39 EOC, p. IO. To accept Feuerbach's contention one must also accept his psycho- logizing thesis that feeling, like all aspects of consciousness, is determined by its "objective" generic nature such that it never gets beyond itself and can signify (if anything at all) only itself. This assumes that the basic concrete reality is the objective scientifically determined generic nature, which determines all "behavior." One must thereby accord a higher level of evidence and certainty to a highly mediated concept (the objective generic nature is an inductively established hypo- thetical object) than to immediate self-consciousness itself. As a global hypothesis concerning human existence, Feuerbach's theory, if true, destroys itself, for it cuts off any appeal to the primary modes of verification of any theory (especially an inductively established one), namely, the subject-relative life world. Schleiermacher's contention is that feeling, consciousness as such, is the general medium of apprehen- sion of all things, including theories. It is the primary, but not the only, mode of verification. 435</page><page sequence="13">The Journal of Religion beings which are the same as, "other than," and "greater than" itself.40 The differentiation of feeling into various modes is further exhibited by the various intentional structures which feeling assumes and which are supported by the various intentional objects. In order to appreciate the diversity of feeling of utter dependence and other, nonpious feelings, we shall sketch briefly Schleiermacher's account of World consciousness and its constituent structures, namely, the feeling of dependence, the feeling of freedom, and the reciprocity between the two. Then we shall examine the nonworldly feeling of utter dependence. The Definite Structures of Feeling: Dependence and Freedom Schleiermacher indicates that in every actual self-consciousness there are two irreducible elements, a being-for-self and a coexistence-with- other.41 The Glaubenslehre hints, and the Psychologie tends to confirm, that the primary sense of the term "other" is a human person or community. The polarity 'Ich-Du' is a pregiven condition of all experi- ence. The 'I' cannot be actual without its 'Thou,' self-consciousness cannot be actual without consciousness of other; consequently the 'I-Thou' polarity is the "basic condition of all experience." 42 The sense of 'other' as 'object for knowledge' is a derivative, secondary objectification; theoretical objectivity is a socially constituted abstrac- tion from the primordial life World. On the other hand, the original, existential sense of coexistence-with-other refers to the concrete inter- action of real beings in the life World. In this interaction, consciousness or feeling assumes two different structures: the feeling of dependence and the feeling of freedom. These are not mere contingent apprehensions or mere accidental modifications of subjectivity; rather, they are structures assumed by consciousness in its concrete interaction. They are modes of being-in-the-World.43 The feeling of dependence is the common element in all receptivity deter- minations of the subject,44 and it signifies a concrete determination of 40 Systematically expressed, the general self-consciousness has as its primary determinate modes the Gattungsbewusstsein or "consciousness of species."

Without the other and its influence, the subject would not be determined as he is. Conversely, the feeling of freedom is the common element in all spontaneity determinations of the subject,45 and it signifies a self- originated counterinfluence upon other, such that the other would not be determined as he is without the influence of the subject. As self- originated, the counterinfluence is relatively independent of the other and involves a relative transcendence of the other and his influence. However, in human experience, receptivity is the primary element. In order for freedom to be exercised on the other, the other must first be given, and that means "given to receptivity," and involves a feeling of dependence. The consciousness of dependence and the consciousness of freedom are concrete determinate modes of coexistence-with-other. The dependence of one being presupposes and corresponds to the predominant spon- taneous influence of another, and vice versa. Freedom and dependence, taken together as modes of being of the self-consciousness as such, signify the reciprocal interdependence of self and other: Whenever dependence or passivity is posited in one part of finite being, then in another part of finite being spontaneous self-activity and causality is posited, to which the former dependence is related. This situation of mutual reference of the differently distributed causality and dependence constitutes the natural order.46 The passive states of one thing are only the result of the active states of others;... On the other hand, the way in which the active states of the thing emerge successively and the strength which they display depends not only on each thing's distinctive mode of existence, but also upon its co- existence with others, and so its active states depend both on the influence of others and on its own passive states.47 However, reciprocal interdependence means something more than a correlation between the receptivity of one being and the spontaneity of 437 45 Ibid. 46 Ibid., par. 5i.I. This passage takes us beyond a description and intentional analysis of self-consciousness in the direction of ontology. Schleiermacher's analysis is not merely phenomenological. He suggests, although he does not explicitly or systematically develop, the positive, realistic, ontological implications of his phe- nomenological description. He is more interested in doing the latter than the former. But he does not abstain from all reality-belief and acceptance; he writes in a marginal note: " If the objects are not created by our activity, it follows that they are as they are, independent of us" (Gi., par. 4-3; Gl., Redeker ed., p. 27 n. c). 47 Gi., par. 46, postscript.</page><page sequence="15">The Journal of Religion another. Reciprocity between beings also means that no matter how much the subject may be conditioned by and dependent on the other, he can subject the other to a counterinfluence of some sort, no matter how minimal.48 Reciprocity is inclusive of freedom, and as such is the general, basic structure of World consciousness. 49 Within the World, freedom and dependence are never absolute or total, but always mutually delimited and conditioned by each other. Within the World, freedom and dependence are finite, limited, and relative. There is no absolute freedom or absolute dependence. Given the primacy of dependence, freedom is a response to, a counterinfluence exerted upon, an other antecedently given and already active. On a higher level or grade (Stufe) of immediate self-consciousness, in contrast to World consciousness, is the feeling of utter dependence. This immediate self-consciousness is exclusively a feeling of dependence, that is, exclusively a receptivity determination of the subject. There is no reciprocity between self and other; the relation is exclusively one of dependence.50 The absence of reciprocity between self and other is not opaque, or a "night in which all cows are black." The feeling of utter dependence is significative. Negatively it signifies that here we have not at all to do with the consciousness of the species. For the religious relation is not a relation within the human species, but a relation of humanity to an other.51 The contrast between conscious being as a species and the being given to consciousness must be overcome in self-consciousness; the self-consciousness must be affected by an other. But clearly not by an other to which it could react. Hence a feeling of absolute dependence.52 48 Ibid., par. 4.2. Again a marginal note clarifies matters somewhat: "Here is the basis of our inclination to deify heavenly bodies, stars, and powers of nature, against which our feeling of freedom is minimal. Likewise the tendencies to deify persons who have exhibited a constant, creative and formative power" (GI., Redeker ed., p. 27 n. b). The fact that all of these worldly interactions are accompanied by a feeling of freedom, even though minimal, means that freedom serves as a critical principle and prohibits such deifying projections of man beyond himself as idolatrous. For such deities are mere projections of a weak feeling of freedom, and they do represent reductions of theology to anthropology. Only when the full stature and scope of freedom is recognized to be coextensive with the world can such reductions of theology to anthropology be avoided. Conversely, authentic piety, which has the nonworldly One for its object, is qualitatively different from such idolatrous anthropomorphisms (cf. n. 67 below). 49 GI., par. 4.2. 50 Ibid., par. 4.4 (cf.

Schleiermacher maintains that there is a close resemblance between the feeling of the sublime and the feeling of utter dependence, and his description of the feeling of the sublime brings out the correlation of subordination of the subject with the dominance of the codetermining other: "Here the impression [of the sublime] is bound up with-I will not say a life- hindrance-but with the consciousness that we concede to that outside of us which is influencing us, a power over us, and we submit ourselves to this power."53 The religious feeling of utter dependence is similar, although qualitatively different because its object is infinite: "What we mean by the term 'devotion' taken in its simplest and most general sense, is a finding of self under the control of an other, a sinking, as it were, under the infinity of the object, and yet being attracted to it again and again. It is a losing of self in the infinite, bound up with the recognition that here every reaction is completely inadmissible."54 It is clear that the feeling of utter dependence is a multifaceted immediate self-consciousness. It signifies a sense of creaturely dependence on the one hand, but on the other hand it combines the central elements of the idea of the holy, namely, awe and fascination at the object.55 Even more important is its unique intentional structure through which the existence of God is originally apprehended: "Finding oneself in immediate self-consciousness to be utterly dependent is the only way in general that one's own being and the infinite being of God can be one in self-consciousness." 56 Positively, the feeling of utter dependence is a kind of proof, an existential proof, for the existence of God. Schleiermacher's Existential Prooffor God An existential proof does not consist in a chain of reasoning from 439 53 Ibid., p. 200. 54 Ibid., p. 211. 55 Cf. Rudolf Otto, The Idea of the Holy, trans. John W. Harvey (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1959), chaps. 3-4. Otto's account of Schleiermacher amounts to little more than a caricature. The preceding quotation clearly shows that the feeling of utter dependence combines not only a sense of creatureliness and dependence, but also a multifaceted sense of its object, combining both mysterium tremendum and the sense of fascination. Although Otto reached his position independently, it appears as if his contribution to the sense of the holy is largely one of assembling additional factual data, rather than isolating and describing structures. 56 Gi., par. 32.</page><page sequence="17">The Journal of Religion premises to conclusion in which existence is inferred. Rather, such a "proof" consists in the discovery of a presence; as Schleiermacher says, " God is given to feeling in an original way." 57 John Wild characterizes his existential argument for transcendence-an argument similar to Schleiermacher's-in the following way: "This is an existential argument from motions rather than notions. One must live through this passage to really understand the argument, which simply brings out the sense and clarifies the original, lived experience, not merely of the individual himself, although this is essential, but that of other individuals and other cultures as well."'58 The concern is not with formal demonstration as such, but rather is focused on the tracing of such demonstrations for God back to their existential roots. The concern is not with notions, but with their underlying foundation in experience. However, the goal is not simply to substitute one type of proof for another, but rather to clarify the basis and sense of the formal demon- strations, which represent further abstractions from and higher, more technical and explicit formulations of, the original sense. Such clarifica- tion should overcome the deficiencies of abstract, formal analysis of the arguments at the notional level.59 Schleiermacher's existential proof for God consists in an inves- tigation of the pious apprehension of God as the nonsurpassable source of freedom. Our task is to bring to light the orientation of the subject. We have already found that the consciousness of freedom is a determinate mode of coexistence-with-other, that is to say, a reciprocal response to the other. The questions are, How is such a response possible? What is the source of freedom? The world, or the natural order, is not the source of freedom, for, as the totality of factors con- ditioning freedom, the world sets limits to freedom. For Schleiermacher, any contention that the world is the source of freedom would really amount to a deterministic denial of freedom. It would mean that the subject is completely determined from without, such that his "free" act would be merely a mechanical extension of such external in- 57 Ibid., par. 4.4. 58John Wild, "An Existential Argument for Transcendence," in Existence and he World of Freedom (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1963), p. 209. 59 For the important distinction between real apprehension and notional apprehen- sion, between real assent and notional assent, cf. John Henry Newman, Grammar of Assent (New York: Image Books, 1955). The philosophical predecessor common to both Newman and Schleiermacher is John Locke, whom Schleiermacher designates as the originator of Gefuehlsphilosophie in his History of Philosophy lectures (in Saemmtliche Werke, Abteilung 3, Band 4, Teil I [Berlin: G. Reimer, 1839], p. 263). 440</page><page sequence="18">Schleiermacher and Feuerbach fluence.60 But freedom-the immediate consciousness of spontaneity determinations of the subject-is a spontaneously self-originated act. Such an act relatively transcends the other and relatively transcends the World. Consequently, freedom cannot have its basis in the World. Reciprocal interaction with the World presupposes, but is not the cause of, freedom. However, while freedom is a self-originated act, it is not a capacity for self-origination. Human freedom is not its own source: "The totality of our free inner movement considered as a unity cannot be represented by a feeling of absolute freedom, because our whole existence does not present itself to consciousness as having proceeded from our own self-activity. Therefore, in any temporal being, a feeling of absolute freedom can have no place." 61 Man is free, but not self- positing; the World conditions and limits, but it is not the source of, freedom. Free human existence relatively transcends the World, but is itself transcended by something greater: "The self-consciousness accompanying our entire self-activity-and because this is never zero, it accompanies our entire existence-and which negates absolute freedom, is already in and for itself the consciousness that our entire free self- activity derives from elsewhere.... But without a feeling of freedom, a feeling of utter dependence would not be possible." 62 In the feeling of utter dependence, man identifies himself with the World as part of it, despite his relative transcendence of it.63 Both self and World are transcended by and exist in utter dependence on nonworldly infinite being: "This overcoming of contrasts [namely, between self and World] could not be our consciousness, if we were not conditioned and determined by something. But not something within the sphere of contrasts, for then the contrasts would not be overcome. Rather we are conditioned by the transcendent ground itself.., through which alone our being can be one with the rest of being. This transcendent determi- nation of self-consciousness is the religious aspect or the religious feeling; and in this feeling the transcendent ground or the highest being itself is represented." 64 To anticipate Schleiermacher's fuller discussion in the Glaubenslehre, the feeling of utter dependence signifies the dependence of the totality of finite being on nonworldly absolute spontaneity and 44' 60 GI., pars. 32.2; 34.2; cf.

Let us anticipate one objection: Why must the feeling of utter dependence signify God, or a nonworldly absolute vitality? Why may it not signify a merely mundane dependence, some aspect of the World on which the self is very dependent ? For example, why not interpret the feeling of utter dependence in a psychological sense so that it would actually signify a neurotic inability? Such an interpretation would represent a return to Feuerbach; for if utter dependence is only a neurotic inability, then the recognition of this fact would be "thera- peutic " and would result in the dissolution of the feeling of utter depen- dence. For the therapy would consist in the recognition that one is not utterly dependent, but only contingently and temporarily hindered from being fully free. The hindrance in this case is a merely mundane anthropological condition, a neurosis. To regard such neurotic inability as "dependence on God" would be to persist in an arrested, neurotic state, in which full, authentic human freedom is not achieved. Con- 442 65 Gl., par. 51.I. Schleiermacher indicates that the most direct and least speculative way of expressing the codeterminant of the feeling of utter dependence is the dialectical formula "God is absolute inwardness and absolute vitality." This formula preserves the multifaceted nature of the feeling of utter dependence and is the best way of characterizing the " numinous" in contrast to the world; it also expresses the utter difference of God from finite freedom. However, one writer questions the legitimacy of "inferring" the existence of God from the mere "psychic datum" of the feeling of utter dependence: "An analysis of the religious self-consciousness permits one to say that the subject.. . is contingent; it does not permit a definite claim about the being upon which the subject is dependent" (Van A. Harvey, "A Word in Defense of Schleiermacher's Theological Method," Journal of Religion 42, no. 3 [July 1962]: 161). Elsewhere Harvey suggests that not even an indefinite claim can be made about the object on the basis of the feeling of utter dependence, because Schleiermacher " cannot derive any content from the feeling of absolute dependence " (Schleiermacher as Contemporary: Journal for Theology and Church, ed. Robert W. Funk [New York: Herder &amp; Herder, i970], p. 39). Such contentions presuppose that feeling is merely psychological in nature, relative to and signifying only the being of the subject; consequently, any assertion about something other than the subject and his experience involves a tacit inference, or at least a transcendence of mere feeling. This is to raise once again Feuerbach's question "How will you get beyond your feeling?" (EOC, p. i1). Schleiermacher's radically different phenomenology of feeling, in which feeling mediates the presence of entire undivided being to the subject, bypasses this formulation of the problem, if not the problem itself. For Schleiermacher the problem is not to get beyond feeling to infer the existence of something absent from experience, but rather to isolate, describe, and interpret the divine presence through its distinctive mode of givenness.</page><page sequence="20">Schleiermacher and Feuerbach versely, if on these assumptions one somehow achieved freedom despite one's utter dependence, such a liberation from a mundane, psycho- logical inability would imply that the "feeling of utter dependence" and its object have become superfluous. They are superfluous because they are reducible to a mundane condition and a merely mundane dependence. This would mean that theology would be reducible to anthropology. But to argue this way is open to serious objection, as we have already shown. Moreover, the contention that the feeling of utter dependence is real, but has a mere mundane entity for its object, denies freedom. According to Schleiermacher, religious consciousness is constituted by both utter dependence and freedom. The unifying element is the consciousness of relative freedom: without the feeling of freedom there would be no consciousness of God, and without God there could be no freedom. Consequently, according to Schleiermacher, the specific sense of utter dependence emerges along with and is co-constituted with the con- sciousness of freedom. The consciousness of freedom signifies that the self and World stand in a relation of reciprocal interdependence, and this means that the free self is part of the homogeneous World order.66 However, although he is part of the whole, the free self is able to subject the World to his free counterinfluence by modifying its order or by instituting a new order of his own within it. Thus, the free self relatively transcends the World. Finite freedom is transordinal: it is able to surmount the conditioning influences of the World and to exert a self-originated counterinfluence on the whole. Such transordinal freedom is presupposed by the mundane, psychological cure; for if the subject could not call into question one order (e.g., the neurosis) and replace it with another (e.g., the cure), the mundane problem could not be overcome in principle, and no "cure" effected. Consequently, to contend that man is utterly dependent on a mundane entity is to deny that freedom is transordinal and that freedom is able to transcend the conditioning influences of the World and to exert a counter- influence on it. But to deny that freedom is able to transcend order and institute new order is to deny freedom. And if freedom is denied, so is the feeling of utter dependence. Schleiermacher thinks that the contention that the whence of utter 443 66 GI., par. 34. The immediate consciousness of freedom signifies that the self is part of the system of nature, which is constituted by the different distributions of reciprocal causality and receptivity (par. 51) and in which the receptive states of one thing are only the result of the active states of others (par. 46, postscript).</page><page sequence="21">The Journal of Religion dependence is a mundane object implies either a denial of freedom or an identification of God with World. If God and World are identified, this not only implies pantheism, it also implies a reduction of theology to anthropology.67 In support of his contentions, Schleiermacher indi- cates that the feeling of utter dependence emerges only along with the consciousness of full freedom. Such self-consciousness signifies that while man is free, he is not the source of his freedom, nor is he the source of the influences coming to him from the World. However, far from contradicting finite freedom, utter dependence coincides with and is 67 The preceding account is simply an exposition of Schleiermacher's argument in GI., par. 32.2. Since this is an important passage, we cite it in full: "There is also a nonreligious account of this finding oneself in utter dependence; it might be said that utter dependence only means the dependence of finite individuals on the whole and on the totality of all finite being, and that what is co-posited, and that to which one is related is not God but the world. But we can only regard this account as a misunderstanding. For, to be sure, we do recognize a co-positing of the world in our self-consciousness, but this is different from the copositing of God in self-consciousness. For the world, even if one regards it as a unity, is still a unity cleft and divided within itself; thus this unity is at the same time a totality of all contrasts and differences and all the determinate manifold of things existing through these contrasts. Every man is one of these determinate things and he participates in all the contrasts. Now to be one with the world in self-consciousness is nothing else than to be conscious of oneself as a co-living part of this whole. This self-consciousness cannot possibly be a con- sciousness of utter dependence. Rather, since all parts are in reciprocal interaction with each other, this being-one-with-the-whole is essentially something twofold: there is, to be sure, a feeling of dependence, insofar as all other parts act spontaneously on one, but there is also a feeling of freedom insofar as one is himself self-active and influences the other parts of the whole. The one element cannot be separated from the other. The feeling of utter dependence is, therefore, not to be explained as a co-positing of the world in self-consciousness, but only as a co-positing of God as the absolute, undivided unity. For there is in immediate relation to God no feeling of freedom, nor can the feeling of dependence in relation to him be one to which a feeling of freedom can accrue as a counterpart. [If that were so, then the feeling of utter dependence would be limited and diminished by the countervailing feeling of freedom.] On the contrary, at the highest level of Christian piety, and with the clearest consciousness of the most unimpeded self-activity, the unconditional character [die Schlechthinnigkeit] of dependence on the codeterminant remains un- diminished. And this is what is meant by the assertion, 'finding oneself to be utterly dependent is the only way that God and self can be together in self-consciousness.' If one abolishes this distinction and mistakes the self-consciousness referring to God as only referring to the world, one must also dispute the feeling of freedom in the latter self-consciousness. Indeed, one must reject the feeling of freedom entirely, since there is no moment in self-consciousness in which we do not posit ourselves as one with the world. This nonreligious explanation, which rejects the here-asserted distinctiveness of the pious self-consciousness as a deception, comes sometimes from those who explain all feeling of freedom as a deception, but also from those who contend that there is nothing on which we could feel utterly dependent. The latter reject all distinctions between God and world." 444</page><page sequence="22">Schleiermacher and Feuerbach the basis of maximal freedom and free activity, such that it is not inappropriate to regard utter dependence as liberating and vitalizing.68 The consciousness of freedom signifies that both self and World are utterly dependent on a yet more primordial source which is neither self nor World, but qualitatively other than both. It should be noted that Schleiermacher as a phenomenologist regards religious consciousness as yielding evidence about itself, World, and God. This evidence he calls the original presuppositions of religious consciousness. Properly understood and consistently interpreted at the level of metaphysical schemes, these original presuppositions imply a rejection of all types of World views which either deny the distinction between God and World or deny the reality of freedom. All such metaphysical theories are in conflict with the evidence of religious consciousness, and for this reason such theories cannot be used to for- mulate, much less communicate, the meaning and expressions of religious consciousness. Such abstract schemes are at odds with the concrete expressions and meaning to be communicated: The only views which are unsuitable for dogmatic language are those which in no way distinguish between the concepts of God and world, those which do not allow a contrast between good and evil, and therefore make no definite distinction between the spiritual and sensible elements in man. For these are the original presuppositions of the religious consciousness, because without these presuppositions the self-consciousness, when widened to a world-consciousness, could not be contrasted with the God-consciousness, nor could one speak of a distinction between a free and a hindered higher self-consciousness. Consequently one could not speak of a redemption and a need for redemption.69 We must now focus on the distinctive mode of givenness of God to self-consciousness, namely, the intentional structure of the feeling of utter dependence. We shall seek to show that this feeling does represent and signify its codeterminant through an appropriate intentional structure. The feeling of utter dependence is a determination of feeling or immediate self-consciousness. But it is not a mundane determination or modification. Rather it takes on a distinctive structure which is correlative to and supported by its codeterminant through which the meaning of its codeterminant is originally constituted. The distinguishing feature of the feeling of utter dependence is the nonreciprocal relation between self and other, or between self and 445 68 Ibid. 69 Ibid., par. 28.1.</page><page sequence="23">The Journal of Religion 'whence.' We have found that in the case of World consciousness the reciprocity between self and other signifies a relative transcendence of other by self. The subject can counterinfluence the other because he is relatively independent of him and so relatively transcends the other. However, the nonreciprocal relation of utter dependence signifies that there is no independence of the subject vis-a-vis the 'whence.' In order to counterinfluence the 'whence' of utter dependence, the free subject would have to be relatively independent of it and thus transcend and surpass the 'whence.' Such independence, transcendence, and sur- passing of the codeterminant of immediate consciousness are essentially and entirely excluded by the feeling of utter dependence. If, as we have found, the feeling of partial dependence with its subsequent and accompanying feeling of partial freedom signifies that the other is surpassable and subject to counterinfluence, the feeling of utter dependence signifies that its 'whence' cannot be subject to counter- influence and is unsurpassable. The feeling of utter dependence, as an immediate existential re- lationship (a receptivity determination of the subject) signifies that its codetermining 'whence' exists, and exists in a nonsurpassable way. The 'whence' cannot be transcended or surpassed even relatively by finite freedom, for it is the presupposition and source of freedom's existence. The being referred to by the feeling of utter dependence is unique in that it cannot be surpassed, and as unsurpassable by the free subject who is united with the whole of finite being, it surpasses all others, the One on whom All depend.70 Prior to all conceptual objectification and judgment of its existence, this One is not only given, but irreducibly given, to feeling in an original way. The feeling of utter dependence, therefore, provides the original existential matrix and the phenomenological genesis of the term "god." For the Glaubenslehre, all theological assertions must be traceable to and developed out of this original mode of givenness and its distinctive sense.71 God is the irreducible and unsurpassable presence who exists prior to all attempts to explain or derive his existence from 446 70 Ibid., pars. 8, 46.2. For similar versions of this argument in contemporary literature, cf. Henry Dumery, The Problem of God in Philosophy of Religion, trans. Charles Courtney (Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern University Press, 1964) ; John Wild; Aime Forest's essay surveying French Catholic literature deriving its inspiration from Maurice Blondel, "St. Anselm's Argument in Reflexive Philosophy," in The Many- faced Argument, ed. John Hick and Arthur C. McGill (New York: Macmillan Co., 1967), pp. 275-301. 71 Gl., par. 4-4-</page><page sequence="24">Schleiermacher and Feuerbach elsewhere, for God is the presupposition-the 'whence'-of all finite, derived spontaneity on which all such "explanations" depend. God is the terminus a quo of thought, and as such, he is the precondition and presupposition of all proof.72 Transcendent to both self and World, God is that beyond which there is nothing greater: he is unsurpassable. Schleiermacher and Anselm The sense of the term "god," which is constituted and conditioned by the feeling of utter dependence, is an existential antecedent of Anselm's formula, "something than which nothing greater can be conceived." 73 Schleiermacher has isolated and described the existential dialectic underlying the logical dialectic of Anselm's argument: that on which self and World utterly depend and cannot surpass, itself surpasses all things. Conversely, Anselm's "something than which nothing greater can be conceived" is a more explicit conceptual rendering of the 447 72 Dial. (0), p. 307. This assertion places Schleiermacher squarely within the Augustinian tradition, especially as developed by Bonaventure, for whom the sense of the presence of God is prior to all attempts to represent the divine nature by concepts and prior to all judgments about it. Schleiermacher agrees with much of Bonaventure, right down to the contention that the " idea" of God is virtually innate (GI., Ist ed., par. 10.4), the original mode of divine presence to man. The idea of God is conditioned (for Schleiermacher) only by the feeling of utter dependence, which represents a deobjectification of it, while nevertheless retaining the cardinal points that the idea of God is neither heteronomous nor adventitious. As conditioned and mediated by the feeling of utter dependence, it is the original mode of divine presence, irreducible to any other, the presupposition and precondition of all more narrowly circumscribed and defined God concepts. However, as the irreducible presence, the light which illumines the intellect, God does more than merely glow and shine; he is an active, driving principle underlying the cognitive process: "We have that transcendental principle in us as the driving principle of our consciousness, as the highest life of thinking and as the impulse to thought, but never as an object of thought" (Dial. [O], p. 272). As the ultimate source of entire human self-activity, God is ipso facto the source of cognitive spontaneity. It should be noted therefore, that utter dependence of man on divine pure act negates only absolute self-originating freedom on man's part; it does not negate finite freedom and finite spontaneity but rather establishes these. In the feeling of utter dependence, utter dependence and maximal finite freedom coincide (Gl., par. 32.2) such that finite freedom is liberated through its utter dependence on and participation in divine pure act. Consequently, it will not do to play off Schleiermacher against Job-as the active protester against God-because Job really illustrates Schleiermacher's thesis concerning human freedom's utter dependence on God: In the name of God-the whence of human free activity-to protest against a God concept or theology. What satisfies Job is not a more adequate conception of God, but a sense of the divine presence and his own utter dependence, his own creatureliness which is not abandoned by God. 73 Anselm, Proslogion, chap. 2, cited in Hick and McGill, p. 4.</page><page sequence="25">The Journal of Religion original existential sense of the term "god." Using his more explicit formula, Anselm seeks to show that God cannot be conceived not to exist and that his nonexistence is impossible. Moreover, for purposes of argument, Anselm shows that his formula is superior to Gaunilo's vaguer formula, " God is greater than all things," because it preserves and expresses better, at the level of explicit argument and analysis, the irre- ducibility and unsurpassability of God which are constitutive of religious experience. The choice between the two formulas is made by reflection at the level of notional understanding, for reasons of clarity, precision, requirements of argument, etc. Such are the concerns of theological reflection, but these are not the immediate concerns of piety.74 For his part, Schleiermacher would very likely regard his analysis of the feeling of utter dependence as filling a lacuna in Anselm's argument. The feeling of utter dependence is the Grundform of existence out of which the idea of God arises and is constituted in its religious 448 74 Another such reflective concern is Hartshorne's question whether divine un- surpassability means "unsurpassable except by himself" (Charles Hartshorne, "What Did Anselm Discover?" in Hick and McGill, p. 328). The manner in which Hartshorne formulates and pursues this question is a speculative one moving primarily at the conceptual level and involving a distinction between divine essence and attributes. This is a procedure and apparatus from which Schleiermacher takes pains to dissociate himself (GI., par. 50.4). Schleiermacher confines himself to a descrip- tion and explication of the feeling of utter dependence in its various determinate modifications. If he were to have written a philosophical theology, or developed an ontology, Schleiermacher would have had to take account of the ontological implications of religious consciousness as set forth in the Glaubenslehre. In such an account he would have found useful Hartshorne's distinction between essence, existence, and actuality: "Existence is that the defined abstract nature is somehow concretely actualized; but how it is actualized, in what particular state, with what particular content not deducible from the abstract definition, constitutes the actuality" (p. 329). Schleiermacher himself makes such distinctions, although within a different framework: in the Glaubenslehre the assertion " God exists " is a general sense constituted at the level of general God consciousness, which is itself the common element within, and an abstraction from, the historically determinate modified forms in which it appears in Christian faith. The latter are contingent, not deducible from the former; Schleiermacher indicates that the general belief that God is omnipotent and eternal is also shared by the devil and is not theologically efficacious (Gi., par. 167.2). Since such historical modifications of the God consciousness are not deducible from its general generic form, and yet do determine its full meaning-since they render it determinate and actual-Schleiermacher may not be very far from Hartshorne's proposal. The abstract formal attributes of generic God consciousness receive their specific and determinate meaning in the Glaubenslehre only when they are viewed as coinhering with those attributes deriving from the specific, historically given elements determining Christian religious consciousness (GI., pars. Io, 29, 64.2, 90.2). This suggests that, like Hartshorne's analysis, the essential, structural elements are not the whole, but elements within the whole which must be viewed in combination with the other, contingent elements (Gi., par. 64-2).</page><page sequence="26">Schleiermacher and Feuerbach sense. The quotation from Anselm on the title page of the Glaubenslehre is very significant: "Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam, sed credo ut intelligam.-Nam qui non crediderit, non experietur, et qui expertus non fuerit, non intelliget." [For I do not seek to understand in order to believe, but I believe in order to understand.-For who has not believed, does not experience, and who has not experienced, does not understand.] 75 Faith is accompanied by a sense of the divine presence, and this sense or experience is the source of the idea of God. The idea of God-something than which nothing greater can be conceived-has its phenomenological genesis and constitution in the feeling of utter dependence, for it expresses a meaning already pre- delineated and given. This is how Schleiermacher himself understands Anselm: "He proceeds from the indubitable, invariant consciousness of God given in self-consciousness, and he postulates only that this is to be clarified in the sphere of intuition [viz., objective consciousness]."76 Such procedure also closely parallels that of Schleiermacher: "Dog- matics must therefore presuppose faith or immediate certainty, and so it does not have to produce faith in God, but rather to explicate the content of the already-given God-consciousness." 77 The feeling of utter dependence is the prior sense of divine presence implicit in the idea of God. One cannot understand the idea fully without this sense of that to which the idea refers and which the idea explicates. Any apprehension of the idea which lacks this sense remains a merely notional apprehension, an apprehension of idea alone, without an appreciation of the original existential sense which Anselm's formula explicates.78 From the merely notional apprehension there is an easy transition to the further contention that the argument moves ex- clusively at the level of ideas and makes an illicit transition from idea to 449 75 Gi., Redeker ed., title page. 76 Friedrich Schleiermacher, Geschichte der Philosophie (in Saemmtliche Werke, Abteilung 3, Band 4, Teil I, p. 184)- 77 Gi., par. 33.3. 78 Cf. Norman Malcolm's comments: "At a deeper level, I suspect that the argu- ment can be thoroughly understood only by one who has a view of that human 'form of life' that gives rise to the idea of an infinitely great being, who views it from the inside, not just from the outside, and who has therefore, at least some inclination to partake in that religious form of life. This inclination, in Kierkegaard's words, is 'from the emotions"' ("Anselm's Ontological Arguments," in Hick and McGill, p. 320). Malcolm is correct in sensing the inadequacy of a merely notional apprehen- sion of the argument, for this involves treating Anselm's formula as a "mere idea." This is the one serious mistake which a proper apprehension of the argument com- pletely rules out, as Hartshorne has shown on the conceptual level, and as Schleier- macher shows for the existential level.</page><page sequence="27">The Journal of Religion reality. Such an interpretation is limited; it views the argument "from the outside." Schleiermacher's interpretation views the argument "from the inside," by tracing the idea of God to its origin in religious experience. Although the argument undoubtedly functions later on the notional level, it cannot be properly appreciated if it is not also seen as ex- plicating a lived, existential sense. The feeling of utter dependence clarifies how the idea of God comes to be constituted in consciousness for the understanding, and it prevents a reduction of the argument to the merely notional level. However, there is one objection usually brought against such an interpretation of Anselm: Anselm rejects any experience of God such as that involved in the feeling of utter dependence.79 In support of this objection, consider the following remarkable passage from the Proslogion: " If you have not found your God, how is He this which you have found, and which you have understood with such certain truth and true certitude ? But if you have found [Him], why is it that you do not experience what you have found? Why, O Lord God, does my soul not experience you if it has found You ? " s Anselm's response to his own question consists in an appeal to a religious experience which exhibits structures and contrasts similar to the feeling of utter depend- ence: " In truth it [viz., the eye of the soul = Gefuehl ?] is both darkened in itself and dazzled by You. It is indeed both darkened by its own littleness and overwhelmed by Your immensity. It is, in fact, both restricted by its own limitedness and overcome by Your fullness. For how great is that light from which shines every truth that gives light to the understanding!... Truly it is more than can be understood by any creature." 81 In this passage there is the same dialect of existence which we previously discovered in the feeling of utter dependence, namely, the utter subordination of the subject and the unqualified dominance and surpassing power of God. Thus, although God is not an object of experience in the ordinary sense, nevertheless there is a sense in which he is experienced. As the light which illumines the understanding and as the terminus a quo of thought, God is the ultimate basis and presupposition of all experience whatsoever. He is present as a constituent element in all experience, yet never an experienced 450 79 Arthur C.

The divine transcendence of spontaneous under- standing is an integral aspect of the sense of the divine unsurpassability. The divine transcendence is an integral aspect of the original mode of givenness of God to feeling, and is therefore an integral aspect of the sense of the ideal of God. Precisely because "something than which nothing greater can be conceived" has its existential and phenomeno- logical genesis in the feeling of utter dependence, it can never be regarded as a mere idea, or an idea which fully exhausts the reality which it signifies. On the other hand, if the existential dimension and matrix of the argument is lost or suppressed, the divine transcendence in its authentic religious sense is threatened, and with it the very idea of God: "Only in its highest degree is thought truly thought, reason. Only when thy thought is God dost thou truly think, rigorously speaking; for only God is the realised, consummate, exhausted thinking power. Thus, in conceiving God, man first conceives reason as it truly is.... God is thy highest idea, the supreme effort of thy under- standing, thy highest power of thought."'85 So contends Feuerbach. But Schleiermacher's treatment of this issue is well worth considering: 451 82 Dial. (0), p. 272 (cf. n. 69 above). 83 Anselm, Proslogion, chap. 15, p. 137- 84 Cf. Langdon Gilkey's remarks about phenomenology and theological method (Langdon Gilkey, Naming the Whirlwind: The Renewal of God-Language [New York: Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1969], pp. 242-46). Gilkey mistakenly assumes that phenom- enology cannot deal with entities "transcendent to" consciousness, such as meta- physical systems, principles, etc., including God. He does not see that " transcendence " of consciousness is a sense constituted by consciousness, and which is the business of transcendental phenomenology to clarify and explain (cf. Eugen Fink's difficult but clarifying article, "The Phenomenological Philosophy of Edmund Husserl and Contemporary Criticism," in The Phenomenology of Husserl, ed. with introduction by R. O. Elveton [Chicago: Quadrangle Books, 1970], pp. 73-74). However, what is baffling is that, after having somehow banished God from consciousness as a "trans- cendent entity," Gilkey should, in the name of Schleiermacher, turn to religious consciousness and religious experience as a source of theological construction. For Schleiermacher, what makes religious experience theologically significant is that through the feeling of utter dependence, God is given to consciousness in a primordial, original way. If God were not a constituent element of religious consciousness, there would be no point theologically in turning to religious experience. 85 EOC, pp. 36-38.</page><page sequence="29">The Journal of Religion Those who rejoice in the possession of a concept of the highest being derived from elsewhere, but who have no experience of piety, will not admit that feeling expresses the same reality as their original concept. They assert that the God of feeling is a mere fiction, an idol, and they may perhaps even hint that such a fiction is more tenable in the form of polytheism. Those who will not admit either a concept of God or a feeling which represents him, base their position entirely on the contention that the representation of God which is built up out of utterances in which God appears in human terms, is self-contradictory and destroys itself. Meanwhile, pious men are aware that it is only in linguistic expression that they cannot avoid anthropomorphisms. But in their immediate consciousness they keep the object separate from its mode of representation. And they attempt to show their opponents that with- out this pregnant fullness of feeling, there would be no certainty-even for the highest and most explicit forms of objective consciousness ... and that to be consistent, they must restrict themselves to the lower level of life.86 Both Schleiermacher and Anselm agree on one fundamental point, that God is not directly apprehended in and through himself--for that would mean that one knows God as God knows God. Rather God is apprehended through a medium which is 'other than' God, namely, religious consciousness and its forms of expression. All such repre- sentations of God are finite and are not fully adequate to the thing signified. For example, Anselm observes that 'that-than-which-nothing- greater-can-be-conceived' is understood and conceived, but only in part. It is also greater than can be fully conceived: "Therefore, Lord, not only are you that than which a greater cannot be conceived, but you are also something greater than can be conceived. For since it is possible to think that there is such a thing, if you are not this same being, something greater than you could be conceived. But this cannot be." 87 As the second sentence in the quotation makes clear, the first assertion is not a blunder which undermines theological discourse. Anselm argues that it is possible to conceive that something is inconceivable.88 Thus, even if it were true that 'that-than-which-nothing-greater-can- be-conceived' were inconceivable, the expression itself can still be understood. But then the expression is at least partly significative, and the thing itself is at least partly understood, that is to say, "Surely 'that-than-which-a-greater-cannot-be-conceived' is understood and 452 86 GI., par. 5, postscript. 87 Anselm, Proslogion, chap. 15, in St. Anselm's Proslogion, p. 132. 88 Anselm, Reply to Guanilo IX, in ibid., pp. 187-89 (cf. also Hick and McGill, p. I5).</page><page sequence="30">Schleiermacher and Feuerbach does stand in relation to the understanding at least to this extent, that these matters concerning it are understood." 89 Schleiermacher makes a contribution to this aspect of the discussion: How is it possible to make distinctions between a thing which is supposedly inconceivable, and the conceivable representations of it which signify something of it-to wit, that it is "greater than can be conceived"? The answer is that the distinction between 'the given' and its various modes of representation is constituted 'within' religious consciousness: the sense of the divine transcendence is an integral aspect of the divine presence. The sense in which God is greater than can be conceived is already included in the consciousness of God as the source of freedom. Through the feeling of utter dependence, 'god' is constituted as an irreducible presence which is not at the disposal of man, but which "disposes" and liberates man. Naive, unreflective faith takes this presence for granted without question-accepts it in a straightforward way, although not without 'fear and trembling.' Reflection has for its object religious consciousness itself, and it finds there already constituted the predelineated sense of the divine surpassing of self and world. As the One on whom all utterly depend, God is not only 'that-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-conceived,' but also and for this reason, God is 'greater-than can-be-conceived.' There are aspects of God which surpass understanding. This assertion is true because it explicates the original sense of the divine surpassing included in the feeling of utter dependence. But it is equally true on the same basis that some aspects of God are understood-self and world, the totality of finite being, are surpassed by something greater. In the light of this understanding, there is one proposition which is genuinely inconceivable, because it does not accord either with the immediate consciousness of utter dependence or with the reflection on the sense of this immediate consciousness. This proposition is "God does not exist." Such a proposition is contradicted by the evidence of religious con- sciousness and by the Anselmian reflection which explicates its sense. For even though God cannot be fully understood, enough about God is understood for reflection to discover that God's nonexistence is ontologi- cally impossible. Thus, reflection goes beyond the naive certainty of religious consciousness by explicating it at the notional level in the form of a proposition. This proposition expresses the judgment that such a being cannot be conceived not to exist; if it can be conceived at all, such a being must exist. 453 89 Anselm, Reply to Guanilo I, in Hick and McGill, p. 13.</page><page sequence="31">The Journal of Religion Consequently, the proposition "God exists" is one which calls into question Feuerbach's axiom " If thy predicates are anthropomorphisms, the subject of them is an anthropomorphism too."90 Though the predicate be finite, the thing signified is not; it is greater. The subject of the predicates is not anthropomorphic-nor is it anthropos-because its nonexistence is impossible. The meaning of this proposition is not dependent on the existence of the truth-conditioning human species; it would be true even if no such species existed. However, though the proposition is supposed to be intelligible in its own right-so intelligible that even a fool can understand it-the proposition is not a mere exercise in conceiving or conceivability. For although the proposition is hardly beyond controversy or criticism on the reflective level, its meaning cannot be fully appreciated or criticized unless its concrete sense and phenomenological genesis are understood. The constitution of 'god' as 'something-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-conceived' through the feeling of utter dependence makes it clear that this is not an 'ontological argument'-an attempt to argue simply from the definition of a word to the real existence of the thing. For the under- standing of 'god' arising out of the feeling of utter dependence is not a mere definition whose words and meaning are arbitrarily selected and determined. Rather, this meaning is elicited by a given: it is not the case that thought imposes any necessity on things, but that the given imposes a certain necessity on feeling and reflection. It is not the case because I feel or think 'thus,' but rather, I feel and think 'thus' because I am dealing with a given which is the case. Therefore, one does not dispose of the argument by a simple rejection of the concept (Kant) or by psychologizing it (Feuerbach). The meaning of 'god' is not merely subjective, or subject-relative. The deliverance of both religious consciousness and Anselmian reflection on its sense is that God surpasses both self and World and therefore exists independent of self and World. III. CONCLUSION Schleiermacher's account of religious consciousness does not involve a reduction of theology to anthropology, but instead presents us with an existential version of Anselm's argument. The constitution of the sense of'god' as the 'whence' of utter dependence signifies that God is not merely a negation, nor can he be reduced to man's generic consciousness. 454 90 EOC, p. 17.</page><page sequence="32">Schleiermacher and Feuerbach The irreducible presence mediated by utter dependence means that God exists independent of religious consciousness. He is not the prisoner of religious consciousness, for he is not at the disposal of man. Psy- chologizing interpretations of utter dependence amount to non- religious, mundane explanations which Schleiermacher rejects as " confused." 91 For God is the One on whom all depend unconditionally, including such reductive 'explanations' of God and religious con- sciousness. Against such foreign, transcendent theories imposed on religious experience in dogmatic, speculative' fashion, Schleiermacher would insist on the right of religious experience to an open, un- prejudiced hearing and an interpretation which seeks to be compatible with the original, predelineated sense. As we have sought to show, this sense-both in itself and as made explicit by Anselm's meditations- resists and is fundamentally incompatible with all psychologizing interpretations. Therefore, Feuerbach does not represent the outcome, much less the fulfillment, of Schleiermacher. Feuerbach's psychologizing interpretation of religious consciousness can provide valuable insight, provided it is recognized for what it is, namely, a therapeutic principle for a decadent, perverted religious consciousness. Such a religious consciousness would be vulnerable to criticism on Schleiermacher's grounds as well. The all-too-human tendency to deify or project deities wherever there are either obstacles or enthusiasm must be held in check by a vital and sober sense of authentic freedom. But such genuine freedom is not opposed to utter dependence, for God's vitality is the ontological presupposition and foundation of finite freedom. Although the full measure of Schleier- macher's achievement has yet to be assessed, it can scarcely be doubted that he has given us an account of religious consciousness that can still speak to us by virtue of its genius and profundity. 455 91 Gi., par. 32.2.</page></plain_text>
