Leipzig, 1938. RM. 12. The quality of this doctoral dissertation is shown by its publication in the series of "Unter- suchungen" founded by the late Kurt Sethe. Dr. Otto has made a comprehensive study of the various localized bull cults of ancient Egypt and of their theological bases. His data are derived both from Egyptian sources, many of them rela- tively late, and from the remarks of classical writers. The two fundamental principles which the bull embodied were fertility and strength. He seems to have been revered in Egypt for these qualities as early as the Badarian period. Harvest festivals in which outstanding specimens partici- pated would direct attention to individual bulls. In regions where animal husbandry was of especial importance such bulls would tend to become recognized not only as participants in but as ob- jects of the cult. In some of the Delta nomes bull cults must have developed early in prehistoric days, for bulls were placed as symbols upon their standards. Of the various bulls worshiped, those of only three sites are fairly well known; and none of these has any connection with nome standards, though the bull cults as a group must all have originated at the same primitive pre-anthropomorphic culture level. The three cults describable are those of Apis of Memphis, Mnevis of Heliopolis, and Buchis of the Upper Egyptian nome of Thebes. 587</page><page sequence="2">588 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY At each site only one bull at a time was sacred. He was selected after his predecessor's death on the basis of distinctive markings, was ceremonially deified, and at death was buried with Osirian rites. Our information about Apis is the most exten- sive. His distinctive markings are seen on a 1st dynasty ostracon, and ceremonies of his cult are mentioned in Old Kingdom records. The earliest Apis tomb known, however, dates from the time of Amenhotep III (about 1400 B.C.), the latest from that of Julian the Apostate in A.D. 362. The first tombs were for individuals, but communal tomb structures with individual chambers were erected beginning with the end of the reign of Ramses II. Mnevis of Heliopolis seems to be mentioned, though not specifically by name, as early as the 6th dynasty. The only Mnevis tombs which have been excavated date from the reigns of Ramses II and Ramses VII. The bull of the Theban nome seems to be equated with the nome god Montu as early as the 12th dynasty, but the bull burials known at Hermonthis begin only in the 30th dynasty and continue until Diocletian's l1th year. The author's accounts of the sacred animals themselves and of the forms through which reverence was shown them are overshadowed in bulk and complexity by his sections on the theological ramifications-the original and de- rived conceptions of their nature and associates. In each instance geography combined with the bull's inherent qualities to produce illogical theological relationships. Apis, for example, becomes the herald or the soul of Ptah, the creator-god of the Memphite nome. Yet in his fertility aspect and also in death he appears as a manifestation of Osiris. Again, he is sometimes identified with the sun-god Atum, or with Horus the son of Osiris. Mnevis in turn is the "herald of Re (the Heliopolitan sun-god), who causes truth to ascend to Atum." The bull of the Theban nome acquires through Montu connections on the one hand with Re and on the other with Amon and the Eight primeval deities. Such theologizing represents, of course, an attempt to bridge the gap between primitive and later, higher forms of religion. The prestige of an ancient bull deity is enhanced by assimilating him to or associating him with the great gods of his own and perhaps of neighboring districts. But the relative power of even the greater gods could be changed by political developments. Hence the fortunes of the sacred bulls were affected by conquest and also by fluctuations in the extent of royal favor. In spite of priestly theory, the primitive animal deities as such seem to have retained their hold on the lives of the humble; only in the official cult did the forms under which they were represented tend on occasion to an- thropomorphism. Thus under the Ptolemies, Osiris-Apis became the widely worshiped Serapis. To thread the maze of theological speculations involves much careful interpretation on the part of the author. The general principles involved he has brought out clearly, and from the scat- tered, complicated, and (to our way of thinking) inconsistent data available he has drawn a reason- able picture of this particular phase of Egyptian theology. Thanks are due Dr. Otto for his com- prehensive presentation of both the practice and the rationalization of bull-worship in ancient Egypt. T.
