<plain_text><page sequence="1">Liza Wieland Upon the Flooding of Our House THE interior Hotel hallways, Ibis in Caen, guest room France, doors felt high-silled to me like to a appear ship, with watertight its narrow and interior hallways, guest room doors high-silled to appear watertight and inspire confidence, the dining room with picture windows on one side. I real- ized the exact ship I remembered was the ferry on which I had crossed the English Channel from Dover to Zeebrugge, Belgium, in 1977. This was a night crossing, and very rough; thus the windows in the lounge were dark mirrors, reflecting the varied discomforts of the passengers. So it seemed entirely logi- cal that my husband should awaken me with news about water, water where it ought not to be, inside our house, our new house in North Carolina. I took in the details in pieces: almost two feet of water, delivered by Hurricane Isabel, the day before. My husband handed me the e-mail he'd printed in the qybercafé down the street, bad news, a friend had written, the message in upper-case letters, as if he were shrieking, waves lapping against the outside of THE HOUSE. WATER INSIDE, 21, 22 INCHES. SOMEBODY WILL HAVE TO COME BACK TO DEAL WITH CLEANUP AND INSURANCE. SO SORRY. Tears Stood in my husband s eyes. He tried to speak, and his voice broke. My first impulse was to laugh. I couldn't believe it, even with the words in front of me. During the long run-up to Isabel, even as she preened and teased hundreds of miles offshore for more than a week, even as her predicted landfall never varied from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, then Pamlico Sound, and right into our front door near Oriental, North Carolina, I didn't think it could happen. Not to us. Not to me. My husband checked the National Weather Ser- vice and the National Hurricane Center several times a day. He worried as the storm grew stronger, then weaker, then stronger again. I reread e-mails from various family members: "Guess you know about the hurricane? Looks pretty close to your house." I felt oddly, supernaturally calm, even a little thrilled. [733]</page><page sequence="2">734 THE GEORGIA REVIEW In the Hotel Ibis, our four-year-old daughter slept in her little sideways Murphy bed, which a hotel clerk had had to unlock from the wall. She called it Snow Whites coffin, and it was the third in her series of narrow little beds that French hotels provide for children traveling with their parents. While my husband and I lay awake talking about what to do and who should go and when, she slept, but more restlessly than I can ever remember, crying out several times. In the morning, she told us she'd dreamed the sea witch had got into our house and stolen our belongings. She meant the fleshy Octopus vul- garis Ursula from the Disney version of The Little Mermaid. I knew she wasn't psychic. We'd been talking about the hurricane and watching BBC and CNN footage for days. But in the end, she understood more than I did about our losses. I had gone to France to teach American literature at the University of Paris in St. Denis, and, so I believed, to help heal the rift between our two countries. My husband and I had visited Paris twice as tourists; we'd loved the city pas- sionately and wanted to live there, so this job opportunity seemed more like a gift than like work. After accepting the appointment in February, I had enjoyed six months of a lively, tender correspondence with a professor of Anglophone literature from whom we would rent an apartment. I apologized to her for the bullying, inane behavior of the Bush administration toward France, the French, things French, and she generously assured me not to worry, that the French people did not blame all Americans for the actions of a few. I came to admire the way the French seemed to work, without contracts, on trust. They had a beautiful capital city, a complex, dramatic history, all that exquisite food and wine. I knew the French loved and protected their language, and I looked forward to speaking it with my students and colleagues. I sat for all of one afternoon in our apartment beside the hôtel de ville writing my introductory remarks, which went something like this: "My first language is English; French, which I adore and find highly expressive, is a second language, which I have studied since the age of seven. I will teach this class mostly in English, but the main thing is that we Americans and French understand one another, and I'm sorry the United States government is such a bad example in this area. I'm open to the ways in which we can put ideas together, using bits of both languages if necessary. As a writer, I'm happy to linger over words in this manner, attend to nuances, flavors." It is not an exaggeration to say I dreamed of the new language my French students and I would invent together; franglais was how my high</page><page sequence="3">LIZA WIELAND 735 school French teacher referred to this mélange - with some distaste, I now recall. She was French, Parisian to be exact. She was an Olympic swimmer. There was a story that she had swum the Seine to escape the Nazis. She married an American soldier after the war, when there was no rift to heal. I thought that night in Caen about the contents of the house, making a cata- logue in my head, what I cared for most, what really did matter, what I would actually miss. This list was shockingly, gratifyingly short. In the rest of that electrifying e-mail, our friends had said they would drag the soaked furniture and boxes outside, to ease the stink of river water in the house. I imagined the couch and chairs, the chests of drawers, the tables, all of it lying on the lawn, first in the rain, then in the dazzle of moonlight. I wanted badly to see it, to have seen it, what really happened, the water rising higher and higher, over the dock, the riprap, the lawn, the doorsills and into the house. And then fall- ing back, which it did rapidly, in less than a few hours. I thought of the early American poet Anne Bradstreets "Verses Upon the Burning of Our House, July 18th, 1666, Copied Out of a Loose Paper," in which the speaker cant keep herself from going back to look at the remains of her house, consumed by fire in the middle of the night. I taught this poem faithfully in American Literature classes for fifteen years, and then I stopped teaching it. There were two lines in the poem that disturbed me deeply: "That fearful sound of fire and fire / Let no man know is my desire." I didn t know how to talk about these lines, dropped oddly between the speaker s moment of coming awake to shrieking voices and her springing from bed to see the fire. I say I didn t know how to talk about them, but the truth is I didn't like the way I talked about them. I made a claim that the syntax, particularly in the second of these two lines, revealed Bradstreets desire for some sort of conflagration, a fiery spiritual upheaval. Remember, I told the students, this is the woman who later wrote to her chil- dren about her arrival in America, "I found a new world and new manners, at which my heart rose, But after I was convinced it was the way of God, I submit- ted and joined the church at Boston." She wanted more, I argued, she didn t want to submit to her old faith, she wanted to burn down that church at Boston and find freedom in the new world. I made similar assertions about another poem, published in 1678, called "The Author To Her Book." In 1650 and with- out her knowledge, Bradstreets brother-in-law took her manuscript of poems to a printer and came away with a volume titled The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America. In "The Author to her Book," Bradstreet addresses this volume</page><page sequence="4">736 THE GEORGIA REVIEW as "Thou ill-formed offspring of my feeble brain," but I tried to convince my students that certain words in the poem suggest the opposite, that she's proud of the book, believes it has a place in the world, even though it appears at first she had not wanted the poems to see the light of day. Our apartment in Paris was large and sunny and right on the Seine. Below us was the Café Marguerite, and just across the rue de Renard, l'hôtel de ville, Paris city hall. From the four casement windows, we had a view of the Pont d'Arcole, and beyond it, the towers and spires of Notre Dame, Sainte Chapelle, and the Conciergerie, formerly the home of the royal superintendent but more recently a prison. The late summer light was beautiful, clean, almost sharp at the edges. I felt it inside my body, that light, and I looked forward to watching it change in the course of a day, as well as in the passage of the six months we were to be there. We shared this apartment with a black cat named Renoir, and we were allergic to him, my daughter and I, and so he loved the two of us with especial passion, our legs, our clothes, our chairs at the dining table. I tried to make sense of his name, or at least the nonsense of it- for it was Theophile- Alexandre Steinlen who made the famous chat noir, not Renoir. You can buy this some- what sinister feline image everywhere in Paris and for every use: on paper, on scarves, on coasters and refrigerator magnets. Renoir the painter is all dancers and bathers, girl with a watering can, which hung in the hallway in my grade school, and so when I see it, I still smell the too cheerful tang of institutional lunch, even in the Musée d'Orsay. Renoir is soft women's faces and bodies; it was Renoir who said, "I never think I have finished a nude until I think I could pinch it." And also: "Why shouldn't art be pretty? There are enough unpleasant things in the world." Renoir the cat liked to escape out the kitchen window if we left it open, sit in the space between our building and the upper floor of the Café Marguerite, and watch us. In our first week there, he scratched my daughter just below her left nostril, and the mark of it was still visible three months later. We tried to like him, but it was clear we were not wanted. We arrived at our flooded house in the dark, Sunday night, 21 September, three days after the hurricane and three days before the full moon. The night was clear and warm, so that the river sparkled and gleamed, and our furniture on the lawn was bathed in pale light. At first, the scene seemed utterly peaceful, imbued with a kind of calm logic: on this night, the precise moment between the last day of summer and the first day of autumn, the owners of this house</page><page sequence="5">LIZA WIELAND 737 would of course want to live outside. Upon closer inspection, however, the arrangement suggested panic. The couch and chairs stood upright, but at odd angles to one another, so that the people sitting out here would have been unable to communicate; facing in different directions, no one would have heard what anyone else was saying. The windows of the house were thrown open, even the two large picture windows, which did not have screens. The front door, too, gaped wide, and at first it was impossible to tell whether or not the door was still on its hinges. The people living in this house had fled, as fast as they could. It did not look like they were coming back. In the burning house poem, Bradstreet seems not to know what she wants. This was in fact the organizing idea for her poems, and how I had learned to teach them, in the 1980s, from other Columbia University graduate students who had fallen under the spell of deconstruction. The two lines of the poem that revealed Bradstreets true desire were its fault line, the place where the poem turned on itself, gave up its secrets, revealed its fallenness. I recall that in one of the two anthologies I used, there was a typographical error, or perhaps an editorial choice, I never knew which: in the forty-ninth line of the poem, one version read "A prize so vast as is unknown" and the other, "A price so vast as is unknown." Either salvation is a boon, to be desired, or it is incomprehensibly costly. I never knew which because I was more writer than scholar, but also because I did not want to know, fearing that my reading of this poem would crumble to dust. One could ask, too, what it meant for Bradstreet to say in the letter to her children about the new world, "my heart rose." The Norton Anthol- ogy now interprets "[i.e. in in horror]," but theres also this typographical error, the double "in," inside the brackets, which has the effect of diminishing this explanations authority. In the other poem, Bradstreet exhorts her book-child not to vanish but to "Take thy way where yet thou art not known," which can certainly be construed as a desire on the part of the poet to become "known." In any case, my students all across the country- in New York, in Pennsylvania, in Colorado, in California- weren't interested in subversion. They wanted an ordered world. What they did understand absolutely was the impulse to keep your writing to yourself. They wrote their papers with the sense that the words were private; they trusted me to keep it that way. If they had known how often I read pieces of their work to my husband and colleagues, I would have had a revolt on my hands. х-</page><page sequence="6">738 THE GEORGIA REVIEW The day of the hurricane, 18 September, we were in Normandy, in Bayeux, where we saw the famous tapestry, which is about the breaking of an oath and the consequences thereof. (Its also propaganda: Napoleon had the tapestry put on display in Paris in 1803 in order to drum up support for a repeat invasion of England.) Bayeux is an important place: it was here that Harold, pretender to the English throne, swore the oath to William, duke of Normandy, which he later broke and which led to his defeat in the Battle of Hastings and to French rule over England. In Bayeux in 1944, Allied forces first liberated the French, and General Charles de Gaulle was welcomed back to his country. The tapestry's 230 feet are displayed at le Centre de Guillaume le Conquérant, in a darkened, U-shaped room, and the effect is stunning. The colors of the thread are said to have faded very little since 1077, when the tapestry was first displayed in Bayeux s Cathédrale de Notre Dame, on the occasion of its con- secration by Bishop Odo, William the Conqueror's half brother. In viewing the exhibit, though, you feel a kind of privacy. Each visitor wears a set of head- phones through which a voice describes the tapestry's thirty-five scenes. The pace is hurried, and the buzz of other languages in other headphones strange, but somehow soothing. I found I was glad to be in the dark. I had waited for twenty-five years to see this solemn yet fanciful artifact, ever since my high school French teacher first described it. I feel sure there was something she especially loved about the Bayeux Tapestry; though I don't recall her exact words, the depth of my desire to see it for myself suggests her own passion. She was a passionate woman, with a history, as I have said, and a temper. She used to call me her petit oiseau, little bird, toujours prête à voler, always ready to fly away. Inside the main room of our flooded house, we found the rest of the furni- ture - the dining table and chairs, two chests of drawers, a sideboard - in disar- ray. The look of it, in the half light, was even more alarming than what we had seen outside, and instantly, the three of us began to speak, all at once, not to each other, but out of some unconsciousness, as in dreams. I hear this speech now in my head, and see it as theater, as if I were not participating, had not participated. We did not turn on the overhead light, assuming- incorrectly as it turned out - that there was no electricity, so these simultaneous monologues were going on in the dark. My daughter was saying, "I want to see my room, I want to check on my stuff." She disappeared around the corner, and we saw the light in her bedroom flash on for twenty seconds, then go off. She said,</page><page sequence="7">LIZA WIELAND 739 "Well everything's here, everything's fine," and she began a catalogue of what she had seen, what she had missed in Paris. "The buddies are dry," she said, referring to her stuffed animals, which occupy a high shelf. "The bookcase is on the bed," she continued; "somebody took the drawers out of the dresser." At the very same instant, behind me, my husband was saying, "There's a chain saw in the middle of the floor. I wonder who that belongs to?" And then, a moment later, as my daughter turned out her bedroom light, I heard him say, "Oh, it's my chain saw." As I was listening to them, my mouth worked and the words came out, "This is a much better place for the dining room table. I wonder why we didn't think to put it here in the first place." Then there was silence. Piled on the table were some familiar objects: a pair of boots, candlesticks, a box of books. I touched these things, one by one and found them to be dry. The books were dry. We didn't lose a single book because before the storm our friends had lifted all the small bookcases up onto the beds. I stood there, marveling at dryness. In May we had left what seemed like the driest place on earth, the central valley of California, where water has been diverted in to grow fabulous crops, and where along certain streets, you can see the desert trying to reclaim its old territory: under the eucalyptus, the oleander, the palm trees, the transplanted hydrangea, is sand. There's sand under the grass of the watered lawns, if you dig deep enough. In March a year earlier, a graduate student of mine, one of the most talented fiction writers I've taught, drove his family into a lake. It was an accident, and they all survived, his wife and their three-year-old daughter, who may or may not even remember in a few years. He's told me the story, but I don't think he's written it yet: out for a drive, early spring darkness falling imperceptibly, then all at once, and the part I knew all too well: parents in the front seat turned to deal with a child, half awake, unhappy, strapped in for too long or not long enough. Then the missed curve, the overcorrection, the water. Do you know how fast a car sinks? he asked me, and I was glad I did not. But the water turned out not to be too deep, and they got out, unbuckled the child, walked to shore. I remember him telling me all this, standing just inside the front door of my old house in the reclaimed desert, telling it in his usual offhand man- ner, with the same spareness that characterizes his prose. I remember saying that if it had happened to me, I would never go near water again. When he heard about the hurricane and our house, this student sent me an e-mail that said, its kind of like driving your car into a lake. This seems exactly right, to be</page><page sequence="8">740 THE GEORGIA REVIEW plunged unwillingly into water, the shock of it, the lost vehicle, the wet clothes, the astonished survival. These two incidents, ours and his, struck me as so precisely the same- even though I knew better, even though we had not been in any kind of physical danger - that I began to wonder why. What did I think a body was? What did I think the self was, what I am or what I have? This is the question Anne Bradstreet can t quite answer in her burning house poem, and acknowledges to be unanswerable in "The Author To her Book," though the wording is slightly different: Is the self what I have or what I've made? In Paris, two days after the hurricane and our last night in the apartment, I lay awake and thought again of the things in my house, the deathly quiet of these things as the water began to come in under the front door and then under the kitchen door. I could not get away from a certain combination of anthropomorphism and the pathetic fallacy: what fear and horror objects in the house must have felt as the water rose. On one hand, this is pure silliness, fancy. On the other hand, there's the middle section of Virginia Woolf s novel To The Lighthouse in which Mrs. Ramsay's empty beach house is full of feel- ing. What accounts for that feeling? I wonder. Is it proximity to water? And if so, who could ever explain why without sounding like a literature teacher or a poet? But I could not get it out of my mind that night, the hushed terror in our house as the water rose. The bleat and blare of the all-night traffic on the quai de Gesvres in Paris could not drown out the silence I imagined, the quiet in which my possessions prepared to be lost. Somewhere in the middle of that last night, I tried to fix us somewhere in time. The old question about tragedy, which is really about loss: where were you? what were you doing when the terrible thing happened? And I knew of course, right away: as the water entered our house, we were standing on a high hill above the Norman fishing village of Port-en-Bessin. We had fallen in love with the place, my husband and I, we were talking about renting an apartment there. We were looking out at the near reaches of the English Channel, called La Baie de la Seine. From that great height and location on the Normandy coast, it's just possible to gaze west past Pointe de Barfleur and Cap de la Hague and into the North Atlantic. I said to my daughter, if you look far enough, you can see home. It seems important to know that, had we had some extraordinary, miraculous power of vision, we might have been able to look south and see Hurricane Isabel come ashore. Otherwise, I would worry that we were being irresponsible, having too good a time. I would come to believe we were not paying attention, believe the words</page><page sequence="9">LIZA WIELAND 74I with which Anne Bradstreet chastises herself, "For sorrow near, I did not look." But no one could accuse us of inattention; we'd been tracking Isabel for more than a week, and her predicted landfall and path had never changed: between Hatteras and Morehead City, across the Pamlico Sound, into the Neuse River, into our yard, our house. In the light of day, it looked as though someone had shoveled dirt into the house, purposefully, neatly, and with particular vengeance into the bathroom, with its new white tile. The waterline was visible on all the walls, about twenty- two inches above the floor, higher in some places, a ring of silt and bits of straw, leaves of grass at the height of our daughter s chest. There was a host of small curiosities: oddly damaged appliances- the washer that washed but wouldn't spin, the hot water heater that worked on and off, the dishwasher that caused the dishes to smell like the river. A rubber duck with the face of James Brown - a gift to our daughter from an old friend - had come to rest on the doorsill of the bathroom, to warn us, to jeer at us (we did not feel good), who could say? A bottle of bourbon had floated, then come to rest on its side and leaked onto a sodden mess of flour and sugar, so that the kitchen smelled like some kind of foul sticky bun. Friends and neighbors who came to help us clean up would sniff, make a face, and say nothing; finally a contractor sug- gested I throw everything into the oven. Which I might have done if the oven had worked. We began to hear the stories. First, the one local death, a lineman named Harold T. Anderson Jr. electrocuted on the job with the Carteret-Craven Electrical Cooperative. He was twenty-nine years old or fifty-eight years old, depending on whom you asked, and so became, at least for me, ageless and mythic. There were traffic deaths, a drowning. A week after the hurricane, a woman whose power was still out died in her bed when a propane lantern tipped over and caught fire. There were tales of graveyards flooded and coffins floating down the road. There was a weatherman who said, quite excitedly, "This was our best forecast ever. We were right on, dead-on." There were the insurance company rumors, the Federal Emergency Management Agency gos- sip. You could get cash for a flood-damaged car, practically on the spot. The FEMA people came with checkbooks opened wide. Everyone speculated - they might give you twenty thousand dollars, thirty thousand- and advised: don t clean up the house; clean up the house; clean up all but one room of the house; show inspectors the mold and mildew; dont show the inspectors mold, or</page><page sequence="10">742 THE GEORGIA REVIEW they'll condemn your house. If the house is condemned, you have to move. If the house is condemned, you can stay, but at your own risk. Certain types of mold can harm young children, cause health problems later, like lead paint does, like chewing on your pencil. I saw mold everywhere, imagined the house eaten up with it, necessitating a complete razing, and us with nowhere to go. We should have stayed in Paris, I thought; at least there we had a clean, functioning home. Days began to be more dream than substance, and objects were no longer themselves. A lamp that was never completely unpacked, the figure of a bullfighter under the bubble wrap, suddenly looked to me like the Venus di Milo, that same cant of hip, translucence like marble, the absence of arms. I recalled the advertising slogan of United Van Lines: if we'd moved her, she'd still have them. The real Venus di Milo is in the Louvre, of course, which we'd walked by many times on our way to the Tuilleries. I had looked forward to taking my daughter to the Louvre, and since she's only four, leading her on Art Buchwalds famous six-minute tour: Mona Lisa, Venus di Milo, Winged Victory of Samothrace, so she would not have to do it that way as an adult. And then the Musée d'Orsay, and the Jeu de Paumes, the Pompidou Center, back to the Louvre, and from there to Paris' other two hundred odd museums. We had six months, all the time in the world of museums. But we'd got only as far as the Musée de la Poupée, the doll museum. My husband and I said we would get our daughter a French doll, and if it became injured, we could take this doll to the médecin at this museum, who we'd read could work wonders. The museum was not large, but still it was shocking to see so many impassive dolls' faces at once. In such quantity, impassivity becomes something else because, I think, it cannot be borne; it becomes wisdom and secretiveness. I left the museum certain that those dolls knew something we did not. My student who drove into the lake is a mountain climber, the son of a very famous climber of European and Near Eastern peaks. His fiction often refers to these climbs as it tries to get at what sort of person is obsessed by this par- ticular endeavor. He often uses "boulder" as a verb, which took me some time to come to terms with, but I have, because it's authentic climber-speak and because the rest of his prose is so engaging. How completely out of his element he must have been, plunging into a lake, inside a car. I thought of it that way after I heard his story and even more so after his e-mail likening our flood to</page><page sequence="11">LIZA WIELAND 743 his mishap. But I recall being told several years ago that some climbers move like water, or think of themselves that way, like water rising over the face of the rock, up the sheer side of the mountain, a slow, single-minded fluid encroach- ment. Maybe that's how he got himself and his family out of the sunken car: because it seemed familiar. For the month we were in Paris, my daughter asked to be read to in a particular way, which she had not wanted before and has not asked for since. She had several different volumes of Grimms fairy tales in French, one we had bought for her at Gilbert Joseph on the Boulevard St. Michel because she wanted a telling of Blanche Neige. The others were already in the apartment, the prop- erty of the twelve-year-old boy who usually lived there. She insisted that I read the stories to her in both French and English, working back and forth between the languages, a paragraph at a time. It was an interesting and useful exercise for both of us, but strange. I tried to think what it must sound like to her - perhaps it was like that old joke about what a dog hears: blah, blah, blah, Blanche Neige, blah, blah, Hansel et Gretei. What sort of sensation must it be for her, to be strung along in another language and then gathered back into the security, the familiarity of her mother tongue? Why would she want this, and how would she know to want it? Because I would be teaching and my husband working on a novel, she was in the French school, lecole maternelle , but only for a week. Though she did not speak French, everyone said she would adapt, would be fluent in a couple of months. I confess my own vanity: I loved the thought of it, my little bilinguist, and it almost breaks my heart, even now, to tell the story, how we dropped her off at 8:30 the first morning, into that care of the very hip maîtresse Madame Basteau, how long the day was for me, even though the school was five minutes away from our apartment. How when we arrived at 4:00 in the afternoon to pick her up, I saw her right away, sobbing, reaching up to Madame Basteau, crying "When am I going to see my mama?" When I got her in my arms, she could hardly speak. "The boys spit on me," she finally choked out, which was in fact true. The next morning she began to cry and beg to stay home even before we were out of bed, but we took her to school, and finally Madame Basteau hoisted her on her shoulders, still screaming, and closed the doors. I brought her home for lunch and had to trick her into going back for the afternoon. At four o' clock, she was all right, but that evening, there were more tears, far into the night. So it went. Later we were told she had to be tested for allergies, the skin test, the little punctures all over the back. By the</page><page sequence="12">744 THE GEORGIA REVIEW end of the week, we'd decided it was all too much for her and withdrew her from the school. Truthfully, it was too much for us. Most truthfully, it was too much for me. And yet every night, when I read to her, she asked for that tease of incomprehensibility, of lost and found. She asked, maybe, to be reminded of those days at Madame Basteaus school where she could not understand the language. Every night we reenacted her loss of language and the finding of it again, the take and give. What did she want, Anne Bradstreet, as she wrote, "And when I could no longer look / 1 blest his name that gave and took"? She wanted to be taught a lesson. Maybe. She wanted her "pleasant things," her trunk and chest, guests sitting at her table, good talk, stories, candles shining, the bridegrooms voice. This is another place where the poem turns strange, where Bradstreet uses what might be interpreted as religious symbols to characterize her possessions and bemoan their loss. When you follow these images through, it sounds as if the speakers faith has been lost to some fire, a conflagration that no one should know she really wants, and she chides her self for mourning that loss, since it's what she really wanted. Why would the poem seem to say such a thing? Stop crying over lost faith. It can't mean that. Still, the language for divinity turns arid in the rest of the poem: God is a mighty Architect, and Bradstreet's house on high is furnished with glory, an abstraction. How, the speaker must be thinking, do you relax in glory, how do you put your feet up, and on what? This house sounds as if it would be too cold, as if you might break something or leave fingerprints everywhere, even if it is heaven. The cleanup in North Carolina went fairly quickly. We washed the floors and the walls with a solution of hot water and bleach, and our throats ached from breathing it in. I had a strange taste in my mouth, like old coffee, for days. We bought new mattresses and bed frames, a couch, an overstuffed chair, side tables. My husband made two new desks with cheap filing cabinets and one- inch- thick laminated pine planks. He installed new windows and framed them in. The losses seemed not very great, and then even distant, as far away as Paris. I knew, though, what the most difficult job would be: the file cabinets in the garage. We had raised these files (which were, ironically, impervious to fire) twelve inches on top of cinder blocks, but a calculation so instinctive it felt like foreknowledge told me this had not been high enough. I remembered only in a</page><page sequence="13">LIZA WIELAND 745 general way that those file drawers contained manuscripts and personal papers. I realize now I could not allow myself to think of this any more specifically. I chose an afternoon when my daughter was at her new preschool and my husband was away for the day, and I found it all there, sodden pages melted together, part of a life, a writing life. Acceptance letters, readers reports, contracts, all the good news (I never kept the bad). Letters, too, all my cor- respondence to a close friend when I was in school in England in 1977. She had generously sent these letters while I was working on my last novel, and I had thought of returning them before we left for Paris, but I had not done it. Manuscripts, in longhand. Photographs. These were perhaps the most terrible because they were so far beyond recognition; I could only guess at what they had been, based on their proximity to other material. I knew the pictures from my first trip to Emily Dickinsons house because they were in a small bag with postcards. Photographs of my daughter as a newborn had a date on the enve- lope. Soaked photographs are an odd, somewhat comical sight. They look like spin-art, that fad from the seventies, now a standard county fair amusement: blobs of paint on a piece of heavy paper, which is then spun in a centrifugelike contraption. The art is psychedelic, explosive, nightmarish, but not without a certain relief; you think, thank God it didn't make more of a mess. What was even stranger, though, was the compulsion to look at these photographs, to stare at them, to try to make sense. It felt like- it was, in fact- looking at the scene of an accident, that inability to turn your eyes away. These ruined pic- tures were the place where metaphor and fact met. Like a poem. Bradstreet's speaker feels this too, lives in this moment: When by the ruins oft I past My sorrowing eyes aside did cast And here and there the places spy Where oft I sat and long did lie. She cant stop looking, cant stop recalling the past and the details of her interior decoration and reminding herself that shell never see these things again. She then begins a curious catalogue of future losses, that which will not happen now: no guests "shall" come for a meal and conversation, no storytell- ing, no candlelight, or "Bridegrooms voice," all of it ending with the line "In silence ever shalt thou lie." Its just the saddest list because she's stuck: the past,</page><page sequence="14">746 THE GEORGIA REVIEW the present, and the future are all the same and all lost to this woman. She's fallen out of time. Its puzzling too; to whom is she talking in that last line? Who's the "thou"? Is it the furniture? Is it the self? Are they one and the same? Aren't they? It's as strange a line as that earlier couplet about desire and fire. What I've come to believe lately is that Bradstreet is talking about her own work, her own poems lost in that fire, paper curled and dark at best, or dust. Maybe she even saw it happen, the flare of words into silence and ash. Nearly every night in Paris, between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m., our bedroom would suddenly fill with flashing light. This would awaken us of course and keep us awake while the light pulsed around the walls for a long time, an hour or more. What we soon discovered was that the traffic signal outside our building, on the corner of quai de Gesvres and rue de Renard, was a favorite spot for the Parisian police to set up roadblocks. We could see the scene clearly from our window, but it was hard to know exactly what was happening: there was the police vehicle with its lights zooming around, a larger van or paddy wagon, maybe some motorcycles, and finally the perpetrators or suspects - usually a single car, with two or three or four men inside, sitting still, a few gendarmes in the street, not much action. After the first few nights of this disturbance, I found myself wishing for a situation, for danger, for violence, gunfire, some- thing to explain, to give us a story to tell, to pierce the haze of exhaustion we felt after so many nights' lost sleep. Beside the Neuse River at the end of September, we had more than a week of sunny, breezy, mild weather, and so I could lay out the wet manuscript pages and letters. I write on yellow legal pads, like the one I have before me now, and transcribe onto the computer later, at the end of the process. I use a black pen, lately the fountain pen my husband bought for me in Paris in the summer of 2001. The pages of the twenty or so legal pads were stuck together, held fast by a combination of brackish river water, ink, and the very paper itself, wood pulp, linen, yellow dye. I stood at a 45-degree angle to the wind coming off the river and began to peel the pages apart, and discovered that the most recent writ- ing was completely illegible, except for some work I had done with ballpoint pens. The same was true of the letters from 1977 and most of the other cor- respondence. The handwritten manuscript of my first novel, written in pencil, had dissolved. Typed manuscript pages were glued together; to separate them would tear the pages to shreds. For the first time since leaving Paris, I put my</page><page sequence="15">LIZA WIELAND 747 head down and wept. Then I set out all the pads in the sun, so that the pages could flutter and dry, perhaps into some semblance of their former selves. I glanced up and saw our neighbors, to the east and to the west, standing inside their screened porches, watching. We did not wave to each other. I thought how every word on these pages had been written in deepest privacy; even my husband had never read from these drafts. I never left them lying around: when I had finished work for the day, every day, I put the work away, in one of the fireproof filing cabinets, before anyone came home. Now they were arranged in full view, and they stayed on display for three days, from sunrise to sundown, until I gave up on them. After the first day, I stopped worrying that the pages would blow into the river. Now, months later, I still have not told anyone how much was lost. I can write it here, but I cannot bear to say the words, recount the inventory, out loud. The most public loss, of course, was the teaching job at St. Denis, which had not officially begun and would not until the first week of October, though I had visited the campus, opened my office, and met the department staff and a few of my colleagues. I had also had three rendez-vous with the university personnel officers, particularly one Madame Colette LeHénaff, who was quite pleasant and even delightfully sweet to my daughter. But there were grave troubles: due to a combination of errors, my dossier had become stalled at the ministry of defense, so the required paperwork could not be completed, and I could not be issued an arrêté , or order to commence payment of my salary. There was the sense that this had been my fault, that I had not submitted facsimiles of my diplomas quickly enough, had applied for the wrong type of visa. I did not dispute these accusations; there would have been no point, and I reminded myself that I was there to heal the rift between France and America. There seemed to be alternatives, solutions, a loan perhaps. But the fifth or sixth time my negligence was explained to another member of the personnel staff, I rolled my eyes heavenward. The gesture did not go unobserved, and there was silence and then a distinct chill in the room. I knew that nothing would be done, and in fact Madame LeHénaff said so moments later, with a little pout and a shrug of her shoulders, gestures so perfectly French that I found them gorgeous, despite the words: il riy a rien à faire. I would not be paid until December, four months into our stay. I did not know how we could manage, but my husband reminded me that we had credit cards, and as long as I did get paid eventually, it would all work out in the end. Still a little shard of unease had got inside me,</page><page sequence="16">748 THE GEORGIA REVIEW a splinter of doubt. I did not like so much uncertainty. I wanted something to happen, to clarify the situation, to end it. I wanted that particularly American assurance: a contract, though - I remind myself now - it is eminently true that a contract can t be broken if it doesn't exist in the first place. What did Anne Bradstreet want? To convince herself that her losses weren't important. To use the word silence and not be afraid of it. To understand that her poems were hers and gone but also never really hers to begin with. More than anything else, she wanted to go home. What did I want? Who knows? Who indeed. One early morning, not long ago, my daughter appeared at my bedside and said, "Mama, last night I dreamed we had to sneak out of Paris." My climber graduate students daughter is enough younger than my daughter that I often give him clothes shes grown out of. Sometimes she comes with him to school wearing a familiar dress or shirt, and the sight of it is both alarming and sweet. I think the phrase "old wine in new bottles," but its the inverse, really, strange, messy if not dangerous if not impossible: the old wine wrapped around the new bottle, like a climber submerged. I try not to picture it this way: my daughter s clothes clinging to his daughter as the water rises inside the car, then dripping wet as she's freed from her car seat, screaming, and carried to safety. Next year, shell wear the clothes we bought in Paris, a denim dress, corduroy trousers, a pair of black spandex athletic pants my daughter called her "tough girl pants" because she hoped the sight of them would keep the boys at l'école maternelle from spitting on her. Anne Bradstreet has the same hope for her poems: In better dress to trim thee was my mind But nought save home-spun Cloth Г tiï house I find In this array, mongst Vulgars mayst thou roam. Dressed in nothing fancy, they're free in the world. But to be free in the world is sometimes to be lost. Our second Sunday in Paris, my daughter and I went to Mass at our neigh- borhood church, St. Gervais-St. Protais, which dates from the sixth century, and is named for two Roman soldiers, twins, martyred by Nero. The church is beautifully, solemnly Gothic, and houses an exceptional and exceptionally</page><page sequence="17">LIZA WIELAND 749 old organ. It is also home to an international monastic community, and draws its congregation from all over the world, so parts of the Mass were spoken in French, English, Spanish, and German. Before the service began, one of the sisters, a young woman in sandals, a blue-gray robe, and head covering, came to us and asked in French if my daughter would like to sit closer to the altar. We said yes, bien sûr , and this young woman took my daughter s hand and led her up the side aisle, slowly, regally, toward the altar. The expression on my daughter s face can only be called rapturous, as she was led by this holy woman toward some sort of communion she could only begin to guess at. She looked as if she felt she were a bride, a saint, a celebrity, all at once. There was a tender willingness in her demeanor that almost frightened me, does frighten me now. As it turned out, I, as an adult, was not allowed to sit with the children, but my daughter would not be parted from me, so the sister led us back to our original seats on the backless wooden footstools that served as pews. Again, even on this journey back, my daughter was rapt, inside some vision of herself that I can only speculate about. Awful, as in full of awe. For the first time in her life I had the sensation that she did not belong completely to me. After the Mass was over, she asked for holy water, and I dipped my fingers into the stone basin and made the sign of the cross on her forehead. What really belongs to us? Not our clothes, not our writing, not our jobs, not our houses, not our children. By the end of October, our house and lives had returned to some semblance of their old order. My husband, who is a brilliant, painstaking carpenter, refash- ioned the kitchen into a more beautiful and functional space than it had been before. I cleared hurricane debris from the garden and planted too-late winter vegetables, and was happy to find that tarragon, basil, and nasturtiums I'd brought from California had mysteriously reseeded themselves. I went back to work, conjuring a story from out of the legible manuscript. I allowed my hus- band to burn some of the other, but it took a long time; I could not watch and finally asked him to stop. As Halloween approached, our daughter decided she wanted to be a mermaid, and we found a costume, which she liked to wear for a few hours every day after school. When he saw her in full mer-attire, which included an iridescent red wig, our neighbor, who works at the Cape Lookout National Seashore, asked her if she'd come from the river, and when she said yes, he asked her to be the Keeper of the Neuse. But on Halloween night, after</page><page sequence="18">750 THE GEORGIA REVIEW wed parked by the river and freed her from her car seat, she wouldn't go near any houses. Unable to explain what was so frightening, she cried and pleaded with us to take her home. My husband and I didn t know what to make of this, though I wonder if recent events had not taught her some ineffable lesson about where the river and its denizens should and should not be. As Keeper of the Neuse, maybe she saw it as her duty to keep the Neuse out. We took her to a restaurant in town where she was both the only child in costume and the only child, and therefore much admired. Who are you? the adults asked. Its a good question, I've come to understand, because it has an easy, predictable answer as well as a complicated, perhaps surprising one. Price and prize. She gave both.</page></plain_text>
