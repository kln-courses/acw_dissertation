<plain_text><page sequence="1">Agents and Lives: Moral Thinking in Literature. By S. L. Goldberg. Cam bridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993. Pp. xviii + 331. $59-95 In a USIS lecture tour that I was invited to give in Australia in spring 1993, I came to understand the influence and legacy of the distinguished critic S. L. Goldberg, who died in December 1991. Goldberg was a towering presence in the development of English studies in Australia, and played a vital role in the development of the departments of English in Sydney, Melbourne, and the Australian National University in Canberra. Much of the book under review appeared in earlier form in the Australian journal The (Melbourne) Critical Review, which he founded and edited, and which for some played the kind of role that Leavis's Scrutiny played in England in an earlier era. An Arnoldian humanist and a Leavisite, Goldberg believed that literature had something to teach us about life and that the critical act could teach us how to make moral and intellectual discriminations. His two most important works were The Classical Temper: A Study offoyce's "Ulysses" (1961) and An Essay on "King Lear" (1974) Part of the neo-humanistic revival, Goldberg, like Martha Nussbaum, Stan ley Cavell, and Richard Rorty, sees the strong connection between art and life. He is in the tradition which I discussed in my The Humanistic Heritage: Critical Theories of the English Novel from fames to Hillis Miller (1986), a book which was reviewed on these pages. Goldberg believes that the inclusiveness of a work's vision in terms of depth and range is a measure of the work's quality. The work of literature imitates a world that precedes the text and the critic need to recapture that world, primarily by formal analysis of the text. He believes, too, that human behavior should be the major concern of analy sis. For him the morality of characters must be understood as if fictional char acters were real, because understanding others like ourselves helps us to un derstand ourselves. Goldberg believes that "imaginative literature has traditionally been, and still is, a distinctive and irreplaceable form of moral thinking. ... It has a unique capacity to look at human experience with, as it. were, stereoscopic moral vision" (p. 63). He differentiates between "conduct-morality"?whose "primary object is the voluntary intentional actions of a moral agent" (p. 37) and what he calls "life-morality," by which he means "a person's (or a society's) operative norms or ideals of 'human nature' or of human 'perfection' or 'a good life' or 'well-being'" (p. 38). He wants to "consider people as lives rather than as conductors of lives" (p. 88): "In moral thinking about lives, almost every term of agent-centered, conduct-moral thinking takes on a rather dif ferent meaning. 'Character' is the most obvious of these. The moral subject now is not essentially a will confronting a world external to it, but a life, which</page><page sequence="2">564 Schwarz can be conceived only as a particular physical being inhabiting a particular world in a particular way" (p. 106). For Goldberg, literature is properly con cerned with the moral not the moralistic, and so is literary criticism. Goldberg believes that our reading experience, if we read actively and with intelligence, is central to life and contributes to the development of the ma ture personality. Like F. R. Leavis, Goldberg sees literature as providing sur rogate experiences for the reader, experiences which, because they are em bodied within artistically shaped ontologies, heighten our awareness of moral discriminations. Rather than being divorced from life, reading is, like other cultural activities, central to life and contributes to the development of the mature personality. Like Leavis, he believes in evaluative criticism which cre ates a hierarchy of texts and, like Leavis, he is drawn to George Eliot, to whom he devotes two of his three close-reading chapters as examples of life morality. For Goldberg, reading a poem is like "encountering another mode of life than our own" (p. 249). In Goldberg's radical version of the metaphysical presence of the text, a text could behave as if it were a perceptive human being. As if responding to another human, the critic responds to a text with a balance of sympathy and judgment; he or she oscillates between immersion in the text's world and reflection on its moral implications. That the critic/ reader is always actively engaged in looking for the thematic nuances and moral implications of texts aligns Goldberg, in part, with New Criticism as well as with Leavis. Of terms like "moral" and "humanist" he writes, "Neither term is necessarily bound up with a particular, fixed moral code or a particu lar, fixed ideal conception of Man?much less with the telescoped code and conception of 'bourgeois' or 'Victorian' moralism or of more recent variants of the same thing. . . . What they are bound up with is no more or less than a serious concern, on the part of poets and readers alike, with making moral sense of human experience and modes of human experience" (p. 250). In a paradigmatic passage, Goldberg writes of Eliot in his chapter "Moral Thinking in The Mill on the Floss": "Maggie cannot be reduced to merely the sum total of moral consciousness, feelings and a (somewhat recalcitrant) will. To put it another way, George Eliot's imagination begins to move out of the control of the universal moral principles she is aiming to express" (p. 155). Here we see three important characteristics of Goldberg's work: (1) he values complexity that bursts the bounds of one-dimensional thinking, and in that crucial way he suggests Bakhtin's dialogism. Indeed, in The Classical Temper, Goldberg's best book, he speaks approvingly of the "shifting multivalenced, very pervasiveness and ambiguity of energy it [Joyce's Ulysses] generates . . . [its] deeply ironical response to a universe of ambiguity" (The Classical Temper, p. 267); (2) he values a probing moral consciousness that continually seeks new and ever more subtle distinctions; (3) he does not distinguish between fictional characters and real people. At times Goldberg fails to differentiate between character?the object of mimesis?and characterization?the formal means by which character is rendered. Goldberg's analogy of the work as an anthropomorphic individual undermines the idea of form's role in creating content and does not allow sufficiently for the category of the aesthetic. For Goldberg, the "'dramatic' and presentational aspects of literature" complement the "exemplary and advisory aspects of literature . . . [which] inevitably prompt the reader to think more searchingly and intensively both</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 565 of the work as an individual, and of the particular life it (consciously and unconsciously) manifests" (p. 263). His concept of the dramatic owes much to Leavis, specifically the latter's concept of the novel as dramatic poem. He dis likes a priori definitions of aesthetic value and literary excellence, and in his preference for thinking of specific responses to specific works on the part of the reader, he does empower the reader: "I take a critical judgment to be traditionally something like the moral (or 'human') sense one finds one has to make of a poem as a 'dramatically' present utterance?has to, that is, under the pressure of what the poem is and of one's own fullest and most considered response to it" (pp. 224-25). It is as if reading were a dramatic agon between reader and text. Following Aristotle, he believes agons enact moral issues and that there is an inextricable relation between the aesthetic and the moral; following Trilling he believes that literature presents the hum and buzz of moral implication: Literature does its moral thinking in the particulars it imagines. . . . On the one side, literature does consider people much as moral codes and moral philosophy do, as voluntary agents, each of whom is like any other in having passions, desires, rationality and will, in confronting recognizable moral problems, and in exempli fying recognizable moral concepts and rules of conduct. But at the same time, literature also considers people as lives: as individual unique forms of life . . . whose particular qualities and trajectory in time are, in quite crucial ways, not like others, nor by any means entirely a matter of voluntary actions, and yet no less morally important for that. (p. xv) Goldberg turns to the teaching of recent moral philosophy to support his position. Yet what distinguishes literature from moral philosophy is its speci ficity, its nominalism, its dramatized particularity. Art assists moral thinking. In his final chapter, "Some Limits of Philosophy," Goldberg takes issue with moral philosophers who restrict the term moral only to people's conduct while consigning judgments about their emotional states to the aesthetic. He spends much energy splitting hairs with Aristotle and Rorty. For Goldberg, Aristotle depended on a few simple patterns to define the good life and is, therefore, a moralist who instructs us in the Nicomachean Ethics on how to live rather than examine the nuances of the fabric of life. By contrast, in a pivotal passage in his The Classical Temper, in which we hear the Arnoldian and Leav isian echo, Goldberg praises the alternative to dogmatism: "The classical tem per displays itself as a responsive openness to life, a firm grasp on the cen trally human, a respect for the present reality we all share, an allegiance to the objective, and a mistrust of metaphysical or naturalistic 'realities' ab stracted from the total complexity of human experience" (The Classical Tem per, p. 33). At times, Goldberg writes as if words mean what he wants them to mean. Not for him aporia, undecideability, theoretical claims separate fromfjtexts, because he can, as Super Critic, get to the bottom of a text?or thinks he can. But what if, in the above passage, "openness to life" and "firm grasp on the centrally human" are culturally relative concepts, and his are not mine or yours? Goldberg is not an easy read, and at times he has the turgidity of Leavis. When discussing moral philosophers, he has moments when he is ei ther abstract or reductive or both. To propose an apt metaphor for the tendency of recent theory to wilfully misinterpret the text for political purposes, I turn to Dostoevsky's Grand In</page><page sequence="4">566 Schwarz quisitor chapter (Book 5, Chapter 5). After capturing Christ, the Inquisitor tells him, "Don't answer, be silent. What canst Thou say, indeed? I know too well what Thou wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou hadst said of old. Why, then, art Thou come to hinder us? Thou knowst that . . . tomorrow I shall condemn Thee and burn Thee at the stake as the worst of heretics" (quotations are from Feodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Ka ramazov [New York: Harper, i960]; translator not named). The Grand In quisitor preempts Christ's speech and refuses to let him "add anything to what has been said of old." Heaping opprobrium on the founders of the tra dition to which he has devoted his life and which provides him the moral basis for his position, the Grand Inquisitor?"an old man, almost ninety, tall and erect"?blames Christ for his own skepticism and corruption: "Thou didst Thyself lay the foundation for the destruction of Thy kingdom." The Grand Inquisitor tells him that the Church has "corrected Thy work and founded it upon miracle, mystery, and authority," not, as Christ had, on each person's free will to choose. Finally, the Grand Inquisitor is moved by Christ's kiss. For Christ ends by blessing the very figure who is dismantling his work: "[Christ's] kiss glows in his heart, but the old man adheres to his idea." Recall that the teller of the tale, Ivan, is an ironist enjoying the aporia of the Grand Inquisitor's deconstruction of Christ's (the text's) meaning and message and, more importantly, the very tradition the Inquisitor is charged with serving. Isn't Ivan a cynical, intellectual picaro who mocks, undermines, and questions the text and the interpretive tradition of the past without pro viding an alternative hermeneutics? For he tells Alyosha that his parable is "only a senseless poem of a senseless student." Recall, also, that Ivan's point was that it didn't matter if the visitor was really Christ, but only that the In quisitor had to convince himself of his own argument that the end justifies the means. Now let us think of the Grand Inquisitor as a contemporary critic/theorist and of Christ's words as a literary text. Let us also imagine the clerical tradi tion in which the text of Christ's message had been interpreted as the human istic tradition. And, indeed, isn't there an element of miracle and mystery and authority in the way modern theory has created new texts according to its own changing needs? Haven't miracle, mystery, and authority often been sub stituted for respect for the author's intention as realized within the formal structure of a work? At times it seems as if some theorists were more concerned with burning heretics than respecting the spirit of the original text. Unlike Goldberg's dia logic mode, the Inquisitor's inquiry is a monologue; the Grand Inquisitor's own dogmatism is now turned toward his reading of texts, including Christ's words, according to his current metaphysics. Haven't various forms of recent theory replaced with their own metaphysics a tradition of humanistic, plural istic criticism which for all its failings respected the text and tried to render the experience of reading it? Indeed, if we think of Christ's words, the Grand Inquisitor is a resistant reader reshaping them?Christ's texts?to his needs. Probing for gaps and fissures and enigmas in Christ's message with the goal of deconstructing, he recreates the text without giving it a chance to respond or shape his responses. He examines the text through a lens fifteen hundred years after it was produced with the idea of giving it its meaning now. He insists that the text must be locked into the image he wants and needs to have of it, and that its words cannot be changed.</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 567 We are in the midst of a humanistic revival. Without fully realizing it, new historicism and cultural criticism have paved the way for this by focusing on representation and mimesis. Not surprisingly, when representation of a priori worlds becomes important, issues of how humans live and of what they live for become central because they are what concern us as readers and teach ers?sometimes in spite of ourselves. Abstract criticism, like abstract art, fi nally needs to be recuperated in human terms and thematic issues. As the high tide of de Manian deconstruction continues to recede, hermeneutical questions have again come to the fore; focus on the rhetoricity of language has been displaced by a kind of rampant contextualism which knows no limits and extends the text's borderlands infinitely, much as the Grand Inquisitor has done to the text he reinterprets. Finally, most of us, even while welcoming the important contribution of recent theory, supplement theoretically driven criticism with hermeneutical questions that ask "What does this work mean?" "What does it signify for us?" and "How do the imagined worlds reflect an terior ones?" What separates Goldberg and other neo-humanists from the Grand Inquisitor's peculiar Platonism is the effort of the critic to enter into a dialogue with the text, to examine it on its terms as well as his own, to expe rience its structure of effects before moving from immersion to reflection.
