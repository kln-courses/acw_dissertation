<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nathalie Debrauwere-Miller: Envisager Dieu avec Edmond Jab?s. Paris: Cerf 2007, 316 S. There are several good books on Edmond Jab?s in French and in English, but this is</page><page sequence="2">100 Kurzrezensionen the only one that focuses almost entirely on the religious dimension, and the only one that relates the ontological issues de veloped by the author (an Egyptian Jew, but a secularist without a traditional religious education) to their historical Judaic context. Professor Debrauwere-Miller performs an invaluable cultural service: in France, as in many European and North American lit erary academic circles, religion has been reduced to elements of an atheistic post modernism, developing such themes as the death of the author, writing and Jewishness as exile, nomadic writing, God as silent, ab sent, or non-existent. Of course the Holo caust looms large in negating any humanis tic hopes. Without denying the authenticity of these philosophical debates, which the extensive Jab?s uvre helps us to explore, Debrauwere-Miller provides an authentic traditional and modern Judaic context. The titles of its two parts - ?La Figu ration and ?La D?-figuration et d?figu ration? - suggest a formalistic framework. And the substantial introduction (11-49) traces the philosophic reputation of Jab?s due to Derrida, Blanchot, and L?vinas, and a multitude of readers sympathetic to decon struction and post-modernism. The words ?juif? and ?Dieu? have indeed been ac cepted narrowly as figures of the condition of the writer. Debrauwere-Miller remedies this bias with an incisive survey of mod ern Judaic scholarship on the ?Shekhinah? (the female in-dwelling presence of God) in Kabbalistic and rabbinic tradition, as she examines issues of anthropomorphism that have always dogged religious interpreters. Four long chapters trace basic themes of Jewish theology and their secular liter ary parallels. Part One introduces the femi nist aspect of the Jab?s uvre, starting with Chapter 1, ?De l'av?nement d'un Dieu femme? (53-97). Among the several vol umes of Le Livre des questions, the book Yae'l holds special focus in this analysis. Chap ter 2, ?De l'origine du monde au r?gne du mal? (99-151), features reflections by L?vi nas, Mopsik, Trigano, Ouaknin, as Debrau were-Miller defines ?le moment ?thique? of Jab?s: ?Jab?s cherche des yeux Dieu en qu?te de l'homme. Et pr?cis?ment, c'est dans cette exigence du regard pos? sur la Loi que r?side &gt;le moment humain de l' u vre de Jab?s?&lt; (116). The character Ya?l, as a figure of the Shekhinah, provides a literary context for the use by Jab?s of the Lurianic Kabbalah and its complex symbolism. Writ ing itself becomes both the original sin and its cure (146-151). The two chapters of Part II, ?La D?-fi guration et d?figuration?, turn more ex plicitly to the historical context, with special emphasis on the Shoah. Chapter 3, ?De l'?clips? de Dieu et son &gt;visage&lt; ef fac?? (155-195), analyzes Jab?s in relation to Blanchot and Derrida, but also Judaic scholars such as Tishby, Blumenthal, Scho lem, Ouaknin, Mopsik. The Kabbalistic no tion of tsim-tsoum (retraction of God that opens a space for the creation of the world) relates to a perception of God's silence or God's absence. A radical, self-subverting humanism emerges from the anthropomor phism which Jab?s both practices and repu diates. The central paradox of that vision in cludes both representation and subversion of the word (and reality) of God (see esp. 193-194). Chapter 4, ?De &gt;la mort de Dieu&lt; ? la Shoah? (197-253), introduces the no tion, with which the book will conclude, of a ?Judaism after God?. One practical con sequence is rebellion (?revolte?) inspired by Nietzsche and Camus, among many others. Debrauwere-Miller's quotation of L?vinas on atheism (269) is especially valuable. A number of other insights emerge from the numerous quotations from critics and thinkers as Debrauwere-Miller develops a consistent, and coherent analysis of the scat tered sources. It is almost an ?tat pr?sent of Jab?s studies oriented toward religion, ethics, as well as ontology. Her prose is clear and the references to secondary sources precise, as is the bibliography, and, still rare for a French academic study, an index of names Romanische Forschungen 123 (2011)</page><page sequence="3">Kurzrezensionen 101 and index of ideas. Envisager Dieu avec Ed mond Jab?s provides an excellent, if intense, introduction to the religious foundation of the Jab?s uvre, and a valuable organizing principle for those of us who have followed for years the steady production of Edmond Jab?s and the rich critical explorations of the Jewish condition, the mysteries of human evil, Gods silence, and the grave responsi bility of reading and writing.
