<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Problem of Ideology and Literature Wilhelm Girnus De quel parti est un miroir? Stendhal, 23 July I827, Armance I. Introductory Remarks DEOLOGIES are proscribed-excepting our own. We thought we could avoid the dilemma by banishing them completely from man's dwelling places, but they always steal in again through the back door. Is the mystery of their function and structure not latent in this circumstance? Who would ever think of outlawing physics or mathe- matics on moral grounds? At most, perhaps their abuse! Freedom from physics and chemistry? An absurd postulate! The very laws of nature subject us to their phenomena. We never had, never have an option. But ideologies? Are we ourselves not their creators? Are we not clearly responsible for their existence? Would it not seem therefore that we could also eliminate them, since they caused so much obvious harm? Hence, independence from ideologies is highly valued as proof of in- tellectual integrity, as criterion of scientific steadfastness, at the least as ideal. Thus the engagement-hic pro, illic contra-is undeniable. Ideology, the object of fervent engagement, is itself the offspring of engagement: relative to our world and our contemporaries, to what is and what will be. The question arises: is this engagement a necessary element of man's vital functions? an essential component of his human nature as generic phenomenon? The species Homo sapiens has created a unique position for itself in the universe, a position it cannot abandon without destroying itself. Its life-as well as that of the individual-is a journey without return, and day after day we are under pressure to forge ahead. Every day we have to ponder over our various possibilities for self-realization before we objectify our decision as a component of our life-strategy. But once the decision has left our intellectual projection room and become an</page><page sequence="2">484 NEW LITERARY HISTORY act, a new historical basis for new projections has automatically been created. We can never return with an equal chance to a situation in which we have missed our chance. History is irreversible. This is the very essence of the historical. We are born only once. This is the un- convertible currency in which we have to pay for our existence; it is so fundamental a fact that any attempt to escape from its inner logic causes us suffering. Oedipus. Faust. The human species responds to this situation by means of engagement-intellectually, emotionally, in practice--and cannot respond otherwise. In the constant construction and elaboration of an adequate matrix of expectations, man places him- self in the universe as presumptive subject and groups the world of objects about himself as a cosmic-historical habitat in which his life- strategy must then be realized. Man fights his way through the jungle of history into the situation of a real subject to the extent that he domi- nates history, its natural as well as its social phenomenon. In short, he makes history the object of his knowledge, his will, his practical action. The controlling variable of this dynamic is the world's practical- material changing; knowledge, and all other ideas-and dreams-are the transmitting elements in the process; the aim is ceaseless intensifica- tion of man's vital functions in all their possible dimensions-physical and intellectual, psychic and emotional, ethical and aesthetic, individual and social. Only the relatively monotropic animal-without conscious- ness, without conception of the future, without a universal system of values-can be content with the mere physical reproduction of its generic existence. Consciousness of time forces man to extrapolate his existence backwards and forwards, to visualize constantly the direction and deviations in his life's course, and to relate his course to that of his species-i.e., to the real process of history-by means of his own life- strategy. Among the many differences between knowledge of a planet's orbit and knowledge of a man's and mankind's life-course there is an especially important one which is philosophically definable, thus categorical. The astronomer's judgment of motion is a cognitive judgment concerning the relation between objects; a judgment concerning motion and laws of motion in man or mankind is always a cognitive judgment about the judge himself and his relation to the object-world. The personal sub- ject itself hangs in the balance of his historical perspective. We there- fore make a distinction between this sphere of judgment and cognition and that of mere object-cognition. The human subject, called upon to arrive at a decision, makes himself the mediate or immediate object of his self-knowledge, and we term this sphere of intellectual activity the ideological process. Seen in this way, ideological activity is an inevitable</page><page sequence="3">ON THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGY AND LITERATURE 485 element of the social and individual life-process; everyone constantly produces "Ideology." Heine once said ironically that official submission to a dominant Christian ideology-baptism-was the admission-ticket to European civilization. To this we might add that ideology as an existential phenomenon is the admission ticket to human civilization as such, and that without it there is no conceivable escape from history- less immediacy. Ideology changes and develops constantly, for the subject-disposition of individual and species also changes constantly-objectively and sub- jectively. Ideology thus appears as an intellectual distillate of group- engagement, since coherent groups having any historical consistency constantly give birth to a historical engagement appropriate to their communal strategic needs. Ideology-regarded diachronically and syn- chronically-assumes the most efficient possible form of expression, given the historical circumstances: whether magical, mythical, religious, philo- sophical, scientific, or artistic. Ideology can express the tasks set by his- tory correctly or falsely (or defectively), adequately or inadequately (or unsatisfactorily), meaningfully or meaninglessly (or distortedly), from the point of view of the objectively necessary strategy. This de- pends on its structure in relation to its historical function and to the historical data. The theory that all ideology is a false form of conscious- ness is therefore excessively dogmatic. Ideology can be false, and will be when new facts and new knowledge no longer fit into its framework: "Reason turns into nonsense, kindness into torment... ." Ideology is a process. As the hypothetical matrix in which the historical subject-object dialectic takes place, ideology is dependent, in respect to its truth-content, upon the particular stage this dialectic has reached. Its truth is there- fore as subordinate to the law of development as every other truth. For this reason we do not share the view that ideology is the opposite of science. Economics, history, the social sciences, jurisprudence: all these, like religion, philosophy, art, and poetry, are by definition ideological forms through which man as historical subject visualizes his positions in the historical universe. These sciences are concerned primarily not with object-cognition, but with the laws of motion that govern a thinking, feeling, desiring, acting subject in different spheres vis-a-vis a con- figuration of objects he himself has placed in the world. Statements made by these sciences are therefore essentially ideological events, inde- pendent of the theories and standpoints, interests and historical per- spectives they express. Anyone who interprets economics, for example, as a science of objects and relations, but not as cognition of a sphere in which the human subject realizes itself relative to the object-world- or anyone who considers literature, painting, music merely as the prob-</page><page sequence="4">486 NEW LITERARY HISTORY lem of relations between "material elements," such as acoustic signs, light frequencies, air-vibrations (Max Bense) -anyone who thinks thus is merely a victim of modern thing-fetishism, which is again a kind of ideology even though its representatives claim to be "free of ideology." Seen in terms of these categories, Goethe's vernal hymn "Ganymede" is a piece of poetically compressed ideology, as opposed, for instance, to a geographic, climatologic, botanical, or zoological treatise on spring. Nature myths are eo ipso types of ideological interpretation, since in one way or another the personal subject always determines them subliminally. Every man "produces" ideology every day, in more or less obvious ways. This is the reason for the enormous coagulative power of the images, thoughts, and ideas that form the assemblage we term ideology, which then appears to us as a crystallized system of intellectual-moral coordinates, and the task of specialists is to see to the filtration and purification of this coagulum for social purposes. The function and structure of ideological processes become especially noticeable when traditional forms reveal themselves as incapable of including new world- historical content and therefore have to be overturned or even destroyed. We haven't space to go into the question of why such different forms of ideological creativity as science and poetry are needed. Let it suffice to say that science compresses experience in the form of a general law, but that the human subject is always a personal subject and requires that his potentialities be articulated from the sensual-concrete standpoint of his personal existence. From this standpoint the subject projects for himself by means of imaginative literature his potentialities as a generic subject in order to obtain possible coordinates for his self-positioning in the universe. That class ideologies represent functionally necessary, con- stantly crystallizing, ideal sublimates of the social life-process is just as inevitable as that they seek their corresponding effect in science and literature. In the overturnings and mutations of worn-out ideas, at the historical crossroads of world-historically significant ideologies, the inter- action among function, structure, and expressive form in ideological processes relative to literature becomes especially clear. Brecht says on this subject: In equal measure dangerous and useful is the making Of intelligible images. The cosmos is formed in them. Next to each other, affecting each other, lie all things. To make a totality surmisable requires much variety. The re-creating spirit enjoys the joys of creation. All seems ordered to him since he ordered it. So much That does not fit he leaves out and calls it "little." Or else history is formed. Before everyone's eyes</page><page sequence="5">ON THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGY AND LITERATURE 487 The situations succeed one another. Only a few constantly Recurring laws regulate the proceeding. Such images are useful as long as they serve us. Not longer. Only in the struggle with other images which are no longer so serviceable But were once also useful, do they serve us. Struggling namely with new, never-experienced situations Men struggle also with old images and make New images, that the untenable be shown As vacuous and dispensed with. In large-scale models Men thus show to themselves new scarcely imaginable things Already in operation. And since these new models Are usually made out of old ones, sculpted in material already There, they appear false, but they are not. They become false. (Sinn und Form, II [I959], 645) The Prometheus myth, including its anamnesis and exegesis into our latest socialist present, provides excellent illustrations of these ideas, pre- cisely because the Prometheus myth contains the problem of subject- object dialectic as a theorem in radically compressed form. II. Goethe "Overturning"? Certainly not a word Goethe would have liked. Overturning doesn't lead far, But this doesn't bother us; We turn the stocking inside out And wear it thus. And yet who, before Marx, exercised the right to overturn things if not he? Not only Prometheus! Pandora! Faust! Cloaked in mythical gloom, he rescues them from proscription. Sacrilege becomes highest humanity, an outrage becomes an act of kindness, damnation becomes triumph. Prometheus brings freedom, Pandora hope, Faust victory. Symbols of the divine or the diabolical are transformed by his hand into images of man and the human, the message clearly being: See, the time is almost come. Prometheus as one who helps himself? That is only half the truth. Interpretation on the defensive, ascetic sociology. Prometheus is the world-creator. Demiurge. Begetter of a willed world. Archetype of human productive power. Poetic spearhead of human generic conscious- ness. We are Prometheus. "Wielded hammers"--they become the mod- ern poetry of humanity. These words from the Pandora fragment, though spoken by Prometheus, are a confession of the author:</page><page sequence="6">488 NEW LITERARY HISTORY You who, looking inward to the anvil, work, And force hard bronze into the form of thought, I rescued you, when my lost race Plunged after unsteady mist-images With glazed eyes and open arms, to attain What is not attainable, and even if it were, Neither serves nor shapes; but you bring benefit. Wild immovable cliffs cannot resist you, But topple, mountains of ore, dislodged by levers, Then melted and transformed into tools, A second hand. Thus power is multiplied. Wielded hammers speak poetry, cunning tongs grasp; Thus you increase your own and related powers, Active and wisely powerful, into the infinite. What might designed, what subtlety devised, Yours is to actualize it beyond itself. As if that were not an "overturning"! A total overturning. Not only of the Prometheus myth but of all salvation myths, all "transcending"! But Pandora, who in myth appears as the first woman, created for man's confusion, as punishment for his irreverence-which we may interpret historically as a mythical justification of patriarchy-Pandora, "step- ping forth out of the ancient darkness," is brought back by Goethe in the name of science and art; she is now in command of all the gifts that man needs in order to grow beyond himself into the infinite, and she receives aid and comfort from all creators. As if this symbolism were not clear, not clearly a turning of the myth into its opposite! You are the creators of your world! You alone can redeem yourselves. "I am not wrong, beauty leads us where we must go." This sentence, spoken by Epimetheus, reveals its significance only when the idea of "beauty" is connected with Pandora: to me, says Epimetheus, "it ap- pears in the form of a woman"-beauty! In the form of Pandora? That Pandora of whom ancient myth ventured the opinion: "Her smile, her modesty, conceal treachery! Ruin to fathers, torment to SOns.,, But this dethroning of myth-significantly-is accomplished in a mythopoeic form. Artistry? Strategy? Historically immature methodol- ogy? Probably all of these, each conditioned by the others. Did the the- ologizing curmudgeons seriously believe they were the ones being chal- lenged? Senile error of all who are doomed to extinction. The world- historical, the productive challenge concealed in this thunderbolt, was in reality aimed at discursive thinking: its aim being to transform image into law, to raise human fate to the level of a problem now that the</page><page sequence="7">ON THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGY AND LITERATURE 489 myth had been unmasked as a theorem. The veil of poetry had to be torn apart, the flowery metaphor had to be robbed of its fragrance, in order to savor the profane truth, that seemingly insignificant fertile seed, the truth that man's doubleness in the world is his fate. The doubleness of the world through man was Prometheus in his nakedness without ornament. That was the problem. III. Hegel What could be the meaning of this doubleness? The great god of philosophical world-begetting, Hegel, raised man's doubleness as world- spirit to the Archimedean point of his intellectual world-edifice in the title role of the Phenomenology of the Spirit. And yet, Hegel is not a world-creator, nor does he wish to be. The material world appears to him too seriously blemished by the profane: Inter faeces et urinas nascimur. For Hegel the word is God, the logos. His monstrous and ingenious edifice of categories exposes him as the last great and modern adept of the Book of Revelation. Thus he takes even Prometheus at his word, not by his scabbard. He takes him as a theorist, not a practitioner, as one who thinks ahead rather than one who strides ahead; he takes him, in other words, as the problem of the world-spirit, this funda- mentally creative yeast in the world-process. Here the ancient myth experiences its last secularized reincarnation as tragic genius under the name of absolute spirit. Just as Prometheus in the ancient myth had to sacrifice his liver daily to Zeus' eagles, only to have it grow back at night, so the world-spirit is condemned to profane itself daily, to exter- nalize its infinite divinity into vile finite objects, as material secretions of its essence, in order to enter into appearance. It is condemned as spirit to sacrifice itself to matter. The doubling of the world-spirit into material objects, this unending dichotomy, is the eternal tragedy of the world- spirit. If by the tragic we understand that pathos which takes upon itself the inevitability of sacrifice, then this division between world-spirit and object-world indeed bears the mark of the tragic, for Hegel considers it eternal, absolute, and inexorable. Reality arises only when the world- spirit continually sacrifices itself in world-material. But at least Hegel had passed well beyond the eschatological laxness of this contradiction by means of salvation. Hegel thus replaces imaginative-mythical "transcending" by the speculative "transcending" of discursive reason. A kind of intellectual costume-change: his aim being to rescue something that for him in its traditional form was already utterly lost, and yet in substance seemed</page><page sequence="8">490 NEW LITERARY HISTORY worth rescuing. What no one after Vico, Voltaire, Herder, and Goethe, considering the state of the human race, could dare to offer for sale without making himself eternally ridiculous, Hegel, by an encyclopedic synthesis, ventured to underwrite, in a final attempt to preserve out- moded values. Hegel takes the creator-Prometheus in the form of the world-spirit and demonizes him into the absolute world-creator, who asserts himself in tragic contradiction with world-material. A unique kind of necromancy! The anthropomorphic centralization of a trans- cending world-interpretation is here stylized into a universally valid, all- powerful, abstract world-principle and thus brought to a head. It can- not be pushed further without turning into its opposite. In his world-interpretation, where the world-spirit performs the drama of Prometheus, which despite all its grandly dialectical twists and turns remains ultimately only a permanent shriek of pain, Hegel delivers up beauty as a sacrifice to this tragedy, just as the Achaeans in Aulis sacrificed Iphigeneia, so as to obtain a favorable wind from the gods for their attempt to recapture this very beauty. For even Hegel loves beauty, but it must die, in order to preserve for the world-spirit its birthright, which of course experiences in Hegel's own philosophy its purest and highest incarnation. For Hegel the "beautiful" is mortal. That is its essence, for the beautiful-even though in concreto its indi- vidual expression may be highly respectable and indispensable his- torically-suffers from sensuality and thus from finiteness. This, how- ever, is the strictest condemnation in Hegel's hierarchy of values. "The hour of its birth is the hour of its death . . . the infinite is true being." Humanity must thus ultimately pay for the doubleness of the world as spirit with the loss of beauty. But we should not mourn for it; we should proudly consider that we do not need beauty since we are able to par- take immediately of absolute spirit. For Goethe, on the other hand, it is beauty that shows the way to man's immortalization: "Beauty leads us where we must go"-"we exist in order to immortalize ourselves." Here lies the fundamental opposition between Goethe and Hegel, and it would be wrong to attribute it exclusively, if at all, to the opposition between thinker and poet, between discursive and imaginative spirit. Although for his part Hegel tries his utmost by means of all sorts of conceptual artifices to seduce the arts, considered as the manifestation of the "beautiful," into cohabitation with absolute spirit (if not in canonical then at least in morganatic marriage as "alienation of the spirit in the sensual," as "sacrifice for feeling and sensuality"), still he constantly runs up against the question of "what impels man to bring forth works of art." And even if his pretensions as sole representative of the philosophical spirit dictate to him macabre sentences such as the</page><page sequence="9">ON THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGY AND LITERATURE 491 following: "There are bound to be other and even better ways of ac- complishing what art intends"; still, his inquisitiveness, honed by the study of historical dialectics, continues to seek the impulses and moti- vations behind art, not like the shallow biographical-positivistic exe- getes in curious exhibitory desires of abnormal individuals, but rather in the generic nature of man! The universal and absolute need which gives rise to art (in its formal aspect) originates in man's condition as a thinking consciousness; that is, man makes out of himself and for himself what he is and what exists in general. The things of nature are only immediate and unitary, but man as spirit doubles himself by being first of all like the things of nature, yet equally for himself, in a position to look at himself, imagine, and think; and it is only by means of this active being-for-himself that he is spirit. Man attains this consciousness of himself in two ways: First theoretically, insofar as he must become internally conscious of himself, of what stirs in the human breast, what delves and surges in it; and insofar as he must look at himself in the first place, visualize what thought infers as the essence, orient himself, and recognize in what he himself brings forth and in what he receives from without, only himself.-Second, man is for himself by way of practical activity, in that he has the drive to bring himself forth in what is given him immediately, what is externally present, and thus at the same time to recognize himself. He carries out this pur- pose by altering external things, impressing upon them the seal of his inner self, and then discovering in them his own destiny. Man does this as a free subject in order to eliminate from the external world its rigid alienage, and in order to possess in the form of things merely an ex- ternal realization of his self. .... (Hegel, Asthetik [Berlin, 19551, P- 75) A prose style as seductive as it is treacherous. Man doubles himself in this world--and this is his generic nature- . . . but . . . in the spirit. If anyone-under the gentle, too gentle, influence of Marx-wants to rejoice here and celebrate in Hegel the discoverer of the primacy of practice, he will not be spared a bitter disappointment when he probes more deeply into these sentences. Practice-and in the mere introduc- tion of this category into philosophical interpretation there is a con- siderable amount of Hegelian genius-practice is only the servant of self-knowledge; alteration of the world is only a means of interpreting it! Spirit is the purpose of all purposes, purpose as such-desire and lust only its devices in order to bring even human sensuality, the pal- pable aspect of human existence, with its forging, weaving, and carving, indeed in order to bring even begetting, maturing, and giving birth under the domination of absolute spirit. Absolute spirit is thus nothing</page><page sequence="10">492 NEW LITERARY HISTORY but the secularized omnipotence of God; man is His worldly set of instruments, and man's consciousness is the stultified finite image of cosmic genius in the objective world. Coming from Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, we were hoping for the critical reflection of human generic existence in a philosophical mirror. And what does Hegel ulti- mately offer us instead in his theory of human doubleness? A new religion in the abstract phraseology of the cult of bourgeois reason. But what on the altars of Notre Dame in Paris was only the philosophical requiem for the swath of severed heads in a collapsing world, is now stylized into a monstrous abstract animism. And here is the parting of the ways. Then as now. The time had really come to turn the stocking inside out. This, however, can only mean: to free Prometheus from the tentacles of absolute spirit and to modernize his dossier to befit the age of electronics and space travel. IV. Marx As is well known, absolute spirit died with its originator. But the opportunity history offers in the "decay process of absolute spirit" is not overlooked: "The first assumption of all human history . . . the exis- tence of living human individuals" is recognized as the first premise of all thoughts about man. "The being of men is their real life-process . . . all writing of history has to start out from these natural bases and from their modifications in the course of history through men's ac- tion . . . the really active man is the starting-point. . . ." In the Hegelian "approach one starts out from consciousness; in the other ap- proach, which corresponds to real life, one starts out from the real living individuals themselves and considers consciousness only as their con- sciousness." In short, if for the last grand master of metaphysics human generic nature appears as "living consciousness," it appears in the new, diametrically opposed version of the problem as "conscious life-activity." In a sense, nothing more happens than an ever so small switch from noun to adjective-things are so simple in philosophy-and already an entirely new, revolutionary world-view is born. Here is the authentic text: Productive life, however, is generic life. It is the life that breeds life. Its mode of vital activity contains the whole character of a species, its generic character, and free conscious activity is the generic character of man. Life itself appears only as a means to life. The animal is directly one with its vital activity; it does not separate itself therefrom. It is its activity.</page><page sequence="11">ON THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGY AND LITERATURE 493 Man makes his vital activity itself an object of his will and consciousness. He possesses conscious vital activity. It is not a condition with which he is simply identical. Conscious vital activity distinguishes man from the animals' vital activity. Precisely this makes him a generic being. Or vice versa; the one thing that makes him a conscious being--so that his own life is an object for him--is precisely that he is a generic being. Only for this reason is his activity free activity. The practical creation of an objective world, the fashioning of inorganic nature, is the proof that man is a conscious generic being, i.e., a being that relates to its species as to its own being or relates to itself as a generic being. Animals of course also produce. They build nests, dwellings, like the bees, beavers, ants, etc. But they only produce what they need directly for themselves or their young; they produce within limits whereas man produces even when free from physical need and indeed only then truly produces; animals produce only themselves whereas man reproduces all nature; their product belongs directly to their physical body, whereas man stands free vis-a-vis his product. Animals shape things only according to the measure and the need of their species, whereas man knows how to produce according to the measure of every species and knows how to apply the inherent measure of an object; man therefore also shapes things according to the laws of beauty. It is precisely in his fashioning of the objective world that man first really proves himself a generic being. This production is his operative generic life, and enables nature to appear as his labor and his reality. The object of labor is therefore the objectification of the generic life of man, in that man doubles himself not only intellectually, as in consciousness, but also operatively, and therefore looks at himself in a world created by himself. (Marx, Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts, 1844) The remarkable feature of this text is its exact antithetical parallelism to the Hegel quotation. It is as though it were a direct antitext and a reversal of the first, perhaps even intentionally selected as starting point. Our hearing is sharpened, furthermore, by the aesthetic component, which gives both texts their special tone. But this component is not the determining factor although Hegel's text is from his Aesthetics. Whereas in Hegel it is the problem that is aesthetically determined, Marx places the aesthetic argument-with its implications only suggested but still normative-as a finishing touch upon the closing figure of his demon- stration, as a jewel at the end of his chain of thought, thus operating according to the law of beauty, and directly counteracting Hegel's philo- sophical arrogance. But the core of this world-shaking antithesis is found in the radical overturning of Hegel's "doubling of man as a spirit." Not this doubling makes man: only in his fashioning of the objective world</page><page sequence="12">494 NEW LITERARY HISTORY does man really prove himself as a generic being "... in that not only intellectually, as in consciousness, but also operatively, he really doubles himself [my emphasis] and therefore looks at himself in a world created by himself"! "Wielded hammers speak poetry!" Here the true poetry of humanization is born. Prometheus is at last released from the curse of languishing as a demigod between heaven and earth. At last he may dis- card his mythical costume. At last man sees himself as nature's creature in his natural being within the natural world. Practice, the real life- process which for Hegel is merely an objective manifestation of the hu- man intellect, an acolyte in the temple of absolute spirit, above whose portal is written FvwZe acoTvrov practice is now revealed by Marx as the determining element of our collective existence. Intellect, conscious- ness, and knowledge now become the mediating organ for our progres- sive realization, and the same applies to the aesthetic yeast in this world- formation based on human standards. A tragic world-interpretation, which historically always culminates in a call for the savior, is dis- credited. Salvation through grace is now supplanted by the acting man's solution of historical problems as they arise. For Hegel the transformation of the world is not only a component of man's self-knowledge as spirit-spirit, but at the same time labor, specifically abstract spirit in the sense of labor as such, abstract labor- but the transformation of the world by man is also, and more essentially, a component of the unceasing, indeed infinite transformation of the world as the "labor" of "absolute spirit," the self-realization of that spirit through self-alienation. Transformation of the world as a purely human deed would have been unacceptable to Hegel-this fanatic of systematic perfection and universality-on the grounds of its being anthropolog- ically too limited an idea. For Marx, on the other hand, the unrelent- ing transformation of the world-explicitly distinguished from the cycle of nature-is a component of the formation of human existence, of man's continuing generic determination, and thus the formation of man himself, whereupon labor becomes the mediating element in the meta- bolic process between man and nature. Anthropocentric obfuscation of the idea of world-alteration thus occurs in Hegel because he philosophi- cally forces "unconscious" nature out of the dialectic of the labor pro- cess. Since, for Marx, man in the totality of his generic determinateness is himself an object of the formative action, it follows that he forms not only the objective world, the world "thrown at him," according to the laws of beauty, but also himself! And not only his outer shell, not only skin and hair, but his wholeness as a personality, as heart and intellect, as individuality and character. How could he be capable of changing</page><page sequence="13">ON THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGY AND LITERATURE 495 the world without also changing himself constantly, as the central figure of his generic drama? He thus also realizes himself as man only to the extent that he himself forms himself aesthetically. At this point, the epoch-making deciphering of the Prometheus myth culminates in reality. V. Brecht and his Successors What is world-knowledge, what is self-knowledge as a generic phenomenon, if not a kind of fermenting agent introduced for the pur- pose of raising our generic existence to new levels, expanding it into daring dimensions, making possible a better command of our life- strategy? What can art be, hic et nunc, in an age where the technical, social, and moral bases of our existence change radically every day, faster and faster, before everyone's eyes? This age where Prometheus- the increasingly fervent amalgam of science, technology, and the labor- ing class-is on the point of forging a new world in which wielded hammers write the poem of the future! Prometheus is not only forging a new material world, but is also "forming men according to his image." What existential sense can art have here if not as the yeast in this secular metamorphosis of humanity and man? What use now is an art that only establishes the established, that only sets down what has happened, and at its best merely provides a decorative frame? What use is a theory-no matter how importunately, how shamelessly it offers it- self, labeled "realism," as the fashionable partner in a long-term aesthet- ic loan-what use is a theory which offers aesthetic activity no other opportunity but to produce mirror-images of the transitory and of that which is already past, whether in an "outer" or an "inner" world? A thesis of this sort only serves to discredit art entirely. At base this is nothing more than the dogma of absolute spontaneity in artistic re- actions, provoked by the objective world. "Art" of this kind can at best be the subjective illustration of generic history-and it is usually not even this. The aesthetic function thus sinks to a mere draping of the factual. A thoroughly contemplative, bourgeois-luxurious theory of the aesthetic functions. For no matter how this problem may present itself to the individual, it remains undeniable that reactive manifestations of a doubling of the factual in consciousness give up every claim of con- stituting a component of man's conscious self-formation, the sourdough of world-formation. In an epoch pregnant with revolution in all spheres of existence and all corners of the earth, how could art still be possible without in one way or another reflecting this condition? But art is far from being revo-</page><page sequence="14">496 NEW LITERARY HISTORY lutionary for this reason. It still remains trapped in a journalistic "world-formation" as "doubling in the spirit." Art still does not take itself seriously as a catalyst of revolutionary world-formation, as the fuel for a real alteration in real man and his world, a world in which man "doubles himself not only intellectually, as in consciousness, but also operatively, and therefore looks at himself in a world created by him- self ... [for] it is precisely in his fashioning of the objective world"- and this applies especially to man's aesthetic activity-"that man first really proves himself a generic being." We may extrapolate Marx's thought as follows: only art and aesthetic action which understand and realize themselves as the fermenting agent of operative-revolutionary world-formation, and which iconoclastically goad society to rework its natural and social being, always searching out the most decisive and effective means to accelerate this process; only art and aesthetic action which force a decision, which stir up, spur on, and provoke everything that struggles against revolution and revolutionary evolution, only such art and aesthetic action carry in our time any historical weight. In the epoch of revolution the revolutionary is Prometheus, for revolution is sometimes the greatest productive power of history, in that it breaks down the closed horizons of human creative potency, and "to become productive," even in the thinking of the Prometheus-poet, and properly so, is "the most deep-seated quality in human nature, indeed one can say without exaggeration that it is human nature" (Goethe, "On Dil- lettantism"). In a bourgeois-capitalist society, transformation of the world and of man results from unconsciously operating laws whose effectiveness and mode of operation reactively force themselves into social consciousness and are then reflected and even extrapolated artistically. Dialectic appears here necessarily as the negation of desire, since spontaneity rules the realm of purely individual interest. The dialectic of the negation of desire then becomes the prevalent theme of the epoch, from The Bril- liance and Misery of Courtesans to Doctor Faustus, from The Red and the Black to The Trial. Herein we see the operation of "a part of that power which always wills good and always creates evil." Satiric pathos is therefore the most fertile soil for this art. History always blocks the path of the individual. Kafka is right: condemnation and execution are the essence. The art of this epoch reaches its apex where the unique negativity of the historical dynamic is felt in its terrifying depths, in its apparently never-ending threats, where presumptuous illusions fall apart, where "false consciousness" must always expose itself anew, where subjective bourgeois goals euphorically mask the opposing objective</page><page sequence="15">ON THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGY AND LITERATURE 497 purposefulness of the historical process, in order to be able to endure reality despite this insidious negativity of historical dialectic. In this relatively idyllic phase of history, which deals almost exclusively with the triumph or tragedy of individuals or at most of levels of society, art reaches its greatest heights where it becomes a clear, incorruptible lens to focus upon this negativity in which the law of the epoch expresses itself and hurls its "quis ego" at man. However, now that the triumph or ruin not only of whole peoples or continents but of mankind as such hangs in the balance of history and now that the answer to this world- historical question depends on whether mankind entrusts its ship to the mercy of wind and waves or takes hold of the helm and defies the storm, any art which is not absolutely driven to overturn man and the world radically, any art which does not discover in such overturning the highest joy of existence, voluntarily takes up residence in the back- room of world history. If compendia for students and feuilletons, or hypermodern "infor- mation" aesthetics- and linguistic structure-technocrats, constantly try to intimidate us with the question "Is this art?" then the question alone proves that that whole universe of ideas should be placed in the back-room of world history. Since the revolution has begun to take possession of the whole world, the critical question can only be: "What is revolutionary art?" Only from the point of view of our revolution can it be discovered and made clear what is beautiful for modem mankind and how much of the past belongs to the future. Only he who plunges into the revolutionary stream can have enjoyment of it. Only he who has such enjoyment can entice others into it. That which in the eruptive passion of earlier revolutions appears as a breakthrough of the paralyzing lethargy of normality, is becoming the daily bread of our epoch. Only he who stands at the pinnacle of revolutionary enthusiasm will recognize himself under lofty historical circumstances. There is no revolutionary overturning of the world without a revolutionary over- turning of art and its theory, for art is the social nerve of revolutionary enthusiasm. But the epoch-making change of function in art that distinguishes the socialist period from all earlier ones is concealed in precisely this shift from interpretation to alteration. And is the deeper meaning of the Prometheus myth not hidden here as well? It is not enough merely to find the key; it must be used to open the gates of world history, so that all the swinging hammers may have room. In a world in which historical law asserts itself spontaneously and the truth comes to light only when the chapter is already closed, art has no opportunity for a conscious shaping of world and man in a way that history would not</page><page sequence="16">498 NEW LITERARY HISTORY contradict sooner or later. If art does not want to retreat from the world, then its only possible function, at best, is to mirror the world clearly and incorruptibly, and to stop at that. If the main concern of art is to be the actual alteration of the world, the great leap from mere interpretation becomes possible only when man grasps the law of his own evolution. With imaginative experiments art then uncovers and antici- pates man's various potentialities, and so presents him with the true alternatives in his self-realization as master of events, deftly coaxing from him even the determination of his life-strategy and its variations, or if need be wresting this determination from him by force, thus al- ways stimulating and challenging his freedom of action anew. The mirroring of these configurations, the sensual anticipation of imaginable possibilities, becomes a means to an end. In the presocialist world, despite good intentions, this mirroring remains an end in itself; all else is utopia. For this reason we have many different theories of such mirroring: materialistic and idealistic (e.g., Plato), dialectic and mechanistic (e.g., Lukics). It is well known that Brecht placed just this "alteration" at the center of his aesthetics. For him, the axis of the alteration was political revo- lution, the destruction of bourgeois dominance and the creation of socialist conditions of production. In very general terms: the re- ordering of "social conditions." To move man toward this end was the deepest, the ultimate motive behind all his artistic efforts: La re'vo- lution d'abord !-First revolution! Then all the rest! First the destruc- tion of capitalist dictatorship, then a world of beauty. The thesis, "First alteration of man, then alteration of society," appeared to him as utterly idealistic, treacherous, and social-reformist. He directed his satire and his sarcasm against precisely this thesis, in accordance with Lenin's criticism of such a trend in the European workers' movement. What will happen, however, when these two decisive postulates of our revo- lution are fulfilled, when bourgeois dominance has toppled and socialist conditions of production have prevailed? When on a global scale this victory is no longer in question? Will there still be any sense in the counterthesis: First revolution, then a world of beauty, and only then a human being according to the laws of beauty? Or more generally: First revolution of social conditions, then the alteration of man. Evi- dently there has been a change of function within this dialectic, a reversal of the postulates' values. If there is still any sense to be found in this peculiar thesis, then it can only be that even in a socialist situation the social conditions remain a kind of fate and man their object, unable to raise himself into the position of the subject of events. And yet, how could man want to become the subject of history, how could he alter</page><page sequence="17">ON THE PROBLEM OF IDEOLOGY AND LITERATURE 499 the world, the whole world-not only social conditions-without altering himself for this alteration? The destruction of bourgeois dominance, the expropriation of expropriators, creates only the possibility for a revo- lutionary metamorphosis of man, the matrix as it were for the birth of a new world. Revolutionary transformation of man is not the auto- matic effect of change in social conditions. The possibilities must be perceived and realized. By whom? By precisely this being who alters himself consciously. Man must create new organs for himself. New eyes, new ears, new hands, new nerves, new marrow. Revolutionary transformation of man becomes more and more the key to revolutionary evolution in the totality of social conditions. As Lenin said: "The consciousness of man not only mirrors the objective world, but also creates it!" The irreversible victory, here, of a socialist mode of pro- duction, and its predictable victory on a global scale, has produced a fundamentally new situation for art and our conception of realism. Brecht would have been the last to deny this reality. His thoughts on the problem of realism-for historically well-rounded reasons-do not reach this point. The destruction of bourgeois dictatorship was the problem of his epoch, and he made it his own. But if we were to go no further than Brecht, if we were to dogmatize his thoughts as a non plus ultra, this would necessarily impede our artistic development, just as Luk'cs' theory has at times done to a considerable extent. For us, the change in function mentioned above determines our artistic quest. Neither the alteration of the social order nor the unceasing change of man as a condition for the unceasing change of society is an end in itself. The uninterrupted intensificationr of our life-process is the goal of goals, the deepest meaning of our revolution. Everything else is a means to this end. But there can be no intensification of our life-process with- out shaping our life, our life-conditions, our personality, "also accord- ing to the laws of beauty." Here, for the art of our age, lies the "soul- axis," the orientation of what we consider the criterion of a socialist realism. The highest measure of value in this aesthetics is the revo- lutionary struggle-so that revolutionary man becomes beautiful, which here means more than "good," "true," "useful"-it does not seem improbable that Brecht himself would have been on our side against those who have declared war upon beauty as a supposedly sterile vestige of classicism, and who have declared this war-to no one's surprise-in Brecht's name, thinking fertilissimum in agro (litterario) oculum domini esse. (Most fruitful upon the tilled field [of literature] is the eye of the Lord-with apologies to Pliny.) It is the same with the revolution. The bourgeois world nowadays is so thoroughly pregnant with it that even counterrevolution puts on the mask of revolution-even of socialist</page><page sequence="18">500 NEW LITERARY HISTORY revolution. The stakes grow ever bolder, the nuances subtler, the ex- pectations wilder, the maneuvers more obscure; farsightedness, sensi- tivity, selectivity grow ever more decisive, the borders between decep- tion and self-deception more complex. Where is revolution, where counterrevolution? The roots of a decision between the two reach into our most intimate depths, into our most secret dreams. If Heinrich Mann could remark that every love story is approached by its author from either the right or the left, then the reason is that man, in his own love story, goes either to the left or to the right. Whose antenna is better tuned to such delicate value-frequencies in human events, whose probe finds its way deeper into the unimaginably intricate circulatory system of interhuman communications, what can fix more clearly the frequency shifts between revolution and counterrevolution in the human black- box than art? And what instrument has at its command tones more delicate and pleasing to stimulate the sensitive nervous system of our race, to modulate it and lure it out of its reserve? There are phenomena and problems, psychic areas and founts of impulses, which can be de- tected, made conscious, and prepared for decision by no other means than those of artistic sensibility. And amid precisely such subtleties the "last judgment" in the human individual will hold its session. What else can revolutionary art be nowadays if not a million-branched seeking after the truly revolutionary possibilities for decision in our epoch? A search for authentic revolutionary sources of world metamorphosis amid the thousandfold travesties behind which the fear of a new world at- tempts to hide the thousandfold specter of the revolution. How would our artistic voyage of discovery be possible without separating the parody from its revolutionary original, the farce from tragedy, narcosis from enthusiasm? Goethe could mull serenely over the metamorphosis of plants and animals. We today live the greatest metamorphosis of our planet: that of mankind and of man. There are still things to be over- turned, but not merely for the sake of overturning! Regardless of what the iconoclasts may say. And the world does not come to a halt for Brecht either. Thus the secularization and overturning of the Prometheus myth not only reflect a fruitful interaction between thinking and poetry, be- tween fantasy and deed, but also allow us to sense how poetry itself as a creative medium for ideology spurs on the historical movement of mankind. The corresponding effect of ideology upon poetry, however, is just as clearly demonstrable. De quel parti est un miroir? Voila la question!
