<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Evidence for the Jagann?tha Cult in Seventeenth Century Nepal JOHN GUY The Kathmandu valley in the seventeenth century was very prosperous, the bulk of its wealth derived from the trade which flowed through the valley between Tibet and the Indian plains. The ancient urban centres of the valley, Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur had emerged early in the century as three separate kingdoms. The tradition of joint rulership, whereby rule of each city-state was shared between branches of the ruling Malla dynasty had collapsed. The three kingdoms were engaged in constant rivalry which intermittently spilt over into open hostility and which consumed much of their energy and wealth. Yet it was also this rivalry which stimulated an era of generous royal patronage of the priesthood and the sponsoring of major p?j?s and religious festivals, together with the building of new palaces and temples dedicated to the rulers' favourite deities. Support was extended not only to the artists commissioned to decorate the palaces and shrines, but also to poets, writers and musicians who found their work being encouraged, particularly when Nepalese court life underwent something of a renaissance under Mithila influence.1 This activity reached a peak during the reign of the enlightened and cultured King Pratapamalla of Kathmandu (i641-74),2 and under that of his contemporary and rival, King Jagatprak?samalla of Bhaktapur (1643-72). Patronage of the arts had been, since the rule of the Licchavis from at least the fourth century to the end of the eighth, of major concern to the rulers of the Kathmandu valley - they are chiefly remembered by the people of Nepal for their generous endowment of temples and shrines throughout the valley. The practice of royal endowment of temples is recorded in the earliest dated Licchavi inscription, that of the ruler M?nadeva I, dated A.D. 464, preserved on a pillar at the hill-temple of Changu N?r?yana.3 Royal support for both Buddhist and Hindu establishments is well attested throughout the history of the valley.4 The early Malla period, dating particularly from the reign of Sthitimalla (1382-95), saw a growing presence of highly orthodox Brahman priests from India, and 1 M.

It is evident that this, together with the growing influence of popular devotional Hinduism (bhakti) from northern India, resulted in Buddhism not only giving ground to Hinduism, but being itself (to a degree not witnessed anywhere else in the subcontinent), Hinduized. Tantrism appears to have provided the common thread which enabled these two traditions to be so intimately connected. An aspect of Hindu expansion in the Kathmandu valley in the seventeenth century which appears to have gone largely unrecorded, except in the memory of a number of minor temples which bear its name, is the worship of Lord Jagann?tha. Jagann?tha, "Lord of the Universe", is a deity of uncertain origin, who was popularly identified with Krsna, although sometimes he is represented as displacing the Buddha in depictions of the Dasavat?ras. He was the central deity of a cult centred at Puri, Orissa, one of the four great pilgrimage centres (dh?ms) o? India, a necessary destination for all devout Hindus.5 Although attracting vast numbers of pilgrims from all over India to its temple in Puri, built around 1135, the Jagann?tha cult was not widely practised outside Orissa, where its success was partly bound up with its political role as a state religion.6 It was, however, successfully exported to Bengal, as a number of late paintings testify (Fig. 3). It is also now clear that adherents to this cult included the ruling household of the Bhaktapur court during the reign of King Jagatprak?s'amalla. The evidence is to be found in a cloth painting commissioned by this ruler to commemorate his performance of an ananta vrata ceremony in Nepal Sam vat 790 (1670). The painting was acquired by the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in 1985 from a European collection (Fig. 1). In addition, in 1986 I identified three wooden polychrome figures now in the Bhaktapur Wood Museum, which represent the Jagann?tha triad : Jagann?tha, his sister Subhadr? and half-brother Balabhadra (= Balar?ma) (Fig. 2). Before examining the painting and sculptures in detail, I shall outline the essential aspects of the Jagann?tha cult as practised in Puri and the existing evidence for the cult in Nepal. The cult in Puri Jagann?tha is worshipped as a form of Krsna or indeed as a form of Visnu himself,7 and together with Sudhadr? and Balabhadra, forms a trinity. Each deity is represented by a doll-like figure, with a large head and wild, enlarged eyes. The trunk of the body is reduced to a post-like form.8 Arms are reduced to short truncated stumps which issue from either side of the head or upper torso. These curious icons are far removed from the " Great Tradition" of Hinduized culture, and, as has been suggested by a number of scholars, 5 S. M. Bhardwaj, Hindu Places of Pilgrimage in India.

In this sculpture 9 As Eschmann has shown, Orissan tribal origins overlaid with elements of Hinduization provide the most likely explanation, see A. Eschmann, "The Vaisnava typology of Hinduization and the origins of Jagannatha", in The Cult ofjagannath and the Regional Tradition ofOrissa, ed. A. Eschmann et al.

From the Sun Temple, Konarak, Orissa, c. 1250. National Museum, New Delhi, No. 50.182. Jagannatha is represented being worshipped, together with a Siva-li?ga and Durg? Mahis?suramardim, by the royal devotee and patron. The worship of all three deities together by the ruler clearly has a political dimension, the deities representing Puri, Bhubaneswar and Jajpur, the three major religious and political centres of Orissa, over which King Narasimha I was eager to show he exercised authority. This sculpture establishes that Jagannatha had assumed his characteristic form as early as the middle of the thirteenth century, and that he was firmly installed as the paramount deity at Puri by this date.10 10 The earliest reference to the triad occurs in an inscription of 1225 of the ruler Ana?gabh?ma III which praises</page><page sequence="7">Jagannatha cult in Nepal 219 The principal event in the ritual calendar of the Jagannatha temple at Puri is the annual rathay?tr? when the images are removed from the temple and, after an elaborate ritual bathing (sn?na y?tra), are taken on a journey in the three great chariots (rathas) prepared each year for them (Fig. 5). The procession, which enacts the journey taken by Krsna from Gokul to Mathura to vanquish the evil king Kansa, provides an opportunity for dar?an, to enable the faithful to attain the highest objective of their pilgrimage, a glimpse of the deity himself. The cult in Nepal It is not known when the Jagannatha cult was introduced into Nepal. As is well attested the Vaisnava cult assumed, over time, the status of a quasi-state religion. The rulers of Patan, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur all presented themselves to their people as incarnations of Visnu: King Sthitimalla (r. 1382-95) was the first to include N?r?yana (Visnu) in his title and to claim divine status.11 The Krsna cult experienced a major growth in popularity in the sixteenth century as part of a widespread bhakti devotional movement sweeping northern India. One of the major Vaisnava centres was Mithil?, a region which had already assumed an influential role in the religious and cultural life of Nepal under the Malla rulers. Mithil? brahmans were thus in a prime position to promote Krsna worship within the courts of Nepal. It should be stressed that in the course of the sixteenth century Jagannatha had come to be worshipped not merely as Krsna, an avat?ra of Visnu, but as Visnu himself. The Jagann?thacarit?mrta, an Orissan devotional poem written in the seventeenth century by D?vakarad?sa, declares Krsna to be only the sixteenth part of Lord Jagannatha... who is the highest Brahman himself'.12 This elevation of Jagannatha to the status of Visnu may account for the appearance of the cult in Nepal at this time, where Visnu worship was the supreme expression of Hindu faith. A second factor in the acceptability of the Jagannatha cult may relate to the custom of Orissan rulers claiming divine authority direct from Lord Jagannatha. King AnangabTma III elevated Jagannatha to the sole state deity of Orissa in 1230 and claimed to rule under his overlordship (samaraj).13 This practise would have made the cult attractive to the Malla rulers, already accustomed to identifying themselves with Visnu-N?r?yana. The remarkable portrait sculpture of the ruler Visnugupta (c. 640) in the guise of Visnu, with his two sons represented as the personified weapons, at Mrigasthali, Pas'upatin?tha, illustrate the early adoption of this personification cult.14 There survive to this day several Jagannatha temples in Kathmandu and Bhaktapur. The most well-known of these is prominently sited in the Kathmandu durbar square, directly in front of the Hanuman Dhoka. The Jagannatha temple is assigned to the patronage of Baladeva, Krsna and Subhadr?, although the inscription gives no clue as to their appearance; H.

The stone image is of Caturm?rti Visnu, sculptured according to s?stric conventions, indicating that this temple was initially dedicated to N?r?yana.15 A Jagann?tha cult room was subsequently added on the eastern side of the pradaksin?patha,16 and presumably the temple was known as the Jagann?tha temple from the time of this renovation. I am informed that this temple houses (presumably in the pradaksin? cult room) statues o? Krsna, Balar?ma and Subhadr? in a style similar to that of Puri.17 It is recorded in the Nepalese chronicles that in 1690 (N.S. 810) Jit?mitramalla, the king of Bhaktapur and his younger brother Ugramalla, visited Kathmandu at the invitation of its ruler Bh?p?lendramalla to celebrate the erecting of a finial on the roof of a newly constructed Jagann?tha temple.18 In Bhaktapur there is a Jagann?tha temple which reportedly houses stone images of Visnu, Subhadr? and Balar?ma executed in the classical style. Of particular interest is another Jagann?tha temple, situated in Bhaktapur's durbar square which, I have been informed, houses images of the Jagann?tha triad "similar to that of Puri".19 However, in 1986 I was able to identify three polychrome wooden sculptures which were displayed, unlabelled, in the Bhaktapur Wood Museum. They represent Jagann?tha, Subhadr? and Balar?ma (Fig. 2). I was informed that the sculptures had been presented by the priest of the Jagann?tha temple at Makhan-tol, Kathmandu, in December 1984. The priest informed the museum that the temple had "substituted the old statues with new ones exactly in the old design".20 The sculptures are approximately a metre in height and decorated directly onto the wood. Whilst broadly conforming to the conventions of the Puri Jagann?tha triad, they are altogether more anthropomorphic in their treatment. This is most noticeable in the more fully articulated shoulders and torso and the clearly defined legs rather than a single pillar. The characteristic truncated arms project horizontally to the left and right of the figure rather than forward. When dressed the arms of these images would be fully concealed, unlike those of Puri which project forward in a grim embrace. Jagann?tha's face is painted the characteristic black, Balar?ma white, and Subhadr? yellow. One major iconographie distinction which usually marks Jagann?tha apart from the other two figures is the treatment of the eyes, perhaps the most powerful and hypnotic feature of this extraordinary iconography: conventionally Jagann?tha's eyes are wide and round, whilst the others have large, almond-shaped eyes. This distinction is not observed in the Bhaktapur examples - all three figures have the round eyes of Jagann?tha. That these sculptures were deconsecrated images for which new images had been substituted is particularly revealing. It indicates that the rites of regeneration of images performed at Puri and at other Jagann?tha temples in Orissa,21 were still being observed in 15 M. S. Slusser, op. cit., pp. 189-90. 16 U. Wiesner, Nepalese Temple Architecture (Leiden, 1978), p. 28. 17 Personal communication, Shobha Shrestha, 1986. 18 D. R.

A. Eschmann et al. (New Delhi, 1978), p. 469.</page><page sequence="10">222 John Guy Kathmandu. Convention in Orissa requires that the ceremony for the re-making of the image, the navakalevara (New Body), should occur at regular intervals, in order to strengthen the image's divine energy. It is regarded as a dangerous ceremony, requiring the strictest observance of ritual procedures. L. S. O'Malley, writing in the Bengal District Gazetteers, Puri for 1908, observed that the frequency of the New Body ceremony depends "...on the durability of the wood of which the images are made". He recorded that "within the last sixty years, it has been celebrated [only] in 1853 and 1877 If the festival takes place at an interval of one yuga [12 years] or more, the images are entirely renewed, and the old ones buried in great secrecy ; but if there is a smaller interval of time, only a partial renovation is necessary".22 It would appear from the statement of the Kathmandu priest that some form of the revitalizing New Body ceremony was still performed in Nepal. If the Jagannatha temples in the Kathmandu valley observed the ritual calendar of the Jagannatha cult at Puri (as the performance of the New Body ceremony suggests) then these sculptures would have been subjected to two other major ceremonies which would have undoubtedly contributed to their physical deterioration. Both ceremonies are performed annually at Puri to regenerate the images. They are the sn?na y?tr?, "bathing festival", referred to earlier, in which the images are ritually washed on a bathing platform {sn?na edi) visible to devotees beyond the temple wall, and the ratha y?tr? or "car festival" in which the triad are transferred from the temple to mobile shrines for a ceremony lasting at least nine days. The ritual bathing is particularly damaging: after this the image is screened from view whilst the sculptures are "re-made" (i.e. re-painted). The ritual of washing, decorating and dressing represents their annual re-birth in readiness for the ratha y?tr?. The ratha y?tr? represents the highpoint in the ritual cycle of Jagannatha worship and is probably the best known of all Indian festivals. The massive processional chariots, often up to fifteen metres in height, are drawn through the streets by devotees whilst priests, travelling in the rathas, receive and bless offerings. In the Kathmandu valley chariot processions form a central part of religious ceremonial life. Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur each have major festivals in which mobile shrines are taken on processional routes linking ritually important sites.23 There is inscriptional evidence that a precursor of the Matsyendran?tha ceremony, referred to as the " j?tr? of Vugma-Lokes'vara", has been performed since at least the seventh century, when it was sanctioned by King Narendradeva.24 B. H. Hodgson, the second British Resident in Nepal, who lived in Kathmandu from 1819 until 1843, nas left records of his observation of many of the major festivals of the valley, including detailed drawings which he commissioned. A drawing of the procession of Matsyendran?tha illustrates the rathas being drawn through the streets of Patan with Svayambhunath, the most sacred and venerated of Buddhist sancturies in Nepal, visible in the background (Fig. 6). I know of no record 22 L. S. S. O'Malley, Bengal District Gazetteers, Puri (Calcutta, 1908), p. 105. 23 N. Gutschow, "Ritual Chariots of Nepal", AARP, XVI (London, 1979). 24 M. S. Slusser, op. cit., p. 368.

However, by the time of Hodgson's residence the Jagann?tha cult may have diminished in importance to a degree that its followers could not undertake such expensive celebrations. The Jagann?tha triad in the Bhaktapur Wood Museum provide evidence that at least the cult continued to be observed. The significance of these images is underscored by the fact that no sculptures of the Jagann?tha triad have hitherto been identified in Nepal, nor has their presence in the privacy of temple inner sanctuaries been referred to. The second source of new evidence for the Jagann?tha cult in Nepal is the painting on cloth depicting the Jagann?tha temple at Puri, acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum (Fig. i). It not only provides the earliest documented record of the cult in the valley (1670) but is also direct evidence of patronage of the cult by the royal household of Bhaktapur. The painting depicts the temple at Puri and the subsidiary temples within the compound in cross-section elevation, set in a schematized plan. The main sanctuary, beneath the sikhara, houses the holy triad, with the audience hall for pilgrims, the pillared hall (mandapa) for temple dancers and the offering halls visible to the east. Behind the main sanctuary, on the west elevation, is a shrine housing an image of Narasimha, the man-lion emanation of Visnu closely identified with the origins of Jagann?tha.25 The numerous minor shrines and other structures within the temple compound are faithfully recorded, including the bathing platform (sn?na vedi) and the three rautas. The ten incarnations (avataras) of Visnu are depicted in the upper register, and in the lower register portraits of the donors. The conventional nature of this composition can be judged by comparing it to Orissan paintings, which it faithfully follows (Fig. 7). This raises the question of the painting's authorship : was it painted in Nepal by a local, presumably Newari artist copying an imported model, or was it the work of a Puri-trained artist ? If it was the latter, which seems more probable, was the artist working in Nepal or in Puri ? There is every indication that the donor portraits, which are unquestionably in the Nepalese tradition, were added by a different hand. The inscriptions are of a uniform quality and, given their content to be discussed shortly, must also have been painted in Nepal. The evidence suggests therefore that this painting is most probably an import from Puri, to which has been added the donor group and inscriptions by a Newari artist. There is ample evidence of Puri paintings being produced for circulation throughout the pilgrimage network. R. L. Mitra, in his Antiquities of Orissa (1880) wrote that "it is the custom for every pilgrim returning from Puri to send a picture... to his friends and relatives".26 A major industry had grown up around the Puri temple, traditionally carried out by temple servants of the Maharana sub-caste, supplying such paintings and other souvenirs for sale to pilgrims, a practice continued to this day.27 A large-scale cloth painting of this quality is exceptional and may have been produced to order. 25 A. Eschmann, op. cit., pp. 173-5. 26 R. Mitra, The Antiquities of Orissa, 2 vols. (Calcutta, 1880), p. 136. 27 For an example of a Puri painting of this type collected in Udaipur, Rajasthan, see J.

John Guy The inscriptions are in Newari and not Oriya, with a passage of the inscription on the sikhara in Maithili. The main inscription appears on the upper section of the sikhara, and has been transliterated by Professor Siegried Lienhard as follows (Fig. 8) :28 s'r? 3 Jagann?th?ya namah / ?s?vari / [followed by a song in Maithili, then in Newari] sam[vat\ jgo bh?drasudi 14 s'r? 2 Jagatcandramalladebay?

[May it be] auspicious The ceremony of Ananta celebrates Visnu's repose on the "world snake" Ananta (Anant?s'?yana), symbolising the cosmic ocean, seen represented in the painting in a shrine directly above the offering hall. The painting records the performance of this ceremony by the donor Jagaccandramalla in honour of Ananta, the "endless, infinite", on the 14th day of the lunar fortnight (Catudasi) of August-September (Bh?dra), 1670. The identity of the patron Jagaccandramalla and the other members of the royal donor group is indicated by a caption which appears above each figure (Fig. 9). A close examination of the donor reveals a double-faced figure (Fig. 10), a remarkable visualization of the Nepalese tradition of double-rule, whereby a king and his minister (cautara) share power. Jagaccandramalla is in fact a syncretic name, combining that of King Jagatprak?samalla (r. 1643?72) and his minister Candras'ekhara-simha. The king recorded on a number of occasions his deep affection for his minister and even allowed Candrasekhara's name to appear on a Bhaktapur coin issued in 1662.29 In an inscription of 1667 Jagatprak?sa described his minister as being "as dear to him as his own life"30 and by the time this painting was commissioned in 1670 the syncretic title had clearly been adopted for recording public events. That this was a special occasion for Jagatprak?samalla is also evident from another source, revealed by Dr Horst Brinkhaus's research on the Maithili literature of Nepal : the song which appears in Maithili language in between the Newari passages has been located by Brinkhaus in a collection of songs of Jagaccandra, alias King Jagatprak?s'amalla and his minister Candras'ekhara-simha, establishing that their syncretic name was attached to such private activities as the composing of devotional verse. In the same manuscript appear two other songs in Maithili which record Jagatprak?s'amalla's ananta vrata (religious vow) which he had kept for nine years, when he was 33 years old in N.S. 790 bh?dra sudi caturdasi.31 This is precisely the date of the Jagannatha painting, which would suggest that this painting was intended to record the celebration of two linked religious events in the life of this pious ruler : the performance of the ceremony in honour of Ananta, and the ninth anniversary of Jagatprak?s'amalla's religious vows.

The figure is seated cross-legged and dressed in princely attire in the Rajput fashion, which had become de rigueur in Nepalese court circles of the late seventeenth century. The figure's right-hand face has mature sideburns and a moustache, whilst that facing left appears to be a more youthful complexion. The figure wears a conical-shaped peacock feather crown, which may be taken as an allusion to the subject's devotion to Krsna, whose crown is often decorated with peacock feathers. Two kneeling women, with raised arms, decorate the support, which rests on a double-lotus foot. Comparison of the sculpture with the donor figure of the Jagannatha painting is revealing : the two figures are similar to a remarkable degree. I would argue that this sculpture represents none other than Jagaccandra himself and should be dated to the latter part of Jagatprak?s'a's reign, contemporary with the 1670 painting. The remainder of the donor group are labelled but unfortunately these names are not all legible. The caption of the figure facing the ruler is erased but it may be assumed that it is that of the crown prince Jit?mitra, who was to succeed Jagatprak?s'a in 1672. This identification is supported by the next figure, clearly labelled as Ugramalla, the crown prince's younger brother.

Returning to the Jagannatha painting, the next figure in the donor group is Annap?rnalaksm?, Jagatprak?s'a's wife. The identity of the remaining four figures is unclear, though presumably immediate members of the Bhaktapur royal family. It is evident from the record of a visit by King Jit?mitramalla and his brother Ugramalla to Kathmandu in 1690 to join in the consecration of a new Jagannatha temple, that the royal households at both Bhaktapur and Kathmandu took a close interest in the Jagannatha cult. A century later, in 1797, Rana Bahadur Shah erected a Jagannatha temple in Kathmandu, situated today near the city jail.33 Yet despite the prominent position of temples dedicated to Jagannatha in both Kathmandu and Bhaktapur, and the royal attention they appear to have attracted in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, surprisingly little has been written about royal patronage of the cult. Whilst we do not yet have sufficient information to define precisely the significance of Jagannatha worship in Nepal, the evidence presented here may go some way to allowing a reassessment of its importance. 32 Reproduced in P.
