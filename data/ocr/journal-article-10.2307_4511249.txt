<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vol. XXXVII Recent Literature [75 1966 wintering distribution is discussed next. It is noteworthy that, although nigricans breeds as far west in the Soviet Arctic as the Taimyr Peninsula, the migration route passes down the east edge of the Pacific. The author chooses to view this as a mystery ("logic must be cast aside"), but it parallels the migration pattern of other recent avian colonists of Siberia, such as Grus canadensis and Hylocichla minima, and clearly indicates a North American origin for the Black Brant. Winter distribution is discussed more fully than breeding, where several important references are not cited. There is also a brief section of Asian records, but unfortunately no Soviet sources were consulted. Chapters three, titled "Distinctive Characteristics," includes wing structure and flight power, flight mannerisms, and feather wear, the substance of which is that brant, ocean-adapted, are among the fastest anserine fliers, but exhibit extreme plumage abrasion also. They are wary but gregarious, and easily decoyed if large spreads are set out. Voice and calls are discussed here, though with unnecessary anthropomorphism. A short chapter on feeding habits follows. When the brant are not breeding, they eat little besides sea lettuce (Ulva) and eel grass (Zostera), and the disasterous results of this near-monophagy is well-known in Atlantic brant populations However, the information given on eel grass disease is scanty, and most readers would want to know more. Another gap in this section is the lack of data on brant food habits during the breeding season. Having set the stage, the author proceeds to chronicle the life cycle of the brant, with detailed discussions of breeding behavior, mating, nesting, care of goslings, migration, and predation and other sources of mortality, including hunt- ing. The book closes with chapters on the brant as a game species, and discussions of current management practices, with recommendations for future changes. Einarsen concludes that although most native hunting is not a threat to brant populations, unregulated harvest near population centers such as Nome is po- tentially dangerous, and urges closed-season protection from Eskimo hunting in these places. Excessively large numbers of decoys, scull boats, and offshore blinds are hunting practices calling for prohibition or limitation. Most effective would be establishment of special brant refuges, with four sites recommended: nesting grounds on the Yukon Kuskokwim delta and migration and wintering areas at Izembek Bay, Alaska, Humboldt Bay, California, and the Scammons-Black Warrior lagoon complex in Baja California. Finally, the need for further intensive research on brant is made clear. The book is somewhat marred by contradiction and repetition. Thus we read on page 3, that "the first flight of the black brant marks the opening of the [spring] hunting season", and on page 11, that "it [brant] arrives there the latest of all the birds, after nearly all the other geese have passed." The lead sentence of Chapter 4 reads "Unlike most other waterfowl, the brant do not include a wide variety of both plant and animal matter in their diet" (p. 28). On the next page, the reader is again told "Unlike most other waterfowl, their diet does not include a wide variety of both plant and animal matter." Much of this distracting lack of ac- curacy and conciseness might be due to insufficient editorial care on the part of the publishers. I have only one other general criticism; the ink sketches scattered throughout the text are disappointing. In happy contrast, the photographs are of good quality and add much to the book's usefulness. In sum, although the reader must have patience with a certain amount of irrelevant, repetitive or contradictory detail, there is much interesting and val- uable material brought together in Einarsen's work.-Robert S. Hoffmann. 60. Birds in Florida. Edited by R. J. Longstreet. 1965. Trend House, Tampa. Illustrated. 176 pp. $4.95. This is apparently the fourth "edition" of the book, the first one appearing in 1931 as "Florida Birds: Biographies of Selected Species Occurring in Florida." The present volume differs little in format from the earlier issues except that Mr. Longstreet has attempted ". . . revision, adding and subtracting and. . . re-ordering the bird categories. . . ." It appears to me, how- ever, that the greatest improvement has been the addition of Sam Grimes' beauti- ful color plates, 32 of these. No doubt these illustrations will help to sell the book. Apparently, it has been the conception of the several authors of Birds in Florida that the general public is more interested in a few common birds than all the species occurring in the state. As stated in the foreword, "it was the original aim to present biographies of birds which the untrained observer would be likely</page><page sequence="2">76] Recent Literature Bird-Banding 761 Recent Literature January to see." Approximately 150 species are presented in the present work, only one- third of those listed in Sprunt's revision (1954) of Howell's Florida Bird Life. Usually each species account or "bird biography" contains miscellaneous informa- tion on identification, seasonal occurrence, migration, nesting, food, habitats, and habits. The combination of color plates, small number of species included, con- cise accounts, and perhaps other factors will make this an attractive book to the uncritical tourist and bird-watcher. It is, however, unfortunate to detect gross errors throughout the book Not only are some common names incorrect ("Ruby-Throated Kinglet") but also there are abundant factual errors. All grebes, even those found in Florida, don't have "short-cone-shaped bills." There is no definite evidence that the Sharp- shinned Hawk breeds in the state. Broad-winged Hawks are not in the family Falconidae. The Florida subspecies of the Sandhill Crane does not "breed only in Florida." To state that a towhee is "a bird without a single bad habit . . ." and is "on the honor roll of the U. S. Department of Agriculture as a defender of Florida truck crops . . ." is beyond my comprehension! Had these and many other errors and misspellings been corrected, the book would be far more attractive to this reviewer.-David W. Johnston. 61. The Birds of Shakespeare. James Edward Harting. 1965. A reprint of the first edition published in 1871. Argonaut, Inc. Chicago, Ill. 321pp. $7.50. Just 100 years ago Mr. Harting, an English lawyer and naturalist, started to write this book which occupied his "leisure hours for six years." This is one of a dozen books, written by him between 1866 and 1906; they are mostly on birds, two of them devoted to falconry. In this volume the author cites and explains innumer- able references to birds and other creatures in Shakespeare's writings. It is a treasure trove of pleasant, informative reading. Many ancient super- stitions, implied or referred to in the plays, are described and their authenticity debated. One opinion current in the plays is doubted by Mr. Harting, namely that snakes are deaf, but this belief was based on fact. In ancient times a vulture symbolized a compassionate person, "because during the 120 days of its nurture of its offspring, if food cannot be had, 'it opens its own thigh and permits the young to partake of the blood, so that they may not perish from want."' "The ecclesiasti- cal fathers transferred the Egyptian story from the vulture to the pelican." Curiously enough, though, the author accepts the fantastic notion, "current in olden times" and based on a verse in Job and another in the 147th Psalm, that Ravens fail to care for or feed their young until black feathers begin to appear on the latter (see review of Gwinner's paper; Bird-Banding, 36: 275-276, 1965). An appendix of 19 pages lists the ornithological allusions in all the plays and poems, while an index of 5 pages completes the volume. This unusual book in- spired our family to renew our acquaintance with Shakespeare's plays, a laudable activity in our over-busy, present day lives.-M. M. Nice. 62. John White and Edward Topsell / The First Water Colors of North American Birds. Edited by Thomas P. Harrison. 1964. University of Texas Press, Austin. 59 pp., 10 colored plates reproducing 19 water colors. $5.00. Were this book titled "Primitive Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Century Water Colors of American Birds by Unknown Artists Presumably Based on Nonextant Paintings by John White" I would be less critical of its content. Mr. Harrison's text gives a short history of Edward Topsell (1572-1625), a British clergyman, writer of tracts and author of "The Historie of Four footed Beastes," 1607; "The Historie of Serpents," 1608; and an unpublished manuscript "The Fowles of Heaven" (The Historie of Birdes) which now reposes in the Henry E. Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Pasted into this manuscript are 124 bird pic- tures, among them 9 water colors which Topsell calls "Virginia birds." Mr. Harrison writes next about John White (died 159?), artist with the Roanoke voyages (1584-90), also cartographer, surveyor, military engineer, governor of the lost colony on Roanoke Island, and grandfather of Virginia Dare, first child of English ancestry born in North America. Mr. Harrison then goes on to tell something about bird names, Indian and English, as used by Topsell and others in the 15th and 17th centuries. The remainder of the book is devoted to the reproductions of 19 primitive water-color paintings, 10 found in the possession of John White's descendants a hundred years after his death and purported to be copies made by an unknown hand of some of John White's work.
