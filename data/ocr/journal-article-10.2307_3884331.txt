Zool., 40:847-852 (2000) Animal Consciousness: Some Historical Perspective1 Harriet Ritvo2 History Faculty, E51-285, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge Massachusetts 02139 Synopsis. A monodimensional understanding of both the past and the present has often characterized the historical background provided for scientific disci? plines. It scans the past for the antecedents of the current cutting edge. But estab- lishing such genealogical connections is difficult, even on the level of terminology. For example, neither "animal" nor "consciousness" has ever been defined without contention. The main current (and past) problem with the term "animal" is tax? onomic: does it include people or not? and if so, are people included in only their physical aspect or in some more encompassing sense? An examination of 18th and 19th-century taxonomical treatments of the great apes shows how convictions and uncertainties on these issues were expressed through classification. With regard to "consciousness" the main problem has been whether that term refers to something shared by humans and other species. An examination of 19th-century attempts to claim that non-primates like the dog resembled humans more closely than did apes shows that this issue too reflects scientific as well as lay discomfort at the awkward proximity of other primates. A final problem with establishing scientific genealogies is that they often assume past consensus among experts on issues where there was actually intense disagreement, complicated by the difficulty of deciding who the experts actually were two or three centuries ago. None of these problems has com? pletely disappeared even now. Historical background is often under? stood to mean a survey of the past, in order to show how it prepared the way for the present state of the field (whatever field may happen to be under discussion)?in other words, a kind of intellectual geneal- ogy or search for ancestors. And such an overview is a fine thing to have, certainly, for various reasons. It illustrates the deep historical roots and resonances of even the most up-to-the-minute research, an aspect of their work that investigators focused on novelty and originality are apt to overlook. Further, an appreciation of the difficulties posed to able investigators of earlier peri? ods by problems whose solutions retrospec- tively seem simple or obvious or even be- side the point may encourage us to reflect on the way we have formulated and as? sessed the challenges that we face now. Fi? nally, such straightforward recapitulation 1 From the Symposium Animal Consciousness: His? torical, Theoretical, and Empirical Perspectives pre? sented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Inte? grative and Comparative Biology, 6-10 January 1999, at Denver, Colorado. 2 E-Mail: hnritvo@mit.edu allows the apportionment of credit where credit is due. There is no question that we all (even historians, who tend not to be so strongly committed as scientists to a pro? gressive understanding of our discipline) stand on the shoulders of our predecessors. But, as is the case with most attempts to make sense of large and disparate bodies of information, the illumination that such a retrospective account provides inevitably has its (literally) dark side. That is, by drawing our attention to the activities and accom? plishments of some predecessors, it diverts our attention from others. Think, for exam? ple, of the metaphor I have just invoked (not my own, I hasten to add)?that is, of current investigators standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before them. This met? aphor compares intellectual progress either to a kind of acrobatic performance or to the way that parents sometimes hoist their chil- dren to give them a clearer view. It rightly emphasizes the long (often ancient) pedigree of even the newest insights. But at the same time it offers several misleading sugges- tions?most forcefully, that there is a single line of descent that leads from the past cut- 847</page><page sequence="2">848 Harriet Ritvo ting edge to the present cutting edge (apol- ogies for that mixed metaphor), but also, for example, that the work that seems most at? tractive to us as we look back was most highly esteemed by contemporaries, and that, even where this was the case, it was appreciated for the same qualities or char? acteristics that make it appeal to us. In sum, it suggests that the past can be understood simply as the forerunner of the present. In this suggestion, it is coherent with most of the other metaphors that condition our un? derstanding of the intellectual history of our current pursuits?for example the metaphor of genealogy or descent that I have already mentioned. But now I would like to further suggest a somewhat crossgrained extension of this metaphor: that is, to put it in a nut- shell, it is wise discipline that can recognize its own forebears. Let me state this point in a different way: the reductiveness of the usual kind of "his? torical background" has its appeal, and also its utility. "Potted history" (another term for the same thing) tends to be easily con- sumable, both because it is brief and un- complicated, and also, often, because it flat- ters both its intended audience and the pre- conceptions cherished by that audience. But it also can be significantly misleading?and not just about the past. The monodimen- sional understanding retroactively imposed on the past tends to characterize our under? standing of the present as well. For exam? ple, current debates about animal con? sciousness, among others, are also condi- tioned by the assumption that the stakes are absolute. Positions are understood to be ei? ther right or wrong, and the consequence of their rightness or wrongness is understood to be either intellectual survival or intellec? tual extinction. If we look back, however, we see that, at least in the past, such clarity has not been the rule. I would like to pro- pose a somewhat expanded notion of his? torical background?one that points at the variety of past understandings of animal consciousness, the diversity of causes that made people embrace or reject them, and the difficulty of deciding which ones to privilege as our precursors. Of course, as soon as we begin to look at the past of any modern field of endeavor we encounter a basic problem of historical evidence and interpretation?that of lan? guage or definition. Both the terms in the title of this symposium?that is "animal" and "consciousness"?are contentious at present. They cannot be defined without reference to ideology. And they have been equally and analogously contentious in the past. At issue?whether explicitly or im- plicitly, whether in philosophical or reli- gious terms?is the position of human be- ings within the order of creation. Can we stand to see ourselves as less than singular, and, if not, why not? Aside from this weighty complication, there are more ordi- nary difficulties?difficulties that compli- cate the work of understanding all pre-con- temporary texts. A century or two is time enough at least to alter the connotation of most words, even if they retain their form and their ostensible reference. And often enough, they do not retain their ostensible reference. That is, they may shift in deno- tation?in literal meaning?as well as con? notation; or their place may be taken by completely different terms. The words in the symposium title exemplify both these possibilities (subtle shift and replacement). The main current problem with the term "animal" is taxonomic: does it include peo? ple, and if so, are people included in only their physical aspect or in some more en? compassing sense. This problem is embed? ded in deep etymology, since "animal" de- scends from the Latin word "anima," the varied meanings of which include "breath" "life" "soul" and "mind." In the eigh? teenth and nineteenth centuries the line be? tween people and other animals was both more and less starkly drawn than it is at present. Both convictions and uncertainties were expressed through classification. En- lightenment naturalists often recognized not only the general correspondence between people and what were then known as quad- rupeds, but also the more striking similari? ties that human beings shared with apes and monkeys. For example, in his 1699 treatise on the chimpanzee (which he called the orang-utan or pygmy) the anatomist Ed- ward Tyson implicitly included humanity in the animal series. (Tyson, n. pag.) His choice of terminology further implied that</page><page sequence="3">Historical Perspecive 849 the categories of "human" and "orangu- tan" might not be completely distinct. His Latin term for the creature was "Homo Syl- vestris" or "wild man of the woods," and, conversely, the humanity of the quasi-myth- ical pygmies had long been the subject of European speculation. Even at the end of the eighteenth century, naturalists could claim that pygmies were "nothing more than a species of apes . . . that resemble us but very imperfectly." (Historical Miscel- lanyy ca. 1800, III, pp. 288-289) (When thinking about the boundaries of humanity in earlier periods it is also well to remember that until relatively recently opinion was sharply divided about whether everyone now included in Homo sapiens was fully human.) The celebrated eighteenth-century sys- tematizer Carolus Linnaeus also located people firmly within the animal kingdom, constructing the primate order to accom? modate humans, apes, monkeys, prosimi- ans, and bats. And this taxonomic connec? tion was not necessarily confined to the realm of abstraction; through passion or sentiment it might be embodied in living flesh. Thus at the end of the eighteenth-cen? tury the naturalist Charles White reported that orangutans "have been known to carry off negro-boys, girls and even women . . . as objects of brutal passion" and that it was rumored "that women have had off? spring from such connection." (White, 1799, p. 34) In the realm where the interest of specialists overlapped with that of a broader public, claims might be less guard- ed. Half a century later, a Victorian impre- sario advertised the merely hairy Julia Pas- trana as "a hybrid, wherein the nature of woman predominates over the ourang-out- angs." (Bondeson and Miles, 1993, p. 199) A Laotian girl was exhibited in 1883 as "Darwin's missing link," not only because she was unusually hairy, but because she allegedly possessed prehensile feet and could pout like a chimpanzee. (Howard, 1997, pp. 56-57) The portrayal of apes as particularly hu? man in appearance and behavior extended this implicit assault on the human-animal boundary. Iilustrations in works of natural history frequently showed apes assuming erect posture, using human tools, and ap? proximating human proportions in the trunk and limbs. The chimpanzees and orangu- tans who were predictable features of nine- teenth-century zoos and menageries ate with table utensils, sipped tea from cups, and slept under blankets. An orangutan who lived in London's Exeter Change Menag- erie amused herself by carefully turning the pages of an illustrated book. At the Re- gent's Park Zoo a chimpanzee named Jenny regularly appeared in a flannel nightgown and robe. Consul, a young chimpanzee who lived in Manchester's Belle Vue Zoological Gardens at the end of the nineteenth cen? tury dressed in a jacket and straw hat, smoked cigarettes, and drank his liquor from a glass. (Peel, 1903, pp. 205-206; "Consul," n. pag.] If the term "animal" has been the subject of subtle shifts, the term "consciousness" is the most recent in a series of replacements. In the nineteenth century, for example, most discussion of the mental qualities of animals took place under the rubrics of "intelli- gence" and "sagacity." Then as now, such discussions were not merely descriptive; af? ter all, intelligence and sagacity are no easier to pin down than is consciousness. The qual? ity or qualities under consideration, however denominated and defined, were the focus of particular interest because they contributed both to a ranking of non-human animals among themselves and to a consideration of how closely they approached the human condition. One way of denying the human- ape connection?as of denying the connec? tion between human groups?was to posit an alternative alliance. If non-primate ani? mals resembled humans more closely than did apes, then they would necessarily dis- place apes from their awkward proximity. Thus, throughout the nineteenth century nat- uralists debated the rival claims of dogs and apes to be top animal, and therefore closest to humankind. In 1881, for example, George J. Romanes, a close friend of Darwin's with a special interest in animal behavior, cele- brated the "high intelligence" and "gregar? ious instincts" of the dog, which, he argued, gave it a more "massive as well as more complex" psychology than any member of the monkey family. (G. Romanes, 1896, p.</page><page sequence="4">850 Harriet Ritvo 439) Two years later Romanes revised his ranking slightly, including both dogs and apes on level twenty-eight of his famous fif- ty-step ladder of intellectual development. Level twenty-eight was characterized by "indefinite morality" along with the capac? ity to experience shame, remorse, deceit, and the ludicrous. (To give some sense of the scale: steps twenty-nine through fifty were reserved for human beings, while worms and insect larva occupied step eighteen be? cause they possessed primary instincts and could feel the emotions of surprise and fear.) Although this schema gaves apes and dogs equivalent rank, Romanes was far from thinking that they possessed identical mental attributes. Rather the ape had achieved its high status through intellect, the dog on ac? count of highly developed emotions. (G. Ro? manes, 1883, p. 352, inset) At issue was how to define animal intel- ligence?if, indeed, animals could be said to possess intelligence at all. Some nine- teenth-century naturalists denied that ani? mals possessed any mental qualities besides instincts. A correspondent of the Zoological Journal asserted that although dogs and other animals exhibited behavior that close? ly mimicked such qualities as foresight, in- dustry, and justice, in fact they were merely performing reflex actions, like Descartes's animal machines. [French, 1824, pp. 2, 9] Most investigators were more generous, however, allowing the higher animals a grab bag of intellectual and emotional at? tributes. One representative inventory in? cluded imagination, memory, homesick- ness, self-consciousness, joy, rage, terror, compassion, envy, cruelty, fidelity, and at? tachment. (See Thompson 1851] An index of the mix of mental qualities that naturalists valued in animals?and per? haps also of their desire to distinguish clear? ly between animal and human mental capac? ities?was the fact that well into the last part ofthe nineteenth century "sagacity" was the standard term for intelligence demonstrated by animals. An individual animal or species might be described as "intelligent," but the term "intelligence" itself was generally re? served for strictly human capacities. (Con? versely, if "sagacity" was attributed to hu? man beings, it often had an ironic or less than flattering connotation.) The phrase "an? imal sagacity" in the title of a book or article often signaled an abstract discussion of in- stinct or intellect, the kind of discussion that might conclude by appreciating the intelli? gence of apes. But in the more common us? age of naturalists, sagacity indicated not the ability to manipulate mechanical contrap- tions or solve logical problems, but a more diffuse kind of mental power: the ability to adapt to human surroundings and to please people. A somewhat circular calculation made the most sagacious animals the best servants. So dogs might not only rival apes in the mental competition, but surpass them?closest to their masters in mind as well as in domicile. And since the alternative closeness thus constructed was clearly figu- rative, the whole animal creation was there? by implicitly removed to a more comfortable distance. Even if we leave questions of definition aside, we find another source of confusion in retrieving the history of a discipline. It is customary to speak in chronological gen- eralizations?people thought this way in the Enlightenment, and that way in the Victo- rian period. But such generalizations beg important questions. They assume consen? sus?almost always an unwarranted as? sumption?and therefore require the selec? tion of one among competing voices. It is worth asking on what basis such selection is made?how can we teil in retrospect who best represents a bygone era? Or, to put it in a different way, how do we decide whose opinions are most worth recalling? For ex? ample, with regard to the taxonomic story I have been recounting about the physical and behavioral resemblances between peo? ple and other animals: not everybody was persuaded by Tyson and Linnaeus, or even, later, by Darwin, Jenny, and Consul. Com- mitments that were explicitly or essentially theological made many naturalists reluctant to embed their own species within the sys? tem of animal connections. And if physical resemblances were undeniable, that made it more important to defend the less tangible ground of mentation or behavior. Despite Linnaeus's sanctified status as a systematiz- er, his inclusive primate order was frequent? ly rejected. According to the late eigh-</page><page sequence="5">Historical Perspecive 851 teenth-century naturalist Thomas Pennant, "my vanity will not suffer me to rank man- kind with Apes, Monkies, Maucaucos, and Bats"', a contemporary similarly asserted that "we may perhaps be pardoned for the repugnance we feel to place the monkey at the head of the brute creation, and thus to associate him. . . with man." (Pennant, 1793, p. iv; Wood, 1807, p. xvii) As evolutionary theory suggested a more concrete and ineluctable connection, it pro- voked still more forceful resistance. After On the Origin of Species was published in 1859, for example, the geologist Adam Sedgwick, who had been one of Darwin's early scientific mentors at Cambridge, as? serted that "we cannot speculate on man's position in the actual world of nature . . . while we keep his highest faculties out of our sight. Strip him of these faculties, and he becomes entirely bestial." (Quoted in Hull, 1973, pp. 164-165) As Darwin sadly noted at the end of The Descent of Man, "The main conclusion arrived at in this work, namely that man is descended from some lowly-organised form, will, I re- gret to think, be highly distasteful to many persons." (Darwin, 1950, p. 919) Given this diversity of opinion within the com? munity of experts it is difficult to identify any particular view as particularly charac? teristic of the Enlightenment or of the nine- teenth century. This is even true of one of the most fre- quently cited such views. We are accus- tomed to see Descartes and his above-men- tioned animal machines as icons of the En? lightenment, along with Newton and his gravitational apple. For example Ernst Mayr, who has no love for "Descartes's crass mechanism" and who notes with pleasure the many critics of the biological aspects of his work, credits him with "the spread of the mechanistic world picture," and asserts that his claims "that organisms are merely automata" have "created a millstone around the neck of biology, the effects of which have carried through to the end of the nine- teenth century." (Mayr, 1982, p. 97) But it is difficult to know why this position should be regarded as either especially typical of its period or uniquely ancestral to modern atti- tudes. Although it gave rise to (or served as justification for) many spectacular practices, which have leant themselves to reproduction as part of "the rise of experimental science," there was a great deal of demurral among his contemporaries, both specialists and members of the interested general public. (Even members of the general public willing and even eager to inflict pain on animals? enthusiasts of badger baiting, fox hunting and other blood sports?did not think that their victims could not feel it; on the con- trary they often reveled in the fact that they did.) Sometimes this resistance was ex? pressed formally, in the ripostes offered by investigators with greater experience of ac? tual animals. (Boakes, 1984, ch. 4) Some? times it was expressed informally, as when spectators at public demonstrations quietly put the animal subjects out of their misery. And although this assertion can be seen as at the foundation of subsequent use of ani? mals in experimentation, not all experiment- ers have been persuaded by it?and it also led to or justified many procedures that mod? ern researchers find both shocking and silly. Indeed, this particular case illustrates yet an? other recurrent problem of historical retriev- al. When we look back, it can be difficult to decide who are the experts. With regard to the formal (taxonomic) relations that I have been discussing, the experts are mostly rec- ognizable in modern terms-they were self styled as naturalists if not as biologists or zoologists. But with regard to the sensibility of animals, a much wider circle of people has always felt able to speak with authority. It is not clear why Descartes rather than Bentham or some other like-minded philo- sophe should be regarded as ancestral au? thority on such matters, and it is salutary to consider the somewhat different potted his? tory of ideas about animal sensation offered by people whose major commitment is to the protection of animals, rather than to the increase of zoological knowledge. Perhaps the modern study of animal consciousness should trace itself as much to the protesters as to the experimenters. That is, at least, if ancestry is determined by shared content as well as by shared form. This brings us to another complicat- ing determinant of how we read our past? which perhaps could be characterized as so-</page><page sequence="6">852 Harriet Ritvo cial rather than political. Descartes may be the preferred progenitor because he was sci? entific in his methods, at least some of them. This reading recapitulates a protract- ed effort within the study of animal con? sciousness?as within most other disci? plines that fell within the nineteenth-cen- tury rubric of natural history?to east out the amateurs, the people who were accused of wasting time in journals and at meetings with unsystematically recorded anecdotes about the intellectual and moral capacities of their anthropomorphic dogs, cats, and horses. This effort was characterized in terms of physics envy-such people and practices interfered with the attempt of what ultimately became known as animal psychology to become properly "scientif? ic." This explanation is more persuasive if we look at the sinners than if we look at their judges; from a late twentieth-century perspective they can be hard to distinguish. For example, although Romanes repeatedly warned of the pitfalls of anecdotal obser? vation, he used his favorite terrier to illus? trated the "exalted level to which sympathy had attained" and the "intelligent affection from which it springs" in the dog. (G. Ro? manes, 1896, p. vii; G. Romanes, 1883, pp. 234-235, 240; E. Romanes, 1894, p. 15) Conwy Lloyd Morgan described his obser? vations of his own fox terrier as well as of several dogs belonging to friends (not to speak of a young chicken named Blackie) as experiments. (Lloyd Morgan, 1900, pp. 141-143; Lloyd Morgan, 1893, pp. 227- 228) And, in any case, the kind of infor? mation that had been excluded as anecdot- alism reemerged in a more respectable form within a only few decades as ethology. Re? search about animal consciousness still comes from a range of disciplinary and sub- disciplinary sources. It may be worth ask- ing whether similar questions of sociology still influence relations between exponents of these various approaches. So if we look back we can see a lot of confusion. The past is as variable as the fu? ture, although for different reasons?and we tend to construct or project it to suit our pre? sent needs. It is at least interesting that as information has accumulated about the men- tation of other animals, there has been no significant reduction in the ways in which that information is interpreted?in the range of opinions about what goes on in our heads and in those of our mammalian and avian kin. It seems unlikely that this diversity can be explained in terms of reductive rightness or wrongness, any more than can analogous diversity in the past. So maybe it would pro? duce additional clarity, as well as additional confusion, to try to recognize the religious, philosophical, political, and sociological commitments that inevitably supplement the scientific ones in current debate.
