<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> f i f t e e n Caves and Art rites of initiAtion And trAnsCendenCe In a previous chapter in this volume, I discussed some of  the evidence that leads to  the recognition that certain precincts in Paleolithic sites with or without decorations  are truly sanctuaries, citing cases from Cueva Morín, the Cueva del Juyo, and the  Great Ceiling at Altamira. But the evidence I presented for Altamira was incomplete.  The cave and its decorations provide a more extensive demonstration of  its unique- ness and the propriety of  calling it a sanctuary in its integrity. In its decorations, the  Great Ceiling bears a symbolic relationship to the depictions in the Final Gallery of   the cave (also called the Cola de Caballo) that is so striking that it can only have been  intentional. The central galleries at Altamira seem to serve as a sort of  symbolic  bridge between the decoratively richer galleries near the vestibule and the final re- cesses of  the cavern. What is more, some of  these details suggest that the Altamira  sanctuary was the locus of  periodic rites of  transition or initiation. Before we can  evaluate this suggestion, it will be necessary to complete the description of  the gal- leries of  Altamira and their depictions (Freeman and González Echegaray 2001).  AltAmirA’s CentrAl GAlleries As one goes beyond the Great Ceiling into the central galleries of  the cave, finger-  engraved meanders appear on the ceiling. Another set of  meanders was part of  a  329 </page> <page sequence="2"> 330 CAves And Art fallen frieze further on, where it may perhaps mark a break in the continuity of  de- picted subject matter. Animals in this area are represented by finger engravings, by  engraving with a sharp implement, or by painting, and there seems to be no differ- ence in the selection of  species represented in each technique. The series of  animal  depictions begins with digital engravings of  wild oxen, followed by the true engrav- ing of  a hind. Engraved horses and deer and one large bison occupy the next gallery  in the sequence. Black horses are followed by the red scalariforms of  the “Rincón  de los Tectiformes”; its end is marked by a large patch of  red paint. Along the sides  of  the main gallery there were friezes (one of  which is now partly collapsed), with  engravings of  horses, deer (stags as well as hinds), an anthropomorph, and more  meanders. Further on, when the corridor turns sharply, engravings of  deer vanish as if  by  magic, not to reappear until the Cola de Caballo. We find engraved figures of  wild  oxen and goats, and black drawings of  horses and bison, but no deer. Black ibex are  added to those animals as we pass along the next gallery, when at last the hind also  reappears, but only as a single head in black outline. Black horses are found with  the first enigmatic black marks (like those in the walls of  the Final Gallery) and  along the irregular wall we find the first “masks,” in this case less well defined than  they are in the Cola de Caballo. In these intermediate galleries, the figures and their  relationships correspond more and more closely to the symbols and organization  of  the Final Gallery as we progress in the direction of  that gallery from the Great  Ceiling.  AltAmirA’s f inAl GAllery:  the ColA de CAbAllo When we began our part in the 1980s reevaluation of  Altamira and its depictions,  we chose to invest a great deal of  effort in a reexamination of  the Final Gallery of   the cave. (The methods we employed are described in great detail, with our conclu- sions, in an earlier report [Freeman et al. 1987].) This gallery, also called the “Cola de  Caballo” from its fancied resemblance to that appendage, has a number of  charac- teristics that make it an ideal laboratory for the testing of  recording methods and the  development of  analytical techniques concerning the importance of  positioning and  relationship in the organization of  Paleolithic art. It could be studied as an “isolate”  (though we now know that it is not unrelated to other parts of  the cave), and it is  small enough ( just 70 meters long, usually less than 2 meters wide, and sometimes  even narrower, and from less than a meter to about 2 meters in height) so that it  could be examined completely in a reasonable time. An adult can usually touch the  walls on either side without having to move from the middle of  the track. In addition  to these spatial constraints, the gallery is richly decorated, with fingertip meanders,  deep and fine-line engraving, and black drawings, some representing animals, others  depicting complex geometric figures, and others that are just “marks.” Its size and  the shape of  its corridors naturally constrained the ways the Paleolithic artist could  place the decorations, as well as the ways they would later be viewed or studied.  The gallery makes many sharp bends that divide its topography into clearly distinct  </page> <page sequence="3"> sections. The walls and ceiling of  the gallery are highly irregular, covered with pro- jections and crevices that provide a large number of  surfaces suitable for decoration,  and these irregularities keep many of  the figures from being seen from anywhere but  one strategic viewpoint. These characteristics make it possible to deduce where the  Stone Age artist or viewer stood (or crouched, or lay) to produce or see such figures,  and in what direction he or she must have been looking at the time. Since there is  only one way into the gallery, and one way out following the same track, we can  even establish the most probable order in which most of  the figures were intended to  be seen, to determine which were seen entering and which were only visible on the  return trip. Of  course, this is much harder, usually impossible, for larger, more open  spaces. Our first step was to produce an accurate map of  the Final Gallery, locating  on it each and every figure we detected. The twists, bends, and irregularities of  this gallery subdivide it into six distinct  segments or corridors, that we have given names. With one exception (the “Empty  Corridor”) each of  them contains decorations, including a total of  74 masses of   undecipherable charcoal lines and patches. The other depictions are one positive  handprint in black, two patches of  finger meanders (one that is an extension of  the  meanders at the entry into the first five meters of  the first corridor), several black  tectiforms, several engravings including both geometrics and the figures of  five bi- son, eighteen deer, two horses, and three supposed “goats,” as well as three black  outline drawings, all of  which seem to portray horses. The positive handprint, near  the end of  the first patch of  “macaroni,” is that of  a youngster’s left hand, which  from its outline may have worn a glove. There are also some indeterminate figures  that may be clumsy or unfinished attempts to represent unidentifiable animals. One  of  the fine-line engravings, a bison, had been partly completed by the addition of   black lines to form its haunch and foreleg, suggesting that the engravings and black  line drawings in this gallery are most probably contemporaneous. A series of  large  projections from either wall of  the Final Gallery, uncannily suggestive of  the heads  of  humans or bison, has been minimally altered by engraving, pecking, or the ad- dition of  black lines, to enhance the resemblance. These are the so-called masks at  Altamira. So far, nine certain masks are known from the Gallery. The Empty Corridor splits these representations into two series. The two gal- leries nearer the entry are the Bison Gallery, where all three engraved animals are  bison, and the Low Gallery, where there are four engraved animals on the ceiling, all  stags, and two black outlines of  horses, one on the right wall, the other on a block  projecting from the floor. No engraved horses appear between the entry and the  Empty Corridor. The Low Gallery ends with an engraved “geometric” figure on the  ceiling, and near it, in a lateral fissure on the left wall of  the corridor, there are more  finger-engraved meanders. Beyond the Empty Corridor comes a complex corridor consisting of  our Gallery  of  Tectiforms and a wider room at its end called the Chamber of  Masks. The former  contains two groups of  black tectiforms, each accompanied by spider-like figures  (circular or oval figures with lines radiating outward) next to recesses in the right  wall of  the corridor, and a third engraved geometric a few meters farther on. Aside  CAves And Art 331 </page> <page sequence="4"> 332 CAves And Art from two horses, one of  which is among the finest engravings in the cave, the other  engraved figures in this unit are three bison, including a pair of  animals shown en- gaging in stereotyped breeding ritual, the female mounting the male. The last cor- ridor is the Cervid Gallery. It becomes so low and narrow that one must lie flat to  wriggle through it until it finally becomes impassible. There are fourteen figures of   deer, including two stags and twelve hinds, and three other animals interpreted as  goats, though they may be yearling stags instead. It is important to note that in each  series, the one before and that after the Empty Corridor, representations of  bison  come first, with deer present only in the innermost part of  each.  fiGure distribution in the f inAl GAllery There is much more evidence, if  that were needed, that the distribution of  figures in  the Final Gallery is organized rather than haphazard, and that their placement cor- responds to a carefully executed plan followed by all the artists. The divisions we de- tected evidently provided the framework for this symbolic pattern. Even the appar- ently random black marks obey its dictates. In the first part of  the Final Gallery, there  are about twice as many of  these patches of  linear marks on the left wall as on the  right (20 as opposed to 12). Beyond the Empty Corridor, this lateral distribution is re- versed, with about twice as many on the right (26) as on the left (16). The difference  is statistically significant: the likelihood that the reversal of  proportions is accidental  is less than 0.05 (less likely than one chance in twenty). There are so many of  them,  and they are often so far from the few black drawings, that the explanation that the  black marks may result from the artists’ sharpening their charcoal crayons as they  worked is also unreasonable, and another alternative, that they were used to blaze a  trail to be followed, is ridiculous for a corridor where there is only one possible route  in and out. Other practical reasons for the distributions have been considered, and all  rejected, leaving the conclusion that their organization is simply a reflection of  the  intentional symbolic organization of  space. Other evidence for lateral differentiation  comes from the placement of  the engraved bison and the painted geometrics, all  on the right wall of  the Gallery. All but one of  the hinds’ heads are also on the right  wall of  the Gallery, an apparent reflection of  the fact that these figures occupied a  symbolic position that was somehow complementary to that of  the bison. However, the most revealing evidence of  deliberate organization of  the deco- rations is the differential distribution of  engravings of  bison on the one hand and  deer on the other. In corridors where bison are found, there are never any deer, and  (of  course) where there are deer there are no bison. It is remarkable to us that this  mutual exclusion, which seems so obvious, was not detected before. It is all that is  needed to show that, in the Final Gallery, cervids and bison stand symbolically in  equivalent positions in a system of  complementary opposition. Contrary to Leroi- Gourhan’s interpretation (1964), the ubiquitous horse does not seem to occupy any  particular place in this system. Figures of  horses are represented in every technical  style known in the site: polychromes, red outlines, black outlines, and engravings.  Since horses are found next to both the animals that are at the poles of  the comple- </page> <page sequence="5"> mentary opposition, it is unlikely that they are themselves part of  either group more  than the other. Other details of  the size, positioning, and distribution of  the representations  help complete this interpretation. First of  all, while the density of  depictions of  deer  increases as we go deeper into the gallery, bison are if  anything more numerous to- ward the cave entry. This difference of  focus is underlined by the fact that all but one  of  the bison actually face the entry, while all but three of  the deer face into the Final  Gallery. All the engraved bison without exception are whole animals, but only six of   the deer (five of  them males) are whole: the other twelve are represented by heads  or heads and necks alone. The bison are represented as proportionally larger in scale  than the deer: only seven of  the deer might be called “large” if  we are generous in  our usage, but all six of  the bison are “large” by the same standard. The degree of   aggregation represented also differentiates the two species. Except for one case (a  pair of  bison engaged in pre-copulatory behavior, the female mounting the male),  individual engravings of  bison are always some meters distant from each other (a  minimum of  2.5 meters, an average of  11). Engraved deer, on the other hand, al- ways appear in groups. True, the two major concentrations are separated by more  than 30 meters. But within either concentration, that in the Low Gallery or that in  the Cervid Gallery, the average distance between individual engravings on the same  wall is just over 1 meter, and the closest non-superimposed figures actually touch.  In the Cervid Gallery, the distance between any engraved deer and another on the  opposite wall may be as little as 1 meter and is never greater than a meter and a half.  These observations all reinforce the interpretation of  bison and deer as symbolically  related by the principle of  complementary opposition. Possible correlates of  the symbolic opposition of  deer and bison that would  have been meaningful to prehistoric hunters are not hard to find. The fact that rep- resentations of  deer far outnumber those of  bison is in accord with the archeologi- cal evidence from Altamira’s Paleolithic levels, where the most abundant mammal  bones are those of  red deer. Deer were probably a more frequent prey, and a more  frequent dietary item, than were bison (and deer were certainly more common than  bison in the landscape). Deer and bison contrast markedly in behavior, as well. Deer  remain hidden as much as possible, do not move about much during the day, and  (except during the rut) are timid, skittish, and difficult to approach. Bison, on the  other hand, are ordinarily highly visible animals, and are active during the day. Deer  fall prey to wolves and other large predators quite frequently, while adult bison are  such large, powerful creatures that herds are relatively untroubled by non-human  predators. Descriptions of  techniques used in the bison hunt by Plains Indians before  the introduction of  the horse and firearms indicate that the animals allowed stealthy  hunters (sometimes disguised in wolf- or deerskins) to approach nearly within arm’s  reach of  them before moving away. (Hunters armed with spears or bows sometimes  approached the herd concealed behind horses, when they had them.) There was  in fact a quite peculiar relationship between these majestic beasts and their human  hunters, involving aspects of  prey behavior and techniques and organization of  the  hunt, that clearly differentiate deer from bison as subjects for physical, mental, and  CAves And Art 333 </page> <page sequence="6"> 334 CAves And Art cultural manipulation. The analogical relationship of  people and bison in the art of   the Final Gallery suggests that people thought of  themselves, as well as the bison, as  essentially unthreatened, dominant creatures of  their kind in a usually predictable  and benevolent environment.  the mAsks in the f inAl GAllery There is one other kind of  decoration in the Final Gallery, the eerie, minimally  retouched natural projections that are conventionally called “masks.” They are in  many ways the most remarkable of  the decorations in the Final Gallery. These are  natural head-like projections from the cave wall that resemble face-on or profile  heads of  men or animals. Each of  them has been deliberately modified to make their  naturally suggestive appearance still more evocative, just as was the case for the face  in the sanctuary at el Juyo. In the course of  our investigations, we discovered six of   these figures, which when added to the three already known raises the total to nine.  The presence of  masks is not restricted to Altamira among Cantabrian sites. There is  a particularly fine example of  a large mask representing the profile of  a bison in the  cave of  Castillo. A smaller, frontally viewed face of  a small horned animal was also  found in the same site (Alcalde del Río, Breuil, and Sierra 1912: esp. fig. 144, lams. 62,  85, 86), next to what may be yet a third such figure. Most of  the masks at Altamira are clearly intended to represent bison. One is  the frontal view of  a human face. There are also three that while apparently repre- senting bison also suggest human features, or, in one case, represent a hybrid figure  that from one viewpoint is a bison, but becomes very man-like when viewed from a  different perspective. The conclusion is inescapable that the artists intended to rep- resent a transformational series, including figures that are bison in every respect, fig- ures that are wholly human, and hybrid figures that establish a symbolic equivalence  between the two species. Masks are related in both subject matter and frequency to other depictions in  the Final Gallery. The relationship between the engraved whole bison and the bison  masks is in many ways analogous to the relationship between whole engraved deer  and engravings of  deer heads. If  the masks are included in the count of  bison figures,  however, the density of  depictions of  bison increases from the Bison Gallery to the  Chamber of  the Masks, just as the deer increase from the Low Gallery to the Cervid  Gallery. Beyond the Empty Corridor, the ratio of  heads to whole deer is 9 to 5, while  the ratio of  masks to whole bison is 5 to 3. The difference between the ratios is neg- ligible. Near identity in proportions in this case confirms the postulated correspon- dence, leading us to conclude that consciously or not, the Paleolithic artists intended  these figures to be compared, weighing one against the other. But there are also major differences between the series “whole deer + deer  heads” and “whole bison + bison masks.” All the masks are very much larger than  the heads of  the engraved bison, but that is only true for a minority (three of  twelve)  of  the deer heads. While six of  the nine masks are on the left wall, all six engraved  bison are on the right, as are all but one of  the heads in the Cervid Gallery. These  </page> <page sequence="7"> differences are statistically significant, and there is a very small probability of  their  being due to chance. So, while the bison + mask group is intended to be seen as  somehow related to the engraved deer head + whole deer group, the relationship  indicated is not one of  equivalence. Neither the sequences nor the species are in- tended to be seen as interchangeable. The difference becomes clearer when the mask  distribution is examined more closely.  the f inAl GAllery:  equivAlenCe  And trAnsCendenCe The largest concentration of  the masks (four) is found in the Mask Chamber. This is  the room where the figurative depiction of  bison reproduction in the Final Gallery  is located. It is also the room in which the masks make the clearest statement of  the  equivalence of  humans and bison. In that sense, the Mask Chamber is a focal part  of  the Final Gallery—the locus of  a most important condensation of  fundamental  symbolic values. These symbolic statements are distinctly separated from the cham- ber filled with cervids. They embody aspects of  belief  that differentiate bison from  deer. The positions of  the remaining masks indicate that they also serve other im- portant symbolic functions. Those five masks are strategically sited at liminal points  along the Final Gallery where there is a fundamental change in the nature of  the  decorations, as if  they were the guardians of  “gates” or portals through which one  passed as one symbolic assertion was completed and another began. Most often,  the masks at these portals are all but hidden from view until the visitor is right atop  them, when they suddenly spring into the peripheries of  the visual field in a way that  can be startling even to the viewer who is familiar with the experience. All the “Mask  Gates” but one are marked by a single mask. The other, the first gate one sees on en- tering and the last on leaving, is flanked by a pair of  masks, one on either side of  the  corridor, but even in this case, only one was intended to be seen at a time. The one  seen on entering is wholly a bison. The one seen on leaving is a bison-human hybrid.  The masks on the right wall invariably face the entering visitor, and those on the left  the exiting viewer. The visitor who passes through the Final Gallery viewing all its  decorations in the most efficient manner, without stopping to retrace steps or turn- ing to look about, will in every case but one see the masks on his or her right—the  exception can be seen from both directions. In the case of  the engraved heads of  deer, a part animal, less than a complete  deer, is used to evoke the animal as a whole in a sort of  graphic synecdoche. In  contrast, some of  the masks suggest hybrid beings, part-human, part-bison, that are  something surpassing a whole animal: strange and complex “supernatural”1 entities  whose nature transcends that of  either humans or bison. All three of  the masks on  the right side entering are simply bison, and none really suggests a human visage.  But the very next mask, the first one the visitor sees on turning back through the  Mask Chamber, is a purely human visage. It takes no overdeveloped imagination to  see in the long, saturnine mask that next appears a suggestion of  blended human and  CAves And Art 335 </page> <page sequence="8"> 336 CAves And Art bovine features. The two profiles that follow are simply bison, but the next, though  fundamentally bovine, once more looks oddly human. The last mask one sees on  exiting is the most extreme example of  a hybrid visage in Altamira. It behaves almost  as an optical illusion. Without any voluntary effort on the viewer’s part, it shifts  back and forth between its human and animal aspects. Seen in sequence, the masks  present a gradual transition from depictions that are simply bison or purely human  to representations of  hybrids blending bison and human natures, suggestive of  the  symbolic metamorphosis of  the former into the latter, and a metaphoric equation  of  these two very different beings. Significantly, the equivalence of  humans and bison is also suggested by figures  in other decorated caves. A vertical red bison at Castillo is one example, and the “cal- ligraphic” black bison at La Pasiega another that is even more remarkably human.  Figures of  hybrid men-bison are also known from France. There are two examples  in the Sanctuary at Trois Frères, one of  them the well-known semi-human, bison- headed figure, said to be playing a flute or musical bow. The most remarkable figure  of  the kind in Spain is the vertical bison/man modeled by the natural relief  of  a  stalagmitic column at Castillo. This figure has a bison’s head and body, supported  by human legs and feet (Ripoll Perelló 1971–1972). The column is crowned by the  roughly sculpted head of  another bison, made by enhancing a naturally evocative  formation.  the Cohesiveness of symbols At AltAmirA It is evident when all the evidence is reviewed that the compositions at Altamira,  engravings as well as paintings, polychromes included, form a single interrelated  whole that represents similar concerns in different ways. Once the figures are cor- rectly identified and the structure that underlies their placement and their relation- ships is understood, the unifying integrity of  the whole can be seen. We found ex- actly the same subjects—deer, bison, horses, ibex, anthropomorphs, and geometric  figures—represented both on the Great Ceiling closest to the cave’s entry and the  Final Gallery in its deepest recesses. The same animals are found in the central galler- ies, and those galleries make a structured symbolic transition between the galleries  at the two ends of  the decorated space. The same curious scene of  an excited cow mounting a bison bull is repeated  both on the Great Ceiling and in an engraving in the Final Gallery. The use of  a vir- tually identical design, with both animals sharing a single pair of  hind legs, to repeat  this unusual subject matter in different media is enough by itself  to show that the  procreation of  the bison herds was as much a concern of  the engravers of  the Final  Gallery as of  the painters who made the polychromes on the Great Ceiling. Cervid  reproduction is another theme uniting the two galleries, as is evident from the as- sociation of  antlered stags and antlerless hinds in the Cervid Gallery and in the Great  Ceiling’s engraved series. The human-bison relationship so clearly seen in the masks  of  the Final Gallery is also present in muted form in the man-like face of  an engraved  bison on the Great Ceiling. </page> <page sequence="9"> A single set of  structural principles was applied to the symbolic organization of   the two galleries in precisely complementary and opposite ways.2 While the species  and themes represented are continuous between the Great Hall and the Cola de  Caballo, and the organization of  symbols in both areas obeys the same underlying  structural principles, the application of  those principles in one gallery consistently  yields inverted transformations of  the placement and relationships of  figures in the  other. The Great Ceiling gets its name from the fact that its famous polychrome  decorations are all on its ceiling. Most of  the important figures in the Final Gallery,  in contrast, are on its walls, with few on the ceiling. The most numerous and strik- ing figures in the Final Gallery are its engravings; it is painted figures that domi- nate the Great Ceiling. The decorated area on the Great Ceiling is undivided space,  whose two major compositions, the paintings (principally bison) and the engravings  (principally deer), are superimposed on each other without separation. The Final  Gallery, on the other hand, is split into two major segments, each with subdivisions,  and the bison and deer themes are segregated and occupy alternate galleries. The  polychrome composition contains just one hind and several bison, while the Final  Gallery, like the engravings on the Great Ceiling, has many hinds and few bison. The  polychrome hind is disproportionately large compared to the bison, while the bison  in the Final Gallery are much larger than the deer. In the Final Gallery, there are  several large heads (the masks), while on the Great Ceiling there is but one each in  the paintings and the engraved series. Complete polychromes on the Great Ceiling  are often three-dimensional (from the natural irregularities over which they were  painted), while the large painted head is flat; in the Final Gallery, the heads are three- dimensional projections, and the whole animals are flat. Further contrasts are nu- merous, but the enumeration of  data that all point to the same conclusion would  serve no purpose other than to burden the reader with redundancies. It is also true that there are systematic similarities and contrasts between the en- graved symbols on the Great Ceiling, on the one hand, and its paintings on the other.  They do not coincide exactly with the comparisons and contrasts we have made of   the figures in different galleries. In fact, one can find enough points of  contrast be- tween the engravings on the Great Ceiling and those in the Final Gallery considered  by themselves to show that the two sets of  figures were also intended to embody the  same pervasive set of  concerns in contrastive and complementary ways. All the evidence we have reviewed indicates that the decorations in all Altamira’s  galleries were produced and arranged according to a single uniform program of  sym- bolic organization. This program involves such a complicated and multi-faceted inter- play of  parallels in subject matter and relational oppositions, and its application was  so pervasive and time-consuming for those who produced it, that it can scarcely be  accidental. (Incidentally, in my opinion, that implies that the different compositions  I have discussed, in all the galleries, must be broadly of  the same age.) The remark- able extent and consistency of  interrelationships between the major compositions in  Altamira’s decorated galleries clearly show the importance of  the symbols employed  to the cultural system of  the artists, support the identification of  Altamira as a sanc- tuary or set of  interrelated sanctuaries, and reveal the operation of  sophisticated,  CAves And Art 337 </page> <page sequence="10"> 338 CAves And Art insightful, and playful human minds capable of  tours-de-force of  symbolic construc- tion and cultural complexity rivaling those of  any living human group.  speCulAtions:  AltAmirA And initiAtion The observations presented in the preceding interpretation, including, I submit, the  identification of  Altamira as a sanctuary, have a sound basis in the data, and can be  empirically demonstrated. While it is possible to carry interpretation further, I real- ize that to do so involves a great deal of  speculation. In this case, by speculation I  mean logically constrained conjecture, not the free play of  imagination. The facts in  the case of  Altamira permit plausible inference that leads to interesting suggestions.  I caution the reader that conjecture is not fact, and assertion is not proof. While my  conjectural interpretation may in fact be correct, it may also be wrong, and alternate  interpretations I have not considered may fit the data equally well. I have said that the idea that Altamira was a prehistoric sanctuary is justified.  There are many kinds of  sanctuaries that serve different purposes. The themes rep- resented by Altamira’s decorations indicate some dimensions of  its purpose, while  the correspondence of  the characteristics of  the Final Gallery to those of  some sa- cred sites used for initiation ceremonies—rites of  transition and transformation—in  historic times suggests that it too may have served similarly. The masks of  the Final Gallery, hidden away deep in the bowels of  the cave,  depict a transformation or intergradation between humans and bison, suggesting  that, for the artists, the two were somehow equivalent. In the same gallery they rep- resented deer (which, to judge from their frequency in the Magdalenian level, were  the principal prey of  the hunters) as more abundant but at the same time markedly  smaller than either the masks or the engraved bison, emphasizing the symbolic pre- eminence of  the latter over the deer. On the contrary, in the most accessible composition, and the nearest to the  light of  day and to the space used for the ordinary activities of  daily living, the poly- chrome figures of  bison are much more abundant than are those of  deer. At the  same time, the bison are drawn at a relatively smaller scale than the painted deer.  Significantly, the closer they approach the large hind, the smaller the polychrome  bison become. And there is a group of  much smaller black outlines of  bison near her  figure, one just below her neck. It seems possible that the artists, decorating the most visible part of  the cave,  tried to emphasize the special importance of  the hind relative to humans and bison  by painting her at an exaggerated scale and associating her with engraved “orants.”  Perhaps it would not have been advisable to show disdain for deer, a principal main- stay of  human subsistence, despite the fact that they were comparatively easier than  the bison to capture and kill. Perhaps, in order to counterbalance any suggestion of   disdain that might be inferred from the treatment of  deer in the Final Gallery, to  avoid insulting so important a subsistence resource, and to ensure that deer would  continue to sacrifice themselves to the needs of  humans, the artists symbolically  expressed reverence for and supplication of  the large hind as a representative or em- </page> <page sequence="11"> bodiment of  all deer in general. No such symbolic compensation was needed in the  case of  the bison. The artists had already convincingly incorporated their belief  in  the equality of  humans and bison by means of  the symbolism of  the masks in the  Final Gallery. The Magdalenian artists at Altamira seem to have declared in the polychromes  on the Great Ceiling and the masks of  the Final Gallery some of  their society’s fun- damental beliefs concerning the relations between humans and the natural environ- ment. If  the Final Gallery expresses the wisdom of  a community by means of  figures  whose attitudes and arrangement correspond to definite principles of  symbolic or- ganization, the Great Hall recombines the same symbols in accordance with a new  and complementary structure, to reveal another side of  the same message. The animal world as revealed at Altamira is divided into two principal groups.  One is that of  the large, powerful bison, animals that aside from human beings had  almost no effective mortal enemies in nature. The bison are contrasted to the timid  and vulnerable deer. In a stable, rich, nurturing environment, a perceived equiva- lence between the sturdy, brave, and carefree bison on the one hand and human  beings on the other would be quite understandable. As the bison did in their proper  domain, humans reigned in their own. The polychromes, executed on the Great Ceiling so close to the light of  day, ex- press their message with simplicity, clarity, and power, and their content is not hard  to decipher. But their message is incomplete. In the shifting shadows of  a dark and  twisted gallery lay hidden their secret conclusion. That conclusion is only revealed to  those who follow a narrow and arduous path, finally creeping along on their bellies,  until finally they arrive in the very innermost entrails of  the grotto, from which the  only possible way out is to return along the selfsame constricted path. Their secret is  a simple but profound equivalence: bisons and humans are each the shadow of  the  other. The multiplication of  the bison herds signifies the florescence and increase of   the society of  humans. The characteristics of  this obligatory itinerary and its hidden message suggest  that Altamira was the locus of  prehistoric rites of  initiation. Following a narrow and  menacing path, the novice was eventually swallowed up in the deepest bowels of  the  earth and lay there nearly helpless and immobile. Only after contracting to turn in  the smallest possible space to force a way back out the womb of  the earth was it pos- sible to emerge again, first to a wider gallery where ritual practitioners could explain  the hidden message of  the depictions to the initiates, then to daylight, symbolically  reborn, but transformed by the revelation bestowed in the process of  symbolic death  and rebirth. Symbolic indications of  transformation and transcendence characterize the  three sanctuaries that I have discussed in these chapters. I have indicated that the  treatment of  the Early Aurignacian burials and the mortuary precinct at Cueva Morín  suggests a concern for the neutralization and placation of  the possibly threatening  physical remains of  the deceased by means of  mortuary rituals, and the transition  of  the dead by such means to a new social status, still as members of  the ongoing  social group. At the Cueva del Juyo, whatever the exact nature of  the rituals there  CAves And Art 339 </page> <page sequence="12"> 340 CAves And Art performed, the sanctuary shows a preoccupation with both the change of  seasons— the regular periodic diminution of  day length, the annual regression of  the sun from  the time of  its longest and most beneficent appearance—and the fusion of  the two  sides of  humanity and the natural world: their more “natural,” uncontrollable, in- stinctive, and bestial side symbolized by the large cat that is the head’s proper left  side, and the more “cultural,” controlled, and benign side, symbolized by the beard- ed human that is its proper left. At Altamira, it is a symbolic equivalence of  bison and  people that is indicated by the mask series in the Final Gallery. In all these cases, a fu- sion of  “opposites” that transcends what we can observe in nature is indicated. The  late Mircea Eliade called such reconciliations of  opposed principles a characteristic  of  the oldest and most widespread symbols of  the “paradoxical state of  the totality,  the perfection, and, consequently, the sacredness of  God” (Eliade, 1971: 146; see  also 1979). While we need not believe that all that is implicit in this affirmation can  be applied to the Paleolithic evidence, the fact that it comes from such a respected  authority on the history of  religious systems reinforces our interpretations. The conclusions concerning relationships between the depictions presented in  the previous chapter as certain are susceptible to validation and proof. We do not  pretend that the more speculative aspects of  our interpretation are necessarily cor- rect, or that they are less imaginative than those of  Henri Breuil, Max Raphael, or  André Leroi-Gourhan: in fact, our interpretation shares some particulars with each  of  theirs. But because it is based on a minute examination of  the cave and its compo- sitions in their manifold details, it is more consistent with all the data, and explains  more of  the characteristics of  Altamira and its decorations than did they, and at  the same time it is in better agreement with what we know of  ecology, ethology,  psychology, and socio-cultural anthropology, and all that we know of  the history of   symbols.  notes 1. By the term “supernatural” I mean here that the figures go beyond any possible ex- perience of  the natural world. I do not mean the term to be understood as it is in ordinary  everyday usage, with its accompanying baggage of  meaning and emotion. 2. I did not approach the study of  the Altamira figures using the theoretical framework  of  French “Structural Analysis,” as exemplified by the work of  Claude Lévi-Strauss (esp. An- thropologie structurale, 1958). Though my stance is not by any means “anti-theoretical,” I be- lieve that a slavish and overly rigid adherence to any theoretical viewpoint can or must lead  to distortions of  or falsifications of  the data studied, or (at very least) to the imposition of  an  inappropriate and subjective interpretive scheme on them. The relationships of  complemen- tary opposition described here in fact suggested themselves as our investigations of  the cave  and its depictions progressed.  referenCes Alcalde del Río, H., H.
