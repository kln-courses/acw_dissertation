<plain_text><page sequence="1">Techniques for Developing Discovery Questioning Skills . . . the whole sum of what may be said about questioning is comprised in this: It ought to set the learners thinking, to promote activity and energy on their parts, and to arouse the whole mental faculty into action, instead of blindly cultivating the memory at the expense of the higher intellectual powers. Joshua G. Firch, 1880 ARTHUR A. CARIN Assistant Dean of Teacher Education Queens College of the City University of New York Flushing, New York IT that HAS we been live accurately in an observed answer- that we live in an answer- oriented world. This trend must be reversed if we are to help children learn scientific processes along with This article is based upon Chapter Six, "De- veloping Productive Questioning Techniques" of the revision of Teaching Science Through Dis- covery, to be published by the Charles E. Merrill Publishing Company, Columbus, Ohio, in May 1970. scientific facts, concepts, and prin- ciples. Emphasis must be refocused on finding answers rather than merely on the answers themselves. Teaching-learning science by dis- covery is an approach that stresses involvement of the learner in seek- ing answers. The heart of teaching-learning science by discovery is in questions properly asked and answers to them properly used. Not only do teachers ask too many questions, they more often than not ask the wrong kinds of questions. Surveys indicate that over 90 percent of all questions teachers ask call merely for repro- ducing what was just read, heard or seen by children. These questions re- quire only the lowest level of think- ing by children - memorization. There are unlimited opportunities in a science program to use stimu- lating questions: discussion, labora- tory experiences, demonstrations, student worksheets, films, etc. How- ever, before entering the classroom, teachers should know specifically what they want to teach, why they ask questions, what types of ques- tions they want to ask, and the re- sponses they will accept. One of the most important con- siderations for planning effective questioning techniques is for the teacher to know specifically what it is he wants the children to learn. Selection of specific questions will then follow from the goals and ob- APRIL 1970 13</page><page sequence="2">jectives he hopes to guide the chil- dren to achieve.* Why do teachers ask children questions? One of the most impor- tant reasons teachers ask questions is to find out what their pupils know and do not know. These questions are very valid for they assist the teacher in planning and modifying his science program according to the needs of his class. He can avoid going over material the children already know or presenting material too difficult for their backgrounds. In a similar vein, by knowing the direction his children are going in a lesson, the teacher can redirect or focus by the questions he asks. Questions can be utilized for keep- ing the lesson relevant to the inves- tigation at hand. In addition to the above, teachers ask questions for these purposes: 1. To arouse interest - motivating children to actively participate in a lesson. 2. To evaluate a pupil's prepara- tion and to see if his homework or previous work has been mastered. 3. To review and summarize what is taught. 4. To develop insights by helping children see new relationships. 5. To stimulate critical thinking and development of questioning attitude. 6. To stimulate pupils to seek out additional knowledge on their own. 7. To evaluate the achievement of goals and objectives of lesson. Premeditated Questions Although unplanned "on the spot" questions are important in science education, little true long range creative teaching-learning is possible on such a hit-and-miss basis. Premeditated or planned questioning is essential for a start- ing point in a creative discovery science program. Two kinds of pre- planned questions are convergent and divergent questions. *For examples of levels of questioning which increase depth of thinking processes, see David R. Krathwohl, Benjamin S. Bloom, Bertram B. Masia, Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals. (David McKay Company, Inc., New York City. 1964) pp. 186-193. Convergent Questions Some questions cause children to move toward closure or to summa- rize and draw conclusions. They are called convergent questions. Recall questions fall into this category. "What is the annual rainfall for Ari- zona?" is a convergent question. There is only one answer. Although their importance is limited, conver- gent questions are nevertheless nec- essary. Robert Gagn√© has cau- tioned that discovery could be undertaken only after the individual acquired a store of broad and criti- cal knowledge. When convergent questions are overused, however, more advanced and creative think- ing is inhibited. An excess of the question - answer, stimulus - response questioning can be destructive to developing process thinking in *sei- ence. Convergent questions rarely lead to further investigation. Divergent Questions Some questions, on the other hand, cause children to ask further questions, plan and carry out ex- periences with science equipment, and do library or other research. These are called divergent or pro- ductive questions. In contrast to the convergent question, "What is the annual rain- fall for Arizona?" the following is an example of a divergent question: Mr. Goodman gave an atlas to each of two children. He then asked them to look over the An- nual Rainfall Map of the United States. After a few minutes Mr. Goodman asked: "You'll notice by the colors used that some states receive over 89 inches of rainfall annually, while others re- ceive under 10 inches. Why do you suppose this is so ?" Divergent questions go further than convergent questions. They stimu- late the learner to find out what is to be. The learner is encouraged to broaden or deepen the area to be studied. He is required to gather facts, evaluate them, and to engage in higher creative thinking processes in order to answer divergent ques- tions. Because of their broadening effect, divergent questions are re- ferred to as open-ended or pro- ductive. Improving Teacher Questioning Skills The following suggestions are pre- sented for teachers who wish to start improving their own questioning skills: 1. Write down specific wording of 6-8 questions in your lesson plan before coming to class. %. Ask your questions as simply, concisely, and directly as possible. Avoid such unnecessary introduc- tions as, "What do you think about . . . ," "How many of you can tell me . . . etc. 3. Ask your questions before des- ignating which child should answer. Pause briefly after asking the ques- tion so that all children have time to think about the question. 4. Ask an individual child to re- spond to your question. Total class shouting out of answers could result in classroom discipline problems for the teacher. 5. Ask questions of as many chil- dren as possible during the science lessons - volunteers and non-volun- teers, slow and bright, etc. Gear the difficulty to each child's interest, science background, and ability. 6. Ask a question about the most obvious part of the investigation for your first question. Such a question might be, "How much weight did the hamster gain since last week?" 7. Ask as many questions that stimulate creative thinking processes as possible from among these cate- gories: (a) comparison (g) making (b) summarization assump- (c) observation tions (d) classification (h) collection (grouping) and orga- (e) interpretation nization (f) criticism of data (i) evaluation 8. Ask questions that give chil- dren practical experience with sci- ence process thought questions. These include: (a) designing an investigation - i.e., How would you find out? (b) hypothesizing or predicting - i.e., What do you think will happen? 14 SCIENCE and CHILDREN</page><page sequence="3">(c) making an operational defini- tion - i.e., How would you define that? 9. Ask questions in a variety of ways in addition to "what," "how," "why," so that students are asked to: (a) illustrate or (e) trace show how (f) interpret (b) explain (g) evaluate (c) discuss (h) contrast (d) justify (i) summarize 10. Ask questions that lead to ac- tual experimentation on the chil- dren's part such as: (a) Questions that present a discrep- ancy in anticipated outcome to ex- cite curiosity. (While pouring juice from a can with only one hole punched in it, ask: "Why does the water plop out instead of run out?") (b) Questions that suggest possible tests for solution ("How are metals affected by a magnet? What metals are attracted by a magnet?") (c) Questions that are specific and not too broad or general (Poor: How do seeds sprout? Better : What conditions are needed for seeds to sprout?) (d) Rather than "How" questions (which lead to frustration) ask "What will happen if we . . . ?" Will it work more or less quickly with ... ? What might we do if we want this one to ... ? Can anyone think of a way we might work to get the plant to . . . ?" 11. Avoid asking questions that inhibit investigations: (a) Questions where the answer is obvious and foregone conclusion (b) Yes-No questions ( Poor : Are all trees the same size and age? Better : How do trees vary in size, shape, and age?) (c) Questions in which teleological phenomena or object is given pur- pose or will (Poor: Why does nature abhor a vacuum? Better : Why is maintaining a vacuum so difficult?) (d) Anthropomorphic questions (Poor: Why do electrons want to leave the metal? Better : What causes the electrons to move?) (e) Vague questions (Poor: Tell us about light. Better: What are some of the characteristics of light?) (f) Tooth pulling questions (Poor: Come on, you can think of a third kind of acid. Better : We seem to have difficulty in thinking of a third kind of acid. What kind of acid did we find in orange juice?) (g) Statements that suddenly turn into a question (Poor: The growth of your plants with fertilizer since last month was what? Better : How much have your plants with the fer- tilizer grown since last month?) (h) A battery of questions (Poor: What is weather, how is it different from climate, and how can a weather map help predict it? Better: What are some of the elements that make up weather?) (i) Asking for information chil- dren cannot be expected to know (Poor: How does a Geiger counter work? Better : If a charged particle like a proton comes into the Geiger counter tube, what should take place?) 12. Avoid repeating children's answers. In summary, questioning must begin to reflect concern with scien- tific processes along with content. Before entering the classroom, teachers must know specifically what they want to teach. The teach- ers then will ask questions to find out what their students do and do not know, to arouse interest, to eval- uate pupil progress, to guide higher level thinking processes, and to re- view and summarize. Convergent questions lead to closure while diver- gent questions cause children to ask further questions and to plan and carry out further investigations.</page></plain_text>
