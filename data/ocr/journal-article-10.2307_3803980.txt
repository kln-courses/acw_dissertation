<plain_text><page sequence="1">Amazonian historical ecologies Laura Rival University of Oxford Historical ecology may be defined as the undertaking of a diachronic analysis of living ecological systems, with the view to accounting more fully for their structural and functional properties. Historical ecology, more an approach or a research strategy than a paradigm, addresses a central question: 'How does environmental change relate to the historical development of human societies?' An integral part of the new ecological anthropology, historical ecology seeks to de- reify the concepts of nature and culture, and to rethink critically the complexity of the biological world, particularly the problematic distinction between the wild and the domesticated, which has hitherto inspired natural science research on the diversity of biological life. This paper examines the ways in which historical ecology has been used to research nomadic bands subsisting with few or no domesticates in lowland South America. I argue that current knowledge of the Amazon biome, which is far more sophisticated than it was in the late 1940s and the early 1950s, when Steward edited the Handbook of South American Indians, allows us to rethink human occupation of, and adaptation to, the Amazon; to redefine the forces that have shaped the material dimensions of social life, and to recognize that Amazonian hunter-gatherers have played an active part in the making of the natural environment that they have occupied for millennia. I also argue that 'trekking', far from representing a necessary intermediary stage in the regression from horticulture to foraging, constitutes, in some cases, a sui generis solution to deep contradictory forces of a political, religious, and social character. Such internal processes may have long predated the Conquest and the disruptions it caused. I conclude that reliance on resources created in the past may be a characteristic shared by various trekking and foraging groups of the Upper Amazon. My purpose in this paper is to illustrate the theoretical power of historical ecology as a holistic approach to human ecology which, particularly in the Amazonian context, has opened new paths for the integration of the cognitive, historical, and political dimensions of human nature. The greatest strength of historical ecology, in my view, is that it allows us to formulate non-reductionist analyses of the environment/society interface. I start with a brief exposition of Julian Steward's ideas to show that if they have - unfortunately - given rise to a reductionist model of functional adaptation according to cost/benefit criteria, they can also be interpreted in a way that makes him the unmistakable and direct precursor of the historical ecology approach.

Given the extraordinary demographic changes that have occurred in Amazonian societies at various points in time, but especially in the aftermath of the Spanish and Portuguese Conquest, it would have been impossible to re-assess the historical trajectory of these societies without botanical and ethno? botanical studies. In the last part of the paper, I discuss critically the thesis of post- contact cultural regression. I examine the ways in which historical ecology has been used to research nomadic bands subsisting with few or no domesticates in lowland South America. I argue that trekking, far from representing a necessary intermediary stage in the regression from horticulture to foraging, constitutes, in some cases, a sui generis solution to deep contradictory forces of a political, religious, and social char? acter. Such internal processes may have long predated the Conquest and the disrup- tions it caused. Historical ecology: origins and principles Bill Balee and Caroline Crumley, chief advocates of the historical ecology perspec? tive, have shown that it is theoretically continuous with Steward's cultural ecology. They define historical ecology as the undertaking of a diachronic analysis of living ecological systems, with the view to account fully for their structural and functional properties. In their various publications, they have explained how nature is always in the making, and why human-environment interaction should be analysed from a his? torical perspective. Crumley, who traces the origin of the term 'historical ecology' to the archaeological palynologist Edward Deevey's research programme at the Univer? sity of Florida in the early 1970s, stresses the fact that the physical world and human societies are always and everywhere inextricably linked (Crumley 1998: vi). Everywhere, human action shapes, and is shaped by, the physical environment, without being nec? essarily destructive. Balee argues that historical ecology is 'even more dialectical than historical materialism, for it begins with the dialectic of an inalienable link between nature and culture' (1998: 4); and more holistic, for it attempts to understand the mutual influence of people and non-human nature, a process which is at once biological and cultural. Historical ecology, more an approach or a research strategy than a paradigm, addresses a central question: 'How does environmental change relate to the historical development of human societies?' An integral part of the new eco? logical anthropology, historical ecology seeks to reconceptualize the complexity of the biological world, particularly the problematic distinction between the wild and the domesticated, which has inspired natural science research on the diversity of biologi? cal life. The way in which society views nature is in part a function of how society has affected nature. Nature and the cultural conceptions of nature develop together; they co-evolve. Wrongly characterized by some as single-minded environmental determinism, Julian Steward's position was premised on the fact that the super-organic factor of culture affects, and is affected by, the total web of life. Steward, who did not consider culture to form a seamless whole, tried to introduce a priority order among the various cultural components. He saw the way people work as the determining factor in cul? tural adaptation. Taking ecology in its broadest meaning, he focused his analytical effort on subsistence activities and their influence upon a local society's material expressions and values. Although he especially emphasized the relationship between the tools that humans use in pursuit of subsistence and certain environmental features, /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S79-S94 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="3">Laura Rival S81 Steward did not ignore worldviews, but examined them in the light of historical contingencies. Steward was primarily concerned with social change. His framework was material- ist, historical, and evolutionary, not only because he understood cultural-ecological adaptation with reference to both culture and the environment, but also because he looked at the effect of the environment upon culture in terms of ecological and his? torical processes. His intent to reconcile diachronic and synchronic explanations of cultural facts in his search for laws of social transformation was truly original at the time, and remains an inspiration today. One can best appreciate this by comparing his theory with the equally innovative dynamic theory of institutional change proposed by Edmund Leach in his celebrated Political systems of highland Burma (1954). Whereas both Leach and Steward asserted that relations between people do not change durably before their relationship to the natural environment is undermined and requires new forms of adaptation, only Steward dedicated his research to the precise environmen? tal and historical conditions underlying cultural adaptation. He would not have mis- taken the Kachin for traditional hill farmers, and he would not, as Leach did, have ignored the fact that the Kachin were intensively involved in poppy production, tax levy, and long-distance trade. When linking subsistence and social structure, or arguing that subsistence plays a role in determining social and political boundaries, Steward always emphasized local processes of adaptation. One can argue that, for him, habitat becomes the driving force for social and cultural change only for those who possess accurate and encyclopaedic knowledge of local environmental conditions. The application of ecological func- tionalism to Amazonia produced poor analytical results because it was narrowly focused on adaptation to scarce environmental resources. Our current knowledge of the Amazon biome is far more sophisticated than it was in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when Steward edited the Handbook of South American Indians (1946). This new knowledge allows us to rethink human occupation and adaptation to the Amazon, to redefine the forces that shape the material dimensions of social life, and to recognize that Amazonian hunter-gatherers have played an active part in the making of the envi? ronment that they have occupied for millennia (Rival 1999). Anthropogenic forest formations in Amazonia1 Since the pioneering work summarized in Steward (1946), many cultural ecology theories have been proposed to explain prehistorical subsistence patterns and histori? cal agricultural techniques in Amazonia. Betty Meggers's (1996 [1971]) environmental determinist thesis was followed by works bent on proving that contemporary native Amazonia is the result of severe environmental limitations. Low population density, incipient warfare, transient slash-and-burn horticulture, and food taboos have, for instance, been analysed as manifestations of human adaptation to natural resource scarcity (Rival 1999). It is through careful examination of botanical and ethnobotanical data that authors such as Posey and Balee (Balee 1993; Posey 1984; Posey &amp; Balee 1989) have marshalled new empirical evidence to challenge the earlier claims that Amazonia lacked in resource potential, or that human activity in this part of the world was no more than mere disturbance of natural processes. Posey (1984) argued that the Kayapo Indians are not simple cultivators who periodically cut the forest down in order to open new gardens. Rather, they practise a form of 'agroforestry', by which he meant that the /. Roy Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S79-S94 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="4">S82 Laura Rival limited, shifting, and periodic removal of the forest cover to cultivate foodcrops is only one phase of a long cycle of integrated forest management. Balee (1989; 1992; 1993) has similarly argued that the distribution of tree species in the Amazon rain forest is deeply influenced by human intentional and non-intentional management. Local concentra- tions of specific plant species, which are good indicators of past human activity, show as empirically as any other reliable historiographic record would that environment and society interacted historically in Amazonia. Balee's study ofthe indigenous agroforestry complex in Maranhao, Brazil, for example, explicitly defends the idea that forests of biocultural origin can be treated as objective records of past human interactions with plants, even if the local population does not have any social memory of such history and cannot differentiate old fallows from patches of undisturbed forest (Balee 1993)? The presence of surface pottery and charcoal in the soil, the distribution of species, the size of trunks, oral history, and native classifications of forest and swidden types can all be used to differentiate old fallows from high forests. This leads Balee to argue that nomadic bands do not wander at random, but move their camps between palm forests, bamboo forests, or Brazil nut forests, which are all 'cultural forests', that is, ancient dwelling sites. Amazonian foraging bands such as the Guaja, the Kaingang, or the Siriono are able to subsist in the rain forest without cultivated crops, on the basis of a few essential 'wild' resources (palms, fruit trees, or bamboo), which are, in fact, the products of the activities of ancient populations. According to Balee, these groups regressed in the aftermath of the Conquest from village life and cultivation to trekking in old fallows and foraging in managed forests created by pre-Columbian societies. They lost most of their domesticated crops in the process. Evidence from observation of contemporary gardening activities; the wide occurrence of charcoal and numerous potsherds in the forest soil; the greater concentration of palms, lianas, fruit trees, and other heavily used forest resources on archaeological sites, as well as induction about the long-lasting effects of past human interference, have all led Balee to argue that, far from having been limited by scarce resources, the indigenous people of Amazonia have created biotic niches or 'anthropogenic forests' since prehistoric times; these have been exploited continuously to this day. Like many contemporary analysts, and most espe? cially the archaeologist Anna Roosevelt (1991; 1993; 1994; 1998), the geographer William Denevan (1996; 2001), and the botanist Charles Clement (1999), Balee stresses the sig? nificance of post-Columbian demographic collapse. Before this historical watershed, Amazonia was peopled with complex societies made up of large semi-sedentary villages subsisting on a wide range of intensively cultivated domesticated and semi- domesticated crops. These settlements were networked across impressive distances through elaborate exchange and trade routes. Like these authors, Balee (1999: 26) stresses the dramatic loss of social, political, and techno-economic complexity in the majority of native societies in modern times. Balee and Posey's work has been extremely influential in Amazonian anthropology, and beyond. Their research has shown that adaptation is a dynamic process in which human agency plays a central role. The environment does not limit cultural develop? ment as extensively as was previously believed; and what looks like a pristine envi? ronment may in fact turn out to be an ancient agricultural site. Balee and Posey show that native populations modified their surroundings through a variety of activities that ultimately transformed the Amazonian landscape in distinctly human ways. They were also the first authors to emphasize that human activity, in addition to enriching the vegetation cover and diversifying plant species, also improved soils (see Lehman, Kern, /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S79-S94 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="5">Laura Rival S83 Glaser 8c Woods 2003). Three lessons can thus be learned from their work. On the one hand, human populations must be treated as full components of the ecosystems in which they live; on the other hand, equal importance must be granted to the history of ecological systems and to that of human societies. Finally, Balee and Posey demon? strate the relevance of botanical and ethnoecological studies for establishing the link between the physical and social past in Amazonia. Building on the research of Balee, Posey, and others, Clement (1999) offers the most comprehensive synthesis of Amazonian crop genetic biogeography to date. In so doing, he goes a step further in arguing for the full integration of environmental and histor? ical explanations. The goal this time is not so much to estimate what has been lost since 1492, but to hypothesize how much agrobiodiversity was created by humans in the Amazon region between the late Pleistocene and the fifteenth century. Clement applies the new evolutionary theory developed by David Harris (e.g. Harris 1996; Harris 8c Hillman 1989) and David Rindos (1984) during the 1980s to evaluate the rich and varied pre-Columbian crop genetic heritage. At least 257 plant species were culti? vated in the Americas in the fifteenth century (Clement 1999:188), of which 79 prob? ably originated in the Amazon basin, and another 37 in neighbouring regions (Clement 1999: 203). Some 138 crops belonging to 44 botanical families were either cultivated or more or less directly affected by human management in Amazonia at the time of contact (Clement 1999:192). The distinction between species and landscape domesti? cation, as well as the integration of both processes, is central to Clement's reconstruc? tion of Amazonian horticulture. Using Harris's definition of domestication as a co-evolutionary process based on a continuum of human investment in selection and environmental manipulation (Clement 1999:189), the author proposes a classification of Amazonian cultivated plants according to their degree of domestication (full domes- ticates, semi-domesticates, and incipient domesticates) and their particular life history (annuals, semi-annuals, and perennials). Six categories of plants are distinguished on the basis of these variables, which allow Clement to reconstruct the inter-related his? torical ecology of anthropogenic forest formations and of crop genetic resources. He concludes that if a high percentage (68%) of Amazonian domesticates, semi- domesticates, and incipient domesticates are trees and woody perennials, this fact is to be attributed primarily not to the nature ofthe forest ecosystem but, rather, to the high dependence of domesticated annuals on human management. Crop genetic erosion paralleled the physical disappearing of human populations. This explains why diver? sity, especially infraspecific diversity of cultivars, was reduced shortly after large indige? nous Amazonian societies succumbed to world diseases and depopulation. The (agri)cultural regression model In the previous section, I have presented recent studies of tree species distribution and intra-species diversity which show conclusively that indigenous peoples did not passively adapt to a forest environment poor in vital resources. On the contrary, Amazonian peoples actively manipulated the forest ecosystem, enriched the soils, managed and diversified a wide range of plant species, and generally created the mate? rial and physical conditions to maintain surprisingly high levels of population density, at least in some areas. In this section, I examine the use of botanical and ethnobotan- ical data in works that elaborate on the losses incurred upon contact. As mentioned earlier, most current authors explain the presence of foraging and trekking populations in Amazonia as a post-Conquest phenomenon. Balee's work on /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst.

Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="6">S84 Laura Rival Brazilian marginal groups has led him to conclude that Europe's invasion of lowland South America caused not only the demographic collapse of native populations, but also their massive cultural devolution, with surviving societies adapting to biocultural forests resulting from the dynamic interaction between history and ecology (Balee 1992). It is only because they have secured access to a few essential non-domesticates such as palms and other fruit trees (which, in fact, result from the horticultural activities of ancient populations) that Amazonian foragers have been able to survive without cultivated crops. The process of agricultural regression, parallel to that of regression from village life to full nomadism, is progressive. At each stage, a cultigen is lost, and dependence on uncultivated plants increases. The originality of Balee's argument is to show that loss of cultigens and increased reliance on uncultivated plants amount not to a return to pristine nature, but, instead, to a process of adaptation to 'vegetational artefacts of another society' (Balee 1988: 48). Moreover, in his view, the botanical knowledge of deculturated foragers, that is, their knowledge of both garden crops and wild plants, is poorer than that of gardeners. Present-day foragers who do not remember that their forebears cultivated have forgotten the technical savoir-faire of their predecessors, but their languages still possess cognates for cultigens. Said dif- ferently, the only cultural transmission that has successfully operated through time is unconscious linguistic knowledge. However, even linguistic knowledge may be erased over time. Balee (1992) mentions, for instance, that the Guaja, who still have a cognate for maize, have lost the term for bitter manioc. Balee's twin use of linguistic and botanical data to infer past agricultural patterns and historical change recalls Sapir's (1912) study of diachronic change in folk- botanical terminology. Sapir thought that human languages encode memories of human inventiveness, adaptation, and survival skills, and co-evolve with environmen? tal knowledge. The linguist Louisa Maffi has also used Sapir's theory to show that 'the vocabulary of a language ... inventories the characteristics of the local flora and fauna and thus bears the stamp of the physical environment in which the speakers are placed' (2001: 25). This is why Maffi correlates acculturation (erosion of both native language and ecological knowledge) with losses in biological diversity. She therefore proposes a model of regression akin to that proposed by Clement, who correlates demographic collapse with genetic erosion, or by Balee, who correlates colonial expansion with agri? cultural regression. In all these scenarios, historical events disrupt cultural develop? ments, and changes in socioeconomic systems have profound ecological as well as cultural consequences.2 I agree with these authors that human/environment interactions must be analysed holistically, that is, by taking into consideration both the physical and the mental world - in this case botanical knowledge and the vocabulary used to encode it. However, the inextricable link between the physical world and human societies need not be under? stood according to evolutionary/devolutionary processes, which ultimately imply that agricultural intensification is inherently progressive.3 Moreover, a society's mental world encompasses far more than botanical terms. Let us examine the agricultural regression thesis critically, starting with Balee's arguments. For Balee (1995), history is far more relevant than evolution to understand the changes that occurred in the relationship between human societies and their environ? ments, but what he really means by history is indigenous adaptation to the Spanish Conquest and to post-Conquest biological and political dynamics. History in his model is never envisaged as resulting from pre-Conquest social contradictions or /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S79-S94 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="7">Laura Rival S85 political conflicts; it is always a reaction to external events which invariably affect devel? opmental and evolutionary trends 'backwards': that is, by reversing the pace of devel? opment. The primary historical constraint faced by native Amazonians after the Conquest was the severe demographic collapse that they experienced. All other regres- sive changes are seen as consequential: the loss of agricultural knowledge due to defec? tive cultural transmission, and the regression from agriculture to trekking to pure foraging, because foraging is the only survival option available to small bands.4 Balee therefore correlates lack of agriculture and mobility. People who farm intensively are not highly mobile; conversely, people who hunt and gather are highly mobile. While I agree with Balee's insistence that mobility be considered as an adaptive strategy to his? torical, rather than to environmental, conditions, I lament the fact that he overlooks pre-Conquest historical dynamics triggered by conflicts between highly mobile and less mobile native populations. Another critical aspect of Balee's model is that it is still east in the mould of optimal foraging. What Balee really objects to in the work of optimal foraging theorists is not that maximization of benefits or minimization of costs is at the root of Amazonian subsistence strategies, but, rather, that optimal foraging theory fails to recognize that trekking and foraging may be adaptations to cultural rather than to natural environ? ments. What differentiates the adaptation of Amazonian trekkers and foragers is that, although they depend on domesticated and cultivated crops, they need neither to cul- tivate garden products, nor to exchange game or collected forest products for garden products. The resources they gather in the wild exist as the result of the activities of past agrkulturalists, who have modified the forest environment to the point at which it can be described no longer as a natural habitat, but, rather, as a cultural landscape.5 In this sense, Balee's view of human adaptation is not substantially different from that of Kim Hill (K. Hill 8c Hurtado 1996), for instance, who analyses the mobility of Ache foragers as a function of their adaptation to a particular type of biocultural landscape. Trekking and foraging as envisaged by Balee can still be analysed as a form of eco? nomic adaptation to a particular environment; in this case, former agriculturalists such as the Ache have maximized their adaptation by adapting the environment to their needs, rather than adapting their needs to the environment. In other words, there is no room in Balee's model for understanding the subsistence activities of trekkers and foragers in cultural terms, that is to say, for including in the analysis their own con- ceptualization of gathering and hunting in cultural landscapes, or their own discourse about their subsistence practices. We need to explore whether groups who are known to have been intensive horticulturalists in the past and who now mainly forage, hunt, and gather do so similarly to those who are still intensive horticulturalists, and whether their symbolic representations of hunting, gardening, and foraging are identical to those heralded by intensive horticulturalists. In short, does hunting and gathering in old fallows, that is, in environments modified by previous human intervention and management, make a difference, practically and symbolically? Balee's main concern is to understand the shift from agriculture to foraging in Amazonian societies that are found today on archaeological sites which were once inhabited by ancient chiefdoms for which agriculture must have played a central role. He shares this concern with a number of authors, in particular Roosevelt (1993), Lathrap (1970; 1973), and, to some extent, Levi-Strauss (1948; 1955; 1963a; 1963b). Like these authors, because he sees the progressive abandonment of village life and horti? culture by a number of Tupi-Guarani, the intensive horticultural systems of whom we /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst.

However, Denevan (1996; 2001) stresses that the hinterlands were simul? taneously used by indigenous populations living in sedentary, densely populated village settlements, and by small, mobile groups dispersed throughout the forest. Denevan's thesis may be used to support a view of the dynamic history of plant/human interac? tion according to which foraging with incipient horticulture is as much a cultural choice as intensive, sedentary agriculture.6 Denevan's work thus offers an important corrective to the thesis proposed by Clement, Balee, Roosevelt, and other authors who implicitly conclude that, if it had not been for the Conquest, Amazonia's native populations would have continued to develop intensive agriculture and would have increasingly complexified. To summarize, the agricultural regression thesis defended by Balee is unsatisfactory on a number of counts. The first problem with this thesis is that it only considers post- Conquest historical causes, and never pre-Conquest ones. In other words, devolution to a simpler, less hierarchical social form and to a more nomadic, less agriculture - dependent way of life is envisaged only as the outcome of European expansion. The fact that there might have been processes of regression from sedentism to nomadism and loss of cultigens before the Iberian Conquest is simply not envisaged. Conse- quently, intensive, sedentary agriculture is premised as being logically and historically anterior to the forms of trekking and foraging observed today. And whereas the sequence foraging ?&gt; sedentary horticulture is naturalized as evolutionary, thus de- historicized, the sequence sedentary horticulture ?? foraging is interpreted as having been induced by the historical encounter between Europe and pre-historical Amazo? nia. Like much post-colonial historico-anthropological writing which assumes that history started with the Iberian arrival (J. Hill &amp; Santos Granero 2002), this position impoverishes the actual diversity of historical trajectories in the region. It has been my contention that nomadism and a hunting-gathering way of life need not be post? colonial, for they may represent cultural and political choices already present in pre- Conquest values and social forms. Furthermore, the devolution thesis fails to explain why both sedentarized horticul? ture (as practised, for example, by Quichua communities) and trekking (as practised, for instance, by Huaorani bands) represent successful adaptations to the Upper Napo ecology. The extraction of wild resources through hunting and gathering, although qualitatively different from the use of domesticates through cultivation, nevertheless affects species distribution, and, consequently, systematically modifies the environ? ment (Yen 1989). Finally, trekkers who continue to rely on non-cultivated food develop forest management practices which lead to greater concentrations of favoured resources within specific areas. In so doing, they do transform nature, albeit in a dis? tinctive way, for their techniques are not geared to intensify production outputs. Another and related problem with the devolution thesis is that it over-emphasizes the evolutionary significance of domestication, and treats swidden horticulture as a homogeneous and empirical category, ignoring the importance of subsistence modes in defining group identity. Foragers and sedentarized cultivators have developed radi? cally different means of associating with plants and alternative ways of being in the world and of knowing it. Rather than a continuum of intensity of resource exploita? tion, foraging and cultivation constitute alternative strategies of resource procurement and modes of practical and intentional engagement with their environment. This /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S79-S94 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="9">Laura Rival S87 difference is significant, particularly in terms of identity formation and inter-ethnic relations, given that, on the whole, gardeners feel morally superior to foragers and trekkers (Rival 1999: 82). Last but not least, the devolution thesis entirely ignores the fact that trekkers and foragers do not represent themselves as less developed than cul? tivators. Symbolic constructions of ecologies of difference must therefore be taken into consideration; they form an essential part of the analysis. Culture is a way of life, and identity as forager or as cultivator an important cultural marker. The fact that the Guaja, for instance, are fond of saying that they do not cultivate, but raid instead, illus? trates the fact that to hunt and to gather represents far more than economic action. What is being expressed here are cultural and political values that need to be under? stood as such. In his paper in this volume, David Harris comments on the difficulties of assessing the archaeological data from the Amazon basin and other tropical sites, and on the disparity between the picture for early plant domestication emerging from ethno? graphy and that reconstituted by archaeology. In addition, we might mention the disagreements existing between archaeologists on the existence and the form of pre-Columbian chiefdoms. Archaeologists and anthropologists working in the cultural ecology tradition stress the social and cultural discontinuity between pre-Columbian and contemporary Amazonian societies, with their basic social organization of small, politically independent and egalitarian local groups formed through cognate ties. They treat high mobility and foraging as indicators of historical change. The nomadic, foraging way of life of interfluvial groups does not, they argue, reflect the pattern that predominated in pre-Columbian Amazonia, where elaborate autochthonous chiefdoms developed and flourished. What is at stake in this debate is the nature of the changes that occurred before, during, and after the Conquest. How are we best to understand the interactions between the natural history of the forest and the eventful, uneven, and violent history of human societies in this part of the world? To begin to offer plausible answers to this question, I wish to argue, we need to con? sider biocultural data as more than a repository of historical evidence. We need to describe ways of life ethnographically, and this necessarily implies analysing Amazon? ian hunter-gatherers' own social and symbolic structuring of the world. We need to establish whether a particular socio-cultural fact is continuous or discontinuous with the past as it is both historiographically recorded and culturally encoded. Balee's con? tribution has been to highlight that higher mobility in Amazonia is linked to the choice of using resources that are not 'wild' but 'biocultural', as well as to the choice of replac- ing cultivation with gathering. We now need to determine how such shifts in social and economic practices are reflected at the level of collective representations and in the formation of distinctive identities. The contrastive historical ecologies of Amazonian trekkers and foragers The major problem with attempts to typologize terra firme groups on the basis of their relative botanical knowledge is that such an exercise tends to disregard social, religious, and political considerations. Mobility is analysed as being caused either by environ? mental limitations (for cultural ecologists) or by historical constraints (for the propo? nents of cultural regression). In either case, ecological differences such as those between terra firme and varzea become historical differences, and mobility is seen as imposed from without. My main dissatisfaction with this model, as I have argued else? where (Rival 2002), is that it leaves no place for socio-cultural processes. Mobility is as /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S79-S94 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="10">S88 Laura Rival much a product of historical will and religious belief as it is a form of adaptation to the environment or to historical circumstances. What deserves analytical attention is the fact that people decide to leave a resource-rich area for one which is relatively poorer in order to remain independent, to preserve a separate identity, or to resist assimilation, as in the Huaorani case. Whereas it cannot be denied that the Conquest favoured dispersion and fragmentation, the reasons for centrifugal processes are in part endogenous. It is through their decision-making and choice-exercising that social groups face historical forces, and, for that matter, environmental constraints as well. Mobility and the social forms it engenders need to be envisaged as part of the histor? ical development of a distinct mode of life. Mobility strategies need not be automatically related to foraging behaviour. Mobil? ity is often used politically, as a way to segregate and avoid conflict. Many Amazonian anthropologists have noted a positive correlation between mobility and warfare, and between peace, gardening, and village life. Such correlation is commonly expressed not only as a set of contrastive practices, but also as a form of social discourse. Journet (1995), for example, notes that the Curripaco, who identify horticulture with peace and the foundation of society, equate the nomadic lifestyle of the Maku, seen as antitheti- cal to culture and anterior to civilization, with warfare, hunting, and isolation in the forest. Fausto's (2001) study of two Parakana groups who have chosen, after splitting, to live according to two divergent ways of life - nomadism and sedentism - illustrates the same association between pacific village life, horticulture, and sedentism, on the one hand, and mobility, foraging, warfare, and nomadism, on the other. Several ethno? graphers of the Yanomami point to the same close relation between intense warfare, a lack of internal differentiation, nomadism, and a lesser reliance on garden crops (Albert 1985; Colchester 1984; Ferguson 1995; Good 1989). As the archaeologist Susan Kent (1989) has shown, mobility is not automatically determined by subsistence strate? gies, even where groups with very different levels of socio-political organization and subsistence strategy co-exist. Kent's observations (see also Kent &amp; Vierich 1989: 124-30) are readily applicable to the Amazon context, and her generalizations about mobility go a long way to illumi- nate Huaorani trekking in terms of their own social understanding of space and of their relation to their forested environment, in particular the way in which mobility through the landscape relates to the use of old fallows. The Huaorani people of Ama? zonian Ecuador are best described as foragers. They practise a range of subsistence activities, including hunting, fishing, collecting wild fruits, tubers, and palm nuts, and exploit many other forest products such as honey and insects. They are characterized by a close-knit egalitarian social organization based on strong ties and shared com? munal patterns. Until ten years ago, and unlike their indigenous neighbours (all cul- tivating groups with a strong sense of identity as horticulturalists), the Huaorani chose to cultivate manioc and plantain only sporadically, and mainly for the preparation of ceremonial drinks. Even today, many Huaorani families prefer to secure their daily sub? sistence through hunting and gathering. Through cycles of residential mobility, foraging activities, and the daily con? sumption of significant quantities of forest resources, the Huaorani are active agents in the concentration of useful species. Through marginal modifications (for instance, the quantity of seeds that they leave behind on abandoning a residential camp), they have enriched their habitat for humans, as well as for a number of non-human species. As such, they have contributed to the formation of anthropogenic forests of a very /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S79-S94 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="11">Laura Rival S89 different kind from those created by swidden horticulturalists. The Huaorani are very conscious of past human activity, and are perfectly aware of the fact that every aspect of their forested territory has been transformed in equal measure by their ancestors, other indigenous groups, and the forces of nature and the supernatural. Taking the forest to be a legacy from the past, they have developed an understanding of the forest as owing its existence to past human activities. The forest exists to the extent that humans in the past lived and worked in it, and by so doing produced it as it is today for the benefit and use of the living. Their relation with the forest is lived as a social relation with themselves across generations, hence its eminently historical character. Trekking for the Huaorani is not simply a mundane activity relating to the pragmat- ics of subsistence and to environmental or historical adaptation, but, rather, a funda? mental way of reproducing society through time (Rival 2002). The Huaorani do not experience or represent their lack of intensive horticulture as a regression to a pre-social state (see Fausto 2001 for similar findings among the Parakana). Their lesser reliance on garden products may well result from specific rep? resentations of the world and from political choices pre-dating the Conquest. They contrast trekking and village life as two different types of sociality, linked to different styles of feasting and celebrating natural abundance. Moreover, they practise and rep? resent trekking not only as a conscious form of adaptation to a landscape modified by past occupants, but also as a form of protection against predators. Animal predation and plant fructification thus become the contrastive sources of cultural representations which mediate the relation between environmental change and historical events. Huaorani trekking, the constant oscillation between a more horticultural and a more foraging mode of life, represents an unstable socio-political resolution half-way between two unsustainable extremes: peace and expansion; and war and destruction. Cultural creativity and political agency are therefore key components in the formation of anthropogenic forests (Rival 2002). Trekking, far from representing a necessary intermediary stage in the regression from sedentary agriculture to foraging, may, in some cases, constitute a sui generis solution to deep, contradictory forces of a politi? cal, religious, and social nature. Such internal processes may have long predated the Conquest and the disruptions it caused. I contend that a good understanding of Huaorani history and of its relationship with the natural history of the forest requires not only the examination of historiographic documents, as defended by post-colonial historians, and a botanical study of forest dynamics, as so cogently argued by Balee, but also an analysis of beliefs and values. For it is with such ideas in their minds that the Huaorani have become ecological and historical agents of change. Balee has taken maximization theorists and other cultural ecologists to task for understanding adaptation to the environment in purely evolutionary terms, and for failing to recognize that a part of the Amazon forest to which indigenous people have adapted is not pristine, wild, or natural but, rather, an environment historically trans? formed by human production and consumption activities. While Balee's model illu- minates some aspects of Amazonian historical ecology, the notion of cultural loss fails to explain the cultural logic embedded within a unique system of resource use, which drastically reduces dependence on cultivated crops. Like the Brazilian groups discussed by Balee, the Huaorani, for instance, have chosen to flee away from coercive powers and have adopted a wandering way of life. Although we will probably never know whether they descend from sedentarized and sophisticated cultivators, there is little doubt that they have wandered for centuries, and have always depended more on /.

Their way of life and their long co-existence with more powerful, stratified, and complex agricultural societies cannot be explained with a model which aims to account for the progressive loss of cultivation by marginal tribes affected by disease, depopulation, and warfare. The reliance on resources created in the past by trekkers such as the Huaorani may be a characteristic shared by other Upper Amazon trekkers and foragers, such as the Maku, Nukak, and Hoti (Rival 1999)? Highly mobile, nomadic, Amazonian societies have depended chiefly on hunting and gather? ing for centuries. People may cultivate, but they spend more time, and are far more interested in, collecting food from the forest than planting and cultivating. This cultural orientation and way of life cannot be explained away with reference to the environment and its conditionalities, or to history as a source of disruption and disintegration. A proper analysis of nomad foragers entails taking into consideration the anthropomorphic nature of their environment, as well as their cultural orienta? tion, which strongly emphasizes life in the present. Writing the history of landscapes Research on the Amazon region has focused, perhaps more than in any other region of the world, on the history of the landscape. This is due to the fact that Amazonia is characterized, as Clement so rightly puts it, by 'a strong relationship between landscape and plant domestication' (1999: 191).7 However, it is important to note the centrality of the concept of landscape for historical ecology as a whole. Landscape is the physi? cal manifestation of the long-term human history of the environment. The goal is to document and understand the long-term creation of the environment as we know it today. This understanding may provide models for strategies of conservation and man? agement of the environment in the present and future (Sutton &amp; Anderson 2004: 27). Hardesty and Fowler write that historical ecology aims to describe 'landscape histories (ecohistories) at various scales and from various perspectives. This means searching the landscape for historical evidence of how they were created and changed by both human activity and natural processes, and the interactions between the two' (2001: 78). Crumley (2001: viii) defines landscape as the material manifestation of the relation between humans and the environment, and historical ecology, or landscape history, as the study of past ecosystems by charting the change in landscape over time. Writing the history of a particular landscape allows us to develop a form of anthropological inquiry that is more attentive to historical detail, as well as a kind of history which contains more holistic cultural and environmental data than normally used (see also Cronon 1995). As defined by historical ecologists, 'landscape' becomes a bridge between a whole range of disciplines and sub-disciplines pertaining to both the natural sciences and the humanities. Sutton and Anderson (2004: 27) attribute historical ecology's special concern with landscape to cultural geographer Carl Sauer, who wrote the seminal 'The morphology of landscape' in 1925. For Sauer, landscape served as a common ground especially between anthropology, archaeology, and geography. It is important to remember the close collaboration that existed between Kroeber and Sauer in Berkeley during the 1930s and the 1940s. In her biography of Julian Steward, Kern mentions that Kroeber and Sauer offered seminars together, co-ordinated their research projects, and served as members of doctoral committees in each other's department. The two men shared many interests, particularly in cultural /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S79-S94 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="13">Laura Rival S91 history, as well as a strongly Germanic worldview. ... At one time they discussed the possibility of a joint department, and Loeb, billed an 'anthropogeographer,' taught in both departments on occasion. ... For years, some graduate students from anthropology considered geography a second home, and those from geography routinely took courses with Kroeber and Lowie ... (2003: 88-9). Steward, who worked in both archaeology and ethnology during most of his pro? fessional life, was greatly influenced by both Kroeber and Sauer, and the recent trilogy on the cultivated landscapes of native America written by Carl Sauer's former students Denevan (2001), Doolittle (2000), and Whitmore and Turner (2001) com- bines insights from archaeology, physical and cultural geography, ethnography, and ecology. As Tsing remarks, studying nature in the making forces us to ask the ques? tion: cHow does human action shape nature, and how does nature shape human action?' (2001: 5). The concept of landscape enables historical ecologists to answer this question not only retrospectively, that is, with reference to cthe historically specific form of human and non human interaction that makes up the environmental project' (Tsing 2001: 5), but also with reference to the social, cultural, and political choices that are made today and that will influence the shape and the structure of future landscapes. NOTES 1 As defined here, Amazonia includes the lowland tropical and subtropical regions east of the Andes, that is, the Amazon Basin, the Orinoco Basin, and the Guiana shield. 2 Other authors such as Gary Nabhan and Sara St Antoine (1993) speak of 'the extinction of experience,' and the link between such extinction and the processes of acculturation that promote language shift and cultural assimilation. 3 'Where the land is arable, horticulture is to be expected. The absence of horticulture requires an expla? nation that [need] not be based on environmental determinism' (Balee 1999: 26-7). 4'The smaller a society gets, the more nomadic it becomes' (Balee 1992: 51). 5 In the 'wild yam' controversy, Balee's thesis would therefore side with Bailey et al. (1989) and Bailey and Headland (1991) against Bahuchet, McKey, and de Garine (1991), for it supports the contention that no hunter-gatherer could have adapted to tropical rain-forest habitats without being surrounded by cultivators. 6 '[P]robably all these forms of agriculture and agroforestry were present in the terra firme in a mosaic of variable population densities that may have included sectors of sparse semi-nomadic foragers; small but per- manently settled households and extended families; and in some selected places large and permanent fields and associated villages ...' (Denevan 1996:159-61). 7 Although working with a very different kinds of data, Philippe Descola (1994) reaches a similar conclu? sion when he talks about the symbolic domestication of nature by the Achuar.

Les ecologies historiques d'Amazonie Resume L'ecologie historique peut etre definie comme une tentative d'analyse diachronique de systemes ecologiques en vue de rendre compte plus completement de leurs proprietes structurelles et fonction- nelles. Cette discipline, qui se veut plus une approche ou une strategie de recherche qu'un paradigme, est axee sur une question essentielle : Quelles est la relation entre les changements environnementaux et le developpement historique des societes humaines ? L'ecologie historique, partie integrante de la nouvelle anthropologie ecologique, cherche a de-reifier les concepts de nature et de culture et a repenser sous un angle critique la complexite de Funivers biologique, en particulier la distinction entre le sauvage et le domestique qui, comme on le sait, inspire aujourd'hui nombre de recherches scientifiques sur la biodi- versite.

Les connaissances actuelles du biome amazonien, bien plus complexe qu'on ne pouvait le savoir au moment de la publication du Handbook of South Amer? ican Indians entre la fin des annees 1940 et le debut des annees 1950, nous permettent de repenser l'oc- cupation de l'Amazonie par les humains et leur adaptation aux ecosystemes amazoniens, de redefinir les formes qui ont modele les dimensions materielles de la vie sociale, et de reconnaitre que les chasseurs- cueilleurs amazoniens ont joue un role determinant dans la formation de la foret qu'ils occupent depuis des millenaires. L'auteur affirme egalement que le mode de subsistance itinerant, loin d'etre une etape intermediaire necessaire dans la regression de l'horticulture a la chasse et a la cueillette, constitue dans certains cas une solution en soi, repondant a des forces profondes et contradictoires, qu'elles soient poli? tiques, religieuses ou sociales. Il est tres possible que ces processus internes aient debute bien avant la con- quete espagnole et les bouleversements qu'elle a entraines. L'auteur en conclut que les chasseurs nomades de la Haute Amazonie ont peut-etre en commun le fait de dependre de ressources floristiques produites directement ou indirectement par des actions humaines passees.
