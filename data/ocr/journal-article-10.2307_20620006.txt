<plain_text><page sequence="1">138 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY COLLECTIVITY AND CIRCULARITY* ccording to a common claim, a necessary condition for a collective action (as opposed to a mere set of intertwined or JL JLparallel actions) to take place is that the notion of collective action figures in the content of each participant's attitudes. Insofar as this claim is part of a conceptual analysis, it gives rise to a circularity challenge that has been explicitly addressed by Michael Bratman and Christopher Kutz.1 I will briefly show how the problem arises within Bratman's and Kutz's analyses, and then proceed to criticize some possible re sponses, including the ones proposed by Bratman and Kutz. My conclusion is that in order to avoid circularity and retain the features that are supposed to make this sort of account attractive, we need a notion of collectivity that does not presuppose intention. I suggest that we should make a distinction between collective and noncollec tive activity merely in terms of dispositions and causal agency. There are independent reasons to think that we actually possess such a distinct causal conception of collectivity. It is not necessary for the participants in a jointly intentional collective action to possess a stronger notion of their intended collective activity than this. In par ticular, they do not need to possess the concept of a jointly inten tional collective action. Bratman discusses the circularity challenge to his theory of collective action in "Shared Cooperative Activity," and "I Intend That We /" (ibid.). In his account, collective actions spring from shared inten tions, and "our shared intention" should be understood in terms of I. THE CIRCULARITY CHALLENGE * Versions of this article have been presented at the Higher Seminar in Practical Philosophy in Lund, at ECAP V in Lisbon (2005), and at Collective Intentionality V in Helsinki (2006). I am grateful to participants in these seminars and conferences for valuable criticism and suggestions. I am also indebted to Michael Bratman for helpful comments on an earlier version of the paper, to Margaret Gilbert for useful suggestions in conversation, and to anonymous referees for proposals about clarifications. This article was prepared as part of a research project for the Swedish Science Council. 1 Bratman, "Shared Cooperative Activity," in Faces of Intention (New York: Cambridge, 1999), pp. 93-109, see p. 97 (originally published in The Philosophical Review, ci (1992): 327-41), and "I Intend That We J" in Faces of Intention, pp. 142-65, see p. 148 (origi nally published in Raimo Tuomela and Ghita Holmstr?m-Hintikka, eds., Contemporary Action Theory (Boston: Kluwer, 1997), pp. 49-64); Kutz, Complicity (New York: Cam bridge, 2000), see p. 86. 0022-362X/07/0403/138-56 ? 2007 The Journal of Philosophy, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">COLLECTIVITY AND CIRCULARITY 139 each of us having an intention of the form T intend that we What is it, then, that I intend when I intend that we J? How does this in tention of mine differ from, say, an intention of the form T intend to contribute to J-ing'? It is tempting to think that 'we /' as it appears in the content of my intention, must refer to a collective action, pre supposing shared intention. In that case, though, the account will not help us to a better understanding of what it means for an intention to be shared, and for an action to be collective. It will not provide the meaning of "sharedness." In his book Complicity, Kutz contrasts his own account of collective action with a reductionist view, according to which such acts can be seen as sums of individual choices "on the basis of expectations about the choices to be made by those with whom they wish to coordinate" (ibid., p. 75). Kutz argues that this would be insufficient, and claims that "the core, minimalist, notion of collective action requires ... that individuals act on overlapping participatory intentions" (ibid.). Im plicit in the idea of a participatory intention is "a conception that one is doing one's part in a collective project" (ibid., p. 76). Participatory intentions are a special class of intentions, "differentiated by their group-oriented content" (ibid., p. 86). The content of this type of intention is "irreducibly collective" (ibid.). So, the question is whether we can understand what kind of content these participatory inten tions have without understanding the concept of a collective action in the first place.2 II. RESPONSES Bratman's first response to the circularity challenge was to assume that we should appeal to act descriptions "characterized in co operatively neutral ways."3 My individual intention must refer to an act of the sort that may be cooperative but need not be. The act description must satisfy the "behavioral conditions" for joint activities 2 Margaret Gilbert's theory of collective action is a third example of an analysis that is open to a circularity challenge of the kind discussed here. "What is key is the incorporation of an holistic notion of joint commitment. The formulation [in On Social Facts, p. 198] correctly implies that the parties to any joint commitment must possess this notion"?"The Structure of the Social Atom: Joint Commitment as the Foundation of Human Social Behavior," in Frederic Schmitt, ed., Socializing Metaphysics (Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2003), pp. 39-65, on p. 53. So, the individual states in which the notion of joint commitment must occur are also necessary conditions for a joint commitment to obtain. Since her approach differs in important aspects from Bratman's and Kutz's (she regards the enterprise as essentially nor mative, and it not evident that her account of how joint commitments are created should be read as a conceptual analysis), it would reach too far to give a fair treatment of her view here. 3 Bratman, "Shared Cooperative Activity," p. 97.</page><page sequence="3">140 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY without presupposing "the attitudes essential to cooperative activity." "There is, for instance, a clear sense in which we can go to New York together or paint the house together without our activity being cooperative" (ibid.). This initial response to the circularity challenge, Bratman claims, is similar to a common way of escaping circularity in the analysis of "intentional action." If we want to say that an action is performed intentionally when it is explained by the right kind of attitudes, we must "eschew appeal to attitudes that include in their content the very idea of intentional action. Instead, we limit ourselves to contents that, at most, involve a concept of action that leaves it open whether the action is intentional."4 Margaret Gilbert objects to Bratman that it is unclear how he construes 'that we /' in T intend that we She suspects, though, that "he has an individualistic construal in mind. Consider his central case of painting the house together. I shall take it that he construes my intending that we paint the house together as some thing like this: my intending that the house is painted by virtue of my actions along with complimentary actions of yours."5 In that reading, though, the analysis will fail to capture intuitions about a stronger sense of "sharedness" or "collectivity" in action, which prompted the need for revising standard theory of action to begin with. Gilbert's objection might seem unfair in the light of Bratman's further restrictions on shared intention, which require that inter dependence and interlocking subplans also figure in the partici pant's conception of 'our ^ing'. In terms of the full necessary and sufficient conditions of Bratman's analysis, we have a shared inten tion to smash the window if and only if (1) (a) I intend that we smash the window and (b) you intend that we smash the window; and (2) I intend that we smash the window in accordance with and because of (la), (lb), and meshing subplans of (la) and (lb), and you intend similarly; and (3), (1) and (2) are common knowledge between us. However, I think that Bratman's initial strategy against circularity nevertheless makes Gilbert's doubts reasonable. According to that strategy, it must be left open whether the 'we smash the window', as it occurs in the content of your intention and my intention, is a case of shared intention. Suppose I want the window smashed. When I note your presence on the street, I think that if you act in a certain way, the window can be smashed as a result of both our acts, and I form an intention accordingly. What I intend in that case is merely to get the 4 Bratman, "I Intend That We //' p. 147. 5 Gilbert, Sociality and Responsibility (Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2000) p. 156.</page><page sequence="4">COLLECTIVITY AND CIRCULARITY 141 window smashed, while predicting that your actions will be com ponents in the process leading to that result. This prediction may rest upon my knowledge that your intentions are similar to mine, and that our subplans are likely to mesh in a way that enables me to reach my goal. There is mutuality and interdependence, in line with Bratman's requirements. Still, I would say, nothing in this picture captures "sharedness" or "collectivity" in any sense distinct from what we can construe in terms of standard individualistic theory of action. What we have is a complex set of individual intentions, beliefs about other people's intentions, and means-ends reasoning. In other words, if the characterization of a shared intention allows the individual intentions that make it up to be directed towards a mere set of actions that happen to be grouped together in a purely behavioral sense, the distinction between a shared intention and a set of individual noncooperative intentions will be undermined. The additional conditions do not suffice to ground collectivity. (It is even more apparent that this strategy would not work in Kutz's case, since he explicitly states that additional conditions such as mutual knowl edge, interdependent subplans, and so on, are superfluous.) Bratman's analogy between avoidance of circularity about "inten tional action" and about "collective action" is somewhat misleading. Collective and individual intentional actions both belong to the species of "intentional action." The present way of drawing the dis tinction between them presupposes that the intentions that explain an act (in a way that makes the act intentional) contain a reference to the acting unit itself?the individual or the collective. Without presupposing any references to intention, it seems unproblematic to conceive of an individual acting unit, and to imagine that sort of conception placed in the content of an intention to act individually. The trouble here is that if shared intentions are supposed to be what ties members together in a collective unit, it seems unavoidable that we refer to those very intentions when we characterize the concep tion of the acting unit that is supposed to figure in their distinctive content. The natural solution working for intentional action?to avoid reference to attitudes involving the concept to be defined?has a higher price when applied to "collective action." So, Bratman's first solution seems to make the theory more reductionist than it was supposed to be. With explicit reference to an earlier work by Kutz, he also appears to acknowledge this in the later paper.6 This brings us to the second response. In Bratman's terms, that 6 Bratman, "I Intend That We //' pp. 147-48.</page><page sequence="5">142 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY alternative strategy is to "seek basic cases in which each participant intends a joint activity understood in a way that is neutral with respect to shared intentionality.... We then try to understand those cases in which the agent's conception of the shared activity explicitiy supposes it is a shared activity, in a way that builds on our understanding of these basic cases" (ibid., p. 148). Kutz notes that there are cases where it seems proper to say that an intention is directed towards a jointly intentional activity. "[T]he intentions to perform many kinds of jointly intentional acts cannot be made sense of except in collective terms: noncooperative chess is not chess but something else?mutual chess solitaire" (op. cit, p. 86). "[TJhere is no way to characterize the intention of an individual planning to dance the tango except as an intention to engage in jointly intentional tango dancing" (ibid.). The proper response to the circularity challenge, according to Kutz, is therefore not "an analysis that tries to show how each instance of collective action is built out of non-collective materials, but rather a genealogical account that shows generally how the capacity to engage in collective action emerges out of capacities explicable without reference to collective concepts" (ibid.). This article discusses circularity in the definition of "collective action." This second response by Kutz and Bratman in dicates that what they have in mind could be another issue?about circularity in the explanation of collective actions. What we need, in Kutz's words, is "a genealogical account that shows generally how the capacity to engage in collective action emerges out of capacities explicable without reference to collective concepts" (ibid.).7 Roughly, it says that the content of an executive intention (that is, an intention regarding an outcome as a whole, whose function is to generate and command other subsidiary intentions) can come to refer to a jointly intentional act through a kind of bootstrapping interaction with sim pler noncollective intentions, which then gradually become subsidi ary to it. In learning to play chess, I first conceive of the elements of the game in nonjoint terms: the knight moves so and so; it is best to open with pawns; and if you threaten my queen, I should check your king. As I learn to play, these constituent elements of chess come to be represented and internalized as "my playing chess," or, alternatively, "my doing my part of our playing chess together." By such a bootstrapping process, the 7 A similar genealogical response to the circularity challenge, along with the claim that the ensuing conception of jointness should be regarded as primitive, is suggested by Frederic Schmitt (on behalf of Gilbert) in the introduction to Socializing Metaphysics, P. 11.</page><page sequence="6">COLLECTIVITY AND CIRCULARITY 143 collective joint activity thus becomes the object of an agent's executive intention, having been built out of noncollective elements.8 This response meets one sort of circularity worry, by describing how an intention directed toward a jointly intentional activity can emerge from other sorts of intentions. One could imagine a similar response to Hume's circularity insinuation against the idea that a desire to act justly is what explains a just act.9 The reply to Hume would then perhaps describe how the desire to perform a just action emerges out of purely self-interested desires. That would show how one might explain the desire in question, and thereby the performance of a just act, in a noncircular way. Explanans does not have to contain explanandum just because the explanation refers to an attitude in the content of which a conception of explanandum figures. Assume, though, that Hume's argument should instead be understood as a claim about circularity in definition, directed towards an analysis of the following sort: A 'just act' should be understood as 'an act performed out of the right kind of motive', and 'the right kind of motive' means 'a desire to act justly'. That would be an analytically circular definition, and the genealogical response would not remove its circularity. If the definition is supposed to provide the meaning of 'just act', it fails. In order to understand what it is that a person comes to desire when a desire to act justly emerges, we would have to know what a just act is to begin with. The challenge to be met here is that in order to make clear what it means for an intention to have an "irreducibly collective con tent," we must avoid references to collective action. Otherwise, we cannot avoid circularity in the definition of the latter concept. Kutz's description could be regarded as a response to the accusation that explanans contains explanandum. It might also be read as a de fense of the individualistic presupposition that the capacity to act collectively cannot be just as basic as the capacity to act individually. The account above describes how intentions directed towards jointly intentional activities can emerge, on that presupposition. But the initial circularity challenge is neutral with respect to this individ ualistic assumption, as well as to the question about circularity in explanation. The challenge is not that intentions with a noncollec tive content must come before intentions with a collective content, but that we need a characterization of the content of the com ponents referred to in the definition of a collective action?a 8 Kutz, Complicity, pp. 87-88. 9 Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, book III, part II, section I.</page><page sequence="7">144 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY characterization that does not rely on that very concept. This re quirement is reasonable independently of which genesis we assume that these components have. As far as I can see, Kutz's strategy fails to meet that challenge. Even if his story above is correct, we still want to know what makes an action collective. What kind of entity is it that becomes the object of the agent's intention through the bootstrap ping process? His answer, like Bratman's, seems to be that the action turns collective when the executive intentions of the individuals contributing to it become directed towards a jointly intentional achievement. That answer brings us back to the original circularity challenge, independently of how we think that these executive in tentions come into existence. A third response to the challenge would be to argue that the analysis is sufficiently informative in spite of its being circular. Kutz hints at that strategy when he claims that the circularity problem is "more method ological than substantive." He also notes approvingly that Bratman has "relaxed his strictures" in this matter (ibid.). However, neither Bratman nor Kutz makes clear in which sense and to which extent the strictures concerning circularity should be relaxed in this specific context. Circular analyses may be informative and explanatory. Philoso phers have offered nonreductive explications of (for example) nor mative and modal concepts, while presupposing some primitive notion of modality or normativity. That sort of analysis might be the best we can do in some cases. Network definitions that place a con cept within a larger scheme of interrelated concepts can be in formative even if each concept is defined entirely in terms of others within the scheme. And so on. One thing that may make some inclined to accept circularity in the present case is that the analysis merely suffers from what I.L. Humberstone calls analytical circularity. It is not inferentially circular.10 Inferential circularity is generally vicious, while analytical circularity "might not always be a bad thing" according to Humberstone (ibid., p. 254). Suppose we claim that a necessary con dition for T smash the window intentionally' to be true is that I know that I smash the window intentionally (and that knowledge pre supposes truth). This would be a case of inferential circularity. If you know that this specific component of the analysis applies to a case, you already know that the concept analyzed applies. You cannot know that I know that I smash the window intentionally unless you 10 Humberstone, "Two Types of Circularity," Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, lvii, 2 (1997): 249-80.</page><page sequence="8">COLLECTIVITY AND CIRCULARITY 145 know that I smash it intentionally. So, the analysis would neither enhance our understanding of the meaning of the term "intentional action," nor improve our ability to apply the term to the right kind of objects. But suppose we want to analyze the notion of acting col lectively, in the strong sense of "acting with a shared intention." We assume that a necessary condition for 'we smashed the window col lectively' to be true is that our smashing the window was explained by my intending that we smash the window and your intending that we smash the window. (The two latter occurrences of 'we smash the window' should be taken as presupposing shared intention.) In that case, we still have analytical circularity?the concept analyzed ap pears (implicitly) in a component of the analysis. However, this would not suffice to make the analysis inferentially circular, since we could know that the conception of a collective action, involving the notion of shared intention, appeared in the contents of your inten tion, without knowing that 'we smashed the window collectively' ap plies to the case. As Humberstone puts it, the concept analyzed has a suitably protective embedding in this specific condition. Analytically circular analyses often occur in contexts where we have a common pre-theoretical understanding of the concept analyzed, but a controversy or uncertainty concerning the applicability of the term to some given type of item. In such cases, we may regard the list of application conditions "not so much as a way of getting the concept across to someone not familiar with it, but as a recipe for telling us when it applies" (ibid,, p. 251). This possible excuse for analytical circularity does not apply here. "Collective action" is not alleged to be like "art"?a concept of which we have a common pre-theoretical understanding while we some times need to be informed about boarders for application. On the contrary, the starting point for analyses of "collective action" is an assumption about what kind of entities this concept applies to. Proponents of the concept (like Bratman, Gilbert, and Kutz) typically focus salient cases of cooperative, joint action, as opposed to mere parallel behavior. The analytical task they set themselves is to make clear how the description of these phenomena should be fitted into some overall action-theoretical framework. As Humberstone and Roseanna Keefe both stress, the purpose of the analysis determines whether we should accept its circularity.11 Circularity should at least not be accepted when "it obstructs the 11 Keefe, "When Does Circularity Matter?" Proceedings from the Aristotelian Society, en (2002): 253-70.</page><page sequence="9">146 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY transfer of understanding the application conditions of a concept may be designed to effect."12 One sort of understanding that a definition of "collective action" should provide is practical. Although the theories discussed here are descriptive, they will have relevance in moral and legal contexts. (Kutz explicitly builds his theory about legal and moral accountability on his analysis of "collective action.") To assess normative claims about group actions and participation, we need to know what it is that the individuals are supposed to intend or be committed to when a collective action is said to emerge from their attitudes. Since the circularity discussed here makes it unclear what kind of objects these attitudes have, it obstructs the transfer of one important kind of understanding that these analyses are designed to effect. I suppose that the main theoretical purpose of the analyses at hand is to establish a substantial distinction between collective actions and noncollective sets of individual actions. Circularity clearly threatens that aim. So, in this case, analytical circularity is a methodological problem, and a substantive one. III. COLLECTIVITY WITHOUT INTENTION Bratman suggested initially that circularity could be avoided by appealing to act descriptions that satisfy the behavioral conditions for joint activities but do not presuppose shared intention. On that assumption, there is no reference to shared intention in the notion of joint activity that is supposed to figure in the content of the individual T intend that we /'-intention. My complaint was that if we skip that implicit reference, Bratman's theory does not uphold the distinction between a collective action, and a set of individual interdependent actions. The additional conditions about mutual interdependence, and the like, are insufficient for that. However, I believe that Bratman's suggestion could be elaborated. An act description might be neutral with respect to shared intention without being neutral about collectivity. The strategy is to employ a broad concept of collective activity that does not presuppose shared intention but is nevertheless substantively distinct from the notion of a mere set of intertwined acts. That might require the description to go beyond mere behavior, though not very far. Susan Hurley employs a useful notion of a "unit of activity."13 She does not offer any precise explicit definition, but develops the 12 Humberstone, "Two Types of Circularity," p. 251. 13 Hurley, "Rational Agency, Cooperation, and Mind-Reading," in Natalie Gold, ed., Teamwork, Multi-Disciplinary Perspectives (New York: Palgrave, 2004), pp. 200-15.</page><page sequence="10">COLLECTIVITY AND CIRCULARITY 147 conception by utilizing it in a series of arguments directed towards an individualistic presupposition about instrumental rationality. An important point is that the root of problems of coordination and cooperation (exemplified, for example, by prisoner's dilemmas) is not "the nature of the individuals' goals, or the instrumental char acter of rationality. Rather it is individualism about rationality, which holds the unit of activity exogenously fixed at the individual" (ibid., p. 201). Like Philip Pettit and others, Hurley thinks that consider ations from game theory and social choice theory suggest that we must allow collectives to be regarded as agents or units of activity. She denies, though, that this must involve regarding the unit of activity as the source of the evaluation of outcomes. "Thus, collective activity does not require collective goals or preferences.... That is, collective action does not require that individual preferences be shared or even aggregated into some collective preference" (ibid., p. 202). No joint goals, preferences, or intentions are required. If a definition of "unit of activity" could be extracted from Hurley's account, it would be purely operational. Roughly, a unit of activity is an entity for which options can be evaluated instrumentally, at least from a spectator's point of view. "When I speak of a unit of activity, I mean that activity within certain boundaries (which may be defined in spatial or other terms) has consequences, calculated against a background of what happens and is done outside those boundaries; the consequences of this activity can be evaluated instrumentally, in light of the goals of the unit or parts of it" (ibid., p. 201). Now, if a collective activity does not require shared preferences, goals, or intentions, where then is the glue that keep the participants together in a unit?14 To frame the question differently, are there any essential intrinsic features that distinguishes collective units of activity from mere sets of agents? How do we distinguish a member from a nonmember? Hurley offers several suggestions about how collective units of activity can be formed, and about how their boundaries become determined. One approach focuses "the capacity to identify with others as part of a collective unit of activity" (ibid., p. 208). The ability to attribute mental states to others plays an important role for the development of that capacity, Hurley argues. However, "each par ticipant's identification with the others as part of a collective unit of activity" cannot be taken as conceptually essential to a unit of activity. 14 This was Bratman's rhetorical question at Hurley's presentation of the paper I mainly refer to here (Collective Intentionality IV, Siena 2004).</page><page sequence="11">148 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY To begin with, this would actualize a circularity challenge. Further more, "unit of activity," as Hurley employs the term, applies to entities apparently incapable of identification, at least of the sort requir ing the possession of intentionalistic concepts. Slime mould can form units of activity. "An ant colony can be regarded as a unit of activity governed by various local chemical signals that determine the behavior of individual ants" (ibid., p. 206). It seems compatible with Hurley's use of the term to regard any entity as a unit of activity as long as it produces consequences such that it makes sense for a spectator to evaluate these effects in terms of goals assigned to the entity. Hurley stresses that different units of activity have different causal powers. Attributing such powers to an entity appears to be a condition for regarding the entity as having options to begin with. My sug gestion is that that the problem of what binds a unit of activity together could be solved in terms of causal powers or dispositional properties. This solution is based on the assumption that assignments of dispositional properties carry with them defining limits of the object to which these properties are assigned. To regard an entity as having causal powers or dispositions is to view that entity as a causal agent.15 This notion of an agent is even weaker than Hurley's "unit of activity." Assignments of purely causal agency do not presuppose that any goals can be assigned to the agent in question. All causal agents are not units of activity in Hurley's sense. This use of the terms "agent" and "agency" might seem linguisti cally inappropriate to some. Perhaps they would say, with Donald Davidson, that agency by definition is intentional under some de scription: "a man is the agent of an act if what he does can be de scribed under an aspect that makes it intentional."16 "I am the agent if I spill the coffee meaning to spill the tea, but not if you jiggle my hand" (ibid., pp. 45-46). My spilling the contents of the cup is inten tional, and that aspect is what makes me an agent of (unintentionally) spilling coffee. However, we sometimes categorize as acts reflexes, twitches, manifestations of common clumsiness, and other types of behavior, which are not intended under any description. They fall under the 15 Tim Crane employs this term when he exposes his view that dispositions are independent causes. See Crane, "The Efficacy of Content," in Jan Bransen and Stefan E. Cuypers, eds., Human Action, Deliberation and Causation (Boston: Kluwer, 1998), pp. 199-225, on p. 220. 16 Davidson, "Agency" (1971) in his Essays on Actions and Events (New York: Oxford, 1980), pp. 43-61, on p. 46.</page><page sequence="12">COLLECTIVITY AND CIRCULARITY 149 notion of agency as different types of unintentional activities. Under the adjective 'reflex', the Oxford English Dictionary lists 'reflex action (independent of the will, caused as automatic response to nerve stimulation)' and the noun 'reflex' is said to be synonymous with 'reflex action'. When I unknowingly talk loud to myself, or when I sneeze, you may think of me as doing something. How, then, do these sorts of acts differ from things that merely happen to me, like when my hair grows or the earth beneath me moves me away from the sun? We cannot appeal to the empirical fact that I cannot choose to influence the latter sorts of events.17 That inability is part of the story about reflexes as well. These are acts I cannot help doing. Verbs such as 'grow' or 'move' can be used to refer to processes or tendencies, or to activities. A man's hair grows, and he may also grow a beard. The ferry moves me away from the island, and I may actively move away from things. Growing a beard and moving away from things can be actions that are intentional under some description. However, that active sense of 'grow' or 'move' does not entail the presence of any intention. A plant grows, but it is also capable of growing a new bud, as well as of moving its leaves towards the sun. Without resorting to anthropomorphism, we might even explicitly say about a chemical, that it acts upon a certain substance by making it corrode or dissolve, and we may point to explanatory conditions as being responsible for their effects. These everyday expressions indicate that ordinary speakers are capable of distinguishing a weak notion of agency, which is not intentional under any description. This way of speaking simply places the object in a certain causal role, and refers to an effect for which internal features of the object is a condition. The notion of agency we employ when we talk about reflexes and other types of human behavior without intentional aspects does not only bear a metaphorical resemblance to the causal notion characterized above. If you point out that your jiggling made me spill coffee, my causal role for that effect is stressed?although no intentions are in play. My spilling coffee is in this case something that I do, albeit unintentionally, so it is an act, but not in a stronger sense than the one outlined. The weak causal assumptions made about me in this case differ widely from the conditional state ments that would have to be true in order for me to intentionally spill coffee. 17 This is Irving Thalberg's suggestion about how to distinguish "action verbs" from "bodily process and reaction verbs"; see Enigmas of Agency (London: Allen and Unwin, 1972), p. 62. For more detailed criticism of this suggestion, see I. Persson, Reasons and Reason-governed Actions (Lund: Studenditteratur, 1981), p. 15.</page><page sequence="13">150 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Although the causal notion of acting is weaker than the concept of "acting that is intentional under some description," there is a substantial difference between descriptions in terms of causal agency and purely behavioral judgments. The latter are even less committing. The coffee incident could be described in purely behavioral terms?your hand comes in contact with my wrist, my hand trembles, this causes coffee to be spilt, and so on?and that sort of description would be neutral with respect to causal agency. Similarly, we could describe the series of events that occur when the liquid and the metal meet, while leaving the question of causal agency open. A description of our going to New York, or our painting the house, which merely satisfies the behavioral conditions for these activities, would in itself contain no commitments concern ing causal agency. Connected with the use of a broad merely causal notion of agency is a claim about dispositional properties. To say that the chemical acts upon a substance is to assume that there is some thing about the constitution of the chemical, which explains what happens to the substance under the actual conditions. 'The plant moves its leaves' (as compared to 'the plant's leaves move') contains a similar allegation about the constitution of the plant. If you stress that I was the one who spilled coffee, albeit unintentionally, you are im plicitly claiming that there is something about my features, which ex plain why I spilled coffee under those conditions. This sort of claim is closely associated with the assignment of a dispositional property to the object in question?in the last case, perhaps clumsiness or feebleness. When we explain what happens with the metal in terms of what the acid does to it, and thereby place the liquid in the role of the causal agent, we presuppose a specific level of explanation. If we were chem ists, we could have chosen to describe the process in terms of what the molecules do. We would then assign dispositional properties on the molecular level. Presumably, molecular dispositions form the base of the acid's disposition of being corrosive. That does not imply con ceptual reduction of descriptions of the latter to descriptions of the former. Even a chemist in the habit of thinking about chemical processes in molecular terms switches easily to macro-level descrip tions in contexts where it is linguistically inappropriate to go into molecular details when talking or thinking about what a certain chemical can do. Our choice of a certain object as the causal agent implicitly involves defining the unit to which causal powers are assigned (in the sense of drawing a boundary, not in the semantic sense of 'define'). The object's components belong to it in virtue of their roles for the object's intrinsic dispositional properties or causal powers. To regard</page><page sequence="14">COLLECTIVITY AND CIRCULARITY 151 a set of objects as one causal agent is to imply that something glues its components together, without being committed to the attribution of some specific glue. To illustrate my claim that disposition-assignments implicitly de fine the unit to which causal powers are attributed, let me use an example from the philosophical debate on the nature of dispositions. George Molnar presents the existence of "intrinsic maskers" of dispositions as a case against the idea that disposition-assignments can be reduced to conditional causal statements of a certain kind. According to Molnar, an object x may have a disposition D, and at the same time there may be another disposition intrinsic to x, D*, such that its being triggered prevents the manifestation of D. In trinsically masked dispositions, like the "power of ingested poison masked by the power of ingested antidote," are "everywhere once you start looking for them." (So, Molnar claims, we cannot reduce assignments of dispositions to talk about conditional predictions of their manifestations.)18 It is essential to Molnar's argument that the masking and the masked disposition are intrinsic to one and the same object. The assumption that they are intrinsic presupposes some boundary around whatever they are intrinsic to. Suppose substance y makes us tired. In the drug x this is outweighed by the effect of an addi tional substance z. We could say with Molnar that x has two dis positional properties. It is fatiguing, and it has the property of blocking manifestations of the first type of disposition. The drug then has two causal powers that happen to cancel each other out. A causal conditional analysis of dispositions would not admit that x possesses both these dispositions. On the other hand, we might deny that x has any dispositional properties of the kind mentioned. We could instead assign the property of being fatiguing to substance y, which is an element of x. That would be compatible with a (sufficiently subtle) conditional causal understanding of the disposi tion in question. My point is not that any of these two ways of regarding the matter would be more plausible than the other, but that they exploit 18Molnar, "Are Dispositions Reducible?" The Philosophical Quarterly, xlix (1999): 1-17, p. 5. 19 The "intrinsic maskers" example is meant to undermine even a subtle version of the conditional analysis, of the type proposed by David Lewis. See "Finkish Dispositions," The Philosophical Quarterly, xlvii (1997): 143-58. Lewis's analysis allows for the possibility of extrinsic maskers. If we assign the property of being fatiguing to substance y, and the property of blocking the manifestations of that disposition to substance z, the latter disposition would be an extrinsic masker of the first.</page><page sequence="15">152 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY different underlying assumptions about the individuation of the bearer of the dispositional property in question, and that any as signment of causal powers or dispositional properties comes with such implicit assumptions. Our responses to the "intrinsic maskers" problem will not only depend on our intuitions about the conditional analysis of dispositions, but also on our ways of determining the boundaries of their bearers.20 How much structure do we require from a set of entities before we start placing them within the boundaries of one causal agent? Vice versa, under what circumstances will we switch from viewing an object as one causal agent to regarding it as a set of distinct but perhaps interdependent causal agents? These are questions of pragmatics. Their answers depend on which level of assignment of causal agency that is most convenient for explanatory or predictive purposes in the context. Someone familiar with ecology may find it natural to think about what one species does to another, or to the ecosystem, while others would tend to regard a species of plants or animals as nothing but a loosely connected set of distinct units of agency. On the other hand, when it comes to saliently demarcated macroscopic objects, like a spot of acid on a metal plate, few of us find it useful to regard that as a mere conglomerate of causal agents. Only certain spectators with specific background knowledge and training do that, and only in special circumstances. There are also cases such that most of us switch easily between the two perspectives. Ant colonies or swarms of bees would be para digmatic examples. Evidently we are capable of thinking about a swarm of bees as a set of interdependent but distinct causal agents. We may also watch the swarm as one causal agent and think about what it might do, wonder what makes it fly this way rather than that, think that some of its acts seem unexpected, and so on. That way of thinking does not require much knowledge about what keeps the 20 Dispositions are the subject of an old but still ongoing metaphysical debate and few if any claims about their nature are uncontroversial. Two claims relating to the concept of dispositions are essential to my argument here. First, that regarding an entity as a causal agent?like when we think of the acid as acting upon the metal?is closely associated with assigning dispositional properties to the entity. Second, that assign ments of dispositional properties carry with them defining limits of the entities to which they are assigned. These are claims about commitments inherent in ordinary people's thinking and talking. My purpose here is to explicate a certain conception of causal agency that may figure in the content of ordinary people's attitudes. Although I think that these two assumptions are compatible with quite differing accounts of the nature of dispositions, they may not square with any such account. To explore the exact metaphysical implications of these proposals would reach beyond the ambitions of this paper, though.</page><page sequence="16">COLLECTIVITY AND CIRCULARITY 153 swarm together. You may think that it has something to do with chemical signals while the small child beside you has a completely different theory. What makes both of you regard the swarm as the unit of causal agency need not be any specific knowledge about its internal structure, but just that its behavior gives you reasons to think that there is some such structure. In a similar manner, we are capable of changing perspective when we regard the behavior of people. Without invoking any concept of intention, we may distinguish between the behavioral disposition of a group of agents, and the set of behavioral dispositions of its members. A group of people may be disposed to smash a shop window under certain conditions. The base of this disposition could be a set of behavioral dispositions of the group's members. This does not imply, though, that the behavioral disposition of the group is conceptually reducible to that set of individual dispositions. In other words, we can regard a group of individuals as the unit of causal agency, in a sense clearly distinct from that in which we view it as a set of causal agents. My contention is that to think of a set of individual actions as a collective activity is to regard the set as the causal agent. In regarding the group as the causal agent, we imply that there is some glue?there is something about the intrinsic features of the group and about the participants' role in the base of the group's causal powers, which dis tinguishes members from nonmembers?although we refrain from specifying this glue. This way of implying that there are internal features of an object responsible for the object's behavior, without specifying those internal features, is characteristic of any kind of as signment of dispositional properties. Typically, assignments of dispo sitions are informative and explanatorily valuable in cases where it is nontrivial that the explanation of an object's behavior is to be found among its internal features, although it would be impractical to go into the details of those features (because they are unknown, or it would take too long time, or be too costly for some other reason). The weak notion of collective activity, in which the group is con ceived of as the causal agent, is not an ad hoc construction, designed to save a certain type of account of collective action from circularity. There are, I think, independent reasons to regard this way of thinking about groups as part of common sense. Apparently, we have the capacity to lump things like bees together in a way that enables us to regard sets of them as distinct units of causal agency. I see no reason to think that this conceptual ability must make an exception when it comes to sets of people. One sort of indication of our possession of a concept of collectivity without intention is that there is some empirical evidence for</page><page sequence="17">154 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ascribing a conception of collectivity to two-year-old children.21 There is also well-known evidence strongly suggesting that the capacity to assign intentional states (beliefs, desires, intentions) to others as well as to ourselves is developed later in life?usually around four years.22 If both findings are correct, they prove that two-year-old children have a conception of collectivity that does not presuppose intention. However, experimenters' descriptions are unavoidably theory laden and empirical reports on issues like these are usually open to inter pretation in accordance with more than one conceptual scheme. When it comes to the claim that the weak notion of collectivity is an element in ordinary people's way of thinking and talking, I will in the end have to rely on appeal to linguistic intuitions. Suppose you are engaged in a discussion while walking with a small group of people. After a while, you all realize that you have walked past the place you were supposed to stop at. Each of you just auto matically followed the others without thinking about where you were heading. None of you intended to walk that far, let alone that the group should do so. Still, it seems plausible to regard your walking behavior as collective, in a sense distinct from a set of individual acts of walking that far. I would regard this as a typical example of a collective activity where no intentions concerning the collective activity (in this case, the activity of walking that far) bind the par ticipants together. The analysis suggested here provides a way of understanding how we can think of such activities as being collective in a distinct sense. IV. CONCLUSION When someone is watching us smashing the shop window, he can think of what we are doing as a collective activity?a result of the group's disposition being triggered. Then he simply thinks of the window's being smashed as explained by features of the group as a whole, and the group as the unit of causal agency. In other words, he can regard our behavior as collective, in a sense that does not presuppose shared intention. If each of us intends that the group smashes the window, and conceives of the intended activity as col lective, that is, of the set of agents as the unit of causal agency in what is intended, then we collectively intend to smash the window. (Here I 21 This empirical research was presented by Hannes Rakoczy, Max-Planck-Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, at Collective Intentionality IV, Siena 2004 ("Pretend Play and the Development of Collective Intentionality," work in progress). See, for example, A.

I leave it open which additional conditions, if any, that are needed.) To use a handy hypostatization, we might say that this set of I-intend-that-we intentions is a collective intention. Insofar as this collective intention is what explains our smashing the window, it is a collective action. We do not need to place the notion of a jointly intentional achievement in the content of the intentions of the parties to a collective action. The weaker notion of collective activity is sufficient for that role. Take a paradigm case of collective action. A good soccer player thinks partly in terms of how his or her team should act, not merely in terms of individual achievement. Suppose each player at a certain moment in a game, perhaps at a signal from the coach, starts thinking that the best thing for the team to do would be to settle with the present score and go for mere defense. They should not attempt to score more goals at the price of risking the points they have at present. Each player then comes to intend that the team becomes more defensive. That requires each of them to think about the team in a way that concerns the team's behavioral dispositions. This is the most convenient way of thinking about this change of strategy. They would think of the team as the unit of agency, and evaluate the options that lie within that unit's causal powers. I guess most of us can recognize this simple switch between an individual and a collective perspective on the behavior of a group to which we belong. It seems farfetched to require that the players conceive of their intended change of strategy as being like tango dancing, that is, an activity for which it is essential that each participant conceives of what they are doing as a jointly intentional activity. Occasionally thinking in that way about each other's engagement might be important for getting a greater enjoyment out of playing soccer, compared to the pleasure of playing computer games or solitaire, for instance. Simple group actions within the game do not require that sort of self-reflective awareness, though. My claim is that a weak notion of collective activity must figure in the content of the intentions of the parties to a collective action. That claim is nevertheless stronger than Bratman's initial proposal that it is sufficient that the act description, as it figures in the content of the agent's intention, merely satisfies the behavioral conditions for a joint activity. Such a description would be neutral with respect to causal agency. (A behavioral description like 'their arms move' makes no allegations about causal agency.) My additional requirement is that the notion of the team as the causal agent must enter that content. It might even be misleading to regard this requirement as appealing to</page><page sequence="19">156 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY intentions "characterized in cooperatively neutral ways," in line with Bratman's initial proposal.23 If we allow for a weak sense of coopera tion, corresponding to the notion of causal agency, ants, slime mould and molecules can be said to cooperate in relation to the effects of the unit of causal agency to which they belong. The implicit assumption about there being something that binds the elements together could, as far as I can see, be expressed in terms of "causal cooperation." Finally, I should make it clear that I do not deny that participants in some groups actually think of their intended common activity as being jointly intentional, that is, that they intend their collective activity to be a collective action. Each participant may intend that each participant intends the activity to be collective. It is essential to some individual action-types, like voting, that they are carried out intentionally. When I intend to vote, I conceive of this act as inten tional. In a similar manner, it may be essential to some collective action-types, like tango dancing, that they are jointly intentional. When we intend to dance a tango together, each of us conceives of our intended act as being jointly intentional. There is no reason to exclude the possibility of self-reflexive capacities of that sort. It is not implausible to think that such abilities may develop in the boot strapping manner Bratman and Kutz suggest. The important thing is that this higher-order capacity is inessential to the ability of per forming a jointly intentional collective act?a collective action. All collective actions do not have to be that sophisticated. BJ?RN PETERSSON Lund University 23 Bratman, "Shared Cooperative Activity," p. 97.</page></plain_text>
