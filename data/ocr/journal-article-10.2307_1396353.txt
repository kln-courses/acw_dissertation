<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eugene Korn GENTILES, THE WORLD TO COME, AND JUDAISM: THE ODYSSEY OF A RABBINIC TEXT* Since Jews began leaving the European ghettoes for mainstream Christian societies, they have been caught in the disparity between Jewish tradition and their new socio-political conditions. Living in open, pluralistic societies with pervasive exposure to gentiles and their culture has forced Jewish thinkers to grapple with the issue of how Jews should relate to the non-Jewish world. This subject raises com- pelling and ideologically charged questions even in our day: How does Jewish tradition assess the worth of gentiles who do not share its faith assumptions? According to Jewish law, is there any spiritual benefit to entering wider society and studying gentile intellectual dis- ciplines? Does Judaism value coexistence with non-Jews in an atmos- phere of social pluralism and true religious appreciation? Can Jews do so and maintain their traditional belief in the unique divinity of Mosaic revelation? I These questions seem distinctively modern, yet it is a medieval text that has provided a focal point for many Jewish thinkers struggling with these issues. The source is one of the most discussed passages in Maimonides' legal code, the Mishneh Torah. It appears in the Laws of Kings (Hilkhot Melakhim), 8:10-11. All printed editions of the text read as follows: 8:10. Moses our teacher bequeathed the Torah and the command- ments only to Israel, as it is said, "[It is an] inheritance of the con- gregation of Jacob," [Deut. 33:4] as well as one who wants to convert from the nations, as it is said, "[There shall be one law] for you and for the convert." [Numbers 15:15] However, one who does not wish *The author wishes to thank Professors Zev Harvey and Benny Kraut for their valuable suggestions to this paper.

Thus commanded Moses our teacher on the authority from God to compel all human beings to accept the commandments that were com- manded to Noah, and he who does not accept [them] is killed. One who accepts them is called everywhere a resident alien and he must accept them before three rabbis.... 8:11. Everyone who accepts the seven commandments [of Noah] and is careful to do them is of the righteous of the nations of the world and has a share in the world to come. This is so if he accepts them and does them because God commanded them in the Torah and made them known to us through Moses our teacher that Noah had previously been commanded [to observe] them. However, if he observes them out of his own rational considerations, he is not a resident alien, nor of the righteous of the nations of the world, nor of their wise men (velo me-hakhmehem). Maimonides' controversial text raises a host of philosophic, legal and theological issues that have long perplexed Jewish thinkers. This pas- sage echoes over the course of Jewish history, where Jewish thinkers living in different centuries transcended their temporal limits and engaged each other in debate. Although much of the discussion has centered on requirements of gentiles for entry in "the world to come," underlying the debate has always been the issue of how Judaism as- sesses gentiles and their culture. As is often the case, the eschatological discussion served to mask political, intellectual, and moral judgements about life in "this world." As we shall see, this same passage has been the source for contradictory responses and has informed diametrically opposed religious conceptions. At times it has nourished an open, pluralistic, and integrative religious sensibility and other times it has supported an isolationist worldview. In other words, our text has been used to argue for both modern and anti-modern ideologies. The context of Maimonides' injunctions in the Laws of Kings is his description of an ideal polity under Jewish sovereignty. While detailing the norms for how this Jewish society should be organized and governed, the questions arise whether this society would include non-Jews, and if so what their status and obligations would be. Hence the frame of reference is clearly political and the primary focus of laws 8:10 and 8:11 is the category of resident aliens. This text raises serious difficulties in three categories: logical, philosophical and moral. 1. Multiple logical problems are apparent. Even novice students of Maimonides recognize that his writing style in the Mishneh Torah is precise and complete. Maimonides' remarkable analytic powers enable him to express himself with linguistic elegance and logical coherence. He invariably defines his terminology, carefully establishes categories, 266 Eugene Korn</page><page sequence="3">Gentiles and the World to Come rarely introduces extraneous ideas, and inevitably weaves various log- ical strands into a coherent unity. Yet in this text Maimonides seems to be guilty of violating all of these standards. Maimonides mentions five categories of gentiles in 8:10-11: (1) Those who do not accept the seven Noahide commandments (pagans) (2) Noahites (benei Noah) (3) Resident aliens (gerei toshav) (4) Righteous gentiles (hasidei umot ha-olam), and (5) Wise gentiles (hakhmehem) In 8:10 Maimonides defines a ben Noah as one who accepts the seven Noahite laws and a ger toshav as one who proclaims his com- mitment to those laws before a rabbinic court. In 8:11 Maimonides defines the category of righteous gentiles as those who are careful to observe the Noahide laws and whose basis for acceptance is that "God commanded them in the Torah and made them known to us through Moses our teacher." Maimonides does this even though these are three well known categories that appear elsewhere in his writings and in the talmud. At the end of 8:11 Maimonides introduces an entirely new cate- gory, that of wise gentiles. Instead of offering a rigorous definition for this category, however, he merely proceeds to exclude one who accepts the seven Noahide laws out of exclusively autonomous delib- erations. Yet who is a wise gentile? How does he differ, if at all, from a righteous gentile? Quite inexplicably, Maimonides never defines a wise gentile, nor does he tell us who is included in this category, nor does he differentiate the wise gentile from the righteous gentile. In fact, since such sages remain indistinguishable from righteous gen- tiles, it is not apparent why Maimonides mentions this category at all.' This class of gentiles is not necessary to his main subject, that of non- Jews in the Jewish polity. As an independent category the class of wise gentiles lacks definition, and as a category coextensive with righteous gentiles it is superfluous. Such sloppy categorization is highly unusual in Maimonides' writing. Another lesser known logical problem lurks in the background. Throughout 8:10-11 Maimonides speaks of the acceptance of Noah- ide laws, uniformly employing the same Hebrew word 'lekabel' for all of the above categories. Near the end of 8:10 ("One who accepts them is called everywhere a resident alien.") he implies that the Noahite's acceptance and that of the resident alien are similar and the sole difference between the two categories is the procedural requirement that the resident alien proclaim his allegiance before a rabbinic court. Evidently the content of the resident alien's acceptance is identical to 267</page><page sequence="4">that of a Noahite. Yet in 8:1 1 Maimonides posits that belief in divine revelation is essential to the resident alien's acceptance of Noahide law. Thus due to the substantive identity of acceptance between the resident alien and the Noahite, it may be that Noahite must also accept revelation at Sinai.2 We will analyze the implications of this interpre- tation later, but consider now that under this reading the righteous gentile does not differ at all from the Noahite, since both have identical substantive requirements and neither requires formal acceptance by a court. Here again we are led to category confusion and logical imprecision so unlike Maimonides. 2. Philosophical problems arise from the unique requirement at the end of 8:11 that resident aliens, righteous gentiles and wise gen- tiles must accept the Noahide laws on the basis of divine revelation. More precisely, Maimonides insists that to qualify for any of these categories, one must accept specifically Jewish tradition's version of Mosaic revelation at Sinai ("God commanded them in the Torah and made them known to us through Moses our teacher"), not merely any heteronomous revelation. As Maimonides denies the appellation hak- ham to anyone who does not accept revelation at Sinai, it follows that wisdom can be found only among those who accept Sinaitic revelation and in those disciplines which posit Sinaitic revelation as axiomatic or accept it as a demonstrated fact. In effect, wisdom and truth can emerge only from a community of believers and their intellectual enterprises. This renders philosophy, Aristotelian metaphysics and physics, the sciences of medicine, logic, and mathematics-all disci- plines to which Maimonides was passionately devoted-cognitively sterile. In principle they are incapable of yielding truth and devoid of intellectual value. Moreover, excluding from "the world to come" people who au- tonomously accept the moral and theological restrictions of the Noah- ide commandments implies that they and their philosophies lack spiritual integrity and religious truth-even in "this world." Since for Maimonides the afterlife is a non-physical world of eternal spiritual truth, it is logical to assume that someone who attains a measure of religious truth through his earthly deliberations would somehow as- sume identification with that everlasting verity and participate in its immortality, i.e., have a share of Maimonides' world to come. Exclu- sion from the afterlife is thus a sign of spiritual and religious bank- ruptcy on earth. Indeed many Jews once believed and some still believe today that truth and spiritual integrity can emerge only from a community of believing Jews and a framework which first acknowledges divine rev- elation at Sinai. Those ignorant of Jewish history with its traditional 268 Eugene Korn</page><page sequence="5">Gentiles and the World to Come theological presuppositions have little chance of acquiring wisdom or religious truth. Such a parochial outlook informed Yehuda Halevi's weltanschauung and appears to be the inevitable conclusion of his major work, The Kuzari.3 It is also the guiding principle of separatist ultra- Orthodox Jews, who see no value in either social contact with non- believers (gentile or Jewish), or in intellectual contact with their philosophic, literary or cultural "wisdom." Maimonides, however, was no such Jew. Can one study either his halakhic or philosophic writings without quickly discerning the hand of Aristotle in the background? Is it possible to plumb the depths of Hilkhot Yesodei Hatorah without recognizing the contribution of Aris- totle's metaphysics and Ptolemy's astronomy? Can one fully under- stand Hilkhot De'ot or Shemonah Perakim with their typologies of hakham, zadik, and hasid, their idealization of derekh beinonit, or their appropriation of lefnim meshurat hadin without discovering the influ- ence of the Nicomachean Ethics and other Greek ethical writings?4 Is it possible to comprehend Maimonides' reasoning regarding the in- corporeality of God and his concept of olam ha-ba as expounded in Hilkhot Teshuva and in his introduction to Perek Helek separate from Aristotle's metaphysical arguments? True to the advice he gave others, Maimonides "accepted truth from whoever pronounced it,"5-even those who had no concept of an immanent divinity, let alone a God who could meet the Jewish people at Sinai and bestow the gift of Torah revelation upon it. For Maimonides, truth was determined by validly constructed arguments, and wisdom was a function of the rational content of propositions. These are universal logical properties, not limited to a parochial source or tradition. Because of his rationalist conception of truth, Maimonides was able to interpret all Biblical references to the physical properties of God as anthropomorphic metaphors,6 and consider de- nying the fundamental Biblical teaching of creation should there exist a valid argument in favor of the universe's eternity.7 Similarly, because he had uncompromising conviction in the ability of all people to utilize their rational faculties in order to discover spiritual and moral truth, he could maintain that prophecy was a natural category of mankind8 and that the gentile Aristotle, "omitted nothing that is within the scope of true ethics from his writings."9 Yet incomprehensibly, according to our text Maimonides consid- ers his teacher Aristotle neither a sage who possessed a measure of earthly wisdom, nor a righteous gentile who earned any right to bask in the glory of eternal truth. 3. This text poses another problem for us, one rooted in consid- erations of justice. If a necessary condition for salvation is the belief 269</page><page sequence="6">that revelation at Sinai provides the basis for Noahide command- ments, then due to sheer accidents of time and place of birth, most of humanity is denied the possibility of achieving salvation. The moral problem is highlighted when we compare the position of Jews and that of non-Jews with regard to salvation. As the Mishna and Hilkhot Teshuva'? indicate, "All Jews have a share in the world to come." Only with the commission of grievous sins do a small minority of Jews lose their share in the world to come. The reverse proportion appears to be true for gentiles: Immortality for non-Jews would be the exception, open to a small minority. Thus we arrive at arbitrary inequality, the essence of injustice. It is this injustice in principle which most disturbed many modern thinkers. Moses Mendelssohn expressed this concern more than 200 years ago in a poignant letter to Rabbi Yakov Emden. Mendelssohn took his cue from Yosef Karo, who stated that Maimonides developed the qualifying condition at the end of 8:11 from his own reasoning, even though it is a correct opinion.1' In asking Emden whether there was any talmudic authority for Maimonides' claim, Mendelssohn poured out his soul in the following impassioned argument: These words are to me harder than flint. Are then all the inhabitants of the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof except us doomed to descend unto the pit and become an object of abhorrence to all flesh if they do not believe in the Torah that was given as an inheritance only to the congregation of Jacob? ... What then is expected of the nations unto whom the light of the Torah does not shine and who received no tradition except from their untrustworthy ancestors? Does God act tyranically with men by de- stroying them and blotting out their name without their committing any iniquity? Shall such a view be termed a correct opinion?12 Mendelssohn was scandalized by the injustice of the restrictive re- quirement and understood that the moral critique naturally leads to a theological problem regarding the benevolence of the Creator. Could any God, who is "merciful to all His creations," doom to oblivion the 99 percent of humanity who do not know of revelation at Sinai? Indeed, even Christians and Moslems who accept Mosaic prophecy- at least with respect to moral commandments-would probably not qualify for salvation. How many Christians or Moslems truly refrain from eating the limbs of live animals (the seventh Noahide com- mandment) because it is prohibited by Mosaic revelation? Today pos- sibly only members of the fledgling "Sons of Noah" sect in the southern United States could truly be said to have this motivation. In effect, Maimonides' qualification evolves into Judaism's ana- logue of the traditional Catholic principle, Extra ecclesiam nulla salus, 270 Eugene Korn</page><page sequence="7">Gentiles and the World to Come "Outside the Church there is no salvation." Good works alone avail men little when it comes to salvation. Only when combined with belief in Mosaic revelation does moral behavior take on significant religious value. Thus the world to come has been transformed into an Orthodox neighborhood, rather than a spiritual destination for all created in the image of God. Could this be a correct opinion? So disturbing was this qualifi- cation to Mendelssohn that he considered its denial and the universal opportunity for salvation to be one of the central arguments for the superiority of Judaism over Christianity. For Mendelssohn, Judaism was unlike Christianity and taught that all men qualified for salvation if they professed the fundamental doctrines of God, providence and afterlife and observed basic moral laws. Since Emden was unable to supply Mendelssohn with an authoritative talmudic source for this limiting condition,'3 Mendelssohn felt free to consider Maimonides' original idea to be in error, and proceeded to disregard his opinion by maintaining that according to the concepts of true Judaism, all the inhabitants of the earth are destined to felicity; and the means of obtaining it are as widespread as mankind itself, as charitably dispensed as the means of warding off hunger and other natural needs.14 Ignoring the weighty legal opinion of Maimonides is always a risky strategy. To claim that Judaism decides against him on this question, however, is particularly difficult. Jacob Katz has shown15 that it is none other than Maimonides himself who coined the phrase, "Righteous gentiles have a portion in the world to come," transforming a cryptic reference to zadikim found in the talmud (Sanhedrin 105a and Tosefta Sanhedrin 13:2) into an authoritative and popular principle of Juda- ism. As a result, a cogent argument against Maimonides' interpreta- tion of this concept in favor of a dissenting formulation by "true Judaism" would require tracing this concept throughout rabbinic writ- ings, and demonstrating that it evolved beyond the author's original meaning into a more universal interpretation that eventually became normative. Absent this, intellectual honesty demands that we not dis- regard Maimonides on this principle. Most philosophers and rabbis who discussed this issue acknowl- edged the need to accept Maimonides' opinion and confronted his text. Ironically, it was Baruch Spinoza in the latter half of the 17th century who accepted the text faithfully and accorded Maimonides the authority to represent Judaism and "the opinions of the Jews." In a famous passage in the Tractatus, he cites Maimonides as the basis for a merciless attack upon Judaism. Our text demonstrates that Jew- ish beliefs "are mere figments, grounded neither on reason, nor to 271</page><page sequence="8">be found in scriptures." Maimonides opinion-and by extension all of Judaism-is "harmful, useless and absurd."16 In his polemic against Spinoza's critique of Judaism, Hermann Cohen also refused to consider Maimonides in error. Cohen believed that monotheistic Biblical Judaism represented the point in history at which the concept of humanity begins. The Bible was first in recog- nizing messianic humanity, the concept of every human being pos- sessing inherent dignity and value, independent of race, religion or nation.17 Cohen attempted to universalize the text by claiming that the restrictive requirement of belief in Mosaic revelation applied to the resident alien only, as a political prerequisite for citizenship rights in Jewish society. Thus he considers the end of 8:11 only in part: "But, if he observes them out of his own rational considerations, he is not a resident alien," and consciously omits the remaining exclusions, "nor of the righteous gentiles, nor of their wise men." Cohen's interpretation contravenes the explicit wording of Mai- monides' complete formulation of 8:11. Cohen was able to adopt this interpretation only by tampering with the text and assuming an illicit emendation. Under his interpretation, the end of 8:11 should read, "But, if he who does them out of his own rational considerations, he is not a resident alien, but is one of the righteous gentiles and is one of their wise men." (emphases added)18 As we will discuss, textual variants do exist, but none matching Cohen's version or supporting his interpretation. In the end because Cohen could not preserve the integrity of Maimonides' text, he failed to show that the Maimonides' position was consistent with universal justice or theological benevo- lence. "Could such a view be termed a correct opinion?" The world was to wait a century and a half after Mendelssohn posed this question until a mystic personality, sensitive to the demands of justice and faithful to rabbinic tradition, attempted another answer. II It is well known that there exists another version of our text, and that the printed editions in our possession appear to be a corruption of Maimonides' original manuscript. Evidence indicates that at the end of 8:11, Maimonides wrote, "But, if he observes them out of his own rational considerations, he is not a resident alien, nor of the righteous of the nations of the world, but ('ela') of their wise men," rather than, "nor ('velo') of their wise men." Somehow the 'alef' of 'ela' was mis- taken for a 'vav' and read as 'velo'. 272 Eugene Korn</page><page sequence="9">Gentiles and the World to Come The substitution of 'ela me-hakhmehem' for 'velo me-hakhmehem' suc- ceeds in including rational moralists in the category of wise gentiles. How does 'ela' effect our textual difficulties? Does it resolve any of the logical, philosophical and moral problems cited above? Before attempting to answer these questions, it should be noted that the 'ela' version is not universally accepted. Much of the vigorous contemporary debate revolves around the question of whether Mai- monides-and Judaism-subscribe to any natural law theory, with natural law supporters advocating the 'ela' reading, while halachic positivists and natural law opponents preferring 'velo.'19 Moreover, just as in Mendelssohn's time during the struggle for emancipation when apologetics was a dominant motif in the discussion of this issue,20 a good bit of the vigorous debate amongst contemporary writers seems heavily influenced by both apologetical and polemical considera- tions.21 This is not surprising, for at stake is more than a theoretical demographic profile of the world to come. As stated earlier, the real issue before us today is the nature of Jewish ideals for relations with gentiles and their culture. Nevertheless, most argue on scholarly grounds that 'ela' is the correct text. The inclusive reading is found in numerous early man- uscripts, in the authoritative manuscripts housed in the Bodleian li- brary at Oxford and the British Museum, as well as in the Yemenite manuscripts, generally considered to be most faithful to Maimonides' original text.22 It is also quite easy to understand how the configuration of an 'alefin 'ela' could become defaced or worn away and read as a 'vav' in 'velo.' The reverse process, that of a 'vav' being naturally trans- formed into an 'alef' is much less probable. As Isadore Twersky claims, "practically all texts support the reading of ela."23 Thus bibliographic evidence seems conclusive toward reading 'ela,' even though all printed editions of our text contain 'velo.' Let us now consider the logical, philosophical, and moral evidence for the inclusive reading of the text, and determine what impact it has upon our three problems. 1. If Maimonides indeed wrote 'ela me-hakhmehem', "but of their wise men," the logical difficulties cited are resolved. The category of wise gentiles now becomes well defined and independent: It is those persons who accept Noahide laws from rational considerations. More- over 'hakham' is a term of approbation and positive value, so it is impossible that Maimonides considered such persons to be pagans and disqualified as Noahites. Since the acceptance (kabala) of Noahide law by the wise gentile does not require acceptance of revelation, a 273</page><page sequence="10">fortiori the lesser category of plain Noahites would not require belief in Mosaic revelation as part of the acceptance of Noahide laws either. Thus in 8:10-11 Maimonides delineated five clearly independent categories of gentiles according to halakha: (1) A pagan-one who rejects the seven Noahide commandments (2) A Noahite (ben Noach)-one who lives by the Noahide laws for whatever reason or motive. Such a person may do so unreflec- tively, simply because behavior is the prevailing ethos of his so- ciety or peer group (3) A resident alien (ger toshav)-a Noahite living under Jewish sov- ereignty who lives by the Noahide laws, accepts them as obli- gations from Mosaic revelation, and swears this allegiance before a rabbinic court (4) A righteous gentile (hasid umot ha-olam)-a Noahite who lives by the Noahide laws, accepting them as revealed Mosaic command- ments (5) A wise gentile (hakham umot ha-olam)-a Noahite who lives ac- cording to the Noahide laws because he has concluded rationally that they are correct principles of behavior In effect, Maimonides' use of 'ela' succeeds in defining the class of wise gentiles in classic philosophic style, per genus et differentia: Such sages are in the generic category of Noahites, but differ from plain Noahites because of their commitment to Noahide laws as principles and from the more exalted Noahites (righteous gentiles and resident aliens) because their commitment is rooted in autonomous reason and not from any theological awareness. It is now apparent why Maimonides introduces the category of wise gentiles: He is creating an exhaustive list of all gentile categories. Maimonides uses the opportunity here in Hilkhot Melakhim to give a comprehensive listing of different ways Jewish law classifies and eval- uates non-Jews. 2. If Maimonides wrote that persons living by autonomously ac- cepted morality could be considered wise men, this statement would constitute an explicit claim that wisdom-in all its senses-can be found amongst all persons, even those with no substantive religious commitments. It should be noted that the theological dimensions of the seven Noahide commandments require only that a person refrain from idolatry and exercise a limited sense of tolerance, i.e. refrain from undermining the correct belief in God. Noahide law does not require that one have any positive belief in God.24 Perhaps the most that should be claimed regarding the Maimonidian concept of wisdom is that it entails an acknowledgement of a power higher than man 274 Eugene Korn</page><page sequence="11">Gentiles and the World to Come that has necessary, not merely contingent existence. Maimonides im- plies this in his opening statements of the Mishneh Torah: The foundation of foundations and the pillar of wisdom is to know that there exists a primary being. It provides existence to all that exists. All that is found in the heavens and on earth and between them exists only by virtue of the reality of its existence.25 In this text Maimonides describes a primary being, above both man and nature. This power is closely identified with Aristotle's wholly transcendent umoved mover, who never comes into contact with man. Clearly what this passage does not describe as a prerequisite for wis- dom is a personal, immanent God who created the universe, entered human history, and bestowed commandments upon the Jewish people in a revelatory meeting at Sinai. This is why Maimonides quotes only the beginning of Exodus 20:2, "I am the Lord, your God," and con- sistently omits the latter part of the verse, "who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage," when discussing the positive commandment to know God.26 Nowhere in the initial four chapters of the Mishneh Torah, where Maimonides discusses this higher metaphysical power, does he mention creation, revelation or even the Jewish people. Writers err who wish to use this beginning passage as proof that wisdom requires traditional Jewish belief in revelation, and hence Maimonides must have written 'velo me-hakhmehem.'27 Either they simply neglected to read the full text of Chapter I of the Mishneh Torah or they have been blinded by their ideological fervor. For Mai- monides, wisdom might require belief in the "God of the philoso- phers," but not in the experienced God of Jewish history. It follows that Maimonidean wisdom is an open category, not necessarily tied to Jewish theology or confined to Jews. It is therefore quite logical that Maimonides studied non-Jewish writings, accepted their claims when he thought their arguments were valid, and inte- grated their wisdom into his own philosophic and religious works. Aristotle certainly would qualify as a wise man, as would other phi- losophers, thinkers, and scientists who accept basic Noahide moral norms. In principle, any intellectual enterprise-e.g. philosophy, sci- ence, medicine, literature-could discover truth and possess wisdom as long as that discipline does not ultimately deny the moral prohi- bitions against homicide, theft, sexual license, anarchy, cruelty and idolatry. Thus the philosophical difficulties cited earlier are also re- solved by the 'ela' reading. In 8:10-11, Maimonides should not be understood to be defining a priori the theological requirements for intellectual and spiritual truth. Rather he may be offering a halakhic standard for tolerance: Jewish tolerance extends up to the edge of 275</page><page sequence="12">paganism, that culture which rejects the moral restraints of Noahide law.28 3. The moral problem that so vexed Mendelssohn has proven to be more intractable. The German Jewish philosopher only had the standard printed edition with its 'velo' text,29 but had he possessed the 'ela' version, he would have found little comfort. As Steven Schwarzs- child notes: The emendation of the text does not relieve us of the difficulties that arise from Maimonides' statement, however. It still remains true that he excludes what we might call the philosophical rather than the religious Noahites from the class of the righteous of the gentile nations of the world and thus from the world to come. All the ques- tions raised with respect to this dictum, therefore, retain their valid- ity.50 'Ela me-hakhmehem' accords only wisdom to those outside the tradition, but not immortality. This point is born out by the experience of Hermann Cohen, who was faced with the same problem even though he knew of both the 'velo' and the 'ela' versions of the text. To support his theory he was forced to emend the 'ela' version by moving the location of 'ela' so that it applied both to wise men and to righteous gentiles. Without this illicit change, both Spinoza's critique and our moral/theological problem stand with either version of the text. III Let us briefly sum up the various responses to Maimonides' contro- versial claim that the status of resident alien, righteous gentile (and possibly wise gentile) requires belief in Mosaic revelation: In the 16th century, Yosef Karo accepted Maimonides' opinion as correct, but could not find a source for it within Jewish tradition. In the 17th century Spinoza accepted Maimonides' opinion as au- thoritative, but found it so obviously incorrect that it provided the basis for his argument undermining the validity of Judaism. In the 18th century Mendelssohn could not accept the opinion as correct, considered it to be idiosyncratic and rejected it as an element of true Judaism. In the early 20th century Cohen realized that he could not reject Maimonides in the name of Judaism and exploited the fact that some texts were corrupt. He proceeded to change the text, so that he could 276 Eugene Korn</page><page sequence="13">Gentiles and the World to Come interpret Maimonides to say that belief in Mosaic revelation was required only of gentiles wishing to live under Jewish sovereignty resident aliens), but not required for righteous or wise gentiles. Ostensibly both versions of the text-'velo me-hakhmehem' and 'ela me- hakhmehem-leave us with equally untenable options with respect to our moral problem: either reject Maimonides' opinion (Mendelssohn), change the wording of the text without any bibliographical warrant (Cohen), or accept the authority of Maimonides' text and suffer the undesirable moral and theological consequences (Spinoza). In the 20th century there was one Jewish figure who made a bold interpretive move, attempting to be faithful to Maimonides, the text and to considerations of justice. For Rav Abraham Kook, the 'ela' text was the key to cutting through the Gordian knot. By granting that Maimonides ascribed wisdom even to those who accepted Noahide commandments from reason alone, Rav Kook was able to interpret the comparative merit of wise gentiles: Behold the correct version is "but (ela) of their wise men." My opinion is that the intent of Maimonides is that the status, "possessing a share in the world to come," is a very low level, even though it is also a great good. Since, however, even Jewish sinners and ignoramuses merit this status, it is a low status amongst spiritual values. Maimon- ides reasons that ideas improve man much more than does righteous behavior. Therefore he reasons that the level of "possessing a share in the world to come," is a status specifically for righteous gentiles, who were not superior in their ideas but accepted faith in whole- hearted purity and acted in an honest way because they accepted that their commandments were so given by God. However, he who through his rational conclusion merited acquiring the seven Noahide commandments-he is truly wise of heart and full of understanding. He is considered "of their wise men," for the status of wisdom is very great, and there is no need to state that they "possess a share in the world to come." Rather he stands on a level of holiness (ke- dusha) that requires interpretation in an expression greater than the language of "possessing a share in the world to come."31 Rav Kook inverts the rankings of the wise and righteous gentiles. For him a wise gentile is spiritually superior to the righteous gentile since the sage recognizes moral truths in an autonomous manner, from the innermost spirit of his being, rather than passively accepting them through tradition as heteronomously imposed commandments. Thus the sage has both rational and moral virtues, while the righteous gentile has only the latter. Rav Kook maintains, moreover, that both of those virtues are open to all people: Just as every person has the free will to determine his behavior and refrain from killing, stealing, 277</page><page sequence="14">and raping, so too does every person have the natural capacity to recognize that these actions are morally wrong. Rav Kook's interpretation grows out of his conviction that ac- quiring moral wisdom is more than a sterile cognitive act within secular experience. It is, rather, a transcendent moment filled with religious significance, a moment that elevates the hakham to a high level of spirituality and endows him with holiness. Although he never explic- itly says so, Rav Kook's interpretation strongly implies that the wise gentile also merits salvation. Being on a higher spiritual level, he certainly earns at least the level of spiritual reward that the righteous gentile does. Thus salvation is a possibility available to all humanity. Approximately 250 years after the Tractatus, Rav Kook's has finally rebutted Spinoza's argument. Indeed, according to Rav Kook, Mai- monides' view "should be termed a correct opinion." In this interpretation, we see a classic expression of Rav Kook's world-view, where all forms of knowledge are suffused with holiness and God's presence. Rav Kook's religious universe is radically open: Every aspect of the world, history, and truth necessarily reflects a divine light waiting to be perceived-and Rav Kook sees God's light in every far-flung corner of the universe. For him, Hegel's dialectics of history expressed a working out of God's presence in human affairs, and even the theory of evolution was a corollary to divine creation. Rav Kook's unshakable faith led him to conclude that the activity of atheistic Zionists, although resulting from a total rejection of God and His law, paradoxically realized God's will. The story of atheistic Zion- ism is an example of how history proceeds dialectically towards an inexorably spiritual result: A thesis (religion) clashes with an antithesis (secular Zionism) and together they produce a holy synthesis (the return of the Jewish people to the land of Israel). Perhaps in a similarly paradoxical way, the moral convictions of the rational and autono- mous wise gentile attest to God's worldly presence more effectively than any unreflective and habitual behavior based on acceptance of revelation. Given Rav Kook's religious sensibility, it is not surprising that he maintains the possibility of salvation for all men. But Rav Kook makes a stronger claim, namely, that this is also the conviction of Maimonides ("It is Maimonides' intent..."). Rav Kook reads the text contrary to the majority of interpreters on this point and the question must be asked, "Does Maimonides share this universal religious sensibility or is Rav Kook recreating Maimonides in his own image?" Despite the novelty of his explanation, there is strong evidence both within our text and from the larger corpus of Maimonides' writ- ings for Rav Kook's interpretation. The dictum, "Righteous gentiles have a share in the world to come," has traditionally been interpreted 278 Eugene Korn</page><page sequence="15">Gentiles and the World to Come as, "Only righteous gentiles have a share in the world to come." That is, a gentile merits salvation if and only if he is classified as a righteous gentile. Yet this is not the precise connotation. Logically, the wording allows for other categories of gentiles also to merit the world to come, and this is how Rav Kook reads the phrase. Even the text at hand implies this interpretation since in 8:11 Maimonides requires of a resident alien everything that he does of a righteous gentile, namely acceptance of Noahide laws from belief in Mosaic revelation. It is logical, therefore, that if a righteous gentile qualifies for salvation, so must a resident alien.32 Thus at least one category type other than righteous gentiles also has a share in the world to come. If righteous gentiles is not the exclusive category of persons meriting salvation, then wise gentiles also qualify, as they have attained a higher spiritual level. This interpretation supplies additional coherence to the text, since it explains why Maimonides deems it relevant to mention wise gentiles at the end of 8:11. He is taking pains at this point in the text to list all categories of people who have a share in the world to come for the sake of completeness and to prevent the invalid inference that it is only righteous gentiles and resident aliens who can merit salvation. Significantly, in no other passage where Maimonides mentions immortality does he stipulate that one must believe in divine revelation at Sinai. This is true whether Maimonides mentions righteous gen- tiles33 or not in these passages. Consider one of the most important of these texts: Anyone in the world whose spirit moves him and who understands by his own knowledge to stand apart before the Lord to minister to Him and to serve Him, to know the Lord and to walk straight as God made him . . Such a person is sanctified with greatest sanctity and the Lord will be his portion and his inheritance forever and ever.. 34 It is undeniable that in this text Maimonides leaves open the possibility of universal salvation ("Anyone in the world . ."). There is no explicit reference or implicit hint of restricting the world to come to those accepting Sinaitic revelation. In fact, the text stresses that the person herein described is characterized by independent conclusions in both his spiritual dimension ("his spirit moves him .. .") and in his intellectual faculties ("understands by his own knowledge"). This per- son is similar to Rav Kook's wise gentile, in that his immortality results from his autonomous nature and not from his acceptance of heter- onomous revelation. Other passages in Maimonides halakhic and phil- osophic works also emphasize that an autonomous apprehension of theoretical and moral truths are essential characteristics of those who 279</page><page sequence="16">perfect their souls and attain salvation.35 It seems that Rav Kook's wise gentile would feel very much at home with those personalities in the world to come. How does Rav Kook know that Maimonides regarded the rational and autonomously ethical person to be on a higher level than the righteous gentile? In the famous discussion found in his Eight Chap- ters,36 Maimonides resolves the disagreement between philosophers and the rabbinic tradition regarding the status of different types of ethical personalities: Both [claims] are true and there is no disagreement at all between them. The evils designated by the philosophers are evils about which they state that "he who has no longing for them is more to be praised than he who desires them but conquers his passion." They are com- monly held by all men to be evil, such as bloodshed, stealing, robbery, exploitation, harming someone who has done no wrong, doing evil to one's benefactor ... These are laws about which the sages, peace be upon them, said, "Had they not been written [in the Torah] they should have been written" . . . There is no doubt that the soul that desires them and yearns for them is deficient and that the noble soul has no such desires at all for them. However the things about which the sages said, "He who conquers his urges is more important and his reward is greater, they are laws from tradition." This is true, for were it not for the Torah, they would not be evil... Consider the wisdom of the sages and their examples. They do not claim, "One should not say, I have no desire to kill, to steal, to lie"; rather they say, "I desire them, but what can I do, my Father in heaven has forbade them to me!" But all the examples they cite are traditional laws, such as meat and milk, the wearing of intermixed garments, forbidden sexual unions. Maimonides stresses in this passage that someone who refrains from violating rational laws simply because such acts were prohibited by divine law has a deficient soul (nefesh hasera). The more complete moral personality is he who feels no internal temptation to sin and therefore has no need to rely on heteronomous law for restraint. He is someone who realizes within himself that such behavior is morally wrong. It is no accident that Maimonides utilizes the term, 'mefursamim', literally "widely known," to denote rational moral principles and that the examples he selects are bloodshed, stealing and violations of basic reciprocal behavior that constitutes the foundation of a just and law- abiding society. These are precisely the universally obligated Noahide laws that the wise gentile recognizes autonomously to be morally bind- ing. In other words, it is hakham, apprehending the intrinsic moral integrity of the 'mefursamim' (Noahide laws) who possesses a more complete character than the righteous gentile, who fails to recognize 280 Eugene Korn</page><page sequence="17">Gentiles and the World to Come moral truths and observes these rational moral laws only because, "his Father in Heaven has forbade them to him." Other Maimonidean passages confirm this inference.37 Hence when focusing exclusively on the narrow context of the passage in Hilkhot Melakhim, Rav Kook's reading appears forced and idiosyncratic, but in the broader corpus of Maimonides' other writings it has cogent logical support. IV As noted earlier, the debate over which version of our text is authentic and which interpretation is correct continues unabated. If Rav Kook's reading represented one extreme, utilizing the 'ela' version to create a religious vision that was radically open and universal, a second 20th- century rabbinic personality offered another interpretation present- ing the opposite worldview. Apparently unaware of the problems cited, Rav Velvel Soloveitchik read the 'velo' text as a strict construc- tionist and carried it to its logical conclusion.38 For him 8:10 and 8:11 constituted one logical unit and all eight occurrences of the verb, to accept (lekabel), in that unit indicate that identical substantive accep- tance on the part of the resident alien, the righteous gentile, the wise gentile and the Noahite. He believed that Sinaitic revelation changed the legal requirement of Noahide laws: Whereas before Sinai it was sufficient for a Noahite not to violate any of the seven commandments, after Sinai explicit positive acceptance is demanded. Most importantly, since acceptance is the same for both the righteous gentile and the Noahite, even a Noahite is now required to believe in revelation at Sinai. Alarming logical consequences flow from this interpretation. Not only is the rational and autonomous moral person denied wisdom and a share in the world to come, he also fails to qualify as a Noahite. And as Maimonides explains in 8:10, anyone who does not accept the Noahide commandments is guilty of a capital offense and should be killed. Hence anyone who does not believe in a Mosaic revelation at Sinai forfeits his right to life in this world! Of course Rav Velvel Soloveitchik did not advocate that Jews actually put non-believers to death, but the religious weltanschaaung that emerges from this interpretation pronounces axiological death upon the heterodox and non-Jewish world: It robs all non-believers and their cultures of any intellectual, religious, or even human value. Rav Velvel's universe is sharply bifurcated between traditional Ju- daism and paganism, between the theology of Torah and intolerable heresies, between believers in Sinai and people lacking intrinsic dignity and a right to life. In this binary universe there is no possibility for 281</page><page sequence="18">religious pluralism, interactive coexistence between Jews and gentiles, or any synthesis between the traditional understanding of Judaism and disciplines possessing secular 'wisdom.' Rather, religious integrity demands an exclusively Jewish frame of reference-where Jews are hermetically sealed off from all outside social, intellectual, and political influences. In stark contrast to Rav Kook's religious world, Rav Velvel Soloveitchik's ideal universe was one of isolation and rejection of mod- ernity. Hence Rav Velvel was quite consistent in opposing secular education as well as the State of Israel as a political phenomenon. In the writings of Rav Kook and R. Velvel Soloveitchik we see two traditionalists whose interpretations of Maimonides supply re- sponses to contemporary questions: Should Jews accord full dignity to those who do not share their beliefs in revelation? Can Judaism see spiritual and intellectual value in non-Jewish wisdom? Ought re- ligious Jews to participate in the gentile world? Rav Kook knew that the 'ela' version implied affirmative answers to these questions, while Rav Velvel understood that the 'velo' text was the key to negative responses, implying a commitment to the rejection of the conditions of modern life. Each rabbinic figure represents a version of Orthodox thinking, with Rav Kook's interpretation foreshadowing the philo- sophic principles of contemporary centrist Orthodoxy and Rav Vel- vel's position supporting the isolationist worldview of ultra- Orthodoxy. Thus our text has been used to support both sides in the ideological debate between modern Orthodoxy and separatist ultra- Orthodoxy. It is surprising, therefore, to find spokesmen identified with cen- trist Orthodoxy today advocating the 'velo' text, dismissing the seri- ousness of Rav Kook, and citing Rav Velvel on this point.39 These voices seem oblivious to the fact that in doing so, they are denying essential tenets of centrist Orthodoxy, namely (1) that gentile knowl- edge can constitute wisdom and its study has religious value (2) that non-Jewish pluralistic society can be a spiritually significant arena of participation for religious Jews, and (3) that there is religious validity to the State of Israel and political Zionism.40 When one denies wisdom a priori to a non-believer, there is no consistent way to advocate a synthesis of Torah and 'gentile' knowl- edge. Of course one can continue to view non-Jewish disciplines func- tionally and use them as instruments to achieve pragmatic ends. However one cannot maintain the centrist Orthodox principle that non-Jewish knowledge can have spiritual character and that its study can constitute the fulfillment of the commandments to know and to love God. When one rejects the possibilities of righteousness and spiritual integrity to autonomously motivated gentiles, there can be no religious Eugene Korn 282</page><page sequence="19">Gentiles and the World to Come justification for active engagement with those who do not accept rev- elation. That is, such a person can no longer see gentile society as a stage of possible religious sanctity, as a place where he can act out God's will and make a religiously significant contribution. Withdrawal and separation must be the operative religious imperatives. Finally, if one denies the right to life and the essential humanity of those who do not share traditional Jewish theology, then there is no practical way to support the Jewish people organizing around the State of Israel that takes its place among the family of nations. State- hood demands economic, social, and diplomatic cooperation with other nations, interaction with foreign governments and according their officials full human dignity and respect. In a word, Israel re- quires that the Jewish people participate in the world and establish honest dialogue with the representatives of foreign cultures. This is impossible if they are regarded as pagans, unworthy of true human status. In arguing for 'velo me-hakhmehem,' writers in effect misappro- priate Maimonides as an advocate of intellectual and social separatism. This revisionist biography robs moderate Jewish thought of its great- est rabbinic model and ideological father. In their zeal to distance themselves from more universalistic interpretations of Judaism, some centristic Orthodox thinkers have crossed over the line and entered ultra-Orthodox thinking, idealizing isolation and rejecting a priori the conditions of modern life. Such a drift represents a betrayal of centrist Orthodoxy, a move as threatening to its existence as are the dangers of excessive liberalism. The common belief that "movement to the right" is less perilous than "movement to the left," is both naive and false. Such movement may be easier and psychologically comforting in a time when the sociological trends of religious communities point in that direction. Nevertheless, this turn is intellectually untenable, for it ultimately denudes centrist Orthodoxy of its principles and convictions-and once any religious movement loses its soul, its body will soon follow. In the end, the future of centrist Orthodoxy with its open religious sensibilities and its belief in the religious validity of modern pluralistic experience, may turn on how passionately and persuasively its spokes- men can argue for the worldview that 'ela' me-hakhmehem' expresses, rather than that of 'velo me-hakhmehem.'

Evidently, this is the way that R. Velvel Soloveitchik read the text. More on this interpretation and its sociopolitical consequences later. 3. See 1:25-43 and 95. For Halevi, Jews were categorically different from other people. Only they possessed the mystical divine power (inyan elohi) that was bestowed upon them during their unique history. Thus, as "the pick of humanity," they had exclusive access to ultimate religious truth that no non- Jew could share. Even the faithful convert to Judaism lacked this capacity as he did not experience the exodus from Egypt nor receive revelation at Sinai. 4.

Many of the essays in Jewish Law Anual, Vols. 6 and 7 (Boston, 1987 and 1988), are devoted to the question of whether Jewish law is consistent with any theory of natural law. Of particular interest within these volumes to our question regarding Maimonides' law are Volume 6: Emmanuel Rack- man, "Secular Jurisprudence and Halakhah," Jacob Dienstag, supra n. 13, Oliver Leaman, "Maimonides and Natural Law." Volume 7: J. David Bleich, "Judaism and Natural Law," and David Novak, "Natural Law, Halakhah, and the Covenant." Other important contributions to this discussion include Schwarzschild, supra n. 13, Marvin Fox, "Maimonides and Aquinas on Natural Law," Dine Israel, Vol. 3 (1972), pp. V-XXXVI; Jose Faur, Studies in Mishneh Torah: Book of Knowledge (Jerusalem, 1978), pp. 61-65, 161-176 (Hebrew); David Novak, Image of the Non-Jew in Judaism: An Historical and Constructive Study of Noahite Laws (Lewiston, 1983), Chapter 10; and Lamm and Kirshen- baum, supra n. 1. Bleich, Fox, and Faur are the most vocal opponents of a natural law interpretation of Jewish law and each argues for the correctness of 'velo me-hakhmehem'. Lamm and Kirshenbaum, Rackman, Schwarzschild, and Novak all support natural law interpretations and each maintains that 'ela me-hakhmehem' is the correct version of the text. It should be stressed that while 'velo' precludes a Maimonidean natural law theory, 'ela' does not nec- essarily imply one. That is, 'ela' is a necessary condition for a natural law claim, but not a sufficient condition. 20. Katz, supra n. 15, pp. 176-177, and Schwarzschild, supra n. 13, p. 35. 21. Menachem Genack's, "Ambiguity as Theology," In Tradition, Vol. 25, No. 1 (Fall 1989), p. 79, provides a prime example of the polemical use of this text. The author uses this passage to try to rebut the validity of univer- salistic interpretations of Judaism offered by Conservative Judaism. 22.

It is often mistakenly assumed that because Noahide law prohibits idolatry and blasphemy, it also requires affirmation of some theology. Sol Roth makes this common error in "A Halakhic Approach to the Secular," in Tradition, Vol. 26, No. 3 (Spring 1992), p. 31. Both of these religiously oriented Noahide laws are prohibitions, however, and do not imply any positive belief in God. See Maimonides, Hilchot Melachim, Chapter 9 for a full explication of the requirements of Noahide commandments. 25. Hilkhot Yesodei Hatorah 1:1. 26.

Genack implies that the argument for the correctness of 'velo' based upon the use of the term 'hakhma' in Hilkhot Yesodei Hatorah 1:1 came from RavJoseph Dov Soloveitchik. However, review of notes taken from Rav Soloveitchik's lectures and subse- quent conversations with members of his family by this author have verified that Rav Soloveitchik maintained that the correct text is 'ela me-hakhmehem' and that the 'velo' text is indeed corrupt. 28. See Michael Rosenak "The Religious Person and Religious Pluralism, "The Meaning and Limits of Pluralism Today," (World Council of Churches, 1987), pp. 13-20. The author subscribes to a natural law interpretation of the Noahite laws and argues that they form a minimum universal ethical code for humanity. As such, the halakhic requirement to accept Noahide law is identical with the moral requirement to accept the laws of civilized existence rather than to live in an immoral pagan order. Judaism's acceptance of all Noahites therefore is a liberal tolerance for all people willing to live morally. This moral distinction between unacceptable paganism and acceptable non- Jewish behavior is also found in R. Menahem Meiri's understanding of idolatry. Meiri transformed the definition of idolatry from the traditional theological concept to one whose content was primarily moral. Under this con- ception, all gentiles whose beliefs impose restraints that approximate the Noahide behavioral code (umot ha-gedurot be-darkhai ha-datot) were excluded from the class of idolators. He thus was able to formulate a tolerant halakhic policy towards Christians.

Schwarzschild, supra n. 13, p. 33. 31. Letters, Vol. 1, p. 100. 32. Maimonides states explicitly in Hilkhot Issurei Bei'a 14:7 that resident aliens are also included in the class of righteous gentiles (and therefore merit the world to come). Kirshenbaum and Lamm, supra n. 1, pp. 118-119, foot- note 78, imply that there is a crucial difference between a resident alien and a righteous gentile other than the imposition of ajuridic oath: The resident alien is politically coerced to accept Noahite laws, whereas the righteous gentile accepts them freely. However, the necessity of political coercion with regard to the resident alien is not directly implied by Maimonides' text. 33. Hilkhot Teshuva 3:5, Hilkhot Edut 2:10 and Commentary on Mishna San- hedrin 10:12 are the other references where Maimonides states that "Righteous gentiles have a share in the world to come." 34.

See Introduction to Perek Helek, pp. 132-133 (Mossad Ha Rav Kook edition) (Hebrew), where Maimonides emphasizes that a necessary condition for both human perfection (shlemut) and entry to the world to come is moral wisdom that is manifested by an autonomous internal motivation to observe moral laws. This wisdom and autonomous behavior ("He is moved from within 286 Eugene Korn</page><page sequence="23">Gentiles and the World to Come 287 himself,") is what diffentiates human beings from animals, whose behavior is determined by external forces. In Moreh Nevuchim, III: 17 Maimonides also stresses the value of the autonomously motivated personality by stating that people bear responsibility for their compliance with or violation of moral laws-even those not originating in divine commands-since each person's intelligence (sechel) naturally informs him of his moral obligations. 38. Hidushei HaGriz, final paragraph. 39. Bleich and Fox, supra n. 19, and Genack, supra n. 21, all argue for 'velo'. Bleich dismisses Rav Kook's interpretation in cavalier fashion. Ganeck, writing in Tradition-the foremost journal of centrist Orthodox thought- omits any reference to Rav Kook and approvingly cites only the interpretation of R. Velvel Soloveitchik. 40.
