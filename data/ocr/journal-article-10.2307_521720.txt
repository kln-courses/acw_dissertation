<plain_text><page sequence="1">On Contemporary Marxigt Theory: An Interview with fredric Jamegon A leading American critic, Fredric Jameson has written extensively and persuasively on modern literature, literary theory and more recently on cinema, from a Marxist perspective. He has taught at Harvard University, the University of California and Yale University. He is presently professor of Comparative Literature, director of the Graduate Program in Literature and Theory at Duke University, and co-editor of Social Text, a journal of theory, culture and ideology. He is the author of influential works, which include: Sartre: The Origins of a Style (1961). Marxism and Form: Twentieth-Century Dialectical Theories ofLiterature (1971). The Prison-House of Language: A Critical Account of Structuralism and Russian Formalism (1972). Fables of Aggression: Wyndham Lewis, The Modernist as Fascist (1979). The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act. (1981). The Ideologies of Theory: Essays 1971 - 1986, two volumes, vol. 1: Situations of Theory, vol. 2: Syntax of History (1988). Signatures of the Visible (forthcoming). Fredric Jameson has written on Third World literature and the impact of Third World struggles and cultures on metropolitan thought in seminal essays published in Social Text: "The 60s without Apology" (1984) and "Third World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism" (1986). The latter triggered a debate with the critic Aijaz Ahmad who responded in the same journal 114 AliflO(l990)</page><page sequence="2">with an article entitled "Third World Literature of Otherness and the 'National Allegory"' (1987). Fredric Jameson has kindly granted Alif this interview, which was carried out in writing (Fall 1989). His interlocutors have been following his work closely and attended the seminar he held at the American University in Cairo in early 1989. Sabry Hafez is an influential critic who teaches Arabic Literature in the School of Oriental and African Studies, London University. He is a prolific writer who has published on Egyptian narrative, comparative drama and sociological poetics. Abbas Al-Tonsi has written on ideology and narrative form, and is undertaking extensive research on Arab Marxist critics. He teaches Arabic at the American University in Cairo. Mona Abousenna is a prominent comparatist who has published widely on literary theory, acculturation, drama and the poetics of Brecht. She teaches in the Department of Foreign Languages, Ain Shams University in Cairo. Aida Nasr is an undergraduate in the American University in Cairo majoring in English and Comparative Literature. She is particularly interested in Third World literature. She is the co-editor of Greenhouse, a student lite-rary magazine. Sabry Hafez: What is the impact of what you termed, in Marxism and Form, a Hegelian kind of Marxism on the development of the new critical discourse, particularly that which is written in English? Could you identify some of its tenets which have been assimilated in the contemporary mainstream criticism, or in other words been accepted into the established critical canon? Fredric Jameson: I don't think it's particularly important to retain the word "Hegelian." There are a number of other slogans for what's also sometimes called "Western Marxism," which has generally been described in its difference from so-called "Soviet Marxism" or "dialectical materialism" as involving an increased emphasis on facts of consciousness and culture. There are many reasons why Maixists in the West have felt it important to do this, most obviously as an explanation for the failure of revolution in the West after the 1920s and the increasing role of cultural Alif 10 (1990) 115</page><page sequence="3">apparatuses such as, in our time, television and the media in the ideological policing of working class people. I will, about the word "Hegelian" however, say a few more things. The meaning of the word is obviously going to vary according to the stereotype one has about Hegel. I think that the polemics waged by Louis Althusser in the 1960s against Hegel are no longer of much significance for us for a whole set of reasons. In any case, what he meant by Hegel was idealism, and clearly I was not proposing a return to idealism. But a number of studies of Marx's own text have shown that these texts are dialectical in a deeper way than had hitherto been suspected, and that therefore they reveal, not so much an influence of Hegel, but a development of what Hegel glimpsed in a whole range of new ways. Let me simply say rapidly what I think the difference between a Hegelian and a non-Hegelian approach might be. Bourgeois philosophy imagines that its language is able directly to model the world and therefore it seeks to immediately formulate the structure and nature of reality. In Hegel, there is always the sense that we never have imrnediate contact with the outside world, but that contact is always mediated by our own concepts which have their own logic and their own history. Therefore the task of philosophy is not a one-dimensional one in which we seek to register and represent reality directly, but rather to take two paths simultaneously. It must seek to characterize the outside world, in this case the structure of late Capitalism, and at the same time it must seek to understand the limits of the concepts with which we do that understanding, and those limits are of course, at least in part, ideological and shaped by our formation within the very social world that we are seeking to understand. Therefore, if one wanted to make a defense of this slogan of Hegelianism, as you seem to suggest I have, it would be that this approach obliges us to try to grasp the ideological limits of our own consciousness and its intellectual categories at the same time that it continues to grapple with the task of understanding the social and historical world which is outside us and which is our reality. I would finally add that there are signs that a new way of reading Marx through Hegel is in a process of reappearing after 1 16 Alif 10 (1990)</page><page sequence="4">the Althusserian period. Part of this may be understood to be reaction against Althusser in itself, and against the much more recent British school of analytic Marxism. Some of it derives from the Frankfurt School, and from the so-called (Kapitalogic ?) group in Germany and elsewhere, and it will all receive a great new impetus when the work of the Argentinian philosopher, Enrique Dussell, on Marx'sGrundrisse and the unpublished manuscripts is more widely known. Sabry Hafez: Perestroika has removed some of the psychological barriers against Marxism; how do you see the impact of such removal on the development of critical methodology particularly in the largely conservative English speaking world ? Do you expect it to affect a transformation of the Marxist literary canon similar to that which was brought about by the Russian Formalists or the Frankfurt School, in other words, do you envisage a radical change in the Marxist literary canon towards a wider awareness and less crudely utilitarian understanding of modernist culture in the West ? Fredric Jameson: I would have said that perestroika removed many of the political objections to Socialism or Communism. As for Marxism as a mode of thought, I think that your question is not dialectical enough. It is precisely in a conservative, English-speaking world that a more radical kind of Marxist thinking has had to develop in opposition to that hegemonic set of values and as a reaction against it. While we expect enormous things from the revival of Russian culture, Russian traditions, and the participation of the Soviet intelligentsia in international intellectual life, it seems to me that it will be a while before they have a distinctive contribution to make to Marxist studies. That they will make such a distinctive contribution I have no doubt whatsoever. Bakhtin is of course an enormous monument and resource for the Soviet intellectuals to draw upon . For the moment, according to my observations, they are busy assimilating intellectual trends in the West, and I would imagine the more crucial issue today is whether these intellectuals will be interested in Marxism at all in the immediate future, let alone in making their contribution to it. Alif 10 (1990) 117</page><page sequence="5">One should also add after the current events in Eastern Europe that there are really two possible outcomes for many of the Eastern European countries, most particularly the German Democratic Republic, only one of which is ever mentioned in the newspapers -- that is, of course, the reversion to the market and the selling out of nationalized industries to private business, and less often invoked, the enlistment of cheap Eastern European labor for big business in Western Europe, particularly after 1992. The other possibility, particularly in the two Germanys as I said, would be the renewal of very sharp ideological debate on the nature of socialism. It seems to me that this is now the moment, after the end of the wall of violence and repression, for the Germans in particular to describe positively the benefits of a socialism which has most often been caricatured as being unproductive and inefficient, stagnant, lacking the technological level of Western private business, and so on and so forth. Something is surely still to be said for the choice of other priorities which include full employment, free medical care and education and cradle-to-grave security for its citizens. Sabry Hafez: The older Marxist criticism which you once described as genetic emphasized the historical evolution of art from ritual and religion . How can the new Marxist criticism with its emphasis on dialectics and various forms of oral tradition and folk fantasia, which is clearly manifested in a literature such as that of Latin America and some Third World countries, posit a new concept of criticism ? or form a new critical canon and how ? Fredric Jameson: The question is a very interesting one. Obviously the objections to genetic criticism were, to many people, what looked to be a crudely evolutionist perspective in which early forms of oral songs gave way to more complex modes of the imitation of reality. It's a perspective one finds, for example, in art critics like Arnold Hauser or even in non- Marxists like my teacher, Erich Auerbach. I hardly think we wish to go back to that form of evolutionism, particularly since what has transpired for us in the whole new postmodern era is the notion that in many ways the oral traditions and what used to be thought of as simpler forms are more complicated and more 1 18 Alif 10 (1990)</page><page sequence="6">interesting than our own bourgeois forms. In any case, for the Socialist tradition all of this raises the crucial matter which Ernst Bloch, among others, characterized as that of "die Erbe," "tradition" or the "heritage": how a new Socialist culture, which necessarily emerges from a regime of high industrial production, is to assimilate the cultures of the past and of other modes of production, and in the process become a genuine world culture. Lukacs, of course, thought that Socialist culture should include the classics of realism and of older, middle-class culture. For many people in the West as well as the East for whom the classics of middle-class culture are perhaps, in the postmodern period, not so attractive, this has always seemed to be an unnecessary traditionalism. Bloch's vision was much vaster, and involved a new kind of pantheon of the forms of human cultural production which would, I think, be much more attractive to us in the postmodern era. Sabry Hafez: How can you explain the increasing interest of the exponents of modern critical discourse, from the structuralists to the Marxists, in the literature of the Third World ? Is this a reaction to over-emphasizing the elaboration of literary structure and a return to the concept of value ? Is it a result of the relative stagnation in certain Western literatures ? Or is it part of the process of rejuvenation of Western modern critical theory and has nothing to do with the "Third World" as such ? Is it possible to transfer the socio-economic demarcation coined by the dominant "First World" into the realm of literature without the danger of imposition and displacement ? Is the concept of "Third World" literature a descriptive or normative one ? And what makes it different from other literatures ? Fredric Jameson: In my opinion, the new interest in the culture fully as much as the literature of the Third World comes into being simultaneously with postmodernism. It certainly has something to do with the development of that literature and culture itself, which is very rich all over the world, and which seems to me to have gone beyond its original realist and modernist stages. This also has something to do, I think, with the impoverishment of culture in a kind of standardized media Alif 10 (1990) 119</page><page sequence="7">society like this First World one, which is therefore tempted to reinvigorate itself perpetually and to restore its vitality by infusions of a more vital culture from the outside. One could also go into any number of parallels with postmodernism itself, which I think must have something to do with the simultaneity of the economic situation all over the world but which are nonetheless paradoxical and certainly not be understood as any kind of convergence between these two very different movements. The return to storytelling would be one of those. The disappearance of, let's say "centered" or anthropomorphic characters would be another one. What's generally called textuality is of course a feature of all kinds of texts today, including media texts. So that, I suppose, one could argue fully as much for a radical break of many contemporary Third World writers and cultural producers with their own pasts as one could for analogies with forms developing in the First World. I suppose that one must also stress the signiElcance of language in all this. My own feeling is ffiat literature is the least signiElcant area of production in Western postmodernisms and that clearly has something to do with the standardization of our languages by way of the media. My sense is that in many Third World traditions (one doesn't want to generalizes obviously) language, eloquence in the older senses the word as such s retains a prestige and a power that it has lost in late capitalism in the Wests and that the linguistic material available to Third World writers is therefore much more fruitful. I'm not worried about the transfer of Western critical theory to the Third World or to its context. It seems to me that Third World critics are perfectly capable of knowing what to use, what to modify, and what to reject -- and indeed are bound to modify all these things ceaselessly, just as we ourselves have modiEled everything that came to us from Europe, France or Germany. Or if you prefer, North Americans could make a similar argument, and of course they have done so in previous periods of their own history, about the importation of theory from Europe -- something which could be extended into a general paradigm of importation from the outside, in some distant analogy with the eclecticism of the Roman Empire. As a matter of fact, I feel certain that we both are and will continue to get an increasing amount of theoretical production and new conceptuality from the 120 Alif 10 (1990)</page><page sequence="8">former Third World as we have from Europe in the past. So that at that point, Third World theory will really be Third World theory. I do think that there is something crippling in overstressing the way in which we're all locked into our national situations. That can be a very healthy realization -- the battles that some critics have had over foreign theory also sometimes expresses a struggle between intellectuals, people, groups who feel that their function has been usurped by other groups, and of course those struggles are also not to be taken lightly. On the other hand, I think that we do have things to say to each other, and that one of our tasks at least is to create some kind of new global cultural network, one which is not certainly free of antagonism and tension, but which allows us to speak more directly, just as I'm doing in this journal. It would therefore be unwise to exaggerate the degree to which our critical ideas only project our own realities and are absolutely unable to have any purchase on the various kinds of external other reality that come before us, culturally or otherwise. Abbas Al-Tonsi: Could you specify your understanding of "history" or "historicism" and its relationship to your view of "totality"? How does your concept of the "historical" relate to the subject-object and individual-social dichotomies ? Terry Eagleton's reading of these issues in your writings led him to qualify your Marxism as Hegelian. Do you endorse such a judgment ? Fredric Jameson: I've already said something implicit about historicism in my Hegel question as I have about totality, but it might be worth saying all that in a somewhat different way and connecting it to the answer to the previous question, because I think that the best way of making one's own thoughts and interpretations situational is not to lock oneself into some diagnosis of ethnocentrism but rather to be aware of one's historical situation and the way in which that, I won't say relativizes but marks one's point of view. Therefore I think the question of foreign theory is much better dealt with in a historicist manner. That would imply that one went back and looked at the Alif 10 (1990) 121</page><page sequence="9">internal national socio-economic situation in which certain kinds of theories arose (I'm thinking, obviously, of some theories of the French 1960s but there would be many others and many other countries to look at), and then analyzed the conditions of possibility for that theory to travel across into other national situations and to play a part. That would, I think, not relativize the value of these theories in any banal sense of the word. It would leave them with their power and validity intact, but it would reduce that value locally, just as Einstein's theory of relativity is said to transform Newton's general laws into the local laws of a small corner of a much larger universe. That kind of historicizing, I think, is therapeutic and an excellent way for intellectuals to bring themselves up against a renewed consciousness of their own concrete situation before they start to look out across at that of others. So, I would very strongly endorse the matter of historicism. I think that the Althusserian attack on it was needlessly motivated by the anxiety that, if a relativity of the historical situation prevailed, then the scientific value of Marx and Marxism would ultimately be lost. I think that there is little danger of this except in some vast and cosmic sense. Some of the classics of Marxism were always well aware that, according to some of their own paradoxical formulations, Marxism was the theory of capitalism and would lose its validity or its "truth" so to speak when that ended and gave place to something else. I would agree with that form of historicizing and relativizing, but I don't think it will clearly enough do much to the validity of Marxism today for some time. We have grown increasingly suspicious of Hegelian notions of self-consciousness and reflection and reflexivity, and I share some of those doubts and suspicions, but if we don't want that then we need to have some other form of self-critical distance and that can only be found, I think, in the historicist attitude towards our own present as history. Totality plays a part in this insofar as totality is the supreme instrument for grasping the nature of one's own current situation or that of other people. That is, it seems to me, that unless one's cultural critiques and social diagnoses are governed by at least the regulative idea of totality, of connecting everything together and seeing all of those things as part of one enormous process, then what comes out are little more than opinions or 1' 22 Alif 10 ( 1990)</page><page sequence="10">journalistic impressions. I would want to add to this defense of totality, which I've made in a number of places lately for the obvious reasons that these are truths not merely forgotten but maybe absolutely repressed in our day. I've also tried to insist on one of the basic lessons of the Frankfurt School, namely that the social totality today is more total than it was -- that is to say, the very logic of late capitalism is an absolutely totalizing one which wishes to penetrate everywhere and to make links with everything, so that it is not our own love for this kind of thinking which drives us toward it, but the nature of the object and of the system itself. Surely this is true in the various disciplines, all of which are straining at their seams and feel the vocation to be interrelated in deeper ways. Unfortunately, in most postmodern disciplines, so to speak, or in most disciplines in the postmodern period, that effort to transcend disciplinary boundaries generally takes the form of simple transcoding, borrowing of this or that, transformation of one concept in one field into another one, metaphorical and intertextual uses of language from other fields, and so on. This is because, clearly, there are very few models of what a totalizing grasp of the transdisciplinary object or the social totality would be; and I dare say that Marxism is probably the only one that remains valid and vigorous in the contemporary world. Abbas Al-Tonsi: Let's confront now the crisis of Marxist literary criticism as exemplified in the theory of reflection and the relationship between superstructure and infrastructure. Isnlt the concept of mediation(s), after all, circular and unable to penetrate the problematic? Can't you see that such conceptual constructs (as mediations) join sometimes the very core of idealism, where perception (and it is not enough to qualify it as collective perception) is mixed up with the object ? Do you agree that the concept of reflection constitutes a misreading of Marxist dialectics because it focuses on dualism and presupposes a homogeneous, levelled totality inside each and every superstructure and base ? Fredric Jameson: Yes, I think that the notion of reflection or correspondence has long since been blown away from most Alif 10 (1990) 123</page><page sequence="11">Marxist approaches. My own masters in this respect were the writers of the Frankfurt School, in particular Adorno, for whom the basic clue as to the historicity of a work and its deeper relationship to its social context lay m the form of the text and the generic innovation involved in it, rather than in its content. On the other hand, I think that the danger for Marxist criticism today is, having modernized itself in respects such as these and shed its antiquated doctrines of reflection and correspondence, that it may lose its identity altogether and fade away into other approaches. I think that Marxist criticism must hold to the conception of ideological analysis, albeit in as elaborate and complex modern and postmodern ways as you like, and it must remain committed to the problem of something like a context, that is something like a connection between the text, or the cultural artifact, and its larger situation. How to prevent that from falling back into the kind of dualism you rightly denounce is, of course, a fundamental problem which I would be tempted to approach by way of the dynamic form that I mentioned a moment ago. Abbas Al-Tonsi: I would like to inquire as to how you arrived to Marxism and Marxist criticism ? Could you also elaborate on your concept and view of Mist criticism ? Fredric Jameson : At virtually the dawn of my independent intellectual life, I found myself mesmerized by a sentence of Mallarme that I later on used as the motto to my book Marxism and Form. It ran like this, "il n'existe d'ouvert a la recherche mentale que deux voies, en tout, ou bifurque notre besoin, a savoir, l'esthetique d'une part et aussi l'economie politique." On a weak reading, this could mean little more than a "bifurcation" of needs into the body and the mind or soul, or somewhat less reprehensibly, into work and leisure time -- these two zones being governed by economics and culture respectively. I have read more into it, and trust it will not be a matter of self-indulgence (or at least not merely a matter of self-indulgence) if I think it useful to pursue the relationship between Mallarme's notion and what I have come to discover is my own conception of Marxism itself (an area in which Mallaxme's judgement is born out very paradoxically indeed, since as Perry Anderson has 124 Alif 10 (1990)</page><page sequence="12">observed the most striking and significant products of Marxist research and thought have tended precisely to be the twin distant poles of the economic and the aesthetic). It will also be the occasion to reflect on judgements I have made on ethics, which have been widely deplored, Cornel West reminding me quite properly of the force of the ethical in practical politics, while Jonathan Arac wisely observes that my attempt decisively to separate the ethical from the political will confirm all the worst stereotypical fears about the "immorality" of Marxism itself. What I wanted to achieve in this radical separation was a valorization of collective thought and logic over that purely individual kind that seems to predominate in ethical theories; the effort seemed to me cognate with any number of versions of the end of individualism and the death of the subject (as well as to approach certain theological traditions which it seems to me a misnomer to call ethical and which also have to do with the extinction of pride or the subject itself); finally, in the relative neglect of the originality of collective action itself (which I was tempted to distinguish from the individual in a wellnigh ontological fashion), all exaggerations seemed justified, provided they made the point I wanted to argue, which they do not seem to have done. I want now to reassert this same position but by enlarging it in a way that may make its consequences somewhat clearer in unexpected directions. For I have only very slowly come to understand that -- if it was a matter of making myself clear to other people -- the word political -- that I sought sharply to distinguish from the work ethical -- was likely not merely to be ineffective but even counterproductive. "Political" for a Marxist public had to do with Praxis as such and with forms of activity in which long terms and short terms were uniquely coordinated, in ways it would be too complicated to explain here but which seem to me to justify the claim for a uniquely Marxian conception of politics (based on the uniquely Marxian concept of Praxis ). But for most people, I suspect that politics splits apart into two lower-level meanings, the first having simply to do with any kind of group action against institutions; the second having to do with political philosophy. It is this second meaning I want to dwell on here, with the Alif 10 (1990) 125</page><page sequence="13">result of reviving many of the older stereotypical objections about Marxism, in particular the one that accuses Marxism of lacking a tradition of political reflection and even of repressing politics as such. There is a way in which this stereotype seems to me not merely justified but deserving of a certain measured celebration. Political philosophy, indeed, and not merely the tedious handbooks of its specialists and interpreters, seems to me par excellence the realm of sheer opinion, which is to say in some rather negative sense, of ideology itself. Of opinion I have always held that it is the least interesting kind of thinking or expression; this is of course in me nothing but an opinion, although it is strengthened somewhat by Hegel's endorsement, in whom it might be expected to be something else and something more substantial. At any rate one comes to Marxism at least partly with the conviction that convictions themselves are formed at some deeper place than sheer opinion by realities other than conscious choices -- realities of social class and of the unconscious, which have sometimes been what the word ideology designated (when it was not precisely used to designate the conscious effects of those convictions or beliefs in the realm of sheer opinion -- this duality being another way of characterizing what is potentially unstable not only in the traditional concept of ideology but in anything else that seeks to cover the same field by substitution and transcoding). But if the source of opinion, and of sheer ideology in its unstable, conscious, epiphenomenal forms, lies in this deeper ontological relationship to the real (which can of course be modified and transformed, in ideological conversion, on the occasion of radically new kinds of class experience), then the surface play of ideological effects and opinions is insubstantial -- for all its very real practical consequences -- and a doubtful foundation on which to base either a theory or a practice. Such opinions are what are generally thought to be political; and their range is equally expressed by the procedures and mannerisms of the textbooks, with their intolerableisms, that designate either modes of argument (that is to say, essentially of rationalization) -- decisionism, consequentialism, teleologism -- or "positions" which strangely resemble their philosophical or metaphysical opposite numbers, the Weltanschauungen or world views, of 126 Alif 10 (1990)</page><page sequence="14">which we are plausibly told that there is a finite number, and which then open out into a set of combinations or chessboard squares which one can adopt at will and optionally. It is this optionality of the world views (idealism, realism, materialism) or of the political philosophies (libertarianism, petty bourgeois radicalism) that marks them most securely as sheer opinion, not in the sense in which people can be asked to change them without notice, but in the sense that they are not primary phenomena, but rather accidents of a different kind of substance. As effects, they offer a source of activity to the mind, which can explore its opinions and sometimes discover unsuspected ones; interbreed them and evolve new species of ideology, or fresh combinations of older opinionated features. The work on this great variety of "self-expression", its simplification and organization according to easily graspable oppositions or combinations, is a very interesting pastime indeed; but it should be called typology rather than "philosophy" (political or otherwise) and has little content in its own right unless one is interested in experiencing the traditional anthropological wonderment at the variety of human thought and . . Oplnlon. This opinion of mine leads to two kinds of conclusions; first, that Marxism is not a political philosophy of that kind, and in no way "on all fours" with conservatism, liberalism, radicalism, populism or whatever. There is certainly a Marxist practice of politics (alluded to above), but political thinking in Marxism, when it is not practical in that way, has exclusively to do-with the economic organization of society, and how people cooperate to organize production. This means that "socialism" is not exactly a political idea, or if you like that it presupposes the end of a certain political thinking. It also means that we do have our homologues among the bourgeois thinkers, but they are not the fascists (who have very little in the way of thought in that sense, and have in any case become historically extinct), but rather the neo-liberals and the market people: for them also, political philosophy is worthless (at least once you get rid of the arguments of the Marxist, collectivist enemy), and "politics" now means simply the care and feeding of the economic apparatus (in this case the market rather than the collectively owned and organized means of production). Indeed, I will argue later on the Alif 10 (1990) 127</page><page sequence="15">proposition that we have much in common with the neo-liberals, indeed virtually everything -- save the essentials. But these conclusions now lead me to a second and to my mind more interesting interpretation of the Mallarme sentence by which I was so long fascinated: it has to do with the determination of form by content (and thus in some way with ths dialectic itself). What I have been calling the intolerable optionality of ethical thought or political Weltanschauungen can now be expressed in a different way by suggesting that each involves a play of concepts that seems to have no deeper determination by its content, to know none of the constraints of the historical situation or the resistances of matter itself. The doctrine of form and content, however, coordinates action and history (or on another paradigm, base and superstructure), by reading the creativity and possibilities, the invention, of the active term in the light of the limiting factors of the inert term or the fundamental situation itself; only a certain number of projects and outcomes are possible, and if there is an ontology of Marxism it lies in that through praxis and its determinate failures one confronts the very nature of Being itself (provided you grasp Being as a historical and changing, evolving process). But even though -- on the view and from the perspective of Marxism, to be sure, which is neither an ethics nor a politics -- ethics and politics are themselves profoundly determined by a deeper content, which is to be found in ideological commitment, social class, historical experience; on their own terms, and viewed within the limits of the semi-autonomous fields each has itself sought to constitute, that limit, that deeper content, is not visible and falls outside the analysis. This is why ethics and politics are superficial "sciences," and why Mallarme was correct to oppose to them political economy and aesthetics, each of which is profoundly marked by the drama of content and the experience of limits, of the impossibility of forms and the constraints of historical development. These two "sciences" are in this sense profoundly homologous, in that each one requires a constant and dialectical shuttling back and forth between the form and the reality itself, the "concept" and its material elements and social-historical derivations; the structural similarity is then further confirmed by the consummation of both in a certain Marxism, which alone and 128 Alif 10 (1990)</page><page sequence="16">for the first te reveals arld theonzes just this dialectic of form and content (They are of course not theo only "sciences" of this kind, as Mallarme seems to suggest: one would at least minimally also wmt to include one he could not have anticipateds namely psychoanalysis, and perhaps also anthropology.) Mona Abousenna : I am conceined with comparative literature arld the relationship of culture and philosophy to literature. In my work, I have tackled these issues within a broad Marxist perspective based on the theory of civilization and adopting the recent view about the integrating processes now taking place in cultural development, particularly in the field of cultural creativity as a universal phenomenon. Within this global, universal perspective cultural values retain their significance beyond the borders of the civilization that created them, serving as the basis for further cultural development. I have called this approach the civilizational perspective. In my comparative studies of Arabic and European literature, I have placed the culture of the Enlightenment at the core of a civilizational perspective that aims at establishing a dialogue between cultures on the basis of equality and productivity for a future civilization. My question is the following: how can the global perspective transcend the social and ideological contradictions resulting from a class-divided society founded on property ownership and exploitation on the national as well as the international level ? Fredric Jameson : I think the question needs to be turned inside out: as formulated, it tends to suggest a relatively older liberal world-vision, in which ( no doubt following World War 11 ) the global perspective was a benign one, of cooperation and the end of war and violence, whereas the national perspective included class tensions and antagonisms ( not to speak of the violence of this or that nationalism itself ). I would have thought we needed to reverse that perspective: the struggles within the nation-state -- if they are not smothered or occulted in one way or another-- are the authentic ones, which, when they are fought ffirough, can alone be resolved. It is the global level and the new world system that is on the contrary negative, in the way in which Alif 10 (1990) 129</page><page sequence="17">it makes local and national autonomies impossible, and locks populations into an economic machine over which they have no control. Indeed, to anticipate on the next questions I would say that it is precisely because class tensions are concealed within the superstate that our ( First World ) literature and culture is lacking in vitality. But the new world system has only been in existence (or at least has only been visible as such ) in the last ten or twenty years; so the other implicit question cannot yet be answered, namely what relationship can one posit between politics at the internal level and some conceivable politics on the level of the global system as a whole. This is a period of enounous and unthinkable class restructuration on a global scale, in which the very positions of First arld lthird World ownership, industry, work-force, etc.are being modified in unpredictable new ways, ways that leave politics problematic for the moment, but which also problematize the politics of culture. We need to feel our way towards some larger world cultural space -- I have called it " ars internationalism of the national situations " -- in which the ntemal SpeCifilCit of ffie national culxre is respected at the same time that its subordination to the world economic system is intensified, alld lived as a constraint and a domination about which intellectuals and artists are lucid. The new global cultural perspective must pass through the national situation and its analogies with other such national situations; alld not try to leap at once into the universal or into some " world literature" of an old-fashioned type. Aida Nasr: What steps are Westetn literary scholars taking to accommodate Third World texts in a theoretical sense? Fredric Jameson : So in effect I have already begun to answer this question about the status of Third World literature in the West, at least as I see that status. I should say that this very issue seems to me the hottest current topic of debate among the more "advanced" Westem theoreticians (along with the question of postmodernism, to which it is not unrelated). The urgency of it arises not merely from the disintegration of the canon, but also from the enormous recent richness of Third World literature and culture itself, which has (at least since the breakthrough of the 130 Alif 10 (1990)</page><page sequence="18">Latin-American "boom") begun to set its own agenda. Much is being done in the area of so-called colonial discourse ( which seeks to study the formal effects on Western literature of the fact of imperialism itself ) and also of so-called postcolonial literature, which seeks to study the newer Third World texts themselves, across the barrier of classical non-Western languages that most of us cannot hope to appropriate, but which are themselves central facts and problems in those cultures. I myself speak from a perspective in which the relative sterility of the cultures of the three great First World or late capitalist zones ( Europe, the U.S., Japan ) is acknowledged, and therefore in which the more vital cultural production of the other areas now affords us possibilities of analysis we cannot find in our own literatures. For example, the whole theory of a properly Western modernism now needs to be revised in the light of the experience of modernization in the Third World. This ought to issue in a new period of cultural comparatism on a global scale that will replace, but have nothing in common with, what used to be called "comparative literature". It will henceforth need to include the media ( and what used to be called "cultural imperialism") and it needs to be conflictual, full of critical sympathy with the various nationalisms, attentive to religion and to language revolutions, suspicious of United-Nations-type liberalism, and alert to the paradoxes that obtain when the "Third World" also exists inside the "First World" in the form of minorities, ethnic groups, migrant workers, and the like (as this is the case in all three superpowers).
