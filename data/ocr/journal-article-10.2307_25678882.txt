April</page><page sequence="2">BOOKS IRELAND April20o8 87 (1852-1913) was a popular writer in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and his books continued to sell long after his death, but he was also famous for his involvement in the land question. For much of his life he was a priest in Doneraile. His arrival there coincided with the last stages of the land war and the introduction of the Land Acts and he played a major part in the negotiations between tenants and landlords, earning a national reputation in the process. He was regarded as a man of integrity respected by all sides, even non-catholics. Clifford gives us a very personal view of Sheehan which is as much about his own personal experiences as Sheehan's life. Clifford concentrates on Sheehan as a land reformer but his view is tempered by his own interpretation of the troubles in the North. The result is that this book is not up to the standard we have come to expect of the Aubane Historical Society of late in either content or production, though it is refreshing to find a long-unfashionable novelist fully appreciated. + * Dan Donovan: an everyman's life. Vera Ryan. Collins Press. 224 pp 16.99 ?12.99 pb 21 cm +1 905172-59-7. An oral memoir by Dan Donovan as told to Vera Ryan, who lectures at Crawford College, Cork, and is involved in mounting exhibitions and writing about art in the city. Now an old man, Donovan played many roles in the cultural life of Cork as teacher, actor, director and broadcaster. He was taught at UCC by Daniel Corkery and was involved from the early days with Cork's film and choral festivals. He also worked with the Southern Theatre Group, the Everyman Theatre and the Palace Theatre. This rich and full life is narrated in lively prose with an ear for a good phrase that tells us as much about Cork as it does about Dan Donovan - though there is an 'exasperated' in place of 'exacerbated' on page 3! There are photos throughout, placed near the relevant text, and they add yet more enlightenment to it. I + * / Derek: Dublin's gentle giant. Helen MacBroom. Athena Press. 77 pp ?5.99 pb 20cm +1-84748-251-8. This short book is an affectionate tribute to a big man, Derek Howe, whose face will be familiar to many who live in Dublin because for many years he cleaned parking metres on the city's streets. People may not have realised that this gentle giant suffered from Asperger's syndrome. Like many such people he was gifted musically and mathematically but his gifts were never recognised and from his schooldays on he was shunned, even physically abused, for being different. Despite everything he learned to cope and was always optimistic. This book is an honest and moving account of Derek and his ups and downs by his sister. Even from a distance life with him could be difficult since Derek had to have a routine for everything and there could be no spontaneity. She tells Derek's story from his birth at the outbreak of world war 2 to his death in his flat in January 2007. His is not only an interesting story in itself but may help people to better understand Asperger's Syndrome. The cover is exceptionally appealing, and he text is set in an unusual typeface which, contrary to our expectation, is very pleasant and easy on the eye. - * / Ella Young: Irish mystic and rebel. Rose Murphy. Liffey Press. 170 pp + 8of photos 16.95 pb 23 cm +1 905785-31-5- Ella Young (1865-1951) may not be a household name in Ireland today but she had a very interesting life. She was active enough in advanced nationalist circles to get her name on a British blacklist and well-regarded enough for her Celtic revivalist writings to mix with Dublin's literary elite such as W. B. Yeats and AE. However she spent most of her life in the United States where she was associated with the arts scene and involved in mysticism on the West Coast. She was closely connected with the 'Dunites', idealistic drifters who prefigured the later Hippy movement. Given the dearth of material on Irish literary women, it would have been easy for Rose Murphy to write a trumpet blowing biography but, she tells us, she firmly set her mind against looking at Young's life "through a contrived lesbian-feminist lens". With a story that drops big names from early twentieth-century Ireland and includes adventures on the wilder fringes of America, Murphy is well able to let Young's life speak for itself. B, I ++ * * He That Is Down Need Fear No Fall. Bruce Arnold. Ashfield Press. 256 pp 12.99 pb 20 cm +1 901658-71-2; 17.99 hb -70-5. This is a strange and haunting book about a strange and haunting love story. There is nothing conventional about how the story came to be told. A woman, Barbara Young, died on 15 May 2003 alone, unmarried and childless. When her effects were being sorted out they found a box of letters telling of a passionate relationship with George Arnold, Bruce's father, who had died in 1975. Arnold tells the story of his father and Barbara which he partly witnessed and never understood. The title comes from the fact that George began to slide after a promising start in the Royal Navy. It was said that he had fallen so far that he could fall no further but he did. Central to all this was his love for Barbara but it did not guarantee happiness and made other relationships fraught. Arnold tells the story from his own perspective but with sympathy and understanding. An unusual book from Bruce Arnold who is well known both as an art connoisseur and for his political journalism and biographies. Shirley Kelly interviews him up front this month. ++ * -* * / The Insider: the Belfast prison diaries of Eamonn Boyce 1956-1962. ed. Anna Bryson. Lilliput Press. 295 pp + 8 of photos hb 23 cm +1-84351-129-8. Far from lilliputian, three big - and valuable - tomes come from the Lilliput Press this month, on O'Malley, Moriarty and Casement (see below) and not much less bulky is this account of one man's experience of the IRA campaign in the North that preceded - and is now occluded by - the weary thirty years now thankfully ended. Boyce was imprisoned for his part in the raid on Gough Barracks in Armagh in December 1954. An idealistic young man, he wrote these diaries in Irish in the old script and remarkably kept them intact in the following decades. The book has an extensive introduction which explains the circumstances of the IRA campaign in the 1950s and what it hoped to achieve, a question-and-answer interview with Boyce and an English translation of the diaries themselves. Taken as a whole they give us details and insight not just into prison life but the Republican movement at that time. I + / * Michael Davitt: from the Gaelic American. John Devoy. UCD Press. 174 pp 24 ?16.95 pb 18 cm +1 904558-73-6. John Devoy was a leading figure in Irish-American politics who was a member of the IRB. He was also a journalist with the New York Herald and edited the Gaelic American. In the latter capacity he published in serialised form this appreciation of Michael Davitt. Davitt was a towering presence in Irish politics in the late 19th century and a truly international figure. A former member of the IRB himself, he founded the Irish Land League and negotiated the New Departure with Parnell which saw the coupling of the land and national questions in Irish politics. This book concentrates on the 1880s and the New Departure. It is significant in giving a contemporary view of Davitt and a detailed account of what the New Departure was about. It is a pity that Davitt's achievements are not better known in Ireland today. Perhaps this book will help amend that. It is published as one of UCD's useful Classics of Irish History series. / * / Michael O'Leary: a life in full flight. Alan Ruddock. Penguin. 455 pp ?5.99 pb 20 cm +1-844 88056-0. This is an updated edition of the biography which came out last year to great acclaim. It is a very approving account which traces the rise of O'Leary from his middle-class roots to his current tycoon status. Despite his high profile and the huge success of Ryanair, little is known of O'Leary the man as he prefers to keep his private life private but Ruddock aims to bring the private man into public view and explain just what drives him and why he succeeds. Whatever you may think about O'Leary, and not IRELAND'S LEADING BOOKBINDERS for more than 40 years Hardback Paperback Wire-0 &amp; Looseleaf Binding Slipcases Ring Binders Portfolios Gameboards Presentation &amp; Giftware Boxes For all information and quotations call Colin Newman or Karen Duffy at Tel: 842 7166 or Fax: 842 7641 everyone likes him, this is a hugely entertaining read about one of the most influential Irishmen of his generation. I * / 'No Surrender Here!' the civil war papers of Ernie O'Malley 1922-1924. ed. Cormac K. H. O'Malley and Anne Dolan. Lilliput Press. 720 pp + 8 of photos hb 23 cm +1-84351-127-4. O'Malley is often regarded as the most romantic of the Irish republicans and has even been called the IRA's John Buchan. Not just a man of action, he was also a writer and a man of culture. His trilogy on the war of independence and the civil war are considered classics of their kind. It should come as no surprise then that he wrote down many things during the civil war in which he was on the anti-treaty side. This book is a collection of letters, memoranda and orders written by him - and to him by such as Liam Lynch - from 1922 to 1924, a period which saw him as soldier, commander and prisoner. They contain descriptions of events at the time, and his thoughts on politics and the war, and they deal with the practical matters of running a military campaign. Cormac O'Malley is Ernie's son and he has worked on other books about his father. Dolan is a history lecturer at TCD, and Professor J. J. Lee has contributed a chapter on the political background. This immense and scrupulously edited collection of all the incidental writings of a key figure at a key time gives a unique insight into its author and into the times in which he lived. B, I * &gt; * / Paddy Mo: the life of Patrick Moriarty. Owen McCrohcm. Lilliput Press. 263 pp + 24 of photos hb 23 cm +1-84351-077-2. Paddy Moriarty may not be a household name today but not long ago he was a leading public figure and one of the most influential people in the state. For much of the 1980s and 1990s he was the chief executive of the Electricity Supply Board, Ireland's largest semi-state industry. He revolutionised the way that the ESB was run, expanded its business overseas, and can even claim some credit for laying the foundations of the tiger economy. This book is very much a tribute, charting his life from humble beginnings in Kerry to his joining ESB as a clerk in 1945, and then following his career to the top. It all reads like an Irish version of the American dream and in many ways Moriarty was an Americanised businessman but he was also an Irishman who fostered projects like the Shannon Erne Waterway and was active in the arts. McCrohan, a fellow Kerryman, paints a colourful portrait of this larger than life person. I + ~* * / Roddy Connolly and the Struggle for Socialism in Ireland. Charlie McGuire. Cork University Press. 328 pp 49 ?33 hb 23cm +1-85918-420-2. Roddy was the son of James Connolly and like his father a champion of socialism. He was also an important figure on the left even if he did not achieve the same prominence as his father. He was born in 1901 and so was just old enough to take part in the 1916 rising. Five years later he formed the Communist party of Ireland when he was still young enough to be an unsullied idealist. After peace came, he pioneered the move from revolutionary to parliamentary politics. As with all such movements in Ireland, there were splits, falling-outs and feuds which led him</page><page sequence="3">88 April2oo8 BOOKS IRELAND by John Hamrock 978-0-9539974-7-3 161 pages 13.00 A comprehensive family history guide.

His dream was that a broad left coalition encompassing socialists and left-wing republicans could win an election, but it was not to be. He had a moderately successful personal career as a TD and Senator, and for a time was chairman of the Labour Party before his death in 1980. McGuire has been a trades union activist and tutored in the department of Political Science and Sociology at NUI Galway before becoming a researcher at the University of Teesside. B, I + &gt; * Roger Casement: imperialist, rebel, revolutionary. Seamas 0 Sfochain. Lilliput Press. 680 pp +16 of photos hb23 cm +1-84351-021-5. Casement is one of the most enigmatic figures in recent Irish history, and that is even before we consider his sexuality. A loyal servant of the British Crown which rewarded him with a knighthood, a campaigner on behalf of slaves and exploited workers, and lastly a leader of the 1916 Rising who was hanged by the British. 6 Sfochain lectures in anthropology in NUI Maynooth and along with Angus Mitchell is Ireland's leading expert on Casement. In this monumental work he examines all aspects of Casement's life and the people he was involved with, and it bids fair to be the last word on the man, at least for decades to come. Along with many photographs that have not been widely seen before, the book goes into detail into the various aspects of his career and is perhaps most useful in explaining Casement's contacts with Germany and the attempts to raise an Irish brigade there. In recent years so much controversy has been generated about Casement's sexuality and the authenticity or otherwise of the so-called Black Diaries that the other aspects of his life have been overshadowed. This major biography does justice to the man and gives due weight to all the phases of his life. The author shows pretty convincingly that the diaries could not have been forgeries. B, I * * * CRITICISM J* G. Farrell. John McLeod. Northcote House. 127 pp ?2.99 pb 21 cm +0-7463-0986-5. A critical study of one of Ireland's most enigmatic novelists. Farrell's Empire trilogy is regarded as a modern classic. McLeod gives us a critical study of these - Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur, and The Singapore Grip. He establishes their context in a tradition of imperial literature and examines how Farrell's own life influenced his writing. McLeod argues that it would be wrong to see Farrell as nostalgic or a traditionalist since his books are a biting critique of the British empire and very modern in their approach both to subject and storytelling. This idea is further reinforced by comparison with Farrell's earlier works which McLeod also considers. This book is published as part of Northcote's series on writers and their work. I, B / * The Poefs Chair. John Montague, Nuala Nf Dhomhnaill and Paul Durcan. Lilliput 279 pp 20 ?14-99 hb 21 cm +1-84351-094-9; 12 ?10 pb -095-6. The Ireland Chair of Poetry was instituted to celebrate Seamus Heaney's winning of a Nobel prize. The Queen's College of Belfast, University College Dublin and Trinity College Dublin serve as hosts for each incumbent each for a year, and his or her job during that time is to give a lecture there. Here are the nine lectures given by the first three Ireland Professors of Poetry, in which Montague talks of the relationship of poet and community, and the challenge of translation, Ni Dhomhnaill of Gaelic antecedents (in Irish with English versions) and on her experiences in Turkey, and Durcan on Cronin, Hartnett and Harry Clifton. Seamus Heaney provides a foreword and Donnell Deeny, the Chair's first chairman, a preface. And as we linger over the delights of his sparkling collection, we hear that Michael Longley has been chosen to be professor number four. **&gt; * &gt; * FOLKLORE Essays on the Early Irish King Tales, ed. Dan. M. Wiley. Four Courts Press. 225 pp 55 hb 23 cm +1 84682-045-8. Wiley is an assistant professor at Southern Illinois University, USA, and has researched and written extensively on early Ireland. Tales of the deeds of kings is a central element to early literature in Ireland. While they cannot, as earlier scholars held, be regarded as history they do nevertheless contain much information about early society, political organisation and culture in Ireland. The tales survived for generations and many passed into the oral tradition of recent times. However anyone expecting a retelling of the tales here will be disappointed as this book is a case of academics talking to each other to discuss in depth the minutiae of this literature and what can be learned from it. Titles such as 'Some Thoughts on Baile Binnberlach mac Buain\ no matter how well written, are not likely to attract the general reader. I * / * y GUIDES The Paris of Joyce &amp; Beckett: a tourist guide. London Irish Literary Travel, 62b Hereford Road, London W2 5AJ. 103 pp 9.99 ?7.49 pb 21 cm +0 9532898-1-3. This slim guide was first published in 1998 as a 32-page pamphlet at ?1.80 and has not changed much. There are now ten instead of five walking itineraries of up to 4 hours' duration, based on routes taken on particular occasions by one of the writers or both, with commentaries topographic, biographic and literary. One of the tours is in London, the rest are in Paris. The editing and design are still unsophisticated, there are still no street maps and no illustrations of any significance (other than good photo portraits of Joyce in 1934 and Beckett heading for eternity), but then devotees of the two are accustomed to more difficult puzzles than this. The cover is smart and glossy, promising something a bit more professional inside, and there is a (fairly amusing) amateur cartoon, a beckettry crossword puzzle, an appreciation of Thomas MacGreevy and an extract from Lois Gordon's The World of Samuel Beckett. B HISTORY The Catholic Church and the Protestant State: nineteenth-century Irish realities. Oliver P. Rafferty. Four Courts Press. 221 pp 55 hb 23 cm +1 84682-084-7 Critics of Irish nationalism, especially those who accuse it of sectarianism, overlook the fact that for most of its existence British rule made Ireland a Protestant state and that even after the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, the state continued to have a Protestant character. This obviously put the Catholic Church, to which the majority of the people belonged, in a very peculiar position. It is this situation that Rafferty, himself a Catholic cleric, examines in this groundbreaking book. He examines the view of the Catholic Church on the Act of Union and subsequent political developments and the relationship between the Catholic and Protestant churches. He paints a complex picture whereby the Catholic Church was not always in opposition to other churches and at various times depended on their goodwill. Likewise, its relationship to the state was many-layered and the Church was a dependent on the British state for funding clerical education and buildings for example. Interestingly Rafferty also looks at how the Catholic Church in Ireland interacted with that in England and comes to some surprising conclusions. All in all this is a pioneering work that looks at an obvious but much neglected aspect of 19th-century Ireland. I + &gt; * / Ireland's Magdalen Laundries and the nation's architecture of containment. James M. Smith. Manchester University Press. 295 pp +16 of photos pb 23 cm +0-7190-7888-0. The scandal of the Magdalen laundries has been publicly aired for some time now and so this book is not so much breaking new ground as engaging in a thorough examination of the ten laundries and what went on there. They opened in 1922 as workhouses run by religious orders for women or girls who were seen as a moral threat to Irish society, for example because of having a child out of wedlock. Conditions in the laundries were harsh. The women were forced to assume a new name, to work without pay and had no release date, all of which was done with no official sentence or due process. However, as if that were not bad enough, there was also widespread abuse and degradation of the inmates by those put in charge of them. Smith examines all this and also how they fitted into Irish society. Because the religious orders have not opened their archives and so there are no written sources, Smith contends that there can be no history of the laundries as such but a story which exists as a cultural artefact and he considers this also. This is a disturbing book about a dark part of the Republic's history. There are good photos throughout mingled with the text; there are also reproductions of a photomontage artwork by Diane Fenster. Manchester have the knack of making an academic study attractive to the ordinary reader. B, I / # Irish Agriculture: a price history from the mid eighteenth century to the eve of the first world war. Liam Kennedy and Peter M. Solar. Royal Irish Academy. 216 pp 30 pb 26 cm +1-904890-41-6. Though attractively got up, with illustrations and a lovely jacket, this is not for the general reader; it is a statistical account of agricultural produce, such as potatoes, oats and barley, in Ireland from the mid eighteenth century to the early twentieth. There are six chapters of narrative, but most of the book is occupied with tables and graphs of prices of everything produced on Irish farms. As such it will be an important work of reference for researchers for some time to come. It comes highly recommended from the likes of Professor Cormac 6 Grada.

Though there is a useful chronology of events up front, this book is divided into chapters on (in this order) the Castle's 'Public Information Branch', Dail Eireann's Department of Propaganda, and then one by one on the part played by five newspapers, Freeman's Journal, Irish Independent, Cork Examiner, Irish Times and The Times. This angle on the gaining of independence is one that has not been much used, and in portraying the days before radio and television-and indeed before Fianna Fail's Irish Press group - it no doubt throws as much light on the power of the press as on those critical years of Irish history. * / * / Shadows of the Gunmen: violence and culture in modern Ireland, ed. Danine Farquharson and Sean Farrell. Cork University Press. 238 pp 39 ?25 hb 23 cm +1-85918-424-0. Historians, film scholars, literary critics and even a philosopher come together to discuss in its various forms how violence has shaped modern Ireland and its role in culture. The nine essays in the book focus on different aspects of violence and in different periods. Peter Hart, whose controversial views are well known, discusses the necessity of violence in the Irish War of Independence while Sean Farrell discusses representations of Dolly's Brae, when in 1849 an Orange march was attacked by nationalists. Bernice Schrank looks at the work of Sean O'Casey while Elmer Kennedy-Andrews considers how the poetry of Ciaran Carson represents a new departure in Irish writing, Farquharson considers sex and violence in the 1916 Rising and Keith Hopper deconstructs Neil Jordan's film, Angel. In a similar vein, Brian Mcllroy looks at the representations of the troubles in cinema and a more general investigation of memory and history is undertaken by Richard Kearney. Putting Irish violence in a broader context, Timothy G. Mc Mahon compares and contrasts Irish anti imperial violence with that elsewhere in the world. This is an interesting if narrowly focused book. B, I Sport and Society in Victorian Ireland: the case of Westmeath. Tom Hunt. Cork University Press. 373 PP 39 ?25 hb 23 cm +1-85918-415-8. Hunt is a former county footballer with Waterford who now teaches in Mullingarand who has written other works on local history. The fact that CUP's press release can describe him as a county footballer and we all know what is meant shows clearly what organisation won out in the competition between rival sporting codes in Victorian Ireland. Hunt charts the evolution of hunting and racing as well as team sports like cricket and football - soccer, rugby and Gaelic - in both their social and political contexts. He looks too at the decline of croquet and growth of sports like golf and tennis as well as cycling, all of which became crystallised with universally accepted rules within Victoria's reign. This is a thorough and comprehensive examination of sport in Westmeath from the mid-igth century to the early 20th, illustrated with tables and statistics. As a snapshot of one county in fact it is indicative of Ireland as a whole, as politics and social change influenced what sports became popular and the shape they took. B, I * * / A Tour in Ireland in 1775- Richard Twiss. UCD Press. 188 pp 24 ?16.95 pb 18 cm +1-904558-90-3. Twiss was the son of an English merchant with Irish connections and his book was a huge success when it was published after a five-month trip round Ireland. It also caused uproar because of its unflattering and negative portrayal of the Irish. It is nevertheless a detailed study of the country in 1775 in which are extensive quotations from official and scholarly surveys and reports. Although often quoted itself, it has not been reprinted in full since that first edition until now. This volume comes with an introduction by Rachel Finnegan, head of creative and performing arts at Waterford Institute of Technology, and the original appendix with practical advice on making the grand tour, to which are added poetry of the sort that poured in those days from the pen of everyone with claims to literacy. There are some illustrations so small and sooty they were better left unreproduced. Another in the useful Classics of Irish History series. * * HISTORY INSTITUTIONAL From the Margins to the Centre: a history of the Irish Times. Dermot James.

A solid, reliable and fairly entertaining illustrated account of the newspaper founded in 1859 by a young home-ruler whose widow soon after sold it to a strongly unionist businessman. Thus as the voice of the British empire and the protestant 'establishment' the paper lost what mainstream influence it had with the coming of independence, and only in recent times has moved from marginal to central political and social influence - hence the title - its sales bit by bit gaining on those of the enormous, market-leading Irish Independent, while it pioneers in innovative journalism and simultaneously maintains something of its old-fashioned dignity. Anecdotes galore, good pen portraits of the personalities, and an account of the curious trust ownership. The author joined the company c. 1945 as checker of classified advertisements, and rose through the ranks until he was appointed company secretary in 1974, so you can be pretty sure that nothing too disrespectful of the newspaper gets into these pages. He is the author of some books of 19th-century family history. B, I * &gt; * / HISTORY LOCAL Blarney Castle: its history, development and purpose. Mark Samuel and Kate Hamlyn. Cork University Press. 164 pp 39 ?25 hb25cm +1-85918 411-0. This has already caused something of a stir by claiming that the stone kissed by hundreds of thousands of visitors to Blarney castle is not the real one. This claim has brought a lot of attention to the book but has distracted from the fact that this is a scholarly work which not only gives the history of the castle from it first building in the late 15th century by Cormac McCarthy - or before - to the present, but is also a detailed archaeological examination of the building itself. It takes in a discussion of mediaeval Gaelic society, the evolution of tower houses and a history of the McCarthy lords of Muskerry. It also looks into the legend of the stone and the role that the blarney about the castle has played in making it a tourist attraction over the decades. A handsome production archival and other prints, plans and diagrams. There are colour photos throughout remarkable for a queer softness and lack of contrast, but showing the subtleties of the stone and lichen colours well. Glossaries, B. I *+/ * The Priory of Llanthony Prima and Secunda in Ireland, 1172-1541: lands, patronage and politics. Arlene Hogan. Four Courts Press. 432 pp 75 pb 23 cm +1-84682-088-5. This concerns a religious foundation in what today is county Meath. In 1172, the Irish kingdom of Meath was granted to Hugh de Lacy by Henry II shortly after the Norman invasion. De Lacy in turn granted special status in his lands to the Welsh house of Llanthony. Hogan uses the extant records of the two houses to trace the history. In the main she relies on the various charters issued over the centuries which contain details about tithes, benefices and grants to tell the story. She paints a picture of medieval Ireland, its knights, lords and churchmen over a period of four centuries until its dissolution, giving us an insight into the workings of English controlled Ireland. B, I + / * / Spike Island: saints, felons and famine. Michael Martin. Nonsuch Publishing. 119 pp+ 8 of photos 14.99 pb 20cm +1-84588-910-4. Spike Island has a fourteen-hundred-year history of ecclesiastical, military and penal use. It is a prominent feature of Cork Harbour and has just recently been designated a heritage site with plans for a visitor centre and tours. Among the notable people associated with the island are Oliver Cromwell, John Mitchel and Eamon de Valera, although the latter was only there for one day to formally accept it into Irish hands when the British withdrew in 1938. Martin gives us a potted history of this historic island, dubbed Ireland's Alcatraz, in this readable, pocket-sized guide. He has been involved in promoting tourism in Cork for many years and has written extensively on local history and heritage. This is a neatly produced book with some nice black and white illustrations herded together on shiny paper at the end, although at 14.99 it is a bit pricey compared to similar books on the market.

The Irish language has been in decline for centuries but like Mark Twain claims of its demise are much exaggerated. Every few years a new book arrives examining the state of the language and prognosticating, usually inaccurately, about its future. In this major volume, twenty-one people involved with the language in one way or another undertake a review of Irish and what is likely to happen to it, all writing in English. There is no consensus, and the book could have been entitled Twenty-one New Views...' All aspects of the issue such as census returns, the role of the state, publications in Irish, placenames, scholarship and education come under the spotlight. Two chapters are worth singling out because of their current relevance, larfhlaith Watson examines the role of the language in national identity while Brian 6 Conchubhair considers the role of the diaspora in developing the language. The book identifies many threats to Irish as well as new and encouraging trends, pointing out its decline as an everyday language even in the Gaeltacht, but conversely for instance the remarkable growth in the number of (mostly primary) schools outside the Gaeltacht that teach 'through the medium'. Cois Life's design standards a re high, and they give good value. I LAW Literature, Judges and the Law. W. N. Osborough. Four Courts Press. 179 PP hb 23 cm +1 84682-079-3. Anything from Shakespeare to the Bible or from Ahab to Zola may be cited when a judge is summing up a case or delivering a sentence. Osborough takes cases from common law jurisdictions, mainly Ireland and Britain, to show that this use of literary quotations is not an example of judges showing off their reading but rather tends to be used to reinforce the rationale or reasoning behind a judgement. The book is laid out chronologically in terms of the references; hence we can turn to chapter five on the 17th and 18th centuries to see how fragments from the likes of Alexander Pope or Henry Fielding have featured in law cases. An interesting if abstruse bit of reading. B, I ; * / LITERATURE Joycean Murmoirs: Fritz Senn on James Joyce. ed. Christine O'Neill. Lilliput Press. 342 pp+ 8 of photos hb23cm +1-84351-125-0. Fritz Senn has studied the life and work of Joyce and other Joyceans for over fifty years. He has published and taught in Europe and America as well as co-founding the journal A Wake Newslitter and running the Zurich James Joyce Foundation since it was established in 1985. Christine O'Neill is a fellow Swiss who in her youth 'drifted' into a Senn Joyce seminar and presented a paper at short notice. She was at Trinity College Dublin for a year, and then returned to earn her doctorate on Ulysses in Zurich. Now she is a Dubliner with an Irish family and has pinned down Senn's reminiscences in written form with the help of a tape-recorder and we guess generous helpings of patience and good humour. She is the quiet, even invisible, interviewer who knows her subject well enough to provide the right prompts in minimal words, and so the top hums. Fritz Senn knew and knows all the Joyceans and speaks freely, amusingly and fascinatingly of their not-always cordial relations with each other and with the Joyce family, of the different factions and camps-and of course about the Joyce canon. It is rich stuff and lots of it, and of course will now itself become a major part of Joyce lore. B, I New Contexts: re-framing nineteenth-century Irish women's prose, ed. Heidi Hansson. Cork University Press. 216 pp 39 ?25 pb 23 cm +1-85918 4165. The eight female contributors to this book address the neglect and misunderstanding of literature produced by women in nineteenth century Ireland. Using the works of authors such as Lady Blessington, Maria Edgeworth and Somerville and Ross, they consider the social, cultural and political contexts of their time and pay particular attention to neglected female authors. It would appear that women authors were a key part of the Irish literary scene and some even wrote in genres usually associated with male writers. However in subsequent decades they fell from the public eye and critical notice. This book aims to right that injustice and bring Irish women writers of this period back into the limelight. Designers Kunnert &amp; Tierney always produce handsome books, but they have excelled in the choice of a painting for the jacket by Lars Segerstedt. I, ? / * NOVELS An Angel at my Back. Mary Stanley. New Island. 74 pp 6.50 pb 18 cm +1-905494-86-6. This is number six in the Open Door series from New Island. The idea for these originated with Patricia Scanlan who realised that students learning English as adults or as a second language needed simple straightforward books written especially for them rather than reworked versions of longer novels. So was born the idea of novellas from internationally known authors which introduce learners to English as well as appealing to the general reader. This book one is about the little girl, Lucy, who is bullied by her brother but has an angel to help her, well sort of, as she still ends up being injured and having to be operated on. - ? - * / Bullet and the Ark. Peter Sheridan. New Island. 78 pp 6.50 pb 18 cm +1-905494-84-2. Another in the Open Door series (see Angel above). Sheridan is best known for his theatre work with the Project although he has written as well and contributed another title, Old Money, New Money, to this series. Bullet and the Ark is about Bullet Ferguson who builds an ark on the Liffey because he loves animals. This all seems like innocent fun until he and his friends decide to rescue Jacko the parrot, which leads to all sorts of bother. . * / The Fall Girl. Denise Sewell. Penguin. 301 pp 9.99 ?6.99 pb 20cm +0-141-035157-4. Sewell's second novel after the successful, Some Girls Will, published last year. She grew up in Cavan before moving to New York and she is no doubt drawing on her own small-town experiences to give depth to this tale of a woman who lives in a small Irish town. She is dominated by her unloving mother but her best friend is the most dazzling girl in town. One day she cracks and steals a baby from outside a shop. This act unleashes a chain of events she could never imagine but which slowly and surely leads to her finding her true self and redemption. The story is South of the Border James Ryan This nuanced coming-of-age story rehearses the inner narrative of neutral Ireland as public perception contends with private experience in a series of convergent tableaux. South of the Border is a gem of narrative that brings the reader into the heart of a reality that was wartime Ireland. 240pp 978 1 84351134 2 15.00 pb 978 1 84351140 3 22.00 hb Roger Casement Imperialist, Rebel, Revolutionary Seamas 0 Siochain Roger Casement (1864-1916) is among the most written about and mythologized figures in Irish history, yet has never, until now, been accorded such an impartial, full-scale documentary biography. Seamas 0 Siochain gives us an enthralling book equal to the expansive life of its subject. This definitive work, is an enduring monument to an enigmatic idealist and Irishman. 68opp 978 1 84351 021 5 40.00 hb The Poet's Chair The First Nine Years of the Ireland Chair of Poetry Paul Durcan, John Montague, Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill The Poet's Chairbrings together nine public lectures, from 1998-2007, by the first three Ireland Professors of Poetry and includes a Foreword by Seamus Heaney.

Francisco and the Chieftain's Wife. John P. Rooney. Drumlin Publications. 182 pp 12 pb 21 cm +1-873437-36-0. An historical novel inspired by the adventures of Don Francisco Cuellar, captain of the San Pedro, one of the Armada ships wrecked off the Irish coast in 1588. It is surprising that this historical event and the narratives that it engendered have not inspired more writers and filmmakers. Local author Rooney, whose radio plays have been broadcast on RTE and the BBC and has also written for the stage, was inspired by de Cuellar's sojourn in Leitrim to write this book. He conjures a romantic tale out of the known facts and de Cuellar's comment that the wife of the MacClancy chieftain who gave him shelter was "beautiful in the extreme". It is a tale of love and adventure as the sophisticated Spaniard had to adapt to life among an old society on the edge of Europe. This is a well written and the story flows along nicely although anyone with short sight might tire of the unusually small type. - * / Great Eagle Wood. Derry Cotter. Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ireland. 207 pp 14.95 pb 21 cm +0-903854-06-1. With a cover showing a beaver in overalls and a teller rat manning the River Bank, you might think this is a children's book but, like George Orwell's Animal Farm, it is a fable or allegory for adults, with a large cast of fully anthropomorphic animals. Coming from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ireland, it is not a story about communism and its betrayal but a paean of praise to capitalism, or 'business' as they call it here. Like all good fables it is about how society should be run, and in this instance, how business should be conducted (particularly when terrorism is threatened), with a moral at the end. It portrays an animal republic where the eagles run the government, ducks are the entrepreneurs with a strong presence on the Wood Wide Web and beavers do the work. The hero is Bob the beaver who wants to join the quacking classes and run his own business. The writing has the virtue of lots of dialogue, but it still feels heavy work to maintain the background, and adults might give up quicker than younger readers who don't feel the need to interpret and discover equivalences. The full-page pencil illustrations by Kevin McSherry have a rather pleasant, old-fashioned character. We are not sure if it will plant the seed of ambition in a child to own its own business, or if it will really explain the workings of markets and capitalism to the confused adult, but the ICAI deserve a round of applause for daring to try. - * y Lighthouse. Chris Binchy. New Island. 76 pp 6.50 pb 18 cm +1-905494-81-1. Binchy has two novels to his name already, The Very Man and People Like Us. His contribution to the Open Door series (see Angel above) concerns an unhappy boy whose father only comes home for the weekends. In his despair he begins sniffing petrol and so begins a downward spiral he may never escape from. The Second Child. John Boyne. New Island. 70 pp 6.50 pb 18 cm +1-905494-82-8. Boyne is best known for his book The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas while his next novel, Mutiny on the Bounty, is due out later this year. His Open Door novella is a family drama relating what happens when a wayward daughter, Alison, arrives home to Wexford pregnant by her movie star boyfriend. She and her father clash while her mother tries to make peace but a happy ending seems unlikely. . - * / A Secret Place. Patricia Rainsford. Penguin. 381 pp 9.99 ?6.99 pb 20cm +1-844-88011-9. Rainsford is the co-author of the Sarah O'Brien novels with her friend, Helena Close, and her first solo novel, The Knack of Life, was well received when it came out last year. Wealthy solicitor Billy Hendrick is shot dead in his car and three young women are seen running away. That is suspicious enough but when it turns out that they are three escaped prisoners on the run, they are in the frame for the murder. Detective Rob O'Connell is assigned the case and he plunges himself into it because he is trying not to face up to the fact that his wife is in a coma and he has some hard decisions to make. When he and one of the girls, Gina Brennan, collide the plot really begins. Their lives become entwined as O'Connell hunts for the real killer. A well crafted novel that does not end as you might expect. Star Gazing. Kate Thompson. New Island. 80 pp 6.50 pb 18 cm +1-905494-83-5- Thompson's latest novel, Love Lies Bleeding, has been well received and she too has agreed to contribute a novella to the Open Door series. Star Gazing is not about astronomy but the modern obsession with celebrity. Daisy lives in a sleepy Irish village where nothing happens. Things begin to look up when she wins a competition to be an extra in a TV soap, but will it be all that she dreamed? . -* * Three's a crowd. Sheila O'Flanagan. New Island. 72 pp 6.50 pb 18 cm +1-905494-85-9. Sheila O'Flanagan needs no introduction for Irish readers. She has already written over a dozen popular novels. This novella is a tale of Jennifer who has planned the perfect wedding to the perfect man. All is going well until her future mother-in-law shows up. Cue hostility, disapproval and a fight for acceptance, but we a re sure there is a happy ending. &lt; - * / Under My Skin. Alison Jameson. Penguin. 315 pp 9.99 ?6.50 pb 20cm +1-844-88098-0. Jameson became a full time novelist with the publication of her first novel, This Man and Me, in 2005. Her second book is also a love story in which Hope goes off in search of her true love, ex-boyfriend Larry who has disappeared in New York. Things are not quite as they seem and she gets drawn into the world of Arthur and Matilda who have secrets of their own. There are many twists, turns and surprises before the plot reaches the end. This is not an entirely serious novel; there is a good deal of wit and humour in it. -I - * The Wormdigger's Daughter. John Farrell. Mercier Press. 252 pp 10.99 pb 19 cm +1-85635-574-2. Farrell is originally from Navan, County Meath. He was the youngest of four children in a farming family. He did not go into farming himself but went to London where he studied civil engineering and then worked in the construction industry for many years before returning to live in Ireland with his family. The novel is based on a true story told to him when he was young by a travelling couple in their tent by the roadside. It is the story of a labouring couple in 1920s Ireland who are forced to flee from the Protestant owned estate where they work with their only surviving child. Accused of theft, they have to go on the run and disguise the girl, Angel, as a boy as a way of fooling the authorities. All this is strange enough but gets stranger when they find help from a mysterious brotherhood of small farmers who oppose the big estates. With the help of the Brotherhood, the family are offered the chance of The Quest HH9H for Modern Ireland ^^^^B The Battle of Ideas 1912-1986 ^^^H Bryan Fanning ^H^^^H 288 pages 2008 bB^^^H 978 0 2902 6 HIH^H cloth / ^^^^^1 978 0 7165 2903 3 HB^^H paper 26.95 / $32.95 IRA Internments and QH^H the Irish Government MHHH Subversives and the State, HHH| John Maguire Foreword by Ruan O'Donnell ^^^^^H pages ^^^^^H 978 0 7165 2943 9 II^^HI cloth 65.00 / $79.95 978 0 7165 2944 6 paper 24.95 / $34.95 Thomas Kinsella Bjsgs* Designing for the Exact Needs ^^R Maurice Harmon ^^Mfc"^. 272 pages 2008 W^Kl^ 978 0 7165 2951 4 ^^ j^ cloth / I^^^^B 0 7165 1 HHHfl paper 24.95 / $32.95 Public Opinion, Politics H|B and Society in ^^HH Contemporary Ireland ^^^kH Lyons HIBSH 304 pages illus May 2008 HHj^HHH 978 0 7165 29415 HHBBH cloth 65.00 / $79.95 ^^TCHH 978 0 7165 2942 2 IH^^F 1 paper 26.95/$32.95 Transforming the ESWBff Peace Process in iaaB^ Northern Ireland IHUyya From Terrorism to ^^^^I^H Democratic Politics ^E^^^^l Aaron Edwards, and ^l^^^^l Stephen Bloomer (Eds) HH Foreword by Richard English 272 pages 2008 978 0 7165 2955 2 cloth 65.00 / $79.95 978 0 7165 2956 9 paper 26.95 / $32.95 Madness and Murder ] ~w^m Gender, Crime and Mental I ^^^^H Disorder in Nineteenth I 1 MMPffl Century Ireland rMiNHfl Pauline Prior ^^^^^m Foreword by ^^^^^^H Angela Bourke ^^I^BH 264 pages April 2008 ^HESIQ 978 0 7165 2937 8 cloth 65.00 / $65.00 978 0 7165 2938 5 paper 27.95 Pbk Not Available in US The Irish Factor ^^1*1^ Ireland's Strategic and 9HHn I Diplomatic Importance llfctSi^M Jerome aan de Wiel ' fQI^I Foreword by Dermot Keogh J?22?X^| 464 pages illus May 2008 L58?IX^B 978 0 7165 2863 0 cloth 60.00 / $75.00</page><page sequence="7">92 April20o8 BOOKS IRELAND going to the United States but at a terrible cost. Written mostly in the voice of Molly, Angel's mother, the story is told in a clipped, almost hurried prose, which rattles the plot along but leaves little room for character or context. Whether one takes this as a 'true' story or a work of fiction, it does not really work. As fact or fiction it is too full of holes and unlikelihoods to be taken seriously. Perhaps Farrell should have done more research before putting pen to paper. But the cover, a detail from a Danby painting, is at once inviting and mysterious. + ? * y PHILOSOPHY Ladder in Limbo. Mike Sheehan. Boglark Press (also given as (Boylark}), 2 Martin Street, Dublin 8.51 pppb2i cm +1-905483-42-6. This comes recommended by Kevin O'Higgins SJ and is a series of contemplations on life, the universe and everything. Eschewing titles, it is divided into fourteen sections subdivided into the various numbered musings. Atypical, short, example: "3.31 do not want to die! I know I will but I think I have a vague belief in some sort of afterlife. I have this vague belief because I need it, I fear oblivion. I don't want to die and never again be aware of anything". Elsewhere he accepts as a compelling proof of God's existence that our love for each other "makes no sense" if He doesn't exist. Con Houlihan calls the book "a masterpiece of pure thinking" and the author is said to be a graduate in theology or philosophy. Something has been scribbled over on the title page and an inscription to Books Ireland added "with love". / PHOTOGRAPHS Images of Cork City: shared moments. Brian Lillis. Nonsuch. 120 pp 19.99 pb 22x24 cm +1 84588-598-4. Colour photographs of Cork city, in which the photographer shows a predilection for golden townscapes (brick, sunsets, floodlighting and autumn leaves all help) as well as reflections in still water. It is well produced and a bargain at 19.99. Lillis is not a native of the city but has lived and worked there for over fifteen years, a period in which he has seen many changes. Sometimes it takes the outsider to see the true beauty of a place and Lillis presents many fine streetscapes and buildings alongside shots of people at work and play. He has an occasional eye for the unusual or the telling detail and there is some humour in a series of shop-fronts. Obviously a memento for tourist or expatriate. The text makes no demands: there is hardly any. -* * / POETRY For All We Know. Ciaran Carson. Gallery Press. 113 PP 13.95 pb2icm +1-85235-439-8. Carson needs no introduction to anyone interested in poetry in Ireland. He has ten collections to his name already and has written a number of works in prose as well. He is currently professor of poetry in the Seamus Heaney Centre, Queen's University, Belfast. This is an unusual collection in that the poems are connected and tell a story. A man and a woman meet in a second-hand clothes shop in Belfast in the 1970s just as a bomb goes off. The poems then follow their relationship. The story is told in sonnets, with fourteen syllables per line, and these are in two parts with the titles of the first repeated in the second. As well as being an intensely personal story, this also references historical events, film noir and cold war novels in a poetic tale that takes in Paris, Dresden and Berlin as well as Belfast. A Poetry Book Society choice. +* / ** / Line to Leitrim. Patrick H. Sheerin. Drumlin Publications. 47 pp 10 pb 21 cm +1-873437-32-2. Leitrim based Drumlin Publications is publishing local authors but its vision is by no means parochial. Sheerin is a native of the county who spent his formative adult years in London in the 1950s where he obtained a degree from London University after attending night school classes there. In the last years of Franco's life he moved to Spain where he settled down and married. He obtained a PhD from the University of Valladolid where he remains to this day teaching English language and Irish literature. Such a varied life ought to produce varied and interesting poems and indeed it does. The poems, like Frogs and The Back-of-the-Hill People, would appear to be inspired by Sheerin's growing up in Leitrim. They read almost as an autobiographical narrative taking the poet up to his leaving his native county, and leading us to expect a further volume reflecting his later life. ^ -* Perplexed Skin. Patrick Cotter. Arlen House. 96 pp 20 hb2icm +1-903631-54-6. Cotter was born in 1963 in Cork where he is the director of the Munster Literature Centre. This is his first collection although he has had his poems published in journals and anthologies as well as translating various German poets and even the work of Esthonian poet, Andres Ehin. That Ehin is a surrealist is perhaps a clue to Cotter's own poetry which is quirky, strange and thought-provoking. In one poem he gives a bookworm a Soviet political commentary and Condoleezza Rice's memoir to eat. In another, he rearranges a woman's face on his laptop. There are odd ideas and disturbing imagery that are both serious and humorous. This is the kind of poems that restore your faith in well crafted, serious, original poetry. + &lt; &gt; * To Catch at Reality: on lives and geographies. Patrick J. O'Connor. Oireachtas na Mumhan Books. 80 pp 11.95 pb 21 cm (An impossible 12-digit figure is given for ISBN. Arithmetical detective work suggests that it was meant to be +0-9533896-7-4)- This is an unusual book that combines maps with poetry. O'Connor is a human geographer at the University of Limerick and has won awards for his work. The poetry is inspired by the work of Sean O'Faolain, Elizabeth Bishop, John McGahern, Czeslaw Milosz and Tomas 6 Criomhthain and is a humanist exploration of the big questions in life. Most poems are accompanied by a map showing their rootedness. This is not to say that every poem is about a place as some are concerned with the themes of home, transformation, memory and so on. An intriguing take on a traditional motif in Irish writing. -? * * / POLITICS Advisors or Advocates? the impact of state agencies on social policy. Orlaigh Quinn. Institute of Public Administration. 170 pp 25 pb 23 cm +1 904541-67-7 Examines the process of 'agencification' in the Republic, the process whereby agencies are appointed by the state to take charge of specific areas of policy. This is a process that has been taking place throughout the developed world and has raised serious questions everywhere. Quinn examines the character and role of such agencies, particularly in relation to social inclusion. She examines how they are made up, where they fit in the overall scheme of things, and what influence, if any, they have over policy. She concludes, among other things, that the agencies have little impact on social policy, that there is much overlap and duplication of responsibilities, and that ultimately it is the decision-making within the government departments that really matters. So are agencies like the Equality Authority, the National Disability Authority or Social Inclusion Consultative Group just a waste of money?

Northern Ireland Publications Resource is newly established in Belfast's Linenhall Library to promote and record publishing in the North.

Now, financed by Bairds the Antrim printers and by the Awards for All scheme, it has commissioned this excellent short guide to the book publishing business. Anne Tannahill was managing director of the Blackstaff Press from 1980 to 2003 during which time it won international recognition for the quality of its work. She writes sensibly and clearly and knows her stuff inside out. Wendy Dunbar as in-house and later freelance designer of Blackstaff's books is brilliant and has made this little guide a joy to leaf through. Whether NIPR were wise to give it away free, we doubt - there is much to be said for the principle that people only value what they have paid for. Those with any interest in the publishing process should ask for a copy and will find it very reliable and useful. There are two curious omissions: Tannahill has not adverted to the fact that most authors now can and do provide copy in digital form and (with a little help) in a state which allows editing and copy-preparation to be done on screen, thus relieving the publisher of the cost of 'keyboarding'. The other omission: we were sad not to have been listed in the directory of useful publishing resources. B, I / ** RELIGION A Glass of Homemade Lemonade. Patrick Coghlan.

Red Hen Publishing. 189 pp 12 ?15 pb 20cm +0 955290-2-6. Paddy Pender was a computer consultant until her eyesight began to deteriorate and she was forced to reconsider her whole life. That thinking led in her a completely different direction and as well as running a health food store she is an Anam Chara (soul friend) working with Anamcharadas. In this capacity she is a companion to the seriously ill and dying. This book is based on her experiences both of losing her sight and of comforting those who are ill or dying. It is not light reading but neither is it a depressing book as it celebrates the human capacity to cope with the worst of circumstances. + * * When a Child Dies: footsteps of a grieving family. Jim O'Shea. Veritas. 141 pppb21 cm +1 84730-078-2. There are few tragedies worse than for a family to lose a child. It is of course devastating for the parents but can be just as devastating for other members of the family. Coming to terms with this loss is one of the hardest things and this book bravely takes us into the life of the O'Shea family after the death of fourteen-year-old Cat ha I. It takes us from the beginning of Cathal's life to his death and then the different stages that the family went through in the years that followed as they tried to cope with their grief and loss. It holds nothing back in explaining the emotions from sorrow and grief to anger and acceptance as Jim takes us along the journey with his family. This is not an easy read but it may help others understand and cope with a similar experience. / * SHORT STORIES The Stepping Match and other stories from rural Kerry. Martin Mulvihill. Red Hen Publishing. 223 pp 15 ?20 pb 23 cm +0-9552920-4-0. The story behind this book is interesting in itself as Martin Mulvihill was given a computer by his daughter and told to write down the stories of his childhood. For anyone unused to writing that would be a daunting task but Martin did not even know how to use a computer, so he had to start from scratch in learning how to type and so on before he could even get working on the stories. However he persevered and the result is this collection of stories, mostly based on real events, set in the fictional Kerry village of Balllymachad. The stories are set at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries and are all concerned with the trials and tribulations of rural folk in a poorer Ireland. The stories are quite short, simply written and contain a lot of lore and local history. TOWN PLANNING Dublin Docklands Reinvented: the post industrial regeneration of a European city quarter. Niamh Moore. Four Courts Press. 320 pp 24.95 pb23 cm +1-85182-835-7. The development of the Dublin Docklands over the last twenty years is one of the miracles of the Celtic tiger and a pioneering achievement for Dublin City Council. Largely hailed as a success, the transformation has saved an historic and significant part of the city from dereliction and decay. Moore lectures at the School of Geography, Planning and Environmental Policy, UCD, and gives an upbeat assessment of what has happened in the docklands in recent decades. She shows that it is not unique, but has been influenced by similar large scale urban regeneration projects in New York, London, Sydney and elsewhere. She examines how the process of change came about and how it worked out in practice. She does consider the objections to the proposals, problems along the way and controversies such as that over Spencer Dock. An interesting study of this significant urban revolution in a nicely produced book with plenty of attractive black-and-white photographs and plans. I / * y WEDDINGS The Irish Bride's Survival Guide: plan your perfect wedding. Natasha Mac a'Bhaird. O'Brien. 303 pp 14 99 ?10.99 pb 22 cm +184717-094-1. With a cover like a light-hearted chick-lit novel you might be forgiven for thinking that this is just that, but it is in fact a serious guide to planning a wedding. Based on Mac a'Bhaird's own experiences and information gleaned from other brides, the book looks at all aspects of planning the perfect day once you've found the perfect man. It has everything, such as when to have the wedding, how to budget, the legal and religious requirements, how to look good on the big day, invitations and so on. An added chapter by Aidan Fitzmaurice promises to spill the beans on men and weddings. This book was first published in 2005 when Mac a'Bhaird had her own wedding to Fitzmaurice and has been updated following recent changes in the law about civil marriages and their locations. Of course there's some rubbish too - we're told to book a photographer a year ahead, but leave a videographer till three months later. | - * YOUNG READERS Mad Grandad's Robot Garden.
