<plain_text><page sequence="1">The purpose of this section is to make the literature devel- oped by the Society more useful to the engineering com- munity. This is done in three ways. A SUBJECT INDEX containing all the literature produced during the year. Each individual paper or piece of literature is listed several times under the subject headings that are appropriate to its technical content. The TITLE of each paper has been edited when necessary (for this listing only) so that it more fully reflects the scope of the paper. An AUTHOR INDEX follows the subject index. In both the SUBJECT and AUTHOR index, the same six digit code number used for the abstract is given, so the full abstract can be found and read.

Most papers are published separately in booklet form. How- ever, from time to time groups of papers on the same subject are grouped together in one "Special Publication." Papers presented before each Conference of the Society are published together in a "Proceedings." The following list cross-refer- ences the six-digit code number with the Proceedings volume number (P) or the Special Publication number (SP). For your information, a list of the titles of the Special Pub- lications and Conference Proceedings follows at the end of the cross-references. 690001 - SP- 344 690533 - SP-348 690779 - SP-350 690788 - SP-35 1 690796 - P-28 690807 - P-28 690535 - SP-348 690780- SP-350 690789- SP-35 1 690797- P-28 690808- P-28 690002 - SP- 345 690536 - SP-348 69078 1 - SP-350 690790 - SP-35 1 690798 - P-28 690809 - P-28 690537 - SP-348 690782 - SP-350 690791 - SP-351 690799- P-28 690810- P-28 690347 - SP- 347 690783 - SP-350 690792 - SP-35 1 690800 - P-28 6908 1 1 - P-28 690348 - SP- 347 690784 - SP-350 690793 - SP-35 1 690801 - P-28 6908 12 - P-28 690349 - SP-347 690785 - SP-350 690794 - SP-35 1 690802 - P-28 6908 1 3 - P-28 690542 - SP-349 690803 - P-28 6908 14 - P-28 690543 - SP-349 690804 - P-28 6908 1 5 - P-28 690531 - SP-348 690544 - SP-349 690786- SP-351 690805- P-28 690816- P-28 690532 - SP-348 690545 - SP-349 690787 - SP-35 1 690795 - P-28 690806 - P-28 6908 1 7 - P-28 SP- 344 - Design and Application of Commercial Type Tires SP- 345 - Looking in on Diesel Combustion SP-347 - Engineering Know-How in Engine Design- Part 17 SP-348- Fluidics SP-349 - Guidelines for Engine Maintenance - Analysis, Repairs, Overhauls, Rebuilding SP-350 - Facilities for Engine Testing of Fuels and Lubri- cants SP-351 - Vehicle Engine Driven Accessory Power Systems P-28 - Thirteenth Stapp Car Crash Conference Proceedings 277</page></plain_text>
