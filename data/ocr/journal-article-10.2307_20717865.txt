<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sensing the Overhuman Jill Marsden In his intriguing reflections on why he writes "such good books," Nietzsche claims that one can "hear" (heraush?ren) in things no more than what one already "knows": "What one has no access to through experience, one has no ears for" (EH "Books" 1). In this context, he invites his readers to consider the exceptional case in which a book speaks of nothing but encounters which lie outside the possibility of common or even of rare experience, claiming that this is "the first language for a new range of experiences": "In this case simply noth ing will be heard, with the acoustic allusion that where nothing is heard there is nothing_This is, in the end, my average experience, and, if you like, the orig inality of my experience." Nietzsche goes on to assert that failing to "hear" what is at stake in his work can manifest itself in two ways: either nothing is under stood and his ideas simply go unregistered or they are commuted to existing models that are wholly inappropriate. By way of illustration of the latter, Nietzsche adds that the word "overhuman" has frequently been interpreted as an "idealistic" type of a higher kind of human being: the word "overhuman" as the designation of a type of the highest achievement, in contrast to the "modern" human being, the "good" human being, to Christians and other nihilists?a word that in the mouth of Zarathustra, the denier of moral ity, becomes a very thought-provoking word?has been understood almost every where with complete innocence in the sense of those values whose antithesis is realized in the figure of Zarathustra, that is to say as an "idealistic" type of a higher kind of human being, half "saint," half "genius." Warming to his theme, Nietzsche repudiates the "scholarly oxen" who have understood the overhuman in terms of Darwinism and "hero worship." Their error in interpreting this "thought-provoking" word is not simply their tendency to read in standard ways but an inability to "hear"?a deafness to frequencies outside the normal range. Before aligning ourselves with Nietzsche and condemning the ineptitude of his readers, we must ask what it would mean to identify with the ideas to which he alludes. If his experience is as original as he suggests, we ought not to expect to "hear" what is at stake in his thought. Nietzsche is at pains to insist in Ecce Homo that Thus Spoke Zarathustra is an exemplary work and that it is a "priv ilege without equal to be a listener here" (EHF 4). Moreover, if having an "ear" for such a work is dependent upon experience, it is not clear how the thought of Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Issue 30, 2005 Copyright ?2005 The Friedrich Nietzsche Society. 102</page><page sequence="2">Sensing the Overhuman 103 the "overhuman" is to be reached. By simple definition, it seems that the over human (?ber-Mensch) is not something that is available as an item of human (menschlich) experience. Indeed, the condition for the emergence of the over human seems to be the collapse of any "type" of human being however "ele vated" or "noble." This said, if to experience the overhuman we have to "overcome" the human, this is not something that is attainable, indeed know able so long as we remain "what we are." Here, then, is our problem. How could anyone?Nietzsche included?experience that which is beyond experience? In asking how it would be possible to experience the overhuman, we are obliged to question and to perhaps relinquish our habits of thought. On the face of things, it seems that we can only speculate about the overhuman from within the con straints of human knowing, attempting to understand it according to our "own image" (?r7"Books" 1 ). However, despite suggesting the occasional "role model" for the overhuman, Nietzsche offers very little by way of positive determination of the idea.1 Furthermore, he is at pains to emphasize in the Foreword to Ecce Homo that Thus Spoke Zarathustra is a book characterized by the "air of the heights" and that the "whole fact of the human lies at a tremendous distance beneath it" (EH 4). The most pressing question is what can be heard at this extra-human altitude. One has to "hear correctly the tone that comes from this mouth" lest one hear only notes of familiar kinds of teaching. This is an impor tant caveat since it is all too tempting to interpret Zarathustra's explicit account of the overhuman in the Prologue as the dogma of a new religion, without address ing a number of methodological questions concerning the narrative structure of the work (for example, the status of the first "discourse," the "failure" of the teach ing, the evolution of the concept throughout the text). Given the parodie dimen sion to the work, it may well be that the "tone" of the text is at odds with its letter.2 Nevertheless, even taking these factors into consideration, it is not obvious how one might encounter the thought without assimilating it to existing templates, nor how we might "experience" it as anything more than an abstract idea. If we do not already "know" the overhuman, it seems that we cannot hope to access it, notwithstanding the strange allure that the idea has once the prospect of "hear ing" it has been called into question. Perhaps all we can do is to abide with the experience of this failure and in so doing set the silence echoing. In what follows, I shall aim to develop the conditions for "sensing" the overhuman. Since Zarathustra's pronouncements on the overhuman have to take account of the spe cific context of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, my intention will be to "access" the con cept from a less familiar route. The current discussion will focus on Nietzsche's allusions to the overhuman in Ecce Homo, the desire being to "hear" the "tempo" of its signs and gestures when revisited in this late work (EH "Books" 4). Not only does Ecce Homo contain a series of compelling discussions on the whole issue of interpreting Thus Spoke Zarathustra, but it repositions Nietzsche's achievements within the "self-reflective" frame of "how one becomes what one</page><page sequence="3">104 Jill Marsden is." Moreover, in Ecce Homo, Nietzsche quotes selectively from his own work, potentially enabling the reader to situate the overhuman within his broader philo sophical concerns. Nevertheless, if one has to "experience" the overhuman, it will not be enough simply to register what Nietzsche says. Beginning with a discus sion of how to take up a "vantage point" on the overhuman, we move to a con sideration of the ways in which we might "unlearn" what it is to be a human subject. Making the "aesthetic experience" of thought the chief focal point for our deliberations, we go on to examine how the overhuman might be both "felt" and "realized" when thought in conjunction with the task of "self-overcoming." Allusions to the ?bermensch and the ?bermenschlich in Ecce Homo are fre quently prefaced by reflections on ways of thinking and perceiving for which there is no precedent. As already noted, the segment of Ecce Homo that leads into Nietzsche's discussion of how the overhuman has been interpreted makes extravagant claims for the originality of Nietzsche's experience. In fact, it is typ ical of Nietzsche's discussion of Thus Spoke Zarathustra that its supreme nov elty should be emphasized: "There is no moment in this revelation of truth which would have been anticipated or guessed at by one of the greatest. There is no wisdom, no investigation of the soul, no art of speech before Zarathustra" (EH 6). Nietzsche's insistence that Zarathustra has accessed a realm previously unimagined does not so much prime expectation for the elaboration of the new as it alerts the reader to a break with the familiar. However, since there has to be a determinate context for any inquiry, it seems that some connection to the "same" is essential. After all, logically speaking, any exploration of the overhu man as a concept must take its compass bearing from the human since the "human" is the entity to be "overcome." While for Nietzsche we do not know ourselves as a "fixed standard" and thus are unable to assess the relation between ourselves and anything else (HH 32), the term "human" functions genealogi cally rather than ontologically in his philosophy. Thought adjectivally, the "human" is the primary index of "slave morality." Indeed, his diagnosis of the cultivation of self-cruelty and the extirpation of the passions seems essential to an appreciation of the problem to which the ?bermensch might be a solution. This is already signaled in the Prologue to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, in which the prospect of the overhuman is contrasted with the despicable ease of the "last man." However, this very contrast seems to typify the problem that we have already acknowledged. Put simply, to think about the overhuman from the per spective of the human is to employ the very kind of evaluative thinking that reduces otherness to familiar and predictable patterns. If the overhuman only "makes sense" as an idea in contradistinction to the human, is it not itself a prod uct of "slave morality"? The very attempt to create beyond the human seems to express a fundamentally human desire for self-transcendence. Is the notion of the overhuman little more than the thought of the human once again?</page><page sequence="4">Sensing the Overhuman 105 Interestingly enough, Nietzsche seems to imply as much in Ecce Homo in his discussion of Zarathustra's conception of the overhuman. As we have already observed, if the "whole fact of the human" remains at an infinite distance beneath the heights that Thus Spoke Zarathustra attains, it would be misguided to human ize the ?bermensch. However, in the final chapter of Ecce Homo, "Why I am a Destiny," Nietzsche discusses the overhuman in relation to the elevation of the "decadent type of human" at the expense of its "countertype"?the type that is "strong and sure of life." Here it is suggested that from the perspective of the good?the slavish perspective of the "human animal"?the exceptional type of human being must have been devalued into "evil." We are told that it was Zarathustra's insight into this notion of the "good" that made him feel horror at the human being in general. In this connection, Nietzsche writes: "he does not conceal that his type of human, a relatively overhuman type [ein relativ ?bermen schlicher Typus], is such precisely in relation to the good, that the good and just would call his overhuman devil" (EH "Destiny" 5). It will not escape attention that in this passage the overhuman is characterized in terms of the human, in par ticular Zarathustra's "type of human." We are further informed that the "species of human being" [diese Art Mensch] that Zarathustra envisages, sees reality "as it is"?he is not estranged from reality or transported by it [entr?ckt]. Such remarks appear to situate the overhuman firmly within "our" reality. Moreover, the pecu liar locution "relatively overhuman" seems to betray Zarathustra's subscription to antithetical thinking. However, since it is not obvious that the ?bermenschlich is a species of Mensch, we ought not assume that the type of being alluded to here is the ?bermensch. In fact this passage prompts the reader to mark a distinction between the ?bermensch and the "relatively overhuman type." Directly after making his remark about the "relatively overhuman," Nietzsche goes on to cite from the "On Human Prudence" chapter of Thus Spoke Zarathustra: You highest men that my eyes have met, this is my doubt about you and my secret [heimliches] laughter: I guess that you would call my overhuman?a devil! What is great is so unfamiliar to your souls that the overhuman would be fright ful [furchtbar] to you in his goodness. (EH "Destiny" 5) Zarathustra appears to be making the point that the "highest" human beings that he has encountered are still unable to recognize an alternative economy of "goodness." While the most distinguished human beings may be superior in some way to the "herd," it seems that they still share a common morality. Indeed, the morally "good" see opposition rather than difference. From this perspective, the overhuman is defined in terms of non-being?the negation of the good. This value economy rests on the orthodoxy that opposed pairs of "contraries" are pregiven and have a kind of logical equality. Such a dialectic presupposes an identity between human and overhuman insofar as the relation of negation is assumed by a common concept whether posited or opposed. Of course, if the "exceptional type" were to position</page><page sequence="5">106 Jill Marsden itself m relation to the morally "good," it would repeat the gesture of determinate negation, making it identical to its antithesis at the level of value economy. While it is not obvious from Zarathustra's remarks that such positioning is reciprocal, the reader is prompted to ask whether Zarathustra's "type" is an inherently slavish one. We shall return to Zarathustra's "type" of human in due course. For the time being, suffice it to say that if it is ultimately unhelpful to think about the ?ber mensch in terms of "opposition," whether to orthodox models of thought or in dialectical terms, this is because it imposes a resemblance through contrast. Perhaps we might go so far as to say that so long as the exceptional type is under stood in terms of being, it can only be "relatively overhuman." What is missed here is a thought of difference that is not already determined by identity. Yet how is it possible to mark out a space for the ?bermenschlich without constantly reflecting back on the human? As Nietzsche demonstrates so elegantly in On the Genealogy of Morals, reac tive values triumph by presenting their perspective as the only valid vantage point from which to view a phenomenon. As readers of Nietzsche, we may assume that we can only think about the overhuman from "our" human perspective, indeed that no other route is available. However, it is important to remember that for Nietzsche the human is a question of value, not of ontology. Since values function most effectively when they are perceived to be necessary "truths," they are most powerful when unconscious. As Nietzsche notes in the passage quoted at the outset, we may be almost wholly innocent of the moral values that under pin our thinking and reading strategies. Indeed, we may have yet to develop a way of engaging with Nietzsche's work that is "non-moral," a way that does not adhere to conventionally accepted codes of "truth" and "identity." In this respect, any advantage that we may have in interpreting the overhuman over Nietzsche's contemporaries are outweighed by our familiarity with the critical reception of his work. Mindful of Nietzsche's critique of the "good" human being, we may assume all too readily that the overhuman is to be equated with the "noble," with "master morality," with the "Dionysian," without pausing to question what it means to represent certain motifs in Nietzsche's thinking as desirable ends?as ideals. It becomes increasingly difficult to sense?to "hear"?something in the text that is not already overdetermined by critical consensus. Overcoming the human will almost certainly involve taking one's distance from these habits of thought. The challenge then is to discern the "vital signs" that will catalyse alter native evaluations and generate different ways of making sense. We have been asking how we should "approach" the overhuman. But given Nietzsche's emphasis on the experience of thought, perhaps we would do well to ask how we could be approached by it. To be affected by the ?bermenschlich? to experience it?is not to take up an intellectual position. Somehow we are required to develop sensitivity to different cues, to push the exercise of thinking beyond its usual range. Formulated thus, the project sounds like a daunting one.</page><page sequence="6">Sensing the Overhuman 107 However, if we turn to Ecce Homo in search of guidance, we soon notice how little weight is given to the role of "endeavour" in Nietzsche's philosophy. In his account of the experiences of "great health," "inspiration," and "becoming what one is"?to name just three meditations on what his thinking entails?Nietzsche appears to advocate a kind of passivity: "hearing without seeking" (EH 3), reacting slowly to every stimulus (?7/"Wise" 2), eschewing all notions of strug gle (EH "Clever" 9). In each case, "self-forgetfulness" and dispossession are emphasized. In place of prescription, the impetus seems to be to "subtract" from one's experience. This is not without consequence for our current inquiry since for Nietzsche the value economy of the "human" is best characterized in terms of the preservation of identity. The human animal needs to believe in a neutral, independent subject in order to "know" itself (GM 1.13). The substance of Nietzsche's often-cited criticism of philosophical knowing is that it is predicated upon a desire for sameness: to "know" is to recognize that which one has already named. The acquisition of knowledge thus entails learning what to ignore, a process of filtering out differences between things and equating that which is dissimilar. However, if the overhuman eludes predication, it escapes the snares of self-reflective thought and resists assimilation in terms with which conscious ness is already familiar. The first thing to jettison, then, is the assumption that the overhuman is to be approached conceptually. Indeed, strictly speaking, as the site of a non-conceptual alterity, the overhuman must evade "recognition." This also means that the ?bermenschlich cannot be quantified or represented. In this respect, it seems significant that Nietzsche should characterize Zarathustra's encounter with the overhuman in terms that defy conceptualiza tion. In Ecce Homo, Nietzsche quotes a fragment from Book Two of Thus Spoke Zarathustra in which Zarathustra speaks of his will to create. Nietzsche contex tualizes his own quotation by remarking that for Zarathustra the human is form lessness?an ugly stone that requires the sculptor. He goes on to cite Zarathustra's desire to liberate the image that he sees "sleeping in stone"?a task that he vows to complete because a "shadow" came to him: a shadow came to me,?the most silent, the lightest of all things came to me once! The beauty of the overhuman came to me as a shadow: what are the gods to me now! (EHZS) The implication is that Zarathustra is inspired in his will to beget by the promise of the overhuman. However, if Zarathustra is able to envisage a new future for the human, it is not that of the overhuman. The overhuman emerges as intrinsically opaque, a shadow, not a spectacle. We are thereby compelled to think of beauty in a most counterintuitive way: not as an object of vision but as its absence. More peculiar still, the beauty of the overhuman is characterized in terms of its lack of sound and density. The question, then, is how one "senses" that which eludes deter mination. One might fall prey to the "acoustical illusion" that where nothing is</page><page sequence="7">108 Jill Marsden heard there is nothing. The presupposition of rationalist thought is that something that makes no difference at the level of the concept makes no difference at all. However, it may be that what makes a difference outside of all representation can only be "experienced." Perhaps, like the psychoanalyst, one needs to hear quali ties of silence. Indeed, as Nietzsche reminds us in the Foreword to Ecce Homo, it is the "most silent words that bring on the storm" (EH? 4). Furthermore, it is strik ing that Nietzsche should claim to "hear" a "horrific silence" around himself when relating his experience of solitude (EH 5). The experience of sensation is thus something more than perception per se. Hearing is not simply the reception of sound but also a listening to what sounds conceal?the inaudible affects. Rather than focusing on what we "understand" when we read Nietzsche's tan talizing prose, greater attention might be given to what it feels like to be captivated by his thought. Arguably, it is this sense for his thought that assumes prominence once the desire to clarify and circumscribe is held in abeyance. It is not without consequence that, in his remarks on the art of style in Ecce Homo, Nietzsche should draw attention to the material elements of signification?the rhythm, the phrasing, the embodied expression?rather than the content of signs as such. "Every style is good which actually communicates an inner state, which makes no mistake as to the signs, the tempo of the signs, the gestures?all laws of phrasing are art of ges ture" (EH "Books" 4). As we are told further in this passage, the meaning of every style is to communicate an inner tension of pathos through signs. This tension may be thought of as a rhythmic pulsation?an affective dynamic that ripples through the linguistic signs. As is well known, the chief target of Nietzsche's critique of Platonism is the belief that things retain an identity across space and time, an iden tity represented by the concept that marks the possibility of repeatable experiences. According to this model, concepts and propositions are self-identical units that enter into combinations regulated by established rules. They are taken to designate an external state of things and the adequation of this representation is judged accord ing to a transcendent horizon of truth. However, the ?bermenschlich operates out side this architecture of thought. The inner tension of pathos that is the condition for any such expression is singular and non-repeatable, a non-linguistic remainder at the heart of the sign. While at the level of the concept the materiality of the words are dissolved by the messages they represent, the sign as such is only the form of a possible actualization of affect. The communication of the "inner state" is the real actualization and it is precisely this experience that is always original and without precedent. It is only at the level of representation that it ceases to be remarked. A few lines further on in his discussion on the art of style, Nietzsche again alludes to the task of communicating that which lacks precedent: "Before me, it was not known what could be achieved in German?what could be done with language in general.?The art of grand rhythm, of grand style of phrasing to express a tremendous rise and fall of sublime, of overhuman [?bermenschlicher] passion was first discovered by me."</page><page sequence="8">Sensing the Overhuman 109 We have highlighted the need to hear the "tone" of Nietzsche's writing rather than the words as such. The suggestion here is that it is at the level of pace and rhythm that something "overhuman" is communicated. Particularly significant is the intimation that, through the differential interplay of musical phrasing, the oscillations of sublime, overhuman "passions" are conveyed. As is well known, the sublime is a feeling that is aroused in a spectator when confronted by something that the intellect is unable to conceptualize. In Nietzsche's phi losophy more generally, this idea is explored in terms of the "Dionysian," although in this respect Nietzsche owes a considerable debt to Kant.3 In its canonical formulation in Kant's philosophy, the sublime concerns experiences of that which is in excess of representation (the infinitely great and the over whelmingly mighty). The imagination is humbled in its inability to compre hend nature's might and magnitude, yet this failure discloses the absolute superiority of Reason over the merely empirically based faculties. In effect, the sublime imposes the realization of the limitations of sensibility, since in order to recognize this limit we must also feel what is not limited in ourselves, namely, our capacity for Reason. Yet more significant than this dialectical argu ment is Kant's suggestion that in being forced to confront that which it is unable to recognize or render harmonious, the transcendental subject gains pleasure from an originary experience of inundation. Read in these terms, the sublime does not so much vindicate the rational value economy of the human subject as mark the site of its collapse. Again, we might say that the overhuman is to be sensed in Nietzsche's thinking at the very point where cognition fails. If good style entails the communication of an inner tension of pathos through signs, it is imperative that there are those "capable and worthy of a similar pathos" who are able to hear what is at stake ("Always presupposing that there are ears" [EH "Books" 4]). However, since what is created and squandered in the text of Thus Spoke Zarathustra is "new" and "unheard of," Nietzsche sug gests that such "listeners" will be lacking. With these remarks we are reminded once again of Nietzsche's insistence on the originality of his experience and hence the question of how the overhuman is to be encountered if it belongs to a range of experiences of an unprecedented kind. It is to be noted that the ref erences to the overhuman in Ecce Homo that we have just considered bear on aesthetic experience, that of beauty and sublimity in particular. Aesthetic expe rience is always a singular and unique encounter, the basis of a reflective rather than a subsumptive judgment, to employ Kantian terminology once again. For Kant, the fundamental condition of a pure aesthetic judgment?whether of beauty or sublimity?is that it be "disinterested." For example, delight in beauty is said to claim its "subject" with a sense of utter necessity. Yet at the same time it bears no relation to the desires of the "self as an intentional agent. To say that such a judgment is "free" from personal "interest" means that I can not choose whether to have a liking for beauty. Instead, it chooses me: indeed,</page><page sequence="9">110 Jill Marsden it compels me. Such judgment is of me (is physiologically grounded in sensa tions of pleasure and pain) without being obviously peculiar to me ("inter ested"). Kant's proposal is that the potential universal communicability of the judgment (and hence its intersubjective validity) rests upon this essential anonymity. The judgment excludes me at the moment that I think it. With these reflections on aesthetic experience, we come to the heart of our concerns regarding the ?bermenschlich. Kant arrives at the position that an aes thetic judgment is disinterested if it can be established that it is not informed by conceptual determination, or moral feeling, or simple empirical "liking." Rather than offering an account of the determinate features of a pure aesthetic judg ment, Kant gives weight to that which is indeterminate?the insistent inexpli cable intensity that remains when all other kinds of relevant judgment are subtracted and discounted. In other words, experiences in which mere sensation is humbled and something unprecedented is encountered make palpable an excess. Something is liberated in these experiences that is in excess of experi ence and it is this excess that is "sensed." To put it another way, we are alerted to something within ourselves that is other than ourselves. It is in the experience of beauty and sublimity that one senses one's bodily vitality in the keenest terms. And yet it is also precisely in these experiences that one feels most dispossessed. "I" experience the world at the same time as it overcomes "me." We suggested earlier that so long as the overhuman is understood in terms of being it remains at best a "relatively overhuman" concept?one in which an unprecedented alterity is commuted to the form of identity. To cultivate an account of the overhuman in absence of positive terms might seem to consign the thought to a determinate negativity (which for Nietzsche would be "God" once again). However, with the Kantian model of aesthetic experience in place, we draw closer to developing conditions for sensing the overhuman that are both indeterminate and real. In aesthetic experience, we lose the criterion by which we are able to identify an experience as "mine," yet we also feel a thrill that is intensely corpo real. This is an experience so beguiling that we are tempted to speak of "posses sion" or captivation by overwhelming force. We might go so far as to say that in these sovereign moments we experience the overhuman, or at the very least an overcoming of the values that constitute the self. The problem is that, if we think of this experience as a temporary escape from the "human condition," we con tinue to privilege the human as the site from which the overhuman might be encountered. Perhaps, then, the accent should be placed not on the loss (and ulti mate retrieval) of the human, but on the more searching question of how to rethink self-identity from this experience of a non-personal physiology. Abiding with this notion of aesthetic experience, let us turn to consider Nietzsche's two remaining allusions to the overhuman in Ecce Homo, both of which address the issue of overcoming the human. The first of these takes the form of an extensive quotation from The Gay Science in which Nietzsche speaks</page><page sequence="10">Sensing the Overhuman 111 of the "physiological presupposition" of Zarathustra as a "type," something that he calls "great health" (EH 2). In the context of this quotation, Nietzsche speaks of one whose soul thirsts to experience the whole range of values and desiderata to date, who "longs to know from his own most personal experience" how a dis coverer and conqueror of such ideals feels, and also how an artist, a saint, a law giver, a sage, a scholar, a pious man, and a spiritual recluse of the old style might feel. This is a notion of health that is grounded in one's own vitality, yet which also reaches beyond it to encompass a plethora of different affections. Nietzsche goes on to embellish this notion of great health in terms of an "ideal of a human overhuman [menschlich-?bermenschlich] well-being and benevolence" that will often appear "inhuman" when set beside all earthly seriousness hitherto. This ideal is designated the "most corporeal, involuntary parody" of every kind of solemnity in gesture, word, tone, glance, morality, and task. Unlike the "idealis tic" model of the overhuman of which Nietzsche is so critical, this "ideal" is incarnated rather than merely imagined. It is expressed physiologically as a health that "one does not merely have but also acquires continually and must acquire because one surrenders it again and again and must surrender it." This "great health" is clearly nothing that one could possess. In this segment of Ecce Homo, Nietzsche draws on The Gay Science to emphasize an extraordi nary sensitivity?one that calls into question what it is to "have" an experience as such. As in aesthetic experience, "great health" seems to conduct the human subject beyond its status as a "neutral" and "independent" being. Indeed, Nietzsche articulates a desire to know from one's innermost experience how a vast range of other subjects might feel. Before dismissing this idea as merely fanciful, we should note that the experience of "disinterested" aesthetic judg ment involves just such a transpersonal affectivity?something that remains incoherent conceptually but that can be sensed viscerally, indeed can only be felt when agency is overwhelmed. Once we let go of the assumption that personal experience is necessarily "interested," we are able to see that to sense is simply to encounter, to be affected by other forces. Indeed, it is only the idea of norma tive perception that inhibits our receptivity to this thought. Elsewhere Nietzsche remarks that the fluidity and variety, indeed the participation of "a multitude of persons," in all thinking is not "particularly easy to observe" since we are fun damentally schooled the opposite way round, "not to think about thinking as we think" (KSA 11: 38[1]). To actively experience this thought conducts us beyond the limits of what seems possible so long as one's sense of self remains intact. The key point to emphasize here is that this voyage through extra-human vital ity is physiological. It is not the case that one "identifies" with historical person ages such as Cesare Borgia, Napoleon, or Caesar, emulating their character traits and mimicking their ideals. To say as much is to ontologize affects?to make of them discrete, quantifiable entities. Rather, this is an experience of continuous acquisition and surrender of sensations?an "inner tension of pathos." It is now</page><page sequence="11">112 Jill Marsden no longer a question of experiences that belong to a subject, but of a subject that is formed through these experiences and only through these. These remarks may shed some light on why the ideal of which Nietzsche speaks is "human-overhuman"?a formulation that seems to blur the terms we have sought to hold apart. This ideal of well-being and benevolence is only attained through the constant overcoming of the human, the name for which is the overhuman. There is no period of transition between the two. We noted at the outset the seeming par adox that to experience the overhuman we have to be already beyond the human? which seems tantamount to saying that we can only experience what we already "know." However, we have suggested that the overhuman does not have the sta tus of a "being." It is not an identity that the human may one day achieve. To view the overhuman as an ideal that will be realized at some point in the future is to attempt to position it within the value economy of the human, which means to accept time as "given" and to conceive becoming in terms of being. It is only through the experience of overcoming that the "concept" of the overhuman is real ized. This is an experience that one can never "have" because, unlike any item of human experience, it does not form part of one's "past" once and for all. One incar nates the "human-overhuman ideal" only by surrendering it again and again. This brings us to the final allusion to the overhuman in Ecce Homo that we have to address. As we have just highlighted, for the human subject, time is invariably thought of as a dimension of its own description. In other words, time is conceptualized as a process that appears or occurs in time. Within these param eters, "self-overcoming" signals an "ecstasis" that can only be grasped tempo rally by a selfhood re-attained. However, we have proposed that the overhuman?as opposed to the "relatively overhuman type"?escapes determi nation or predication as such. It is scarcely fortuitous that in the context of dis cussing Thus Spoke Zarathustra as an unprecedented work,4 Nietzsche should allude to the overhuman in terms of the perpetual overcoming of the human: "Here the human is overcome in every moment [in jedem Augenblick], the con cept "overhuman" here becomes the greatest reality,?all that has hitherto been called great in humanity lies at an infinite distance beneath it" (EH 6). The "moment" understood as an event that occurs within time is impossible to appre ciate in terms other than the logic of identity (the reiteration of the same events dispersed in space). However, if the thought of becoming is liberated from the concept of identity, the notion of "moment" ceases to designate an item within a chronological process. This moment "is" the whole of time inasmuch as past and future are both generated anew from the moment. The reference to the overcoming of the human in every moment serves to under line the thought that it is only through the experience of eternal return that a non anthropomorphic, non-moral, non-humanist reality is encountered.5 Nietzsche's thought of eternal return inaugurates the collapse of time and the logic of iden tity. Repetition in eternal return marks the re-coming of time as a process of</page><page sequence="12">S e s nc? the Overhuman 113 differential becoming. One "becomes what one is" through the originary time of each moment. Outside of the logic of identity, human experience is nothing other than the inner tension of pathos?the full range of variegated, self-differing affects. Changing qualitatively again and again, affective states differ without being ontologically other. Like the moment, they are indivisible. "Affirmation" of the moment is the embrace of this inclusive disjunction without negation. Free of the narrative of self-possession, the overhuman is a concept that has the "great est reality" without casting itself against the human. The ?bermenschlich is not a juncture within the time of the human, it is the creation of a new time of thought. As we indicated earlier, from the perspective of the human it is difficult to "sense" the overhuman without commuting it to essentially human values, ren dering it at best a "relatively overhuman type." However, from the perspective of the overhuman there is only life's encounter with itself?something that can never "be"?or can only "be" in terms of a perpetual overcoming. We may then be inclined to rethink Zarathustra's allusion to an exceptional "species of human." It will be recalled that such a type is "reality itself" But we need no longer view this as a reference to a discrete, "this-worldly" being. Such a being "still has all that is fearful and questionable in reality in himself (EH "Destiny" 5). In other words, there is no presumption of a subject as a preliminary unity. To be reality itself?io feel oneself to be the highest species of all existing things?is the "type of achievement" attained when the desire "to be" is abandoned: "he who has the hardest, the most fearful insight into reality, who has thought the most 'abyssal thought' nonetheless finds therein no objection to existence, not even to the eter nal recurrence?rather one more reason to be himself 'the eternal Yes to all things" (EH 6). Indifferent to the empirically determined subject that accompanies it, the ?bermenschlich is life's encounter with its immanent outside. It is this "life" that is ?bermenschlich, this unique life that is "of me without being "mine." We tend to abandon thought before it collapses, eager to retrieve the familiar coordinates?and the familiar values?of our philosophical repertoire. If the wreckage of the habits of thought is something that cannot be thought, this does not necessarily mean that it cannot be experienced?sensed. To sense the ?ber menschlich is to evoke a truth in the very moment of its disappearance. Nietzsche's text communicates a sense for novel affects, for a sensibility in the process of being born. If sensing the overhuman ultimately entails re-sensing the human, this need not be the ressentiment of reactive life. It can be the cre ation of new senses and new significances. The rich terrain of extra-ordinary sensation is accessed when our habits of thought break down. One feels a power that one is unable to recognize, but in this very failure one actualizes an extra discursive seeing and hearing, an extra-human vision and audition. This is tan tamount to saying that if the ?bermenschlich must go "unheard" it leaves a trace?an excess. It is the silent pulse of intensity, the affective rhythms of becoming, that belong to a new vocabulary of experience.</page><page sequence="13">114 Jill Marsden To develop the conditions for sensing the overhuman, one has to suspend the intellectual values that guide one's thought and be guided in turn by one's senses. One might be inclined to think that after Thus Spoke Zarathustra there is little to be "heard" about the overhuman in Nietzsche's work?and that "where noth ing is heard there is nothing." However, as we have sought to demonstrate, to be able to "hear" the intimations of the overhuman, one must cultivate a subtle sense. The new experiences of which Nietzsche speaks are utterly original but equally impersonal, as anonymous as they are real. For it is at the heart of the most intimate, most sacred encounter that the category of the "personal" is undone. The price of accessing the overhuman is the loss of the very coordi nates by which it could be recognized.

Notes 1. This is even true of the assorted notes on the overhuman that seem to strike an authoritative, even definitive tone. Such passages include an extensive notebook entry (November 1887-March 1888) entitled "The Overhuman," in which Nietzsche speculates on the cultivation of a "higher type"?"something that is a kind of "overhuman" in relation to the totality of humanity" (KSA 13: 11 [413]). Another notable example from autumn 1887 discusses the notion of the genesis and preservation of a "higher type" for which the word ?bermensch is the salient "concept" and "metaphor" (KSA 12: 10[17]). 2. For example, Zarathustra may be parodying the "improvers of mankind" when he declares the overhuman the "meaning" (Sinn) of the earth. 3. Despite Nietzsche's infamous criticism of the Kantian idea of "disinterestedness" in GMIII, it could be argued that the notion of "ecstasis" Nietzsche employs in relation to both Apollonian and Dionysian states (in BT and WP notes) fulfills a formally similar function. Indeed, it is Kant's explicit focus on the primacy of pleasure and pain at the heart of aesthetic judgment that enables Nietzsche to pursue the themes of beauty and sublimity from the perspective of a transcendental physiology. Unfortunately, it is beyond the scope of the current discussion to develop this point further here. Interested readers might like to consult my After Nietzsche: Notes Towards a Philosophy of Ecstasy (Palgrave: Macmillan, 2002). 4. Despite the dominant discussion of Zarathustra as a "type" in this passage, it is arguably the text rather than the figure that is alluded to here. Without revisiting arguments about Zarathustra's status as teacher rather than exemplar of the ?bermensch, it is worth noting that Nietzsche frequently uses the term "Zarathustra" to denote the work rather than the persona. It may be recalled that a similar remark about the whole fact of man lying at an infinite distance beneath the work is used in the Foreword (cited above). 5. The passage recalls a similar thought in the "Heath of Lenz" fragments: "Can we remove the idea of a goal from the process and affirm the process in spite of this? This would be the case if something within this process were attained in every moment?and always the same" (WP 55).</page></plain_text>
