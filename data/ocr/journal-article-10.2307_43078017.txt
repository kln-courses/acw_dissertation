Introduction The archaeologists who have studied the figurative patterns of pre- classic Western Asia have very rarely focused their attention on colours and geometric systems, because of the difficulty in discovering, preserving and understanding polychrome findings of any kind. Moreover, the very rare examples of architectural use of colours have been usually intended as ways to express the same iconographies of relief. Little attention has been paid to the technical differences between sculpture and painting and in par- ticular to the semantic implications. An entirely plastered room located in the western side of an important building dating to the Early Bronze Age IV and probably functionally linked to the Southern Administrative Quarter of the Royal Palace G2 has been recently discovered at Tell Mardikh-Ebla in the southern Lower City3. A hypothetically reconstructed niche in the northern wall of this room (L.8729) was completely decorated with geometric painted patterns directly traced on white plaster. A number of plaster fragments is what remains of the niche. The fragments' preserva- tion state is definitely critical: the collapse of the imposing structures caused the total shattering of some parts of the plaster4. 'Marco Ramazzotti is the author of paragraphs I, II and V; Alessandro Di Ludovico wrote paragraph III. Both authors are responsible for paragraphs IV and VI. The present work is the first synthesis of two preliminary studies that the authors presented in Chicago (poster session at the 51th RAI 2005) and Madrid (oral presentation at the 51th CAANE 2006). A specific and detailed monograph of the excavations and findings which are here shortly dis- cussed is currently in preparation on MSAE ( Materiali e Studi di Archeologia Eblaita , Uni- versity La Sapienza of Rome). The authors are grateful to Prof. Paolo Matthiae for permis- sion to study art and material findings recently discovered in Tell Mardikh-Ebla. 2 For a detailed architectural and stratigraphical analysis on the Southern Administrative Quarter of the Royal Palace G see Matthiae 1978: 204-236. 3 Matthiae 2006: 452-458; Ramazzotti, in the press. 4 The remaining fragments are in general very fragile and friable, and they look to have been weakened and partly erased or discoloured. Besides the effects of the building collapse process, this is likely due to the penetration of water in the ground. Unfortunately, this means</page><page sequence="2">Design at Ebla 67 II. The discovery The systematic investigation of the southern slope of the Acropolis of Tell Mardikh originated mainly from two problems: locating the northern limits of the Southern Palace (MB II) and analyzing the connections between the Acropolis and the southern part of the Lower City during the Old Syrian period5 (Figure 1). At the end of October 2002 the investigations revealed that the walls of the Citadel and the Southern Palace were separated by a wide road6. Beneath this road, in front of the so-called Southern Sector of Royal Palace G, a monumental building was discovered. This building is placed at a lower level than Palace G, and shows no structural connections with it7. The building has been named «Building FF2» (Bâtiment FF2) since a more precise functional interpretation is currently too difficult8. The stratig- raphy of Building FF2 is largely disturbed by the foundations of the Middle Bronze Age "Southern Palace" and by a number of later pits. So, its architectural plan, as well as its collapse levels and its complex wall decoration program, can be only partly reconstructed9. Building FF2 is a multifunctional structure with some quadrangular rooms of different dimen- sions. Its spatial setting can be understood by applying principles similar to those well known in some Royal Palace G sectors, but the semantic rela- tion between the two buildings can also be hypothesized on the basis of their typical Early Bronze IVA building techniques10 (Photo 1). III. The Syntax of the Geometric Decoration Concerning the reconstruction of the plastered decorations in L.8729, a first important step is that of singling out the main motifs which were also that the fragments are mostly of small dimensions, if compared to the size of the decorating motifs, which complicates the reconstruction of the whole original decorating pro- ject. Although it is still too early to formulate conjectures on the actual shape and dimensions of this niche, its original dimensions could be approximately estimated as corresponding to 1.4 (height) X 1.6 (width) metres circa. 5 Ramazzotti 2008a; 2008b. 6Matthiae 2004: 325, fig. 27. 7 Matthiae 2004: 319, fig. 18; 320, fig. 19, 321, fig. 20. 8 Matthiae 2004: 318, footnote 34. 9 The particular stratigraphie position of Building FF2 has been detailed in a poster ses- sion held in Chicago, Oriental Institute, in 2005: A. Di Ludovico - M. Ramazzotti, The Painted Walls.

Beside the decorated plaster fragments, a not very deep circular hollow in the floor and a column base have been discovered in L.8729: these features could be clues to cultic functions.</page><page sequence="3">68 Alessandro Di Ludovico - Marco Ramazzotti Figure 1: Plan of "Building FF2" (by R.

The groups into which the motifs of the fresco paintings can be subdivided are evidences of a grammar of the decoration. At first glance, it is possible to single out at least eight kinds of patterns (Photo 2): a) concentric rhombuses; b ) triangles arranged in helicoidal motifs inscribed in quadrilaterals; c ) series of black and red triangles staggered by white ones; d) triangles arranged in butterfly-motifs inscribed in quadrilaterals; e) asterisks inscribed in squares; f) small nets of perpendicular lines inscribed in squares; g ) large meanders; h ) rosettes. In order to better comprehend the structure of niche and decorations, another fundamental step is to include the fragments in categories which refer to their three-dimensionality. The best preserved fragments found in the room can be classified into three main groups: moulded elements origi- nating from the particular shape of some surfaces, flat elements and pro- jecting elements. In general, the whole decoration was probably perceived through depth, surface, coloured decoration and slight light and shade effects. Since the findings come mostly from the northern side of the room and were not far from the brick structures, it is very likely that the original position of the niche was in a small area in this sector. With regard to the original position in height of the painted motifs, they were probably in the upper part of the wall11. The decorations are painted in black and red on a white undercoat12. This undercoat often recurs as background or counter- part of the motifs drawn in the other colours. The tendency toward repetition of standardized patterns in chains of various sizes is quite evident. The basic units which form the patterns represented can be mainly related to triangular and quadrangular shapes. They are arranged in various combinations that follow one another in chains (Figure 2). The concentric rhombuses (a) always appear in chains, 11 The painted plaster fragments were found under a great quantity of debris of the room and just above the remains of the beams and the leaf and reed roof, mixed with other brick fragments. 12 Though we do not yet have the results of chemical analyses on the materials used, it seems very likely that this white undercoat was essentially made of gypsum, in the way de- scribed by Nunn 1988: 6-7, 12-13. The colours mentioned here seem to have been the "Grundfarben" in the earliest wall painting tradition of a large part of Western Asia (Nunn 1988: 18-19, 29). About the problem of analyzing and describing colours used by ancient cultures see, for example, what is stated in Di Ludovico 2008: 328-329; id.: in the press.</page><page sequence="5">70 Alessandro Di Ludovico - Marco Ramazzotti Figure 2: Hypothetical and provisional reconstruction of the arrangements of the patterns in the niche (by U. Capriani, 2004), with its reconstructed section (below).</page><page sequence="6">Design at Ebla 71 but they can vary in size and in the kind of chain arrangement: in some fragments they are arranged in one series, so that they form a sort of frame (Photo 2, a). The limits of this frame are signalled by two bold lines and by the particular outline of the surface of the plastering. Another kind of concentric rhombuses was intended to fill a wide surface (Photo 2, a, above). These rhombuses are clearly different from the others: they are linked to each other, but also separated, by red lines the intersections of which form right angles. The helicoidal motifs (b) formed by triangles seem to allude to shapes like swastikas (Photo 2, b). Since the fragments containing this motif are very small, it is not possible to ascertain how many parallel chains of them were originally represented on the wall. Anyway, it is clear that the colours of the helicoidal elements were black and red, alternating on a white background. This motif was bounded, on the one side, by a thick black line forming a frame; on the other side, by another chain of motifs consisting of red and black triangles of different sizes. Similarly bounded by a thick black line is the succession of series of black and red triangles staggered by white ones (c). They also follow the "logic of the chain", and the compositional schemes here employed are clearly based on rectangular frames (Photo 2, c). As well as with the series of triangles, the triangles are also arranged in butterfly-shaped motifs (&lt; d ) in quadrangular schemes (Photo 2, d). Of both these motifs just few small fragments are preserved. The shape of the square is taken up in a more explicit way in the tissues of asterisks inscribed in squares (Photo 2, e) and those of small nets made of perpendicular lines and inscribed in squares (Photo 2, f). In some parts of the niche they seem to have been contiguous, but squares inscribing small nets are adjacent to the rosettes (Photo 2, h). Chromatic contrast between red and black was employed in the chain of the large meanders (g) much more than elsewhere (Photo 2, g). In this motif the background colour is rarely visible. Like the largest rhombuses, the meanders were surely used to fill large surfaces. Rosettes Qi) are the only pattern based on a round, and not square, scheme. Though they appear isolated, and not in the chain-like arrangement, their rounded shape and the cyclic disposition of the petals recall the same arrangement as the chains. The rosettes could have been employed in the angles of some framings. The clearest decorated fragments show that the whole compositional system is based on the repetition of triangular and quadrangular shapes. Obviously, exceptions to this remark are apparently represented by the rosettes. Beyond these distinctions, however, an abstract compositional paradigm can be recognized. In fact, most of the geometric decoration pro- ject seems to have been carried out on the basis of some quite rigid</page><page sequence="7">72 Alessandro Di Ludovico - Marco Ramazzotti canons of proportions. These canons make the various elements of the composition fit a standardized general scheme. Actually, one of the most interesting features of the decorated plaster fragments discovered in Build- ing FF2 is the surviving agglutination of interconnected guidelines systems (Figure 3). These guidelines are traced in red colour and consist of thin perpendicular and parallel lines dividing up the surface. They were very likely not visible in the final stage of making the painted decoration and were drawn for the sake of allowing the craftsmen to guide their own hands in a methodical and repetitive sequence of gestures13. One could Figure 3: The guideline system used to execute the wall paintings in "Building FF2". 13 A very similar use of guidelines in the drawing of wall paintings is widely attested in Egypt in many epochs, since the XI/XII Dynasty (Robins 1994: 31-40, 57-63; 2001), and also in the Aegean world (see, for instance, Brysbaert 2002: 100-101; Bietak-Marinatos 1995: 46-63; Marinatos 1998: 84-101). It is important, however, to notice that the string impression grid was mainly used in Egypt and the Aegean in the drawing of anthropomorphic bodies, animal figures, plants and narrative sequences, and not for chains of geometric patterns.</page><page sequence="8">Design at Ebla 73 imagine that the guidelines were particularly important because of the peculiar physical relationship between the motifs and the surfaces they were intended to be drawn upon. The concentric frames of the niche were not an effective spatial reason for the motifs, which seem to be considered to exceed them. In fact, the motifs have a boundless expansion potential, to the point that, on the one hand, the moulded frames need black bound- ary lines signalling their effective limits; on the other hand, the character- istics of their drawing procedures may suggest that those who drew them and first saw them perceived them as continuing over the material bounda- ries of the niche and its components. Actually, close to the black line and to the mouldings which bound the components of the niche the geometric motifs are drawn partially, as if they were endlessly continuing in some other dimensions, apparently hidden to the eyes of the observers. The hypothesis that rigid recurring compositional principles were guid- ing the project of the paintings is strengthened by some metrological clues. The rosettes are clearly drawn on the basis of a unit of length and its sub- multiples that can be recognized in the motif of the "nets inscribed in squares". The squares with the net of lines look very interesting from this viewpoint, since the length of their sides and its thirds seem to be basic units for the drawing of the rosettes. This means that each rosette is built on an ideal grid of 16 squares, as if it was inscribed in a bigger square the length of the side of which is equivalent to four times the "basic unit" (Figure 4). IV The Inner Spatial Grammar The white plaster-moulded structure was a typical Early Bronze tech- nique: it is used also in Royal Place G, as is well documented by the modular surface treatments in the gate of L.8495, the southern room of an administra- tive quarter originally built on the eastern limit of the recently discovered L.2866 court. A more specific iconographie relation appears if we look at the analogy between the rhombuses of the plastered decoration in the gate of Royal Palace G administrative quarter and the characteristic motif painted on the white plaster in Building FF2. In this case the basic figurative pattern for the mudbrick wall plaster decoration was planned in order to follow a specific geometrical pattern. Moreover, some of the iconographies recently discovered in L.2982 Royal Palace G, such as the golden rosette (TM.03.G795)14 which presents the same petal shape as the EBA white limestone cover from Temple l4Matthiae 2004: 315, fig. 12; 317, fig. 17; the diameter is 4.0 cm and was discovered in layer 4d.</page><page sequence="9">74 Alessandro Di Ludovico - Marco Ramazzotti Figure 4: Recurring proportions in the rosette components and adjacent motifs.</page><page sequence="10">Design at Ebla 75 P215 can be formally compared both to the 'rosette inlay' discovered in L.8613 and to the painted rosette pattern in L.8729. The spatial organization of these grammars cannot be detailed, because of the difficulties of locating the archaeological evidence in their original position and because of the destruc- tion processes which completely dispersed the record. Anyway, its inner semantic coherence can be deduced by observing some formal analogies be- tween some basic painted motifs discovered in L.8729 and some important documents dated to EBA. These analogies are not only limited to a technical habitus of the Early Bronze Syrian architectural traditions but can also be traced through the formal codes of the basic geometric motifs in some of the findings from Royal Place G. First, the rhombus pattern attested in the famous inlay panel discovered in Royal Place G16 is formally analogous to the basic polychrome motif painted in Building FF2 niche (Photo 3, above). Second, the same geometric organization could be recognized also in the stamp impression of the Early Bronze Rim Jar of the Palace, just as the triangles arranged in butterfly-motifs inscribed in quadrilaterals seem to correspond to the incised motif of a stamp seal (Photo 3, below). As for the problems of the analogies between decorating techniques adopted in similar contexts, many geometric FF2 modules are impressed or incised on objects like pottery and seals. It has been pointed out that this kind of seal impression on the rim jar coming from the Central Complex of Royal Palace G (L.4452) is well known in Anatolia and Northern Syria and could be related to the 'brocade style' attested in Mesopotamia since the beginning of third millennium bc17. V The Semantic Relations On the level of pure geometry and colour revealed in Building FF2 paintings, the similarity with the well known Uruk Wall cones in Eanna can be considered the most impressive one. Not only some of the patterns used for this decorative prospect are syntactically organized in the same way as those of Building FF2, but also the arrangement of the Black, White and Red colours seems to follow the same compositional order18. This aesthetic concordance between the two decorating structures cannot be 15 Matthiae-Pinnock-Scandone Matthiae 1995: 344, 363, n. 139. 16Matthiae 1985: 61, fig. 21. 17 See Mazzoni 1992: 79-135, ns. A2, A4, A6, A8, A12, A15, A35, A36, A37. All these formal analogies could be simply observed as a formal repetition of geometries which assume very important communicative functions, but it could also be understood as an iconographie mimesis of very significant elements. 18 See Lenzen 1959: Taf. 20b, Taf. 41; 1966: Taf. 23 a-n; Brandes 1968: Beilage 2 and 3, Taf. 1-7.</page><page sequence="11">76 Alessandro Di Ludovico - Marco Ramazzotti reduced to the sphere of the formal analogies, because the logical formali- zation of the geometry is a more ancient attitude to reproducing a specific non-verbal narrative19 and later on the lozenge decorative system is incised on pottery coming from the Arslantepe Late Calcholithic strata and painted, in the same colours, on mud-brick walls as a dynamical scheme to represent human heads or the bodies of deities20. On the other hand, other lozenges painted on the FF2 niche could be formalized as geometric design and can be related also to the schematic treatment of the so-called Eye Idols of Tell Brak21. Moreover the northern tradition of this geometric syntax is well represented in some decorations of the so-called Northern Mesopotamian Stone Ware dated to the Late Early Dynastic and Akkadian period22 and in some Jazira bichrome stands23. This multiple apparatus system was well known in Lower and Upper Mesopotamia during the fourth millennium bc and it served as ideographical language on mudbrick wall-plasters or objects clearly linked to different functions. Archaeologi- cally, this geometric apparatus becomes more understandable or less abs- tract when we compare the identical motifs discovered in FF2 building to the monumental discoveries of the Early Dynastic Period at Ubaid and Ur. Here the lozenges are included in the same texture and are inlaid in some structural elements of figurative complexes. Some fitting examples are the sound box of a harp from Ur24 and the columns sustaining the copper reliefs in Tell el-Ubaid Ninkhursag Temple25. VI. The Hypothetical Reconstruction The geometric figurative patterns of the FF2 niche are quite well attested in Ebla during the Early Bronze Age IVA as plastered, inlayed and painted decorations. They are closely related to an aesthetic perception of the geometrical decorative system. While it is of course possible that these geometric motifs inspired the well known Grain Measure system painted on some northern Old Babylonian jars26, the indirect semantic relations between " This kind of dynamical scheme has now been revealed as a sort of geometric code too, representing dancers and temples on a selected sample of proto-historic Iranian sherds decora- tion system, dated to the VI and V millennium b.c.

The frame of FF2 system of decorating patterns is contemporary and quite similar, as for colours and inner arrangement, to Ur and Ubaid monuments, but Bull-head and the Anzu images of these pre- cious documents offer us an important occasion to fill out our hypotheses on the geometric and figurative patterns revealed in the FF2 niche (Photo 4). The apparently non-iconic decorative system of the niche could be related to the absence of the divine simulacrum, which was probably placed inside the niche itself in the original project, and its absence could be explained by the destruction or the sack of images of deities during the de- struction of Early Bronze Age IVA Ebla. In this specific sense, we should understand the generative role of the geometrical grammar of the niche paintings. Though it could seem just an extraordinary discovery of the most common motifs adopted as decorations by royal architects and artists during the Early Bronze Age, it could indirectly allude to the inner space of a Royal Chapel located very close to the southern limit of the Administrative Quarter. Unfortunately, this building complex, which was strictly related to the royal sphere, was irremediably damaged by destruction and pillage of the Old Syrian Southern Palace foundations and later pits. As a conclusion, we express our hope that the style of the painted decorations of L.8729 may lead to a new way of understanding the relations between the geometric decorations and their ideographic meaning and that the Building FF2 niche architectural system may represent an important way of exploring the very polysémie non-verbal relation between shape and substance or between the cornice and the images27. 27 For a semiotic analysis of this specific relations and their implications on modern visual perception see Schapiro 1969: 223-242.
