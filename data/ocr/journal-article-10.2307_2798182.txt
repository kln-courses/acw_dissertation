<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art SANDARS, N. K. Prehistoric art in Europe (Pelican Hist. Art). xxxix, 350 pp., plates, figs., maps, tables, bibliogr. Harmonds- worth; Penguin, 1968. ~6 6s. In this volume Miss Sandars attempts to review all European prehistoric art from the Palaeolithic to the Iron Age. Although she warns against too unitary a view of prehistory, she is forced to group together the many different art forms of diverse peoples. Miss Sandars displays an unusual width of interest in all the conventionally accepted 'periods' of prehistory, and the book is fairly evenly devoted to the major art forms, from Palaeo- lithic small carvings and rock art to the arts of the Celtic metal smiths. Major sections are also devoted to modelling, carving, potting and the monumental art of the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, but with emphasis on metallurgy in the latter period. In view of the width and comprehensive nature of the coverage, it is surprising that the post- Mesolithic rock arts of Iberia and the Alpine regions receive barely a passing mention. The illustrations are good and the book contains new photographs of many examples of prehistoric craftsmanship which are not normally found illustrated in general works. There is also a sizeable bibliography in the notes to the text, as well as a list of general works of reference for the lay reader. Miss Sandars has not attempted to define art, but she includes in this book discussion of two- and three-dimensional representations, non-representational designs on rock faces and on pottery and implements as well as the shapes and designs of the objects themselves. Some representational works, however, she considers 'hardly rank as art at all', for instance the Spanish Neolithic rock paintings and pottery decorations or 'symbols like the "Neolithic" paintings of Levanzo'; these works receive no further mention. The closest that we come to a discussion of what con- stitutes 'prehistoric art' is in the introduction to the section on the Neolithic period where Miss Sandars asks whether she has' the right to</page><page sequence="2">FOLKLORE 493 speak of Neolithic art in Europe at all'. Her answer in the affirmative is justified with examples of some Neolithic objects which she describes as of 'classic proportions', 'forcefully three-dimensional' or with 'abstract purity', etc. In conclusion she establishes the 'existence' of art in Neolithic Europe by the 'existence' of objects which show 'variety', 'aesthetic sensibility' and 'technical competence'. With these criteria to guide her in the choice of subject matter it is perhaps not surprising to find a discussion devoted to establishing whether a pot is 'ugly' or 'beautiful'. Much of the text is descriptive. After short introductions to the archaeological back- ground the artistic complement of each period is illustrated from selected examples. These are all too frequently described in general terms which are more imaginative than they are informative: the 'genial' face of a Vinca figure 'you might expect to see grinning over a beer-mug' but the engraved man from Les Colombieres is 'hirsute, slow witted, uncanny'. Miss Sandars has deliberately not attempted any of the typological analyses which it would be a matter of course for her to apply to any other archaeological material. Indeed, she states in the foreword that the study of prehistoric art demands a 'much greater freedom than does prehistory itself'. This is a provocative statement. However, even if one were to admit such licence for freedom, it would not justify the vagueness encountered about facts of content or context of some of the material she discusses. We are, for instance, asked to take at face value Miss Sandars's evaluation of a marble figurine from Senorbi, Sardinia, the 'cold, inviolate image, sym- metrical and anonymous' as giving us a glimpse of 'what men thought they saw when they peered across the stone threshold of the tomb'; yet, we are told, the Senorbi figure was not found in a tomb-we are not told in what context it was found. The interpretation of prehistoric art is not a main concern of this book. Discussions of the interpretative problems are short. Miss Sandars expresses a healthy scepticism for the facile comparisons of symbols or representa- tions across time and space which have led some archaeologists to group all female figurines as Mother Goddess figures, or all 'eye' patterns on tomb stones as representa- tions of a female goddess. In particular she queries the interpretation of the arc and circle patterns on some tomb stones, notably Gavr'inis, as necessarily anthropomorphic, since the same patterns recur in many diverse contexts, for instance both in Near Eastern metal work and on Romanesque churches, where they are certainly not anthropomor- phic. She also points out that similar patterns may, and do, have quite different meanings in different cultures. In rejecting some earlier interpretations based on the comparison of isolated patterns, she unfortunately also rejects all detailed analysis of design or form for arriving at an understanding of the meaning of the art. Having 'thrown the baby out with the bathwater', Miss Sandars is left with nothing more than her own personal evaluation of the art, supplemented by the (supposed!) interests and preoccupations of prehistoric peoples.
