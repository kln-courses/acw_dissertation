Oceania 34 (1999) 145-160 Bedrock notions and isochrestic choice: evidence for localised stylistic patterning in the engravings of the Sydney region jo McDonald Abstract This paper explores stylistic variability in engraved art in the Sydney region. It is argued that engravings operated in a distinc- tive social context, fulfilling a regional bonding function and pro- viding the opportunity for large scale group cohesion. Conversely the sheltered pigment art, produced in an arguably domestic social context, is thought to have provided the opportunity for individual and localised group identifying behaviour. The region's open engravings are considered to be the stylisti- cally more conservative of the two art components. This paper explores rare engraved motifs and compositional details in an attempt to explore the artists of this region's bedrock notions and isochrestic choices (Sackett 1990). It concludes that by exploring regional patterning at a variety of integrated scales we can under- stand better the processes and complexities of a regional rock art network. Introduction "I would now maintain that focussed regional archaeolo- gies of rock art which combine a consideration of the diversity of form and of syntax, of 'art' vs 'mark', and of archaeologically defined contexts leads to a more opti- mistic view of the interpretative potential of rock art in archaeology". (Rosenfeld 1997:298) This paper describes part of an archaeological analysis on a regional Aboriginal rock art assemblage. In it, styl- istic variability in the engraved art of the Sydney region is described in terms of communication networks. The art assemblage is an archaeological one. There is no anthropological basis and little ethnohistoric evidence as to how this rock art articulated territoriality and commu- nication around this region. By focussing on social con- text and by applying the precepts of information exchange theory, this work has attempted to explore the concept that rock art is an expression of group identity. This research was done as a PhD thesis (McDonald 1994), supervised by Andrée Rosenfeld. I hope that this research project was one of those which gave Andrée the optimism she describes above. The broader analysis of the two artistic media present in this region - engravings (petroglyphs) and pigment shelter art (pictographs) - indicated that both art com- ponents exhibited stylistic variability. In most parts of the region this variation was clinal. The variation was explained in terms of defined language areas1 (Figure 1). Within language areas, however, there was identifiable variation across drainage basins - the likely range of smaller social (ie. residential) groups (McDonald 1994, 1998; Rosenfeld 1997). In an effort to determine the local character of engraved motifs the distributions of several rare motifs were explored. At an even more spe- cific level, compositional details on one rare motif, the shield, were analysed in an effort to explore variation within language areas. The Sydney Basin regional style The rock art from the Sydney Basin is acknowledged as being a distinctive regional style (McCarthy 1979, 1988; Maynard 1979). What makes it distinctive and what dis- tinguishes it from other regional styles has been addressed by others (Franklin 1984, Officer 1992, 1993; Layton 1992a). The internal variation within this region and possible causes for these were the focus of the research discussed here (McDonald 1994). However, the very presence of this regional style, and the fact that it has a generally definable geographical extent is of some import. What was it about the prehistoric cultures of the Sydney Basin that led to the proliferation of artistic behaviour? Why is the Sydney Basin surrounded by a comparative artistic vacuum? (Officer 1992) These ques- tions are not specifically addressed in this paper, although they certainly motivated the approach taken in this research. It is considered that the nature of social organisation in this region resulted in the development of sophisticated information exchange networks. Portable art and body decoration would have played a part in 15 Bankside Ave, Undercliffe, NSW 2206 1. Capell (1970) concludes that four language groups (with varying numbers of recorded dialects) existed in the region at contact. On the basis of archaeological evidence, I have argued that these boundaries may well have existed for at least 1,000 years into prehistory. The art in the region was still being produced at contact. While one cannot presume a timeless ethnographic present, diachronic analysis of the art indicates that time is not a major factor affecting stylistic variability (McDonald 1998). I am thus assuming that the language boundaries, recorded at contact, provide a reason- able baseline for comparison and interpretation. 145</page><page sequence="2">S~ DARGtNYUNG ' ÌOARG/NVUNG^I || G U R / Ν G A li Wisemans Fenyj^fa^ ) «ϊ Γ ^^ΙθΛ r its ) λ χ -flfi?sford ζ Γ / *^&gt; ^J 'J - 'Broken Bay I nu « ur S GURINGA/ ■* J / DHARUK nu « ur jf y^ ■* J*l ' "SVDNEV / /^ DHARUK / '/A f*r' ì f&gt;„ J$ / I ^jtA J Λ Port Hacking Caxndc^OTpbnlt0^ /DHARAWAf^Ä I J Hacking , y / / O 10 go km Figure 1: The four language areas defined in the Sydney region (after Capell 1970: Figure 1).

Note that the spelling used by Capell varies from that generally used here for the various language groups. these. The rock art, however, produced in arguably two different social contexts, provided the mechanisms which have survived in the archaeological record. Regional patterning operates multifariously and can be understood at a variety of scales of inclusion (Conkey 1987:70). It facilitates the detection and comprehension of regional patterning if the complexity of intrasite pat- terning (eg. Frankel 1989), the evidence from individual sites as well as localised catchment patterns (eg. Attenbrow 1987) are first understood. Through an under- standing of identified localised variability, regional pat- terning can be quantified and assessed. This paper dis- cusses stylistic variation at the localised - or more fine-grained - end of the scale. Style and Information Exchange The way that archaeologists have interpreted style in the archaeological record reflects the belief that style relates directly to cultural behaviour; that the distribution and interaction of different groups should be identifiable through an analysis of certain stylistic traits. There are, of course, conflicting theories about how this may be achieved, as indeed there are contrary views about the role of style in contextual artistic behaviour (cf. Conkey 1978, Clegg 1988, Franklin 1989; Hodder 1978, 1979; McCarthy 1957; Plog 1980; Wiessner 1983, 1985, 1989; Wobst 1977). For the purposes of this research style was defined broadly as the particular way of doing or produc- ing material culture which signals the activity of a partic- ular group of people(s) who distinguish themselves from other, similarly constituted groups. Social interaction theory views stylistic similarity as a function of social and geographic similarity, proximity and interaction. Behavioural interpretations based on this theory are limited to those of general communication: the continuity of a style through time represents the con- tinuity of communication processes; the widespread dis- tribution of homogenous stylistic material reflects close and/or high levels of interaction throughout the region in question. It is possible, however, to envisage style in a much more functional capacity: One of the major functions of stylistic behaviour is to link those members of a community who are not in constant verbal contact with each other, and make their interaction more predictable and less stressful. (Wobst 1977:327) Information exchange theory has been successfully applied in recent years in various ethnographic and ethno-archaeological contexts (Hodder 1978; Smith 1989; Wiessner 1983, 1984, 1989; Wobst 1977): If style is a means of negotiating identity relative to that of those surrounding one, then change in the amount of personal and social expression in a given artefact in a region through time should give some measure of changes in the condition ... personal and social expres- sion being measured by heterogeneity and homogeneity, respectively, in artefacts. (Wiessner 1989:59) In her work amongst the Kalahari San, Wiessner (eg. 1983, 1989, 1990) has developed a model of stylistic behaviour based on the duality of emblemic and assertive styles. The primary element here is the speci- ficity of referent. Styles with distinct or specific referents are assertive. Styles with more generalised associations are classed emblemic. The basic assumption for these categories is that style is seen as a means of non-verbal communication used to negotiate identity, by comparison and/or contrast. The level at which comparisons are made is seen as an important source of variation in style. Comparisons at the individual level will result in different stylistic distri- butions and rates of change from those at the group level (Wiessner 1989), and determinants of style become more complex as social systems evolve (Plog 1990). Since style is seen generally as a medium for projecting iden- tity, actively and passively, both individual and group identity can be expressed in style. Wiessner (1989) has defined different situations which might stimulate the different identity emphasis and result in stylistic mes- 146</page><page sequence="3">sages demonstrating different levels of social interaction. Group identity will be emphasised where there is fear (real or potential), inter-group competition and aggres- sion, a need for co-operation to achieve certain goals and imposed political control requiring group cohesion. Conversely, individual identity will dominate where there is competition between individuals, when there are options for individual economic gain or where there is a breakdown in the social order that would require individ- uals to seek solutions to their own problems. The indi- vidual may be difficult to recognise in archaeological studies (eg. Deetz 1965). Increasing individual expres- sion, however, should be observable by an overall con- comitant decrease in stylistic homogeneity at the local and, ultimately, regional levels. But where, within the formal variation identified in one's assemblage, does style reside? Sackett's work is explicitly directed at this question, and he believes style is found wherever isochrestic options exist and where factors allied to ethnicity dictate the choices made among them (Sackett 1990:33). This may not seem to get us any closer to an analytical approach or answer, especially since Sackett also con- ceptualises 'style and function as complementary and dualistic aspects that also simultaneously reside in instru- mental form' (ibid.:34). He does, however, perceive of style as having both active and passive voices. The 'active voice' is a recognition that the iconic properties of style constitute ethnic 'messaging' generated by what is essentially self-conscious, deliberate and premeditated behaviour intended to identify and maintain boundaries within and between groups (viz. Wobst 1977). The con- cept of passive voice recognises that the majority of iconic information carried by objects is latent, 'inherent in the isochrestic choices which lie behind their manu- facture and which themselves are for the most part made unselfconsciously' (Sackett 1990:36). Style enters the picture when we see that the artisans of any given fraternity (or sorority) are aware of only a few, and often choose but one, of the isochrestic options potentially available when performing any given task, and that the choices that they make are largely dictated by the technological traditions within which they have been enculturated as members of social groups that delineate their ethnicity. (Sackett 1990:33) Sackett also perceives of another, less well defined concept, which he labels the vernacular style. This con- sists of the 'bedrock' design notions inherited by the arti- san of any cultural group: notions as deeply and unconsciously embedded in their behaviour as their motor habits, the dialects they speak . . . Inculcated as much by insinuation as by instruction, and therefore all the more unquestioned, these notions thus constitute a kind of substratum to the group's style (Sackett 1990:39). He argues that this level of stylistic information may be responsible for a significant proportion of the ethni- cally significant variation that archaeologists are able to perceive in an assemblage, particularly given the usual degree of resolution possible and an absence of ethno- graphic or ethnohistoric information. This concept is par- ticularly suitable when considering a regional style, such as that in the Sydney Basin. Indeed it describes - and provides a testable model for - the development of regional stylistic patterns over broad areas and consider- able distances. It is another way of explicating schematic consistency over a dispersed area. There are various methodological advantages to an isochrestic approach, particularly when one's classifica- tion is based on thematic variability. Thematic variability is taken as being based on the choices made about sub- ject matter and the designs used in the production of an art system. There are various examples of how the com- bination of motifs and compositional features indicate high levels of ethnically significant patterning (eg. Glassie 1975, Longacre 1981) and Sackett suggests that 'themes may well be the [things] that give congruence to isochrestic choices in non-material aspects of cultural life' (1990:41). By focussing on motif choices and regional patterning in the Sydney rock art, an attempt was made to get at the artists' isochrestic choices. An approach which views its classification as 'the- matic' has not been explicitly attempted on an archaeo- logical rock art assemblage before. It could be argued that all previous regional analyses of motif assem- blages/design elements per se have indeed explored the congruence of design themes (eg. Franklin 1984, David 1994, McMah 1965, Officer 1984, Rosenfeld 1982, Tacón 1989; and see Smith 1989 on portable Australian art) although rarely is the relevance of a motif - in itself or through combinations - to the broader question of stylistic variability discussed (cf. Clegg 1977). The approach used here was an attempt to apply Sackett's thematic approach to a regional art assemblage. A model for the Sydney Region The Sydney region comprises one culture area, broadly defined by the watersheds of the Hawkesbury-Nepean and Georges Rivers (Peterson 1976). Linguistic and eth- nohistoric evidence indicate underlying social patterning, but there is little known about how the social structure in this culture area functioned - how the distribution of populations was organised around the region, what were the actual number, nature and arrangement of smaller social groups - and more importantly how these resi- dential groups maintained their patterns of distribution and articulation (Madden 1983:191; Rosenfeld 1997). We do not know how social processes were structured and where discontinuities occurred: and more impor- tantly how these may be manifested as variability in the archaeological record. The challenge of applying information exchange to a rock art assemblage is that this prehistoric symbolic behaviour is 'grounded'. The art remains in the location that it was produced, and is representative of the activi- 147</page><page sequence="4">ties of its producers, at that location. Much of the sym- bolic behaviour which accompanied increasing social complexity, and which has been the subject for analysis by previous information exchange research, has been mobiliary (eg. Gamble 1982, Hodder 1978, Smith 1989, Wiessner 1984, Wobst 1977). Much of the symbolic behaviour which signalled group identity and affiliation in the Sydney region - such as body painting and scari- fication, tooth avulsion, removal of the little finger of coastal women etc. - was also portable, being individu- ally borne by the people involved. While the fixed or grounded nature of the rock art provides a immobile record for symbolic activity, shifting boundaries over time, as well as the mobility of the art producers and the complexity of their social contacts could be expected to blur this evidence. To understand the nature of communication in the Sydney region it is necessary to determine what sort of social networks were in place (David &amp; Lourandos 1998, Rosenfeld 1997). There is an extensive anthropological literature on this subject (although not within this region specifically) - and previous analyses using information exchange theory have defined this issue as being of cen- tral importance to understanding the nature of resultant information exchange requirements (Gamble 1982, Smith 1989). On the basis of geographical, environmen- tal, ethnohistoric and archaeological evidence it is expected that the social networks across the fertile and temperate Sydney region would have been relatively closed and exclusive. On this basis, it would be predicted that stylistic messaging would be discontinuous and show a tendency to be discretely clumped, compared with the art of a harsher environment where social net- works were by necessity open. It is not known how art functioned across the Sydney region, and - as indicated above - much stylistic information which demonstrated social group affiliation may not have entered the archaeological record (eg. body scarification and/or painting, tooth avulsion, and so on). If we assume that style is found 'wherever isochrestic options exist and where factors allied to ethnicity dictate the choices among them' (Sackett 1990:33) then an extensive regional rock art assemblage provides a perfect opportunity for demonstrating the 'bedrock design notions' of that region's artists. As the art is 'fixed' in space, many of the problems (eg. re-use over time by dif- ferent people in a different social context) of portable artefacts are avoided. The art remains where it was pro- duced, and while the individual artists would have had considerable mobility, the art is a record of their ranges of activities (David &amp; Lourandos 1998). It has been argued that the engravings in the open and the pigment art in rocksheiter sites had different func- tions (McDonald 1994, 1998)2. On the basis of informa- tion exchange theory it is anticipated that the art which was viewed by a larger proportion of the population and which is located in a public context, would be expected to contain the best potential for stylistic messaging of an emblemic kind. Art produced in a domestic context (fol- lowing Wiessner 1990) may also have allowed the opportunity for individual stylistic expressions, similarly resulting in the development of localised stylistic trends. The two media appear to have presented different opportunities for projecting identity. Elsewhere (McDonald 1994) I developed the thesis that Sydney Basin engravings were used to establish group identity acting as a bonding force, while the region's shelter art provided opportunity for an expression of individual or localised emblemic variability, providing a mechanism for group-bounding behaviour. It has been argued, on the basis of ethnographic anal- ogy and comparison with bora ceremonies and earth sculpture from along the south-eastern coast of Australia, that the engraving sites in Sydney fulfilled a ritual func- tion (Elkin 1949, McCarthy 1956, 1959), despite the absence of supporting ethnohistoric evidence from the Sydney region for such a function (eg. Collins 1798; Mathews 1897). While disagreeing with the manner and intent of this earlier interpretation, it is nevertheless con- sidered that engraving sites appear to have fulfilled a regional bonding function and thus provided the opportu- nity for large scale group cohesion. This may in part have been achieved by 'ritual function'. Open engraving sites are mostly on ridgelines, away from the economic resource areas and often on access routes around the region, ie. not in the centre of any partic- ular group's foraging territory (see also Layton 1989, 1992b). There is ethnohistoric evidence in the Sydney region for gender exclusivity and inter-group participation in some ceremonies, particularly for the Yoo-lang and the Burbung, where tooth avulsion was recorded as part of male initiation (Collins 1798; Mathews 1897, Mathews &amp; Everitt 1900). If any particular group, ie. men or women, used these sites for ceremonial purposes, it would be expected that they would be viewed by a more limited sec- tions of the population. The audience would have been restricted, not public. Given the precepts of information exchange, it would be expected that stylistic patterning with this art form should be clinal within and between social units. Given that open engraving sites are also often on access routes, it is possible that generic social group identity messaging was further reinforced in these loca- tions. Such a usage would contribute to a further 'blurring' of boundary information in this component. In contrast, the shelter art sites are mostly within val- ley systems. Their concomitant evidence for occupation makes them demonstrably also living sites. It could be expected that all members of a local territorial group (men, women and children) used these shelters. Given this wider audience and therefore more public social context, the shelter art would be the most likely to reveal social group-specific stylistic form. It is also considered that in this art component - largely domestic and there- fore probably more casual - the expression of individ- ual identity would be most likely to reside. Local territo- 2. It is also assumed that they were produced contemporane- ously (McDonald 1998, Rosenfeld &amp; Smith 1997). 148</page><page sequence="5">Figure 2: Histograms showing percentage frequency of engraved motifs compared with percentage frequency of sites upon which particular motifs were engraved. rial groups operating in their own territories are least likely to be communicating a politically motivated need for larger scale group cohesion. Wiessner's individual identity is most likely to function in this context. Thus individual traits would be reflecting the territorial range of the local group. The art in this context, while not nec- essarily defining the locations of boundaries per se, con- tains the best potential for stylistic bounding informa- tion. Analysis supports these predictions. The stylistic messaging of this art is discontinuous and discretely clumped. Having demonstrated, using broad-scaled patterning, a relatively conservative thematic use of engravings across the region, effort was directed to explicating variability within this art component at the local-group level. At attempting to describe design elements within the overall themes which appear to have regional congruence. Because of the assumptions relating to social context (ie. public vs private), this medium was considered the more appropriate to identify localised stylistic traits which could be explained as ethnic (ie. local group), not indi- vidual (viz. Clegg 1977, re factors affecting stylistic vari- ation - 'personality' vs 'culture'). Again, Wiessner's (1990) model for identity emphasis and stylistic mes- sages demonstrating different levels of social interaction were primary in forming these assumptions. Rare Motifs The analyses of engraving sites at the regional level demonstrated that there was thematic congruence across Sydney. A fairly limited number of (largely) figurative motifs have been used, and the combinations of these would appear to be relatively homogenous. The Correspondence Analysis (CA) used looked for patterns in the presence and combination of motifs. Stylistic vari- ability was discerned, although this was largely clinal in nature. In an effort to elucidate localised stylistic traits, to determine thematic foci within and between language areas, the distribution of rare and/or unique engraved motifs was analysed. Analysis concentrated on motifs it could be argued carried no economic value (such as food resources) in an effort to demonstrate cultural, and not environmental, influences (see McMah 1965). Identification of rare motifs was based on the number of times that any individual motif occurred at an engrav- ing site in the region (Table 1). The motif which is found at most sites in the region is the emu (41%) followed by fish and macropods, men and other land animals. These figures do not generally replicate the overall percentage figures for motifs generally - ie. emus are not the most frequently depicted motif in the region (Figure 2).

Significance values for rare motifs in the five language areas. commonly depicted motif in the region) were only pre- sent on about 21% of the sites. This result demonstrates that some sites contain a more restricted motif foci (ie. some motifs are concentrated on few sites), while certain motifs are widely dispersed (relatively few/single motifs are placed on many sites). It is considered that this fea- ture indicates much about design themes in the region or bedrock notions (a la Sackett). This analysis focussed on several of the concentrated rare motifs, ie. those which are relatively rare and which occur on few sites. It also examined one motif, shields, which is relatively rare (0.7% of all engravings) but highly dispersed (found on 14% of sites). The distribution of these motifs was plotted and sev- eral examples are demonstrated here (Figure 3). The per- centages of sites with each motif type were calculated per language area (Table 2). These figures were com- pared with the overall percentage figures for each lan- guage area so that relative significance could be deter- mined. In order to test the statistical significance of these differences, an approximate randomisation method (Shennan 1988, Wright 1992) was also used on the fig- ures presented in Table 2. If we take a probability level of 0.05 as statistically significant, we can interpret the differences in the art between certain language areas as being significant (Table 3). The differences and similari- ties between the Guringai and Darkingung groups are not statistically significant. However, the differences (and similarities) between the Guringai sites and the Darug and Tharawal sites are more marked. It is notable that in the Tharawal and Eora areas, there is generally a smaller sample size - and that the rarer motifs (both relatively and in terms of dispersion) are mostly absent from these two language areas. It has been argued (McDonald 1994) that the differences between these central and south-eastern assemblages are cultural. It would appear that the language groups south of the Georges River (and see McMah 1965) may not have been part of the social network which used engravings to main- tain regional social information, and which was flourish- ing when the First Fleet arrived. The absent motifs on the distribution maps shown here is a real absence. This more detailed analysis confirmed some of the differences revealed by the broader analyses done across the region. Certain design themes which had been demonstrated were more explicitly identified by this process. For instance, • in the Darkingung area there is a significantly higher proportion of profile figures and roo tracks and a sig- nificantly lower proportion of shields and axes; • in the Guringai area, shields and axes occur in signifi- cantly higher proportions, while there are significantly fewer profile people, roo tracks and complex-non-fig- urative motifs; • in the Darug area, there is a significantly higher than expected number of profile people and complex-non- figurative motifs. Contact motifs and hands also figure quite highly; • in the Tharawal area, there are significantly lower pro- portions of women, snakes, shields and axes. 151</page><page sequence="8">Ό ΌΦΘΦΘΘ Α Β Cd Ε F G 2Bi 2Ci 2F Figure 4: Range of shield designs present in the regional engraved assemblage. These results confirm the localised thematic character of the engraving assemblage in different areas of the Basin. The distributions of these sites also suggest some interesting subject foci. The apparent focus of certain motifs was considered to have implications in terms of aggregational contact (following Conkey 1980) between these language groups (and see Gait-Smith 1997). Compositional Details An analysis of motif composition was undertaken to explore further cultural and/or stylistic choices across the region (Sackett 1990). This analysis is done selectively, choosing motifs for which no environmental influence could be adduced: shields and culture heroes. Shields Previous archaeological analyses of shield designs have demonstrated stylistic patterning explicable in terms of trade, overall alliance systems and individual and group affiliation (Dickens 1992, Hatte 1992; and see Morwood 1987). Local ethnohistoric evidence also suggested that the analysis of this motif type may provide ethnically- sensitive patterning. Various early commentators indi- cated that the coastal peoples from around Sydney and further north carried distinctively patterned shields (Bellinghausen and Rossiyisky in Barratt 1981; Enright 1901, Threlkeld in Gunson 1974). The geographic distri- bution of particular shield designs may therefore shed light on the interrelatedness of contacts across the Sydney Basin. Threlkeld described most comprehensively the con- struction of the region's wooden shields, from around the Lake Macquarie area (Awabakal/Guringai language areas): three feet long by eighteen inches . . . lozenge shaped, pointed at top and bottom, and pigeon breasted rather than flat. ... The shields are always painted with white pipeclay and are generally ornamented with a St George's Cross, formed by two bands two or three inches wide, one vertical the other horizontal, coloured red ... [Gunson 1974:68]. Rossiyisky describes the wooden shields from the Sydney area very similarly, although notes that "they are daubed with various red and white figures" [(In) Barratt 1981:23, emphasis mine]. Bellinghausen's description confirms the colour usage as "dry white colouring sub- stance over which was painted red stripes" (In Barratt 1981:41; and see Enright 1901; Cave in Brayshaw 1986). As little design detail was provided by ethnohistoric accounts, the engraved assemblage of shields was inspected to determine the extent of design variety.3 This revealed considerable divergence from Threlkeld's description, within a relatively simple regionally specific (cf. Hatte 1992: Figure 3) design theme. Twenty-six design categories (including undecorated) were identi- fied (Figure 4). The designs consist of variations on the horizontal and vertical line theme. The only distinctive design element is the presence and/or absence of dia- mond shaped elements at either or both of the shield's pointed end(s). There are several unique examples which are variations on other designs (eg. 2Bi and 2Ci). These may be representations of shields which have been punc- tured by many spears (see Megaw 1993). While engraved shields are relatively rare (232 - 3% overall), they are fairly widely dispersed (at 103 sites; 14%). There are a few sites which have concentrations of this motif type. Most sites, however, have one or two shields (av. = 2 shields/site). These motifs are usually found on larger sites (average assemblage size = 22 motifs/site). The shield from one site was excluded from this analysis on the basis that the motif was incomplete. The sample for this analysis then was 102 sites. The geographic focus for shields is in the Guringai language area (85%). Darkingung has the next highest number of shields (11%) followed by Darug (3%) and Tharawal (1%). There are no engraved shields in the 3. It is assumed that these motifs are iconic representations, with their designs reflecting culturally important decorative information. 152</page><page sequence="9">'¿7 $0 Figure 5: An engraving site in the Guringai language area with 15 shield motifs (of seven design types) and three boomerangs.

The two sites with many shield motifs are separated by considerable distance. One is north of the Hawkesbury River (in the Mangrove Creek drainage basin, Darkingung language area), the other is at Mosman (Middle Harbour drainage basin; Guringai lan- guage area: Figure 5). The former consists entirely of design varieties 1, 2B and 2c. The latter has a total of seven design types (2C, 4A, 4D, 4E, 4F, 5B and 5E) all but one of these having the diamond point decorations at one or both ends.4 The investigation commenced by analysing sites with only a single design type present. It was thought this pro- cedure would facilitate clear focus on localised pattern- ing in the design elements, unconfused by synchronie 'noise'. Ethnohistorical records suggest that the 'St George cross' form (ie design type 2B) would be the most common and most widely distributed. This, how- ever, was not the case. The analysis revealed that the focus for the St George cross design was quite restricted. With the exception of one Darkingung site located west of Mangrove Creek, this design was confined to the Cowan, Pittwater and (particularly) Middle Harbour drainage basins: all in the Guringai language area (Figure 6). Four major design themes were identified and these accounted for 62% of the sites with shields (Table 4). Plain shields, as might be expected, are ubiquitous. They are present on both sides of the Hawkesbury River in the Guringai language area, as well as in Darkingung, Darug and Tharawal sites. The double (horizontal) cross design (2C) is the most commonly engraved in the region. It occurs at 28 sites (in isolation) as well as at another 13 sites in combina- tion with a variety of design forms. It occurs in Guringai, Darkingung and Darug areas. The design element with diamonds at either end of the shield has a very restricted distribution. The 11 sites with this form of design element (in isolation) occur only in the Guringai area, in the Cowan and Middle Harbour drainage basins. The two forms which thus appeared to have the most potential for indicating inter- and intra-language design contact were the St George (2B) variety and the dia- mond-end varieties (numbers 4 and 5), which are both restricted predominantly to the Guringai area. The distri- bution of these design elements in sites with combination shield designs was next analysed, but was found to have an equally restricted distribution (Table 5). More than 90% of these sites were in the Guringai area, with the 4. An this may be because the recording is such a small-scale. 154</page><page sequence="11">/ Macdonald River S^^ ' / / |_ C Mangrove Ck ' s 1 'l J / ι ' /7/ 0 S) 20km / l™,, ^íp (° V δΔ ; /Extent of Sydney ^&gt; ^^'/'/'^-. /' r I engraving sites C.

Distribution of Biaimi and Daramulan type motifs. Cowan and Middle Harbour drainage basins containing 68% of these sites. The conclusion which can be reached about shield designs in the region is that they exhibit highly localised characteristics. The Guringai language area has the largest number of shields in the region and contains the greatest degree of design variability. It has also been demonstrated that there are localised design traits within this area - which are not found elsewhere in the region. Cowan and Middle Harbour drainage basins contain high frequencies of shields; the design focus for both the dia- mond infill and double-cross (type 2C) appears to be shared by these drainage basins. The ethnohistoric literature on this point has been shown to be highly inadequate, with regard to both the design variability present and the distribution of the design which was considered to be the most widespread. Designs which were generally described as being used by 'coastal' peoples between Sydney and Newcastle were largely restricted to the coast between Broken Bay and Port Jackson. Either there was a severe constriction in the designs 155</page><page sequence="12">Area Drainage Basin Daramulan % Biaimi % Total % Darkingung Upper McDonald River 1 100 1 2.8 Darkingung Central McDonald River 4 100 4 11.1 Darkingung Mangrove Creek 1 100 1 2.8 Darug Cattai Creek 1 100 1 2.8 Darug Berowra Creek 1 50 1 50 2 5.6 Guringai Mooney Mooney Creek 1 50 1 50 2 5.6 Guringai Brisbane Waters 3 75 1 25 4 11.1 Guringai Berowra Creek 3 60 2 40 5 13.9 Guringai Cowan Creek 5 31.3 10* 62.5 16 44.4 Totals 14 (38.9) 21 (58.3) 36 100.1 Table 6: Engraved culture heroes.

If the first explanation is correct, it is possible that the ethnohistoric 'present' has little applicability to the prehistoric past, particularly in terms of ethnically signifi- cant designs. The latter seems the more likely explanation, with early illustrations (eg. Cave in Brayshaw 1986) demonstrating a wider design variety than was described in the various sources in words (eg. Barrati 1981, Gunson 1974). It would appear that this is another example of the inadequacies of early European observation regarding the richness of Aboriginal culture in the region. Culture Heroes A total of merely 36 culture heroes is present at 29 sites across the region (Figure 7). Despite the potentially unwarranted cultural significance that this motif label connotes (eg. McCarthy 1961, 1965), I have used the term 'culture hero' because this class of motifs is so extraordinary within the Sydney region. As the remain- der of the motif classification used assumes this art to consist of iconic representation, to call these figures something less spectacular seems churlish. There are two main forms of culture hero: those either partially or fully in profile ('Daramulan' type) and those which are front- on, limbs akimbo ('Biaimi' type). These have been named following McCarthy's (1959; and see Clegg 1981) nomenclature, although the original interpretation (sensu strictu) is not adopted. These have been individu- ally described, for type, features, dimensions and design details (McDonald 1994: Table 8.10). This motif is differentiated from ordinary anthropo- morphs (be they male, female or non-gendered human fig- ures) on the basis of its extreme size and by the degree and complexity of infilled decoration. The mean length of this motif is 5.2m (standard deviation 1.4m) more than four times larger (on average) than 'ordinary' anthropomorphs. While many anthropomorphic figures in the region con- tain infilling and are often accompanied by items of mate- rial culture (headdresses, waist-belts arm and leg bands, and so on), the internal decoration of culture heroes is often extreme (see illustrations). Some versions of this motif are therianthropic - involving part human and ani- mal features (Lewis-Williams 1982, Flood 1987, Tacon 1989), particularly bird's and/or snake's heads. This motif form shows an interesting feature which suggests its cultural importance - its continued use over time. More than half of these motifs have evidence for more than one episode of engraving. Many have added features or altered outlines. The Daramulan type appears particularly susceptible to change, with many having a second leg added (changing the perspective from profile to plan), and sometimes an arm or extra penis (Figure 8). Culture heroes occur within a range of assemblage sizes (the average size of sites with this motif present is 25.4 motifs/site). Some sites with culture heroes are extremely large (97 motifs), but four have only two motifs while one has only a solitary culture hero present. The average dis- tance to drinking water from sites with these motifs is c.500m (average for engraving sites generally). Culture heroes are restricted to the Guringai (75%), Darug (8.3%) and Darkingung (16.7%) language areas. The main focus is in the Guringai area where most (44.4%) are located in the Cowan drainage basin (Table 6). Their distribution, while similar, is wider than for engraved shields (cf. Tables 4 and 6). Most culture heroes occur individually at sites, but they are frequently paired. Some of these pairings are clearly male/female; others are male/male. Some sites include paired and/or transitional Daramulan and Biaimi types (Figure 9). 156</page><page sequence="13">/ tá? Figure 8: Engraved Culture Heroes.

Bottom: after McDonald 1986: Figures 3 and 8. NB Daramulan on the latter site also has an altered outline. The Daramulan type is focussed (86%) in the Guringai area, while the distribution of the Biaimi form is more widespread (although still 67% in Guringai). The two Daramulan-type culture heroes located outside the Guringai area occur on major engraving sites (Devil's Rock Maroota, Flat Rocks Ridge) in places which it could be argued are aggregation locales (Conkey 1980) or at least in locations (eg. on access routes) where group cohesion is being demonstrated. The highly focussed distribution of both types of culture hero in the Guringai area, with relatively few examples in adjoining (north and westerly) language areas, suggests a degree of design contact among these three language areas. It also is suggestive of this significant design theme (signif- icant in terms of rarity, size and repeated use over time) stemming from the Guringai language area Conclusions We know little about the extent or nature of social net- works in the Sydney region prior to the white incursion, and nor do we understand the role of rock art in the 157</page><page sequence="14">adaptive strategies of this hunter-gatherer society. Analysis of the rock art assemblages here, however, have demonstrated stylistic patterning which can be explained in terms of past networks of communication (Rosenfeld 1997). Broad-scaled analyses have shown that across the Sydney region the engraved component exhibits clinal stylistic variability (McDonald 1994), with patterning being explicable in terms of language boundaries. There is only one distinctive boundary in the region, this con- firming a previously identified style boundary to the south of the Basin (McMah 1965). While broad stylistic patterning can be explained in terms of the defined lan- guage areas, within these areas, there is localised vari- ability. This has been explored on the basis of drainage basins - the scale considered appropriate to localised social (ie residential) groups. Analysis has demonstrated a complex network of styl- istic variability as defined by engraved motif preference across the region. There are, however design themes, taken here as repeated combinations of motifs, which can be described in terms of Sackett's isochrestic model. It would appear that bedrock notions can be discerned around the region and that both broad regional similari- ties as well as localised peculiarities are present. The engraving sites within (particularly) the Guringai and Darkingung language areas, show varying degrees of stylistic variability and levels of internal cohesion. The analysis of rare motifs confirmed the localised character of the engraving assemblage in different parts of the Basin. The distributions of sites with rare motifs also suggested some interesting intergroup social con- tact. Engraving sites with culture heroes are focussed in the western part of the Guringai territory - with a design link, and presumably social connection, with the Darkingung peoples. This result supported the broader analyses whereby relative stylistic homogeneity was identified between these two language areas. An analysis of compositional detail on rare engraved motifs further refined our understanding of design con- tact between the Guringai area, and the Darkingung and Darug language areas. Design variability on shield motifs was found to be extraordinarily diverse in the Guringai area, with both less motifs and a marked decrease in design options being practised outside this language area. In terms of Sackett's isochrestic model, the Guringai artisans knew of a variety of equivalent stylistic alternatives for shield designs and practised these: while the Darkingung and Darug artists would appear to have been aware of only a few of these design options, and chose to depict only these. 'The choices they make are largely dictated by the technological traditions within which they have been enculturated as members of the social groups which delineate their ethnicity" (Sackett 1990:33) The stylistic impetus or the design direction of this social contact would appear to stem from within the Guringai language area - both larger numbers of rare motifs are located here and design patterning is more varied. It is tempting to surmise that social influence is the source of this stylistic predominance. There are eth- nohistoric observations that the Cammeraygal 'tribe' from the north shore (a Guringai dialect) was observed to be 'the largest and strongest group by the influence of their numbers and muscular appearance', and, 'there is no doubt of their decided superiority over all tribes with whom we are acquainted' (Collins 1798[1975]:453). This research has indicated that different levels of analysis can provide greater insights in an archaeological investigation of regional stylistic patterning. A broad- scaled regional perspective and a coarser-grained approach can demonstrate patterns which inform us about social cohesion, and bedrock notions. A more fine- grained approach, exploring intergroup patterning identi- fies isochrestic choices being made by local groups and affiliations between these. By exploring regional pattern- ing at a variety of integrated scales we can understand better the processes and complexities of a regional rock art network, and come closer to identifying networks of communication.
