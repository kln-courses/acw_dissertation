WILLIAMS1 GROWTH OF THE BEVAIA TRADE The Lakatoi, DEADERS of the Melanesians of British New Guinea will be *^ familiar with the lakatoi. Their expedition, or hiri, which Captain Barton described in a chapter of Dr. Seligmann's book,2 is the most important event in the social life of the Motu, and one is glad to say that each year sees its repetition. The Motu live in what is known as the " dry belt " of Papua. It is a hard country with scanty rainfall. But the women are potters, and the men are sailors ; and each year the lakatoi set forth on a voyage of some two hundred miles, bearing a cargo of pots which are to be traded for sago. The outward voyage takes place usually in September, at the end of the south-east trade wind season. The return should be made towards the end of the north-west monsoon season, i.e. before April, when the lakatoi, greatly enlarged by the addition of new dugouts, bring home many tons of sago to tide over the period of scarcity. The lakatoi, a unique vessel, which is really a large raft of dugout canoes, and which carries the famous crab-claw sail, has been fully described in Captain Barton's chapter. There also will be found an account of the organization among the principals, the stages of construction, the sailing, the sojourn in the west, and finally the return, together with the attendant magical and ceremonial usages. I do not propose to spend time over these ; readers must refer to the original source if they wish to make a detailed comparison with the subject of the present paper. This subject is the trading voyages in the contrary direction, from west to east ; and I shall confine myself mainly to the trade Government Anthropologist, Territory of Papua. 2C. G.

Most of my information comes from Orokolo, Arihava and Vailala, i.e. from the villages of the so-called Elema people. The first part of the paper will deal with the rise and development of this trade, as illustrating the voluntary adoption of an important custom from a neighbouring people. The second and third parts will deal with the magic associated with the trading voyage and its relation to myth. Early Trading Voyages. The Gulf natives are no sailors by tradition. They use mainly small outrigger canoes along the coast, and double canoes in Kerema Bay and the delta of the Tauri-Lakekamu.8 But from long ago, it would seem, they have been in the habit of building large double canoes for trading voyages along the coast. From the Toaripi group, at the eastern end of the Gulf coast, these vessels plied in both directions, and there is the authority of Holmes and Romilly for saying that they used to visit the Motu.4 From Orokolo, however y and the other villages at the western end of the Gulf coast, it seems that they travelled mainly toward the east : they commonly went as far as the Toaripi at the Lakekamu mouth, and sometimes even beyond Yule Island. These large double canoes were and are called haruka-iroki, and the trading expedition, hahi. The trade, however, was not comparable to that of the modern hiri. They carried mainly bows and arrows and native-grown tobacco, and exchanged these for shell ornaments rather than pots. The canoes were built large and strong, not with the idea of accommodating a bulky cargo, but in order to withstand what was for the Gulf natives a specially long and dangerous journey. It is only within comparatively recent years that these natives have taken to exporting sago, and accordingly the trading vessel has altered in character. It has in fact become, under a different name, no other than the lakatoi. 3Very large outrigger canoes are used between Kerema and the Lakekamu for fishing with seine nets. 4Melanesians of British New Guinem, 118 sq.</page><page sequence="3">TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA 141 From Double Canoe to B evaia. It is interesting from the technological point of view to follow the intermediate changes. We have first the original haruka-iroki, with paddles as the regular means of propulsion, and mats used as temporary sails. Then owing to the example of the Mission whale- boat we have the para-iroki (Motu bala=oai). Craft of this kind are still commonly in use, and have been adopted by the traders for loading cargo. Next comes the use of a permanent mast (auvia) and sail {yard). And then, as an approximation to the lakatoi model, a double canoe, masted and fitted with bulwarks, piri (Motu biri= nipa leaf), and deck houses, uvi, but still adapted for oars as well. I saw two vessels of this type while in the Gulf Division this year. Finally, we come to the out-and-out lakatoi, or what is technically a pretty exact copy of it. This imitation lakatoi is called bevaia. I do not know what the word signifies, but it is the traditional name for the vessels which the Gulf natives used to sight every year when the Motu, or as they were called, the Derai-Haera, arrived about September. It is often smaller : I saw none with more than three dugouts, whereas the Motuan lakatoi often sail with four or five6 ; and in many cases as yet it is not so well put together. The names of the parts differ, the Gulf natives apparently retaining many of those that they formerly used in the construction of their own haruka-iroki ; but the lakatoi pattern is followed very closely, even to the ornamental finish of the cane lashings. There are, however, some significant differences in the prepara- tions for and conduct of the expedition. I cannot find that there is any ceremonious manner of making public a man's intention of organizing an expedition and securing collaborators ; nor is there any organization to compare with that of baditauna, doritauna, udiha, " mast captain " and " sail captain," such as we see on the Motu lakatoi. The spectacular trials in which the village girls dance on the fore platforms of the Motu lakatoi are not seen in the Gulf bevaia ; but on the other hand married women, who are not permitted 5The Motu lakatoi are reconstructed in the Gulf or Delta and return with as many as ten or twelve dugouts.</page><page sequence="4">142 TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA on the lakatoi, often travel as passengers. The magic, which will be our main concern here, is in some respects similar, or superficially so ; but it is expressly denied that the bevaia magic, or maho, is derived from Motuan sources ; indeed informants have said that they would be afraid to dabble with foreign magic. It is probably true that in all essentials the magic used for the fully-fledged bevaia is the same as the early voyagers used for the haruka-iroki. Recent Expansion. Within the last few years there has been a rapid expansion of bevaia enterprise at the western end of the Gulf coast. The large village of Vailala, situated at the mouth of the Vailala River, claims to have been making bevaia for the last ten years and more, but I doubt whether they have ever previously reached the pitch of enthusiasm which has caused them in this last season (i.e., the end of 1931 and the beginning of 1932) to send out twelve bevaia and one large haruka-iroki. Beyond Vailala the first experiments were made only in the previous season, 1930-31, when three were equipped. But during last season, while I was in the neighbourhood, three were fitted out at Orokolo and four at the neighbouring village of Arihava. The reason the native himself gives for adopting the lakatoi model is that it saves time and labour. It is in fact questionable whether it does either, since he takes such an unconscionable time in the building of his bevaia. What he means is that, once away, he does not have to labour at the oar or the paddle. He can sit back and watch the wind do all the work. It is not surprising that despite proverbial conservatism he should come to copy technical improvements when he sees examples so constantly before him ; what does surprise, perhaps, is that he should have hesitated so long, and that having once made up his mind to build bevaia he should have begun building them with such a rush. There are two fairly obvious reasons. One is that of the tax. This may drive him afield to seek money, and it should be noted that the purpose of the hahi expedition is not so much to collect pots (the lakatoi from the east bring enough of them) as to seek shell ornaments, trade goods and money. The other reason is</page><page sequence="5">TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA 143 found in the after effects of the Vailala Madness, that startling religious movement which, temporarily in some parts, and (it may be) permanently in others, involved the destruction of the cere- monies. This reason applies especially to Vailala itself, which remains strangely obdurate against a revival of the old customs, though the surrounding villages have been gradually taking them up again. A number of informants at Vailala spoke with enthusiasm of the present state of affairs. Formerly they were always busy in preparation for some ceremony or festival ; now they have ample time for enterprises of a more profitable nature - at least com- mercially. As one man literally put it, it was their " one thought " nowadays to make money. Others did not lay so much stress on the money as on the actual bevuta. Previously they were per aia, " glad " with hevehe, kovave, and so on (i.e. the really fine mask ceremonies of the Gulf) ; now they were per aia with their bevaia. And it is a truly surprising thing to see this thriving village con- tinually at work in shaping the enormous dugouts, in lashing them together, in building the superstructures, and in rigging the masts, all with meticulous attention to detail, or engaged in the making of sago, collecting betel, or the manufacture of dyed sago-leaf skirts for cargo. Nowadays, indeed, Vailala is more a port of native trade than any Motu village. Its inhabitants have discovered, unassisted, a substitute for the interest of the old ceremonies : they are quite mad on bevaia. Setbacks and their Causes. But as we have observed the Gulf natives have no real tradition of seamanship. They are still learning the trade ; and so far they are making heavy work of it. Their frequent failures have been due in part to ill construction. Whereas the Motu have had genera- tions of practice, the Gulf natives are new to the game. Not infrequently one may see the Motu visitors helping in or even super- vising the construction of a bevaia ; but the independent product may lack the finish in lashing and caulking which in such a craft is essential to seaworthiness. A second cause of ill-success is sheer overloading. Even the experienced Motu sailors are sometimes guilty of this mistake ; but among the local experimenters it seems</page><page sequence="6">144 TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA almost invariable. One after another of those bevaia that I saw settled down at its moorings after the loading ; some did so more than once. And when it appears loaded to the very limit an enthusiastic and too numerous crew swarms aboard, completely regardless of human avoirdupois. One party deliberately left behind their stone anchor ; they actually sailed anchorless rather than jettison a few bundles of sago or expel any of a crew of thirty- six. A third and more potent reason is that of delaying the start overlong. By April the winds are uncertain, and a south-east wind may spring up. But again and again, despite a full recognition of the danger, native dilatoriness has been responsible for disaster. Even if it sails in good time, however, when the weather is usually calm, the bevaia may be overtaken by the tremendous north- west squalls that sometimes descend by night. Altogether the expedition is attended by many risks ; and these combined with the sheer inexperience of the sailors have brought about a regular train of disasters, so that we may well be astonished at the perseverance of this new school of merchant adventurers. Vailala has apparently gained its experience. Of the seven bevaia that had sailed from Vailala before April last season, only two came to grief : one of them was wrecked on the Vailala bar ; of the other the crew and passengers were rescued at night by the Government yacht in a gale off Port Moresby, the bevaia being abandoned. But of the seven which were fitted out at so much pains in Orokolo and Arihava only one got away successfully, and I cannot say whether she ever completed her voyage ; three sank at their moorings and never sailed ; two were driven ashore and broken, and the seventh was abandoned at sea on the very day of her sailing. BEVAIA MAGIC The Sea Hevehe. Over and above the natural terrors of the sea there is one which is definitely regarded by the native as personal and, one may say, supernatural. It is that of the sea hevehe* Here we reach an *Hevehe is the pronunciation of the western end of the Gulf Division of the more familiar sevese.</page><page sequence="7">TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA 145 important religious belief, to which in the present paper I can only refer briefly. As against the apa hevehe or drum hevehe which appears in the magnificent mask ceremony, and the beuta hevehe, i.e. ground hevehe or bullroarers, there are the ma hevehe or sea hevehe. They are sometimes called hevehe-havahu or real hevehe because they enter into the complex of the drum hevehe ceremony, the latter being of course only masks or representations, whereas the former are supposed really to exist in the sea. They are identified usually with enormous fishes ; not species, but individuals of limited number. Some few are identified with submerged rocks, floating logs, and so on. They have personal names and haunt different parts of the coast or the rivers. They are sometimes alleged to be seen near or above the surface, and it is said that they may rise to drag down a canoe. Many canoes and even cutters have been destroyed in this way on the Aivei bar. The last of the previously mentioned losses is worth pausing over in this connection. After long preparations the bevaia, of which two men, Arepe and Tahia, were the bevaia haera, or principals, made a good start in the morning from Orokolo. There was very little wind and by late afternoon they had gone no further than Koialahu, just past the Vailala mouth, where they anchored. Although a light breeze now sprang up from the south the bevaia was apparently quite safe at anchor for the night ; but Arepe and Tahia, after some argument among the crew, decided that she should put back to the Vailala for shelter. Such decisions are not necessarily made by the bevaia haera, though in this case the blame was subse- quently laid on them. Incidentally, on entering the river she happened to strike a floating log, but without suffering any actual harm. Now, however, a changing tide prevailed against the wind, and she was borne some distance out to sea. The fact that she was actually moving against the wind seems to have baffled the sailors. Someone started the alarm that she had encountered a hevehe in the shape of the floating log and was being carried off. It was told how the bevaia jolted backwards and forwards unaccountably, so that the men almost lost their balance. Coconuts and betel were thrown overboard in the traditional way as an offering or bribe to the hevehe ; but it was observed with horror that, instead of dispers-</page><page sequence="8">146 TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA ing, the floating nuts kept clustered about the vessel - a sure sign that a sea hevehe had it in its power. Darkness was falling and some water was coming in, as to some extent it always does ; but, convinced that they were supernaturally overtaken, the crew abandoned bailing. They climbed on to the deck houses and up the rigging, where torches were waved and conch shells blown, until village canoes and the Mission whale-boat put out to the rescue of the terrified mariners. Then the new bevuta, a comparatively sound one, was abandoned with a full load ; and next morning at Orokolo we watched her drifting past under her crab-claw sail towards the Purari Delta. She subsequently became a total wreck with the loss of all her cargo. One or two canoes had ventured out to her as she passed, but no one had dared go aboard, for the coconuts and betel still clung around, and the water in her vicinity was seen to be bubbling and boiling. An Orokolo man, recently returned from a visit to the Delta, had brought a report that certain fisherman had seen the hevehe Laurei Mairau, a mythical individual half snake and half man, bearing towards the east ; and it was now generally believed that it was he who had seized the bevuta. The B evaia H aera. So far I have dealt mainly with the practical side of the hahi expedition ; but we have seen that the sailor thinks he has obstacles to contend with which demand more than merely practical measures. Indeed, the whole success of the expedition is conditioned by the use of the appropriate magic. I do not mean to imply that the sailor discounts the practical aspects of his task. He is quite ready with explanations in material terms to account for disasters : it may be a case of faulty lashing, or of the use of an old dugout which would not stand the strain of the heavy seas. And while he believes that magical control of the winds is to some extent possible, he nevertheless accepts them as part of nature against which one does not contend out of season. Just as the rain and thunder maker does not perform his magic in the fair weather of the north-west, so the wind magician</page><page sequence="9">TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA 147 does not attempt to lay the winds for the bevaia at the height of the south-east.7 The magic or tnaho for the bevaia belongs to the man whom I have already referred to as the principal or bevaia haera, i.e. simply the bevaia man.8 He it is who initiates and organizes the expedition of the particular bevaia ; and he would not think of undertaking such a task unless he were in possession of the necessary maho. The bevaia haera of the Gulf corresponds fairly closely to the baditauna of the Motu lakatoi. Not infrequently two principals will join in fitting out a single bevaia (in one case that I observed there were three) ; and each of these individuals is referred to as bevaia haera. The bevaia haera will bear his part in the work of building together with the other men who have agreed to make the voyage. When it is complete each will put on his load of sago, which he has made, probably with the assistance of his wife, in that part of the vessel which has been allotted him by general agreement. The trading away of this sago (and the other commodities such as grass skirts, bows and arrows, etc.) is an individual matter : there is no attempt at organizing the sales or allotting the profits, and the bevaia haera does not receive any recompense from the members of the crew for his responsibility and expert knowledge. That expert knowledge, as we have seen, is of magic. The bevaia haera is not necessarily naval architect or captain, though as an experienced voyager he commonly figures as both. His business is to know the magic and carry it out, and thereby to " make the bevaia go fast and escape rough weather." He is responsible for certain observances at various stages from the very beginning of the enterprise, e.g. at felling the tree to make the dugout, at the commencement of lashing, at the commencement 7In the Gulf Division the rainy season is that of the south-east (the Southern Hemisphere winter) and the dry season that of the north-west (summer). In the " dry belt " where the Motu live it is precisely the opposite. 8At Vailala I heard the terms oropa haera and aireke haera (fore man and aft man) which may indicate a tendency toward the organization, baditauna, doritauna, etc., of the Motu. Other terms in use are bevaia oa, literally father of the bevaia ; and iroki-aue-haera, an expression which means canoe-tail-man, and refers to the responsibility for steering with the great oar at the stern. This no doubt harks back to earlier times, for it is nowadays no part of the iroki-aue-haera* s duty to handle the steering oars of a bevaia.</page><page sequence="10">148 TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA of loading, at the final embarkation, and during the voyage. I do not pretend to have anything like a complete account of his actions, but what I have gathered is sufficient to show the general nature of bevuta tnaho. We may begin with the personal tabus which the bevaia haera undergoes, and then follow him in the performance of some of these successive rites. Tabus. He must avoid certain kinds of food : all meat ; all fish, with the exception of piria and avaha ; coconuts ; rice ; and sago cooked with any of the before-mentioned. His ordinary fare is plain boiled sago mahea (rna-ahea, literally, hot water), and bananas, to which may be added the European luxuries of tea, sugar and biscuits. Taro is eaten by some bevaia haera and avoided by others. The reason invariably given for these food tabus is that they ensure lightness in the bevaia haera, and thus indirectly in the bevaia. Whereas among the European foods rice is regarded as heavy, tea, sugar and biscuits are excepted for the express reason that they are light. (The fish piria and avaha, two varieties of mullet, are permitted as food because of their reputation for exceptional speed in the water.) The idea of fasting to ensure lightness is in evidence else- where, e.g. in preparation for the apa hevehe ceremony, when the young men who are to wear the masks submit to similar tabus for a month and more before the final ceremony in order that they may be able to dance well in these enormously top-heavy structures. But although in these connections the object of fasting is claimed to be lightness, it would appear elsewhere to be a preliminary condition for magical performance at large, where lightness is not always particularly in point : in sorcery and weather magic, for instance. Thus one rain and thunder maker, after revealing some of his secrets to me, observed that it was a good thing he had eaten that morning, for had he been fasting the things he had told me would have brought on an untimely thunderstorm. Besides fasting, the bevaia haera must abstain from sexual intercourse himself and even from indirect association with it. While the bevaia is building, his food must be cooked by his wife alone, and he must accept it from her hand : another woman would not be</page><page sequence="11">TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA 149 expected to have observed the tabu. The members of the crew at large are not under the same restriction ; but it is claimed that any man who had had intercourse would absent himself from the work of building for a while. The object of this tabu once more is to ensure lightness : it is expressly stated that intercourse would make the bevaia haera heavy, and through him, the bevaia. The same idea is seen in connection with the mask ceremonies. A youth who had to run in a kovave would be sluggish in his movements if he had indulged and if, knowing that he was innocent himself, he found the mask heavy and unwieldy, he would accuse a previous wearer of having broken the tabu. Further evidence of this belief is found in the myths. When Bitawabu, for instance, visits the girl Aviara, he flies from the Aivei to Yule Island in a ruru, i.e. an artificial structure or model, representing a bird. He refuses an invitation to sleep with her, for in the morning he must mount his ruru again and fly home : he fears, as he explains, the heaviness that would result from intercourse. A precisely similar episode occurs in another myth when the youth Iviki wearing a ruru that represents the bird of that name rejects the offer of the girl Boro. His younger brother Kowoko, however, is less cautious ; he yields to the charms of the younger sister, Mavu, and donning his ruru next morning finds that he can rise only to the lower branches of a bread-fruit tree, where he proves an easy mark for the arrow. The bevaia haera is subject to another restriction : he must not wash. For this I have heard no native explanation ; but it is a familiar notion that washing dispels magical power, and it may be connected with the supposed importance of heat in magic which, as I shall now show, is not absent from this culture of the Gulf. The Chewing of Ginger, etc. Besides observing the above-mentioned tabus the bevaia haera must from time to time chew upi and apiapi, two kinds of ginger root, of which he carries a supply in a small woven bag (hivi) about his neck. In addition to these he chews various barks such as meouri (cinnamon) and her evari and paiha (both unidentified). These and others all share the characteristic of heat ; i.e. they are</page><page sequence="12">150 TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA hot to the taste. (I should add that most of the herbs used for this purpose are also strongly scented, which appears to be from the magical viewpoint an equally important characteristic.) One reason given for chewing ginger and these hot barks was to " harden the stomach " of the fasting bevaia haera ; but more usually it is explained that they make him hot, and thus ready for magic-making. In the same way sorcerers chew certain barks and leaves to make themselves hot ; the sap of a creeper, specially " hot, like curry " is applied to the pointing stick ; and prior to one rite of divination the young men chew a plant called paidava with the same stated intention. A magician has explained to me that before commencing operations he gets himself as hot as possible ; puts the leaves of oe, puo and laitohe under his mat ; and then lies down close to the fire. He makes pretence of being ill to give colour to this action, but his real purpose is to make himself hot for magic. Finally it was definitely stated in connection with the secrecy of magic that a man would lose his tnaho ahea (magic heat) if he communicated his private knowledge to others : he would become bevehere (cold) and powerless. Felling the Canoe Tree. The fasting and other tabus, as well as the chewing of ginger, etc., commence with the first episode of the bevaia enterprise, viz. the felling of the chosen canoe-tree. It is for the bevaia haera himself to strike the first blow, and as he does so he spits ginger and paiha on the axe, and mutters, or thinks of, a secret name for the tree and for himself. It is in the use of these names that the essence of tnaho consists and I shall refer to it at greater length presently. I do not believe he ever gives audible utterance to them : informants have constantly said that the magician merely thinks the names, or at most frames the words under his breath. It is certain that he would not utter them aloud, for that would be to make his secret public. Nor can I find that there is any set formula to go through. I have witnessed some of the rites in which magic names were used, but there has never been any noticeable pause, nor have I observed the principal engaged in uttering what could be called a spell. I think it may be said that spells, in so far as they exist, must be of a</page><page sequence="13">TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA 151 very rudimentary nature, and that they are thought rather than spoken. Having struck his few blows at the tree the bevaia haera leaves the work of felling it to the other men ; but before leaving he gathers the chips he has himself struck off, stows them in a bag and keeps them until the voyage of his bevaia is brought to an end. It is explained that he must not leave them lying on the ground to become soggy in the rain, or the hull of his canoe will become equally soggy. Lashing. He has a further rite to perform when the dugouts have been fashioned complete. He in person must begin the work of lashing, and when he ties the first of the series of kwari-haro, or cross-beams by which the dugouts are held together, he binds in a parcel of secret medicines. I was quite unable to get any further information on this subject, though it evidently represents a regular duty of the bevaia haera. When there are two bevaia haera or more, only one of them, it is said, will bind in his medicines, for those of two might not correspond, and then the effect would be to make the bevaia labour or go awry. Loading. While the construction proceeds the bevaia haera sleeps close to or even aboard his vessel, ostensibly to guard it from sorcerers or suspicious characters ; and when after a good many weeks it is completed, he must begin the loading by himself putting aboard the first bundle of sago. Here again he makes use of some secret name or other, according to the maho he possesses. It is some secret synonym for sago connected with the particular myth which underlies his maho. His bundle is decorated with streamers and maybe symbolic ornaments, and is hung up in front of the uvi or deck house in which he spends most of his time on board. By now the canoe is, or should be, completely ready. It is fully rigged and the stays are fluttering with hapa, sago branches with finely frayed leaflets. Ornaments of more significance hang from the rigging, light models of fish, or of pipi the flying fish, or of</page><page sequence="14">152 TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA birds that have some mythical association with the sailing of bevaia such as that of ititi or atatioti, with a pair of decorated betel nuts fastened under its wings. The first bundle has been put aboard by the bevaia haeta at dawn, and thereafter the loading goes on apace. By afternoon all has been stowed away and a feast is in progress.9 The Ivaiva. I am assured that an ivaiva or ceremonial offering is made at this stage. In the only case where I was an actual observer the ivaiva was certainly not made, but I have been told of it often enough to believe that it is a usual practice. It is, at any rate, a common feature of Elema ceremonies. Before certain feasts a half-coconut vessel is filled from the pots of stew, as yet untouched, and passed round the objects (sometimes people) in connection with which the ivaiva and feast are being made. Thus it may be passed round the hevehe or kovave masks, or round the posts of the men's house (etavo). Then it is cast on to the ground and the feast proceeds. In this case, according to various informants, the half-coconut is carried on to the bevaia, passed round the mast and rigging, and then with its contents thrown away in the customary manner. It is very difficult to get at the native theory of this rite. One good informant said that the food was being offered to the spirits of the dead, who would be angry and damn the expedition if they did not receive it. It was never suggested that this was a preliminary act of placation of the sea hevehe, although, as we have seen, they may be placated by offerings of food when they are actually met. I feel fairly convinced that, if the native has any object of placation in mind, it is rather vaguely the bevaia itself. (A similar feast and ivaiva are made at the final dismantling of the bevaia on its return, the object then being more definitely the sail, which is put away in the etavo for safe keeping till the next expedition.) 9In the case where I made definite enquiry the feast was a mutual one between two sections of a small village which had joined in fitting out a bevaia. In the ordinary case it is provided by the bevaia haera and those associated with him in the enterprise to all the outsiders who have helped in the work of building.</page><page sequence="15">TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA 153 Embarkation. While the feast is going forward the bevaia haera and his closer associates, i.e. the joint organizers of the expedition and the steers- men, who are to some extent in his magical confidence, are decorating themselves in the closed eravo. Their mode of decoration itself is determined by the particular maho that is being used. When they are ready the temporary door of the eravo suddenly bursts open and the bevaia haera emerges, perhaps blackened with charcoal and with strips of fresh nipa leaf from neck and limbs. In the case where I was a witness he was accompanied by half a dozen colleagues similarly dressed. All uttered shrill bird cries, " kekekeke - / " waved their arms as if flying, and thus danced down toward the bevaia. The women started wailing - for the real moment of departure was at hand - and all rose to follow. The bevaia being moored close against the river bank the bevaia haera and his associates had simply to leap aboard. Had it been any distance out they would have been hoisted from the shore, for on no account must their " toe-nails get wet " ; and once there they continued their leaping and dancing and blew clouds of chewed ginger and spittle into every part of the vessel. All who are intending to sail crowd aboard after them, save one or two who have to run back to the village on errands of their own. Then it is found that the stock of soft-wood plugs used to stop leaks has been forgotten - someone runs off for these. One old man is shouting that this is a breach of the proper routine ; that once aboard, all should stay aboard for the present. But amid the babel he is disregarded and finally he turns his back abruptly, tosses his hands loosely in the air, and walks off as if he for one did not care what happened to their bevaia. Now the strays have returned, the steersmen cluster at the stern with their great oars, and the bevaia is pushed off. A great cheer is raised, and with her master still frantically dancing and her model birds swaying realistically aloft she moves downstream to anchor for the night against an early start next morning. At the actual getaway the scene is much the same. The bar is crossed on a rising tide ; many have assembled at the river mouth to see her go. There is the bevaia haera - or as he is sometimes called at this stage the bevaia laho (laho= seagull) - dancing with arms</page><page sequence="16">154 TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA outstretched, waving a switch of cassowary plumes and spitting ginger. The younger men push the b evaia out over the shallow bar, the crab-claw sail goes up, and she is away on her doubtful journey. On the Voyage. On the high seas the bevaia ha et a remains very much in charge of his ship, though not necessarily as captain, and certainly not as steersman. He handles no sheets or oars and it is stated as a general rule that he gives no instructions to the crew. It is to the bevaia that he gives instructions : " My child, go fast ; my crew are getting tired." He must never sleep while under way, only at anchor. Opinions were freely expressed by some of the crew that the loss of Arape and Tahia's bevaia recounted above was due to their negligence : they had slept on the shelter of the uvi instead of watching and dancing. One of the functions of the bevaia haera is to raise the favourable winds and to lay the unfavourable. The switch that we saw him waving as his bevaia was crossing the bar is used for this purpose. It sweeps back the south-east wind and beckons the westerlies. How it does so in itself is not explained ; indeed, as a piece of the most elementary and spontaneous kind of magic, this action in the native view calls for no explanation. The same kind of switch is seen frequently in use at large dances, when it may be waved solemnly to and fro, as a party of guests is entering a village ; both guests and hosts use the cassowary switch (hore) in this way, ostensibly to dispel the magic which may emanate from the opposite party. The hore is simply a magician's wand. But apart from these motions the bevaia haera has a far more potent means of controlling the winds. Once again it is in the use of secret names derived from the myths. One man for instance will use those of Oveai and Kairai, another that of Berare Kiwai, or Divea and Lauvea, and so on. My information about these wind- names is very incomplete, but there is a large number of them, and by using more than he should a wind magician (and the bevaia haera is always such to some extent) could cover the sky with clouds and call up a tempest. In fact, the thing could be easily overdone.</page><page sequence="17">TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA 155 I have spoken of the sea hevehe as a source of danger, but it does not seem that the bevaia haera has this danger constantly in mind : his duty is to know how to placate them if they happen to threaten. He should know the names of the individual hevehe and be able to reel them off10 ; for the hevehe, which does not usually show itself, will not respond to the act of conciliation until it hears its own name. The method of dealing with the hevehe may be that of conciliation, when an offering of sago, coconuts and betel is cast into the sea, as we saw in the case of Arape and Tahia's bevaia ; or attempts may be made to scare it off, when the bevaia haera spits chewed ginger and scented bark on to his hands, mixes the spittle with lime, and throws it into the water. The lime will temporarily blind the monster, as it did in one of the myths to which I shall presently refer, and the smell of the barks will drive it away. A regular business of the bevaia haera, however, is to burn his leaves and barks (generally heheva or pairava) on the potsherd vessel within the bevaia. This potsherd (heaia) corresponds to the Motuan keikei and the place of burning, i.e. within the hulls of the dugouts on either side, is the same, yet Elema informants insist that it is an ancient practice and not copied from the Motu ; and a precisely similar procedure is followed on other occasions where there is no question of a Motuan prototype ; e.g. in the fumigation of bows and arrows and of the anthropomorphic plaques, kaiavuru in the er avo 9 preparatory to a pig-hunt. The barks and roots used in both cases are characterized by a strong odour. The cinnamon (tneouri) is often used, and a root called ivuru is a stock ingredient. The latter gives off a sweet and remarkably pungent scent. Different reasons are offered. It has been suggested more than once that this scent enters the water and scares away the hevehe, just as that of the chewed bark thrown into the water, as above- mentioned. Others see in the nature of some of the barks used a property of lightness magically transferred to the bevaia. Thus tneouri, hevoko and ker evari are strangely elusive trees : if a man comes 10The practice of naming the hevehe in succession is seen at one of the final stages of the apa hevehe ceremony, when the remnants of the masks are cast into the sea for the sea, or real, hevehe. »</page><page sequence="18">156 TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA on one of them in the bush and wishes to cut it down he must not leave it in order to fetch his axe. When he returned it would have disappeared. The only thing to do is to stay by the tree and call for someone else to bring the axe. Again, one of the trees mentioned, hevoko, is used by runners in the kovave masks : a fragment of bark on the tongue will bear them along so that their feet hardly touch the ground. But the third reason suggested is the commonest ; fumiga- tion with the strong-smelling smoke of the bark is meant to humour the bevuta, to please or flatter it, or as the equivalent in Motuan (hanatnoa) says literally, to " make it good." This is the explanation offered for the practice of fumigating the weapons before a hunt. The above-mentioned ingredients in the heaia crucible are said to be all common knowledge ; but different bevaia haera have secret ingredients of their own which belong especially to the particular tnaho they are using. Only one man, Epe, whose bevaia was named " Hedi Houvu," even consented to reveal such a secret medicine to me, and the doubt remains in my mind whether he was sincere. It was the large glossy red seed hepahepa, about the size of a florin, which will split or explode in the fire, the two halves flying in different directions. At the sound of each explosion the crew would give their cheer, " Uah ! " and Epe would stamp his foot and say, " Hedi har avara, Houvu hat avara ! " - " Run Hedi, Run Houvu ! " The Return. I will not attempt to follow the bevaia any further in detail on its voyage. If successful it will reach the Motuan villages, dispose of what sago it can at each of them, and on its return voyage collect the price in shell ornaments, trade, or money. When it reaches home it may be welcomed with great enthusiasm by the women, but on the other hand there may be no noticeable demonstration. It is quickly dismantled. The sail is set up in the village to dry out, and then folded up and stowed away in the eravo. This is said to be the occasion of a feast and an ivaiva, the object of which is said to be the sail itself. It is addressed (or nominally so) in such words as these : " Now we wrap you up and send you to the eravo. If the men are strong they will set you up again ; if they are weak, you will stay there/'</page><page sequence="19">TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA 157 MYTH IN RELATION TO BEVAIA MAGIC I have attempted to show that magic of some kind or another accompanies all stages of the construction, equipment, and sailing of the bevuta, and that in some phases rites of placation are in evidence. But so far I have not come to the heart of the magic of the bevaia haera. The Use of Mythical Names. One of the first things that strike us in our dealings with him is his secretiveness : he is reluctant to pass on his magic knowledge lest it lose its power. And we find that even the names of the bevaia themselves are often kept secret. Informants will try to put one off with the stereotyped Motuan names, Oalabada, Kevaubada, etc., of which there are only a few. But it soon transpires that each bevaia is known as one of a much longer series of local names, and that each such name forms part of what might be called a magical complex. Such complexes are theoretically of limited number, but there is a good deal of interfusion and, with some bevaia haera, a tendency to eclecticism, so that the system is not entirely cut-and- dried. Any one complex will be known to a number of men, and anyone who possessed it would be, as far as magical qualifications go, competent to organize a hahi. The magic is commonly passed on from father to son ; but in some cases a man may for personal reasons cut his son off in favour of another ; and at any rate it is rather freely bought and sold. A bevaia haera who has failed with one complex may discard it and buy another for his next venture. The leading feature of each magical complex is the assumption, or application, of certain secret names. These names belong to certain myths. The myths of the Elema are numerous and long- winded. The greater part of each myth is public ; but nearly all of them, I think, contain esoteric passages which have a magical value. These in open narration are always omitted, and one can too often detect by the sidelong glances of an informant and the garbled nature of his story that he has reached and is endeavouring to steer clear of such a passage. The legend or myth is called generally lauu or oharo ; if it contains secret passages of magical s</page><page sequence="20">158 TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA value then it is called maho-oharo ; or it might be more correct to limit this latter name to the actual passages of this kind. The myths are respectively associated in a broad sense with some one or other of the ten totemic clans of the Elema.11 And they tell of the exploits and particularly the wide travels of various individuals in some sense belonging to the clans. Not a few of these myths deal with long voyages with a successful issue, and thus they provide exemplars for the modern voyagers. The names of the bevaia themselves and those used in magic at the successive stages of the whole enterprise are names which appear in these myths. The myths provide magic not only for bevaia, of course, but for all sorts of other undertakings, whether of love, or war, or rain- making, or fishing, or whatever else. The magician must know the relevant parts of the appropriate myths ; above all, he must have at his command the secret and potent names. The generalization, as framed by one informant, stands thus : magic to be effective must employ the names of long-ago people, born in the beginning. I shall give some examples in abbreviated form of the myths that have a bearing on bevaia tnaho. The Myth of Evarapu's Journey to Lavau. Evarapu, a man of the Hurava, or western clan, lives on the Aivei River with his younger brother Iriri. So far he has been unable to win a wife for himself, but one day he receives a visit from two young men, Lere and Pove, in the form of birds ; and these visitors recommend him to try for their sister Aviara, who lives at Lavau, or Yule Island. They volunteer to cany a decorated betel nut from him to the girl as a form of proposal. Evarapu, under instruction from Lere and Pove, now sends his younger brother Iriri as an envoy or go-between ; and to provide for his passage to so distant a part makes him a ruru, or model, of a bird in which to travel. Iriri, in his ruru, after resting at certain places nKaia - sky. Baiu - ? (Aivei Month). Ahea - sea. Auma - Auma Point. Hurava - west. Vailala - River Vailala. Purari - River Purari. Nabo - Nabo Mountains. Miri - beach. Kauri - east.</page><page sequence="21">TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA 159 on the way, finally reaches Aviara, bearing a duplicate message-nut. He rejects her offer to sleep with him as we have already seen, because sexual intercourse would make him heavy and so endanger the success of his return flight (another version of the story, however, has it that he does not wish to usurp the privilege of his elder brother). Having delivered his message and ascertained that the girl is willing to marry Evarapu, he returns, carrying a small load of taitu and earthenware pots in his turn, to prove that he has actually been to Lavau. He has informed Aviara that she will eventually be called for in a large canoe made from a meouri tree. Evarapu now sets to work to make the canoe and the story gives details of its construction, and of the launching, when Evarapu, with body blackened and bedecked with strips of nipa leaf (the typical decoration of the Hurava, or Delta, men) dances on the canoe platform. In due course he reaches Yule Island and elopes with Aviara. Her father, Oa Laia (elsewhere called Oa Birukapu and Oa Idiva) learning of her elopement, gives chase. He enters the water and becomes a hevehe in the form of a huge fish. At Motu he stops and procures a house, which he carries on his back through the water, apparently to make his appearance more terrifying to the fugitives. He causes a storm to arise, and the canoe, " Meouri/' is threatened with destruction. But Evarapu throws lime into the water ; the hevehe Oa Laia is for the time being blinded, and thus Evarapu manages to escape and bring his bride safely home. The myth goes on much further. Oa Laia follows the fugitives to the Aivei and comes ashore after them, where, lying in hiding, he later devours, inadvertently, the son of Evarapu and Aviara, named Birau Upumake. But the subsequent episodes of his destruction and the return of his bones to the east do not seem relevant to the bevuta maho. This myth makes it sufficiently plain why the bevuta should be in some cases called " Meouri/' and in others " Iriri." It does not seem quite so reasonable that other bevaiu should be called " Meouri- Oa Laia," though Oa Laia, travelling through the water with the house on his back, might be something for any bevuiu to emulate. It gives precedents for the stages of construction, the tabu on sexual</page><page sequence="22">i6o TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA intercourse, and the use of a model bird as decoration with carved betel nuts fastened under its wings. It also accounts for the conven- tional decoration of the bevuta haera of Meouri or Iriri, which is that of the Hurava man, and for his imitation of a bird. The whole myth might be made to square with a voyage to Lavau for pots, and in his magic the bevaia haera is recalling the details of that early venture. The Myth of Eau's Arakaita. Another of the maho-oharo used in bevaia magic is that of Harai and Eau. Harai (identified with the morning star) comes from Kauri, the east, or more particularly from the upper Biaru River. Walking along a rattan cane, which he throws from one tree top to the other, he makes a long journey toward the west, and at the end of it finds the woman Eau (a kind of nipa palm) beyond the river Aivei. He marries her and she bears a son, but Harai decides to return to Kauri. He has a large single dugout made, i.e. a canoe of the Delta type, called arakaita, and after fasting and decorating himself he loads this with sago and embarks with his wife and child. On the way they encounter bad weather, but Eau cries out " Harai, arave Orovuvira." The word Orovu indicates a mythical place of great beauty in the west, since overwhelmed by mud, and Eau's cry may mean, " Harai, my husband in Orovu." Since Harai comes originally from Kauri, the east, this does not seem an entirely satisfactory explanation, but at any rate the canoe passes safely through and reaches its destina- tion. Some bevaia, especially those sent out by men of the Kauri clan, are called " Eau-ve-arakaita " (Eau's dugout), or " Orovuvira." I have no details of the maho used in connection with them. The Myth of A ori and Iviri. Another maho oharo is associated especially with the Auma clan. It tells how Aori, who lived at Auma point, went to the Kemera River to bring home as his bride the woman Iviri. Iviri is the name of a hill on the Kerema River, but in the story she is wholly human except that she was born with a love, or sprig of feathers growing in her hair. He first goes in quest of her in a ruru, representing the little bird aori, and having found her he plucks out this love, tells her he will call for her later in a canoe, and then flies home to make</page><page sequence="23">TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA 161 his preparations. The canoe completed and given the name " Heava," he travels again to the Kerema River and in due course returns home with his bride. They are pursued by her parents, who enter the water and become sea hevehe, but eventually are left behind. Later on, when the fugitives are camped at Bie (the Bluff) a local woman, Kikiriapu, takes all the ornaments from the sleeping Iviri, and before daylight induces Aori to set off again, posing as his bride. There is much more to the story : Aori reaches home before discovering his mistake, but after many adventures Iviri, who has followed along shore, succeeds in reuniting herself with him and displacing Kikiriapu. These episodes, however, do not as far as I know have any bearing on the mako. The bevaia haera who told me this story made it quite plain that when he set forth on his bevaia, which was named " Heava," he was impersonating Aori himself. He wears the costume which Aori is supposed to have worn, with a blackened face (and in a way prematurely) the same kind of love in his hair which Aori plucked from Iviri's head. As he boards the bevaia he thinks, as he puts it, to himself, " I want to pluck the love from Iviri's head." He dances on the platform and extends his arms like Aori's wings. Another man, master of a bevaia of the same name, " Heava," told the above story in a somewhat different form. The hero was a man, Baiaiapo, who sent the bird Aori as messenger to Iviri before actually going himself. In this case the bevaia haera said that in loading and embarking he pretended to be Baiaiapo : " My name is Baiaiapo," he says under his breath ; and, to the canoe, " Keep your eyes on Nabo and Horoi " (two mountains behind Kerema, where Iviri lived.) The name Heava was said by this last informant to be a synonym for ova, a kind of mangrove. The dugout is always, I believe, actually made from a softwood tree called ihohea, and my informant, who made no secret of the name " Heava," was very reluctant to reveal the intermediate name " Ova," whispering it in my ear as a great favour. It would appear that it is this latter name that has the magical power. He also said that in loading he applied the name " Kikiriapu," that of the usurping bride, to the sago, though</page><page sequence="24">i62 TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA he was unable or unwilling to make the connection plain. Another informant told me subsequently that I had been deceived, and suggested that the name " Kikiriapu," as that of an ill-deserving and ill-fated woman, was used only in malicious magic, i.e. in the endeavour to ruin the sago and the enterprise of a rival bevaia haera. The Myth of Hedi Houvu. The Kaia, or sky, clan may use the name " Hedi Houvu " for their bevaia. The myth, which I give very briefly, relates how two men Oveai and Kairai were rescued by the girls Kawaka and Pupuvari from the continual attacks of their enemies. Kawaka is some kind of boring insect which I could not identify ; pupuvari is the carpenter bee. They bored into a laura and an aravea tree till they were hollow and then told their people to hide themselves inside ; this done, they bored a little further till the trees fell into the river, when they were bound together as a haruka iroki which was called " Hedi Houvu," and eventually made off to the Motu coast. Hedi and houvu stand respectively for the trees laura and aravea, the latter names being, as before, the specially secret ones, which are applied in magic to the softwood ihohea. Oveai and kairai are secret names for the north-west wind avara. The names " Kawaka " and " Pupuvari " are assumed by the bevaia haera himself as he begins the felling of the tree, and with his axe he pretends, instead of chopping (haiakive), to be boring (parerekive) in the manner of these two insects. Here, however, as elsewhere, it was denied that any set spell was used. The Myth of Aroae. As a last example I shall refer to the myth of the Baiu clan, which has an old-established legendary connection with the Motu lakatoi. It is claimed that the man Baiu made the first expedition to the Motu coast, accompanied by another canoe of the Kaia clan. He had married his daughter Aroae to Lavai, of the Vallala River, and she had borne a son. But the child died, and when later Baiu set out on his expedition and was anchored at Kearu for the night, Aroae stole up and put the dead child on board. Next day Baiu's canoe sank, and he had to transfer his belongings to that of the</page><page sequence="25">TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA 163 Kaia clan. This proceeded down the coast, but at every stop there was Aroae, who had preceded them along the beach under cover of night. The people did not recognize her, but because of what they thought her resemblance to the real Aroae at home they gave her presents of bows and arrows, the regular cargo of the early trading canoes. By the time they reached the Motu coast their stock was exhausted ; but Aroae had preceded them again, and there they finally settled together. This, according to the myth, was prior to any other settlement on that coast. Aroae herself discovered how to make pots and subsequently Baiu and his people made expeditions in real lakatoi to the west. They were the first to do so ; in fact they were the veritable Derai Haera, or Motu.12 The Baiu bevaia is called " Aroae " ; though as in some other cases the connection does not seem entirely logical. Indeed, the narrator of the above legend had abandoned it owing to the failure of a previous expedition, and instead bought the Harava magic, and with it the name " Meouri." However, the myth recalls what is supposed to be the earliest trading voyage and indicates the method of trading, viz. by leaving parcels of bows and arrows at various places of anchorage and collecting pots on the return. In this and the other myths referred to there is no doubt a good deal of maho that was not revealed to me. The only piece of magic that my informant would consent to tell me in this connection was of a malicious nature. To sink a rival's bevaia it was only necessary to wrap up a parcel of leaves (what they were he would not say) and place it secretly on board, calling it as he did so " Lavai-Kaki." That means " Lavai's namesake," and the parcel represents the dead child of Lavai and Aroae, which the latter placed on her father's bevaia. The Magic of Impersonation. The foregoing treatment of myth in relation to bevaia maho is all rather fragmentary, but it is enough to show the importance of mythical associations, particularly of mythical names in Elema "Another version of the story has it that Aroae preceded the canoe as far as Kerepuna at the mouth of the Kemp Welch, where she remained, her father receiving payment for her in armshells and pots.</page><page sequence="26">i64 TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA magic, and further to suggest the connecting link, or the way in which the name gives power. When a man thus employs a name to help him in his purpose we might at first sight be inclined to think he was actually calling on the bearer of the name for help. I am not at present prepared to state that such an idea is entirely absent from Elema culture, but it does not represent the construction which the magician himself here places upon his action. As a number of definite cases show, he is rather applying the mythical names to himself or to this or that feature of his undertaking. In short, he is himself impersonating a mythical character, or identifying some feature of his undertaking with a corresponding feature of a mythical undertaking which reached a successful close. He apparently feels more confident of success himself by pretending to be the great man of the long-ago and by making his present undertaking, so to speak, a reproduction of the great man's exploit. Such pretence or impersonation is helped out by details of costume and action and by such extras as that of the model bird fixed in the rigging. The same general method, and with it the same explanation^ is applicable to other phases of magic as well as to bevuta make. When a man goes a-wooing, for instance, he will, if he knows it, employ the name " Marai," a highly secret synonym for the moon (Papare). In the myth the moon, as a person, is peculiarly attractive to women ; and for the time being the lover actually impersonates him. He does not whisper to himself, " Marai, help me to win this woman," but he thinks, without even whispering, " I am Marai himself, and I will get her." Again, Kivavia Orokiki Akore became infallibly successful at shooting fish with the bow and arrow ; this was because two men, Berari Kapipi and Kiwai Kapipi, had informed him in a dream that they would come to him as decorated arrows and that he should use them on his fishing. In due course Kivavia picked up two floating arrows on the river and used them with the success they had promised. A man who knew this maho oharo told me that when he went fish shooting he pretended to be Kivavia himself, and as he took down his</page><page sequence="27">TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA 165 arrows he addressed them or thought of them as " Berari Kapipi " and " Kiwai Kapipl." I could give more instances from magic devoted to other pur- poses, but these will be enough to indicate the common use of what we might call the magic of impersonation. The essential equipment of the magician is, of course, a know- ledge of the relevant parts of the myths, but special stress is laid on the secret names. It remains somewhat obscure why the secret name should be more potent than the public name. It may be that the special reliance on the former has its rise in the magician's own secretiveness : he is very jealous in guarding his own magic, and fearful lest it be communicated to others. The ostensible reason is that magic made public loses its power ; but we may suspect that the real reason is the fear of losing a prerogative and a private source of influence. The magicians then stick close to their several secrets so that they alone may have the advantage of them ; and this secretiveness itself may give rise to the general belief that magic drawn from secret sources is the most potent. But the argument may be that the secret name is more real or intimate, and that the knowledge of it brings the magician into closer relation with the mythical character, thus making the impersonation easier and more effective. This, however, is a subject which I did not sufficiently explore. It is not by any means implied that this magic of impersonation covers the whole ground of bevaia tnaho, but that it is the dominant feature of that maho in so far as it is dependent on myths. Even within this more limited field it is difficult to see how it can explain the use of some names, as e.g. those used in raising the winds. In Elema myths the great majority of characters can be identified with, or in a manner represent some creature or natural object ; and in this way certain names are interpreted as synonyms for the winds. It may be that in using them the magician is actually calling up the winds. Once more, I missed the opportunity of looking particularly into this matter, and will not venture to speak with any finality until</page><page sequence="28">i66 TRADING VOYAGES FROM THE GULF OF PAPUA I have seen more of Elema culture.13 But in the cases where informants could make their meaning plain it appeared with sufficient definiteness that they were acting on another principle, viz. the one I have attempted to formulate under the name of magic of impersona- tion. They were themselves impersonating characters from the myths and seeking to re-enact the successes which those mythical characters had achieved. F. E. WILLIAMS 13In the meantime I should say that I have found nothing at the western end of the Gulf Division to endorse Holmes1 statement that " Prior to setting out on this journey, Avaralaru, the god of the north-west wind, has to be conciliated. To this end the village sorcerer is engaged at a good fee to intercede with Avaralaru and the god of the sea, that they may give to the voyagers a safe journey and bring them back safely to their village and friends. Two old men, who are considered to be sacred during the voyage, are especially commissioned to accompany those expeditions, that they may use their influence in appealing to the gods of the winds and the sea to refrain from bringing any calamity upon the party " : Melanesiens of British New Guinea, 119.</page><page sequence="29">&lt; eu to &amp; O ^ Pu 8 W is O 'S £5 (S) S w 2 &lt; ^ H</page></plain_text>
