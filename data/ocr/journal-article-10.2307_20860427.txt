<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dennis Dutschke THE TRANSLATION OF ST. ANTONY FROM THE EGYPTIAN DESERT TO THE ITALIAN CITY The translation of Antony the Abbot's relics to the West and the translation of his biography, from Greek to Latin and the vernacular languages, followed analog ous tracks along which physical displacement and textual transference carried with them multiple changes in the knowledge about the saint and the devotion to him. Through the process of translatio, the identity of the saint evolved from ascetic hermit, ?Father of Monasticism?, in the Egyptian desert, to thaumaturge of St. Antoine de Viennois. Along with the movement of the relics, which brought with it a new praesentia and a renewed potentia of the saintl, the texts of Antony's life evolved through a series of translations which not only recuperated the past, but also refracted and reproduced the texts upon which the saint's complex identity was based 2. In medieval Italy, the text of St. Antony's life reached religious and secular audiences, and it was reproduced in a variety of literary and artistic forms. 3 One of the most receptive audiences was an obscure fourteenth-century flagellant confrater nity dedicated to St. Antony, the Societas disciplinatorum sancti Antonii de Aretio, in the Tuscan city of Arezzo 4. In the laudario (UK) of the confraternity there are three laude which constitute an extraordinary example of the reproduction and refraction of St. Antony's life and identity. Lauda 7 identifies Antony as the patron saint of the confraternity, ?Antonio nostro campione? (v. 2), for whom the members raise their gonfalone (v. 18), and to whom they pray for defense against the cruel dragon of evil (v. 26), and for salvation (v. 38): Et si defenda la nostra citade a ira et guerra, et d'aversitade, da mala morte et da 'mfermitade, da ogni pianto et confusione. 1 For Peter Brown, the two terms define the identity of a saint whose relics have been translated: praesentia, ?the physical presence of the holy, whether in the midst of a particular community or in the possession of particular individuals, was the greatest blessing that a late-antique Christian could enjoy?; potentia, ?the ideal power? of the saint (P. Brown, The Cult of the Saints. Its Rise and Function in Latin Christianity, Chicago 1981, 86-127). 2 Andre Lefevere has defined translation as ?reproduction, refraction? (A. Lefevere, Literary Theory and Translated Literature, ?Dispositio?, 7/19-21, 1982, 10). 3 Paolo Toschi has emphasized the need to combine the study of literary and artistic traditions: ?So lo un'analogia con tutta la nostra pittura dal '200 al '400 ci pud dare un'idea approssimativa di quel che rappresentino queste leggende poetiche popolari e farci comprendere la loro ragion d'essere, le loro somi glianze e differenze? (P. Toschi, La poesia popolare religiosa in Italia, Firenze 1935, 122). 4 D. Dutschke and S.

(UK 7, vv. 39-46) Laude 8 and 17 contain the biographical details in support of such an image of the saint: UK 8: Antony's birth, including his being pledged to the devil, and forced to descend in to hell (UK 8, vv. 3-14); Antony's conversion, as he gives everything to the poor, and begins his ascetic life (UK 8, vv. 15-18); Antony's struggles with the devil (UK 8, vv. 19-26, vv. 31-34). UK 17: Antony's conversion, as he gives all to the poor, and begins his ascetic life (UK 17, vv. 7-10); Antony's departure from Patras to seek a suitable place to live (UK 17, vv. 11-18); Devil's temptations of Antony with silver and gold in the desert (UK 17, vv. 19-22); Antony's struggle with demons, and the appearance of Christ to save him (UK 17, vv. 23-34); Antony's entering into the fire to combat temptation (UK 17, vv. 35-36); Antony's resistance of the temptation of false coin (UK 17, vv. 37-38); Antony's search for martyrdom (UK 17, vv. 39-42); Antony's meeting with St. Paul (UK 17, vv. 47-50); Antony inheriting Paul's habit (UK 17, vv. 59-60); Antony's building of an abbey in the desert, and his converting of many followers (UK 17, vv. 61-62); Antony's teaching the saintly life (UK, vv. 63-64); Antony's death and secret burial (UK 17, vv. 67-70); Discovery of Antony's body and its translation to St. Antoine de Viennois (UK 17, vv. 71-78). If, as Josef Morawski has written, the strange destiny of the solitary hermit is dependent on the mysterious translation of his relics to the West5, it is within the UK laude, in conjunction with other related hagiographical material, that the re fracted and reproduced details of that mystery are to be recovered, and, in so doing, thereby shed some light on St. Antony's strange destiny. In what may be regarded as one of the most eloquent modern tributes to the lasting vitality of the cult of St. Antony the Abbot, the Pontifical Institute St. Anselmi dedicated the entire thirty-eighth issue of Studia Anselmiana to Antonius Magnus Eremita 6. Relying upon an apparently unlikely authority, the editors call on Martin Luther to introduce the volume and to delineate the main identifying fea tures of the saint: in contrast to his usually unsympathetic considerations of Antony 5 ?Etrange destinee que celle d'un saint ermite vivant dans le lointain desert d'Egypte, qui ? grace au hasard d'un mysterieuse translation des ses reliques ? devint l'un des saints les plus populaires de l'Oc cident et patron d'un puissant Orde d'Hospitaliers? (J. Morawsky, La legende de saint Antoine ermite [Histoire, Poesie, Art, Folklore], avec une Vie inconnue de S.

VII.</page><page sequence="3">THE TRANSLATION OF ST. ANTONY 501 and monasticism 7, Luther's words of praise of St. Antony, taken from the De votis monasticis, declare the universal admiration for the ascetic Father of Monasticism: Sanctus Antonius, ipsissimus monachorum pater et monasticae vitae princeps, sapientis sime et christianissime censuit et docuit, nihil prorsus esse tentandum, quod auctoritatem Scripturae non haberet8. Etienne T. Bettencourt, in the same issue of Studia Anselmiana, offers the modern confirmation of the saint's enduring religious figure: En effet, Antoine non seulement nous est connu aujourd'hui comme un personnage historique, mais il est de plus passe a la tradition chretienne comme un symbole de la vie monastique vecue solitairement dans le desert, c'est-a-dire, de la vie eremitique 9. Prophetically, the author of the Vita Antonii10 had clearly envisioned the key role that Antony would assume in the adoption of the ascetic way of life by future generations of brethren, as he stated in the preface to the Vita: ... magna cum laetitia suscepi vestrae charitatis imperium. Etenim mihi ingens lucrum est atque utilitas hoc ipsum quod recordor Antonii, et vos cum admiratione audientes, scio ejus propositum cupere sectari: perfecta est siquidem ad virtutem via, Antonium scire quis fuerit 11. This message, as it was articulated in the Vita Antonii, attributed to Athan asius, written between the years 356-362 12, and translated from Greek into Latin by Evagrius Ponticus of Antioch shortly thereafter around the year 371, quickly spread throughout Eastern and Western Christendom 13. As the author intended, it was 7 Luther's works are peppered with an unsympathetic view of St. Antony and monks in general, who live for themselves only and not to serve others; the De votis monasticis was written in 1521, when Luther had already broken away from the Church, and when he was writing against monastic vows and the Sacrifice of the Mass. A recurring criticism of Antony is found in the Commentary on 1 Timothy, 4, 8, in which Luther accuses monks of isolating themselves, of serving only themselves, and of neglecting others (Luther's Works, XXVIII, ed. H. Oswald, St. Louis 1973, 322). 8 ?Studia Anselmiana?, 38 (1956), p. VII. The quote from Luther is from his De votis monasticis, in D. Martini Lutheri Opera latina, ed. H. Schmidt, Frankfurt 1872, 245. 9 L'idial religieux de saint Antoine et son actuality, ?Studia Anselmiana?, 38 (1956), 45. Jean Le clercq reaches the same conclusion in Saint Antoine dans la tradition monastique medievale, ?Studia Ansel miana?, 38 (1956), 240-41. 10 St. Athanasius (ca. 296-373), Bishop of Alexandria, is thought to be Antony's first and foremost biographer. Although some skepticism has been voiced regarding his authorship, most pointedly by H. Weingarten, Ursprung des Monchtums im nachkonstantinischen Zeitalter, Gotha 1877, for the purpose of this study it is essential to remember that from the fourth century it was believed that Athanasius was the author, and the medieval reader read the text in Latin, in Evagrius' freely translated version, well removed from the original author. Even Jerome, in the De viris illustribus, identifies Athanasius as the author of the Vita Antonii: ?Vitam quoque beati Antonii de Graeco Athanasii in sermonem nostrum transtulit? (PL, 23, 751). I will refer to Athanasius as the author of the Vita Antonii as the medieval reader would have done. 11 The quote is from the Latin translation by Evagrius, Versio Evagrii, PL, 73, 125-26. 12 See L. Von Hertling, Studi storici antoniani negli ultimi trent'anni, ?Studia Anselmiana?, 38 (1956), 16. R. Meyer proposes the year 357, in Saint Athanasius, The Life of Saint Antony, New York 1978, 8. 13 In no uncertain terms, Robert Meyer states: ?The Life of St. Antony enjoyed a tremendous popu larity in ancient times and throughout the Middle Ages? (Saint Athanasius, The Life of Saint Antony, 14). Christine Mohrmann notes, regarding the translation by Evagrius: ?En Occident la traduction d'Evagre, ami de saint Jerome (devenu eveque d'Antioche en 388) a eu un succes enorme et durable, comme l'atte stent les manuscrits nombreux qui l'ont conservee et les editions imprimees, elles aussi assez nombreuses?</page><page sequence="4">502 D. DUTSCHKE admired (cum admiratione audientes) and emulated (cupere sectari) not only by those lowly monks for whom it had been intended originally, the ?brethren in foreign parts? 14, but also by generations of converts amongst whose ranks were to be found the leading figures of the Church, including St. Martin of Tours (d. 397), St. Jerome (ca. 342-420), St. Augustine (354-430), and St. Francis of Assisi (1181/2-1226) 15. St. Martin founded what seems to be the first monastery in Gaul, at Liguge near Poitier in ca. 360, and it is ?evident that this was a simple reproduc tion of the Antonian monachism of Egypt? 16; and Sulpicius Severus' De vita Beati Martini offers ample evidence of Martin's ascetic emulation of and rivalry with Antony 11. Jerome fully acknowledged the ?celebre nomen Antonii? I8, he included Antony as one of the 'principes* of monastic life 19, he noted that even if Antony had not been the first, it was by him that the first monks' passion was awakened 20, and Jerome chose to write the life of the lesser known Paul of Thebes with full re cognition that Antony had already figured so prominently in collective memory: Igitur quia de Antonio tarn Graeco quam Romano stylo diligenter memoriae traditum est, pauca de Pauli principio et fine scribere disposui21. Shortly before his fateful reading of the passage from the Vita Antonii, Augustine confessed his own ignorance of Antony and his wonder in hearing Ponticianus speak about Antony's fame, ?... ortus est sermo, ipso narrante, de Antonio Aegyptio monacho, cujus nomen excellenter clarebat apud servos tuos ...

All of them, espec ially Augustine and Francis, found in the Vita Antonii the way to perfecta virtutem via 23, and their search helped to establish one of the most popular and lasting lite rary traditions in the history of hagiography. In the Vita Antonii, the ascetic ideal is presented as Antony's journey through progressive stages away from worldliness and toward spiritual perfection 24. The es sential first step in the soul's journey toward perfection is the initial break with the worldly, and conversion to spiritual life, as is recounted in the Vita Antonii: Post mortem autem parentum, annorum circiter decem et octo seu viginti, cum sorore admodum parvula derelictus, et domus et sororis honestam curam gerebat. Necdum vero sex fluxerant menses, quibus ad ecclesiam (ut solebat) accurrens, recordabatur quomodo et apo stoli, omnibus spretis, secuti fuissent Salvatorem: et multi, ut legitur in Actis apostolorum, facultatibus suis venditis, pretia ad pedes eorum detulissent egentibus partienda, quaeve aut quanta spes iisdem reposita esset in coelis. Talia secum volvens, intravit ecclesiam, et accidit ut tune evangelium legeretur, in quo Dominus dicit ad divitem: Si vis perfectus esse, vade, vende omnia tua quaecunque habes, et da pauperibus, et veni, sequere me, et habebis thesaurum in coelo. Quo audito, quasi divinitus hujusmodi ante memoriam concepisset, et veluti propter se haec esset Scriptura recitata, ad se Dominicum traxit imperium; statimque regressus, possess iones quas habebat vendidit25. Antony's conversion will be the inspirational example for future generations. The reading from Mt. 19.21 not only provides the concrete evidence to substantiate Antony's later teaching (V.A., ch. 16), that the ?Scriptures are sufficient for instruc tion? 26, but it also establishes the starting point for himself and for those seeking, 22 PL, 32, 755. 23 There is a noteworthy difference between Evagrius' ?perfect way of virtue?, and the Greek text which more specifically indicated ?an ideal pattern of the ascetical life? for monks. The extended audience is also indicated in the last chapter of the Vita Antonii, (PL, 73, 168), in Athanasius' proposal that it be read even to pagans. 24 M.J. Marx compares Antony's journey with the similar itinerary of Origen's asceticism, and out lines the stages of the journey of the soul to perfection in the Vita Antonii: the young Antony is desirous of imitating the early Christians, and he begins to practice the ascetic life (ch. 2); Antony retreats to the outskirts of his village (ch. 3); Antony's first decisive victory over the devil (chaps. 5-7); Antony leaves for the tombs, is molested by demons; his first vision (ch. 10), and the decision to retreat across the Nile to the distant desert (chaps. 11-12); after 20 years in the desert, Antony, compelled by admirers, abbandons solitude (ch. 14) to become a teacher of the ascetic life; longing for solitude, Antony retreats to the inner most desert (chaps. 49-92) (Incessant prayer in the "Vita Antonii', ?Studia Anselmiana?, 38, 1956, 123-24). 25 Vita Antonii, PL, 73, 127. The same text, with the erroneous attribution to Luke instead of Mat thew, appears in the Prologus de pueritia S. Antonii in a 15th-century manuscript (Rome, Biblioteca Casa natense, ms. 3898, f. 51), published in F. Halkin, Une histoife latine de s. Antoine: la 'Ligende de Pa tras', ?Analecta Bollandiana?, 61 (1943), 243, and also in the life of St. Antony in Syriac, which according to Rene Draguet was based on a version of Antony's life written before the Vita Antonii, in La vie primiti ve de S. Antoine conservee en syriaque, Louvain 1980 (Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium, vol. 418, Scriptores Syri, t. 184), 6. The efficacy of the example is underlined by the analogous scriptural mes sage that Antony receives shortly thereafter, which signals the complete break with his past: ?Rursus autem ecclesiam ingressus, cum audisset Dominum in Evangelio dicentem: Nolite cogitare de crastino, reliquam quoque portionem pauperibus distribuit? (Vita Antonii, 3, PL, 73, 128). The reception of the Scriptures (cum audisset Dominum in Evangelio dicentem) leads directly to a break with the past and an embracing of the future, ?... ipse jam omnibus saeculi vinculis liber, asperum atque arduum arripuit institutum? (Vita Antonii, 3, PL, 73, 128). 26 ?Quadam autem die, cum sanctus Antonius a congregatis fratribus rogaretur, ut eis institutoria largiretur praecepta, cum prophetica fiducia exaltans vocem, aiebat ad omnem quidem mandatorum disci plinam Scripturas posse sufficere? (Vita Antonii, 15, PL, 73, 134-35). Cfr. ?Athanasius often speaks of this sufficiency: cfr. Cont. gent. 1; Epist. de Syn. 6; Epist. ad episc. Aegypti et Libyae 4? (Meyer, St. Athanasius, the Life of Saint Antony, 111).</page><page sequence="6">504 D. DUTSCHKE as St. Benedict would later say, to walk ?in the way of the Gospel? 21. As successor to the apostles 28, Antony seeks to follow the path set out by the Gospels, in what Bouyer calls a perfect psychological continuity 29. Although Antony may not be the first or the only one to cite the words spoken by Christ to the young rich man to sell all he has, give it to the poor, and follow (Mt. 19.21)30, he is unique in re-enacting them and translating them directly and literally into a new experience 31. They are repeated in a ritualistic act of conversion, and assume a redemptive force 32. Unlike the young rich man who went away with a heavy heart thinking of his great wealth (Mt. 19.22), Antony embraces the ascetic life. Antony's biographer records the saint's actions within a narrative frame that, according to Thomas Heffernan, constitutes the driving force of sacred biography, in which, In this narrative frame, action becomes ritual, and specific action becomes specific ritual. For sacred biographers, there existed a veritable thesaurus of established approved ac tions which they could employ in their texts. The repetition of actions taken from Scripture or from earlier saints' lives (often this practice extended to appropriating the exact language) ensured the authenticity of the subject's sanctity 33. St. Augustine recalls these same words in some of the most memorable pages of his Confessions, just prior to his own conversion: 27 ?Enfin elle est une 'vie evangelique', ou toute regie n'a d'autre but que de faire marcher, comme le dit saint Benoit, 'sur le chemin de l'Evangile'. Pour developper ces themes scripturaires, on s'inspire de la tradition du monachisme antique et des modeles qu'il a laisses, en particulier saint Antoine?, J. Le clercq, F. Vandenbroucke, L. Bouyer, La spiritualite du moyen age, Paris 1961, 228-29. 28 See Leclercq, Saint Antoine, 230-36. An early example of the influence of the Gospel among the desert monks is: ?Quidam monachorum Serapion tantum Evangelium possidens, vendidit illud, et esurienti bus dedit, dignum memoriae sermonem imitans: Ipsum, inquit, verbum venundavi, quod mihi semper dice bat: Vende quae possides, et da pauperibus (Pelag., libell. VI, num. 5)?, Verba Seniorum, 3, 70: PL, 73, 772-73. 29 Bouyer, La vie de S. Antoine, 45. 30 Origen (ca. 185 ? ca. 254) had cited them in his homilies and in his commentary on the Gospel of Matthew: ?Confessing Christ, then, involves the complete renunciation of the world and Origen repeate dly cites the same text that will be used by the monks as a point of departure in their apologies for the monastic life. This is the text which contains the words spoken by Christ to the young man of the gospel, 'If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give it to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come follow me'? (E.E. Malone, The Monk and the Martyr, ?Studia Anselmiana?, 38, 1956, 208). Malone refers to two works by Origen, In Genes, horn. 8, 8-10 (PG, 12, 207-10), and Comm. in Matt. Ser. 15, 18-19 (PG, 13, 1303-10). 31 Cfr. the fifteenth-century manuscript, Casantense 3898, fol. 51, in which the biographer, drawing upon the V.A., emphasizes Antony's close reading of and listening to the Gospel (the confusion between Luke and Matthew has little or no affect on the overall message): ?Et cum evangelium legeretur, eum dili gentissime ascultabat. Inter cetera dicta beati Luce evangeliste audivit verba taliter resonantia: 'Si vis per fectus esse, vende omnia tua bona que habes et da pauperibus, et sequere me, et habebis thesaurum in ce lis'?, in Prologus de pueritia S. Antonii, in Halkin, Une Histoire, 243; also 218 and 223. 32 Although St. Martin does not hear the same words of the Gospel, his conversion is set clearly against the inspirational background of Antony's renunciation of the worldly: see Sulpicius Severus, De vi ta Beati Martini, in ed. Fontaine in Sources Chretiennes, Paris 1968, 133-35, and Fontaine, Verite et fic tion dans la chronologie de la 'Vita Martini', 229-30. 33 T.J. Heffernan, Sacred Biography: Saints and Their Biographers in the Middle Ages, New York Oxford 1992, 6. Heffernan has replaced the term hagiography, which he believes to be largely outdated, with the term sacred biography: ?Sacred biography, as understood here, refers to a narrative text of the vi ta of the saint written by a member of community of belief. The text provides a documentary witness to the process of sanctification for the community and in so doing becomes itself a part of the sacred tradi tion it serves to document? (Heffernan, Sacred Biography, 16).</page><page sequence="7">THE TRANSLATION OF ST. ANTONY 505 Audieram enim de Antonio quod ex evangelica lectione, cui forte supervenerat, admonitus fuerit, tanquam sibi diceretur quod legebatur: Vade, vende omnia quae habes, et da pauperibus; et habebis thesaurum in coelis; et veni, sequere me (Mt. 19.21); et tali oraculo confestim ad te esse conversum (Conf. VIII, 12, 29) Reading and experience become one and the same, and Augustine emulates Antony by opening up the Gospel (codicem Apostoli) and reading Rom. 13, 13-14 34. Augustine faithfully bears witness to the conversion by transcribing the Gospel text, together with that which already had been transcribed into the Vita Antonii, into his own text, and he attributes the same redemptive force to the reading of the text. In what has been called a kinesthetic reading of the Gospel, Augustine visualizes the text, internalizes it and adopts it in his own mimetic conversion 35. Although Augustine ?...led toward his own conversion across the stepping-stones of three others ? those of Victorinus (8.2), the Apostle Paul (8.4), and Antony of Egypt (8.6)? 36, the Vita Antonii episode was the most compelling and lasting example of conversion for Augustine, as well as for the readers of the Confessions. Throughout the Middle Ages in the West, Antony continued to be extolled as the exemplar of ascetic life, and the Vita Antonii remained the primary text upon which the saint's image was based. Leclercq has compiled an impressive list of those for whom Antony was the Orientate lumen, from Cassian and Isidore to the elev enth-twelfth century monastic reformers of mainly Italy and France 37. The Benedic tines appear to have played an important role in keeping Antony's memory alive: Leclercq identified no fewer than eight copies of the Vita Antonii that were in the library of Monte Cassino in the eleventh-twelfth centuries 38, and numerous referen ces to Antony by Benedictines, and in particular those by the Benedictine monk Pet er Damian (1007-72) who accorded equal praise to both Benedict and Antony: Verumtamen die, obsecro, quis sanctorum, quis antiquorum Patrum sub hac, quam in solenter asseris, probatione conversus est? Numquid Antonius? Numquid Paulus? Numquid Hilarion? Numquid et ipse sanctus Benedictus, qui ista, sicut tu falleris, videtur praecipere, sub hac probationis observantia ad monachicum legitur ordinem pervenisse 39. By the thirteenth century, the St. Antony of the Vita Antonii was widely known as the Father of Monachism both within and without the monastic walls: he 34 ?Itaque concitus redii ad eum locum ubi sedebat Alypius: ibi enim posueram codicem Apostoli, cum inde surrexeram. Arripui, aperui, et legi in silentio capitulum, quo primum conjecti sunt oculi mei: Non in comessationibus et ebrietatibus, non in cubilibus et inpudicitiis, non in contentione et aemulatione; sed induite Dominum Jesum Christum, et carnis providentiam ne feceritis in concupiscentiis (Rom. 13, 13-14). Nec ultra volui legere; nec opus erat. Statim quippe cum fine hujusce sententiae, quasi luce securi tatis infusa cordi meo, omnes dubitationis tenebrae diffugerunt? (Aug. Conf. VIII, 12, 29). 35 K.F.

Elliott also cites St. Guthlac, as a close follower of Antony, in Roads to Paradise: Reading the Lives of the Early Saints, Hanover and London 1987, 4. The monk Felix, author of the Life of Guthlac, describes the saint's reaction to reading the lives of the first monks: ?Cum enim priscorum monachorum solitariam vitam legebat, turn inluminato cordis gremio avida cupidine heremum quaerere fervebat? (Felix's Life of Saint Guthlac, Introd., Text, Translation and Notes by B. Colgrave, Cambridge 1956, 86; Colgrave dates the life between 730-40). 38 Leclercq, Saint Antoine, 235. 39 Contra espiscopum monachos ad saeculum revocantem, 8, PL, 145, 377.

DUTSCHKE was the embodiment of the ascetic ideal, as Uguccione da Pisa wrote in the Agiographia: ...inde Antonius quasi antenius, id est tenens et considerans superna et despiciens mun dana, vel Antonius ab ana quod est rectum et ton quod est terra vel teneo, quia inter terrena rectitudine&lt;m&gt; tenuit et item virtut&lt;e&gt;m 40. and as Jacobus of Voragine later repeated, in part, in the introduction to Antony's life in the Legenda aurea, Antonius dicitur ab ana, quod est sursum, et tenens, quasi superna tenens et mundana despiciens. Despexit autem mundum, quia immundus, inquetus, transitorius, deceptivus, amarus 41. William of Auvergne's sermon reinforces the close relationship between Antony's conversion and the Gospel of Matthew (21.19): Beatus Antonius Christo se conformare voluit, unde audiens illud evangelicum in ecclesia legi: Si perfectus vis esse, &amp;c mox illud implevit. Ipse quod rectum in viris sanctis aspiciebat imitabatur: unde legitur in vita ipsius, quod proprias gratias fratrum quos visitabat velut apes mellis dulcedinem a floribus hauriebat. Vita etiam ejus recta fuit, quia medium ab extremis non discrepabat42. Although the totally Antonian heremitic life was rejected by the Franciscan and Dominican orders 43, the quest for evangelical poverty, and an asceticism of the ?deserto interno? u, became the goal of both, especially the Franciscans, and the St. Antony of the Vita Antonii was their key guiding figure 45.

Francisci (pars 1, cap. 14) recounts a discussion between Francis and his disciples about their way of life, (?Conferebant pariter, veri cultores iustitiae, utrum inter homines conversari deberent, an ad loca solitaria se conferre?, Analecta Franciscana, ed. a patribus Colle gii S. Bonaventurae, X, Quaracchi-Firenze 1926-1941, 28); Francis decides in favor of evangelism amongst the people, against living for himself (?... eligit non sibi vivere soli, sed ei qui pro omnibus mortuus est, sciens se ad hoc missum, ut Deo animas lucraretur quas diabolus conabatur auferre?, Anal. Franc, X, 28). Coincidently, the mise-en-scene recalls the Vita Antonii: C.H. Lawrence, Medieval Monasticism: Forms of Religious Life in Western Europe in the Middle Ages, London and New York 1989, 246. An analogous episode, referring to St. Antony, is also found in the ?Legend of Patras? (?Analecta Bollandiana?, 61, 1943, 225-27), in which Antony decides that the city is contrary to ascetic life, and therefore he leads his fellow monks out of the city of Patras to the desert. Francis' particular form of ascetic life, nonetheless, grew out of that which has been called the golden age of Italian ascetism, which was based in large measu re on St. Antony: L. Pellegrini, L'esperienza eremitica di Francesco e dei primi francescani, in Francesco d'Assisi e francescanesimo dal 1216 al 1226. Atti del IV convegno internazionale.

ANTONY 507 Francis's Regula Primitiva leaves little doubt as to the primacy of the Antonian model and the Gospel of Matthew 19.21 in Franciscan thinking: Caput I: Quod fratres debent vivere sine proprio et in castitate et obedientia. Regula et vita istorum Fratrum haec est, scilicet vivere in obedientia, in castitate, et sine proprio; et Domini nostri Jesu Christi doctrinam, et vestigia sequi, qui dicit: Si vis perfectus esse, vade, et vende omnia quae habes et da pauperibus, et habebis thesaurum in coelo; et veni, sequere me 46. The reading from Mt. 19.21 is followed directly by Mt. 16.24, and Lc. 14.26, as Francis embraced a tri-part Gospel lesson, first by renouncing the worldly, then by following Christ47. Only the Mt. 19.21 text is retained in the Secunda Regula as the aspiring friars are called upon to read and follow, either literally or in spirit, the words of Christ to give all their worldly possessions to the poor: ?...dicant illis verbum sancti Evangelii, quod vadant, et vendant omnia sua, et ea studeant paupe ribus erogare. Quod si facere non potuerint, sufficit eis bona voluntas? 48. Thomas further remembers that Francis taught all his prospective followers the absolute im portance of obeying the verbum sancti Evangelii, i.e. Mt. 19.21: Docebat sanctus venientes ad Ordinem ante tradere mundo libellum repudii, prius sua foris, postea se intus Deo offerre. Nonnisi expropriates et nihil penitus retinentes ad Ordinem admittebat, turn propter verbum sancti Evangelii, turn ne forent in scandalum loculi re servati 49. St. Bonaventura also reminded his readers that St. Francis Docebat proinde, sicut revelatione didicerat, sacrae religionis ingressum ab illo fore in choandum evangelico verbo: Si vis perfectus esse, vade, vende omnia, quae habes, et da pau peribus 50. The reading which is most closely associated with Francis' own conversion was, instead, another one, Mt. 10.9-10, in which Christ encouraged his disciples to own tuale Piazza nuova si chiamo 41 monte di Sant'Antonio', per la sua brulla e selvaggia solitudine che la ren deva simile a una Tebaide. Si vuole che lassu, nelle selve e nelle caverne, si stabilissero gli anacoreti al dila gare delle invasioni barbariche. Fino dal tempo di San Francesco sorgeva in quell'estrema contrada cittadi na una chiesa, tuttora esistente, detta la 'cappella di Sant'Antonio'...

What remained from Antony's conversion was the act itself of first contemplating how the apostles left everything and followed Christ, then hearing as if by chance the Gospel, believing that the words were intended specifically for him, and finally following to the letter the message contained therein. Even with regards to the choice of text, i.e. by going beyond the Mt. 19.21 text, Francis was in fact emulat ing Antony's experience of Gospel revelation and conversion: although Antony had given primacy to Mt. 19.21, his conversion was not dependent on one text, but in stead steeped in many different Biblical references, including Mt. 4.20 and 19.27, Acts 4.35-37, Eph. 1.18, Col. 1.5, and Mt. 6.34 52. St. Augustine also, after recalling Antony's revelation-conversion based on Mt. 19.21, took up the codicem Apostoli, opened it, and in silence read the first chapter upon which he cast his eyes, and the reading was from Paul, Rom. 13.13 53. From the beginning to the end of his quest for spritual perfection, Francis, novus evangelista, repeated the act with ritual dev otion 54. The notion of an evolving conversion, which had been operative in Antony, is also found in Francis: as Thomas of Celano writes, near the end of his life Francis retreated to a solitary place, and ?borne along by the spirit of those saints and perfect men, who moved by the desire to be saintly, had done, as is read, the same thing?, he opened the Gospel to a passage on the Passion of Christ, which he interpreted as a direct foretelling of his own suffering and death, which ultimately signified his achievement of perfection 55. 51 ?Dum enim die quodam Missam de Apostolis devotus audiret, perlectum est Evangelium illud, in quo Christus 'discipulis' ad praedicandum mittendis formam tribuit evangelicam in vivendo, *ne videlicet possideant aurum vel argentum', nec in zonis pecuniam, nec 'peram in via', neque duas tunicas 'habeant', nec calceamenta deferant, neque virgam. Quod audiens et 'intelligens' ac memoriae commendans, apostoli cae paupertatis amicus 'indicibili mox' perfusus laetitia: 'Hoc est, inquit, quod cupio, hoc 'quod totis prae cordiis concupisco'?, in S. Bonaventura, Legenda maior, cap. 3, in Anal. Franc, X, 567. The conversion appeared previously in Thomas of Celano, Vita I, pars 1, cap. 9, and Thomas added a note regarding Francis' response to the Gospel: ?Non enim fuerat Evangelii surdus auditor, sed laudabili memoriae quae audierat cuncta commendans, ad litteram diligenter implere curabat? (Anal. Franc, X, 19). The conversion also appeared in other Franciscan writings, including: Fr. Iulianus de Spira O.F.M, Vita S. Francisci, cap. 3 (Anal. Franc, X, 342); Henricus Abrincensis, Legenda Sancti Francisci versificata, Lib. V, vv. 6-20 (Anal. Franc, X, 434); Legenda liturgica antiqua ordinis fratrum praedicatorum, Lectio II (Anal. Franc, X, 533); S. Bonaventura, Legenda minor S. Francisci, ?De institutione Religionis et efficacia praedicandi?, Lectio I (Anal. Franc, X, 658); Jacobus of Voragine, Vita S. Francisci, 1 (Anal. Franc, X, 682). The dra matic renunciation ?coram patre?, immortalized by Dante, Par. XI, vv. 61-62, also appears in Thomas of Celano Vita I, pars 1, cap. 6 (Anal. Franc, X, 14), and in S. Bonaventura, Legenda maior, 2, 4 (Anal. Franc, X, 564). Cfr. also Francis' perfecta conversione, in the church of St. Damian when Francis receives the word of God from the cross to rebuild His church, in Thomas of Celano Vita I, pars 1, cap. 8 (Anal. Franc, X, 16-18) and in S. Bonaventura, Legenda maior, 2 (Anal. Franc, X, 563-66). 52 The Gospel ?Nolite cogitare de crastino? (Mt. 6.34) seals Antony's complete break with the world ly. All the readings converge on Antony's conversion, in Vita Antonii, 2. 53 Conf. VIII, 12, 29. Augustine's friend, Alypius subsequently took the book from him and read until he reached Romans 14.1, which he applied to himself, and thus extended the evolution of conversion readings. 54 ?Summa eius intentio, praecipuum desiderium, supremumque propositum eius erat sanctum Evan gelium in omnibus et per omnia observare ac perfecte omni vigilantia, omni studio, toto desiderio mentis, toto cordis fervore, 'Domini nostri Iesu Christi doctrinam sequi et vestigia' imitari?, Thomas of Celano, Vita I, pars 1, cap. 30 (Anal. Franc, X, 63). 55 ?Nam cum esset perfectissimus perfectorum, perfectum abnuens, imperfectum se penitus reputabat ... et ut perfecte consummare valeret quod olim simpliciter et devote inceperat, quid sibi esset opportunius agere, in prima libri apertione indicari suppliciter precabatur. Sanctorum quippe ac perfectissimorum viro rum spiritu ducebatur, qui pia devotione in desiderio sanctitatis simile aliquid fecisse leguntur? (Vita I, pars 2, cap. 2, Anal. Franc, X, 70).

Franc, X,</page><page sequence="11">THE TRANSLATION OF ST. ANTONY 509 The specific Gospel text which had been so influential in St. Antony's conver sion is reserved for Francis' first disciple (and by extension, to all Franciscan followers), Bernardo, who upon entering the church of St. Nicholas in Assisi with Francis, and in accordance with Francis' instructions, opened the Gospels three times and prepared to follow the counsel given by each. The first reading that they chanced upon was from Mt. 19.21: Intraverunt proinde ecclesiam Sancti Nicolai mane iam facto, et oratione praemissa, cultor Trinitatis Franciscus ter Evangeliorum librum aperuit, trino exposcens a Deo testimonio sanctum Bernardi propositum confirmari. 'In prima libri apertione' illud occurrit: Si vis per fectus esse... 56. The conversion of Bernardo is recounted in the lives of Francis by both Thom as of Celano and St. Bonaventura, and repeated in the Actus Beati Francisci et sociorum eius and the Fioretti57. Francis' biographers and hagiographers firmly placed the Franciscan quest for evangelic perfection in an Antonian tradition and they saw conversion as a set of ritual experiences based on the repetition of a Gos pel text. Although they were more prone to consider Francis' own conversion as re lated more closely to a different Gospel reading, and even other saintly examples 58, 616); and also in Fr. Iulianus de Spira, Vita S. Francisci, cap. 11 (Anal. Franc, X, 363); Henricus Abrin censis, Legenda versificata, Lib. XII, vv. 26-36 (Anal. Franc, X, 478); and the Legenda monacensis S. Francisci, XXVI (Anal. Franc, X, 714). For similar acts of reading the Bible for guidance, see: Sulpicius Severus, De vita B. Martini, lib. 1, cap. 9 (PL, 20, 165-66); Sanctus Gregorius episcopus Turonensis, Hi storia Francorum, Lib. 5, 50. The likelihood that Thomas was thinking of Antony when he spoke of the ?spirit of those saints and perfect men? is supported by another reference to Antony by Thomas: ?Quam vis homo iste beatus nullis fuerit scientiae studiis innutritus ... Legebat quandoque in sacris libris, et quod animo semel iniecerat, indelebiliter scribebat in corde. 'Memoriam pro libris habebaf, quia non frustra se mel capiebat auditus quod continua devotione ruminabat affectus? (Vita II, pars 2, cap. 68, Anal. Franc, X, 190-91). In the Vita Antonii: ?Auditioni etiam Scripturarum ita studium commodabat, ut nihil ex eius animo laberetur, sed universa Domini praecepta custodiens memoriam pro libris haberet? (PL, 73, 128). 56 S. Bonaventura, Legenda maior, cap. 3, in Anal. Franc, X, 567-68. The other two readings are from Lc 9.3 and Mt. 16.24.

Franc, X, 139-40); Henricus Abrincensis, Legenda S. Francisci versificata, lib. V, vv. 109-15 (Anal. Franc, X, 437-38). Cfr. Delcorno, Le 'Vitae Patrum', 192. 57 In the Actus, for example: ?Inverunt ergo ad episcopatum; et, audita missa et oratione usque ad tertiam prolata, sumpsit sacerdos predictus missale ad rogamen s.

Moroni, Milano 1979, 64-65 (ed. based on that of Fioretti, a c. di G. Petrocchi, Alpignano 1972, in turn based on text established by B. Bu ghetti, Firenze 1926). In another of the Fioretti, the Gospel is paraphrased in the conversion effected by Francis of a young rich man: ?'Ecco, io sono apparecchiato, al tuo comandamento, dare a' poveri cio ch'io posseggo, e teco seguitare Cristo, cosi scaricato, d'ogni cosa temporale.' E cosi fece; che, secondo il consiglio di santo Francesco, egli distribui il suo a' poveri ed entrd nell'Ordine, e vivette in grande peniten za e santita di vita e conversazione onesta. A laude di Cristo. Amen? (I Fioretti, a c. di Moroni, 170). 58 Thomas of Celano even remembered the example, which Francis emulated, of St. Martin, who gave part of his cloak to a poor man: ?Quid minus hie a Martino illo sanctissimo gessit, nisi quod, licet unius propositi et operis forent, in modo tamen dissimiles? Hie primus vestes quam reliqua; ille, primo da tis omnibus, vestimenta dedit extremus: uterque pauper et modicus vixit in saeculo, uterque dives ingressus est caelum? (Vita II, pars. 1, cap. 2, Anal. Franc, X, 133).</page><page sequence="12">510 D. DUTSCHKE they were drawn together by the Gospel text of Mt. 19.21 in Bernardo's example and in the Regula. Through them, the experience of Antony, Augustine and Bernardo (as the first Franciscan convert)59, forms a coherent literary tradition bas ed on a single text. The importance of St. Antony and Egyptian monasticism for the Dominicans is represented by two hagiographic volumes that frame the almost hundred-year period that separates the composition of each: the Legenda aurea (drawn up between 1255 and 1266) by Jacobus of Voragine and the Vite dei santi padri (translated before 1333), of Domenico Cavalca 60. In the case of St. Antony, the principal source was the Versio Evagrii of the Vita Antonii attributed to Athanasius, and it was this text, including the episode of Antony's conversion, that was faithfully transmitted (through the Vitae Patrum) into each work. By the mid-fourteenth century, together with the Vita Antonii, Vitae Patrum, Palladius' Historia Lausiaca, Apophthegmata Patrum, the Historia monachorum in Aegypto (attributed to Rufinus), the collec tions of legends, the Legenda aurea and Vite dei santi padri offered a vast re pository for the monastic and mendicant orders, preachers, as well as religious and secular writers, in Latin and the vernacular. As Giordano da Pisa stated in his sermon on August 5, 1303, Leggesi di quello grande Santo Antonio d'Egitto, che fu cosi grande santo, il quale e commendato di cotanta penitenza, che fece cosi grande astinenza, e stette in tanta contempla zione 61. The account of Antony's conversion derived from or transmitted through this repository became the authoritative text, entering appropriately into the Breviary lessons for the feast of St. Antony: Antonius Aegyptius, nobilibus et christianis parentibus natus, quibus adolescens orbatus est, cum ingressus ecclesiam ex Evangelio audivisset: Si vis perfectus esse, vade, et vende omnia quae habes, et da pauperibus; tamquam ea sibi dicta essent sic Christo Domino obtemperandum existimavit. Itaque, vendita re familiari, pecuniam omnem pauperibus distribuit62. For Francis, the reading of the Gospel was a personal revelation, literal and unglossed. For Petrarch, who also recalled Antony's conversion and the accompany ing text, Mt. 19.21, as he ascended Mount Ventoux (Fam. 4, 1), the reaction and interpretation to Antony's conversion were significantly different: Petrarch instead confirmed the literary and spiritual authority of Antony's example, in an inter-per sonal interpretation of the texts, including Mt. 19.21, which he had translated (translatio) from the Vita Antonii and from Augustine, and which he glossed in a 59 Cfr. Dante, Par. IX, 79-81, who may well have been referring to Bernardo in: ?tanto che '1 vene rabile Bernardo/ si scalzo prima, e dietro a tanta pace/ corse e, correndo, li parve esser tardo?, Dante Ali ghieri, La Commedia secondo Vantica vulgata, a c. di G.

Step by step, Petrarch peeled off each succeeding layer of the history of the transmission of the text, from his own chance reading and reac tion to Augustine's Confessions, VIII, 12, to Augustine's reading of Paul, Rom. 13.13, and Antony's reading of Mt. 19.21 according to the Vita Antonii: Quod iam ante Antonio acciderat, quando audito Evangelio ubi scriptum est: 'Si vis per fectus esse, vade et vende omnia tua quecunque habes et da pauperibus, et veni et sequere me et habebis thesaurum in celis,' 'veluti propter se hec esset scriptura recitata' ut scriptor rerum eius Athanasius ait 'ad se dominicum traxit imperium'64. The recapitulation of the text triggers a referential thought process in Petrarch which paradoxically draws him near to his predecessors, as he asks for nothing more, like Antony, and he proceeds no further, like Augustine, but unlike Anthony and Augustine, Petrarch undergoes no complete spiritual conversion. His experience has been, as he himself admits, a lectio 65, a reading that has drawn his attention to an irresolute moral question. In place of conversion, Petrarch projects his thoughts forward to the literary effects of the profoundly moving experience: when upon hav ing descended Mount Ventoux and having returned ironically to the point where he began, his sole intention is to write to Dionigi de' Roberti da Borgo San Sepolcro, to preserve the moment, and to reveal his vague and uncertain thoughts 66. As Giuseppe Billanovich has demonstrated, those thoughts had matured from the year 1336, assigned by Petrarch to the letter, to the actual date of composition of 1353, and they reflected Petrarch's readings of the classics and church fathers, champion ed respectively by Livy and St. Augustine 67. Petrarch's knowledge about and interest in St. Antony was not limited to the isolated reference in Fam. 4, 1. Although no surviving manuscript of the Vita Antonii has been identified as having belonged to Petrarch, nor is there any mention of it in Petrarch's list of books, there are references in his writings that indicate the poet's intimate familiarity with and ownership of a copy of the Vita Antonii (which he attributed to Athanasius), as it was contained in the Vitae pat rum. In a letter (Sen. 8, 6) dated June 10, 1367, Petrarch suggested to Donato Albanzani a number of ?res ad salutem utilissimas?: Scripsere &amp; alii multi, res ad salutem utilissimas, de his loquor, non quae scientia im plent, &amp; saepe inflant, sed quae devotione humili, humanum animum accendunt, ut collationes patrum &amp; patrum vitas.

DUTSCHKE In his letter, Fam. 10, 3, written in 1348, encouraging his brother to persevere in his novitiate as a Carthusian, Petrarch calls upon the examples of John the Bapt ist, Antony, Macarius, and if they are too austere, then Benedict, or also Augustine and Arsenius, all ascetics who shunned the world. He then lists the books that are best suited for his purpose, and the Vitae patrum is the first entry that he encour ages his brother to read: Habes Patrum vitas; illas perlege, ut facis; ibi amicum invenies, quern testem secretis consiliis non recuses, quo conscio te ipsum vitamque modereris tuam, sine quo denique nichil agas nichil cogites69. Petrarch followed his own advice, reading and gathering examples of hermits for the De vita solitaria from the Vitae patrum. Although at the beginning of the second book he warns that he does not intend to transcribe the whole Vitae patrum 70, he does not escape giving a long list of solitary saints whose main source was indeed the Vitae patrum. One of the most illustrious examples was St. Antony, who had become one of the most famous and glorious (nobilitatus et gloriosus): ...adeo nobilitatus et gloriosus effectus est, ut Cristus homunculum suum egiptiace solitudinis latebris abditum, et, ut ipsius Athanasii heredis atque historici sui verbis utar, 'alio pene orbe celatum, Africe, Hispanie, Gallie, Italie, Illirico, ipsi etiam que urbium caput est Rome, ut in exordio promiserat', demonstrarit71. Petrarch was quoting directly from Athanasius, Vita Antonii, Versio Evagrii as it most likely appeared in the copy of the Vitae patrum in his library 72. Immediately preceding Petrarch-Anthanasius' declaration of Antony's widespread fame, Petrarch had made reference to episodes from the second half of Antony's life (following Antony's candidacy for martyrdon under Maximin Daja), and all the episodes, save for the meeting with Paul, derive directly from the Versio Evagrii of the Vita Antonii73. The source of the meeting between Antony and Paul is the Vita Pauli by St. Jerome, a text which is also in the Vitae patrum (PL, 23, 22-27). The life of St. Antony, from his conversion to the meeting between Antony and Paul, forms an authoritative devotional subtext for the important corpus of Petrarch's prose works, especially those focussed on spiritual conversion and solitary life 74. The Antony who appeared within the pages of Fam. 4, 1, Fam. 10, 3, Sen. 69 Petrarca, Prose, 936-38. Other readings suggested by Petrarch are: Gregory, Dialogues; Augusti ne, Soliloquies and Confessions; and the Psalter. 70 ?Illud ne expectaveris, ut transcribam tibi, quas vocant patrum vitas? (De vita solitaria, Lib. 2, Petrarca, Prose, 406). 71 De vita solitaria, Lib. 2, in Petrarca, Prose, 416. 72 ?... qui devotos eius animos erga suam praevidens majestatem, hominem alio pene orbe celatum, et inter tantas positum solitudines, Africae, Hispaniae, Galliae, Italiae, Illyrico, ipsi etiam, quae urbium ca put est, Romae, ut in exordio promiserat, demostravit? (Vita Antonii, PL, 73, 168). 73 Petrarch's interest is concentrated on the second half of the Vita Antonii: the hermitage inhabited by beasts ? V.A., 48; Anthony's fame and popularity in the form of visits by many persons ? V.A., 48-49; Antony's bewilderment next to the river ? V.A., 49; a voice from the heavens counsels Antony through two contrasting questions (loosely paraphrased by Petrarch) ? V.A., 49; Antony's departure for the desert, with a guide sent by God ? V.A., 50; Antony's encounter with the demons ? V.A., 51; An tony's discussions with the philosophers ? V.A., 72-80; and the letters from Constantine and his sons to Antony ? V.A., 81. 74 Regarding the veracity of Athanasius, cfr. Petrarch's praise of him as a reliable witness of the widespread acceptance of the Roman Catholic religion: ?... ad Iovianum Augustum missa fidelis Athanasii testatur epystola, non famam sequentis sed comperta referentis et, ut ipse ait, experimento sententiam om</page><page sequence="15">THE TRANSLATION OF ST. ANTONY 513 8, 6, Sen. 17, 2, and in the De vita solitaria was the Antony that Petrarch found in his reading of the Vitae patrurn, a compendium of solitary saints' lives that contain ed the Versio Evagrii of the Vita Antonii. That reading proved to be as intense and profitable as Petrarch had declared in the De vita solitaria: que copiosa et amena et varia et penetrabilis atque ignea lectio est et que, preciose materie filum habens ac magnis texta ingeniis, natura pariter atque arte delectet75. Through Petrarch, the life of Antony reached a culminating point in the literary transmission and reception of one of its most important texts, the Vita Antonii. In the De vita solitaria, Petrarch praised the growth and vitality of the ascetic and ere mitical orders of the Cistercians, Maiellans, Carthusians, Vallumbrosans and Camaldolese by adopting the image of streams descending and spreading out into the valley, and into mighty rivers, but the source of each one is found in that most harsh and solitary mountains 76. The image is appropriate for the ultimate source of eremitical life, Antony, and the text that conveyed his life from the remote Egyptian desert mountains (through accounts handed down carefully by Greek and Roman wr iters, as Jerorrie had put it)77 to the poet's writing desk 78. As intended by its author, the Vita Antonii was indeed to be read to and by monks (fratribus) and also by the heathens (gentibus)19. Between these two extremes, together with the famous reli gious example of Augustine and the equally famous secular example of Petrarch, nium cognoscentis, et literarum pignus hominumque notitiam habentis?, De vita solitaria, Lib. 2, in Pe trarca, Prose, 490. 75 De vita solitaria, Lib. 2, in Petrarca, Prose, 418. 76 ?Longum est enumerare qui deinceps viri et quales, huius vestigia secuti et vel claritate ducis et exempli stimulis, vel inclinatione nature, vel divinis oraculis admoniti, religionum venerabilium fundatores, varias solitudines petiere. Indicio nunc etiam sunt sacra cenobia, et inter spelea silvestria devotissime domus Cristi: Cistertium, Maiella, Cartusia, Vallisumbrosa, Camaldulum, innumerabilesque alie; quarum religio num rivi, etsi celesti devotionis augmento postmodum longe lateque diffusi sint et plana compleverint, si tamen ut magnorum fluminum fontes sic harum queris origines, ex asperrimis montibus emanasse compe ries? (De vita solitaria, Lib. 2, in Petrarca, Prose, 450-52). 77 ?Igitur quia de Antonio tam Graeco quam Romano stylo diligenter memoriae traditum est?, Jero me, Vita S. Pauli primi eremitae, in PL, 23, 18. 78 The similar image of flowing water is used by Giordano da Pisa to indicate the transmission of Scripture through preaching: ?e come il canale, che la Scrittura entra per lui da la fonte della Scrittura, e versa al popolo; non ci ha che ffare nulla, pero ch'elle non sono sue parole? (Giordano da Pisa, in ?Santa Maria Novella il calendi marzo 1306?, Quaresimale fiorentino 1305-1306, ed. critica per c. di C. Delcor no, Firenze 1974, 144). 79 ?Hunc itaque fratribus librum magnopere perlegere curate, ut, agnita fideli vita sublimium chri stianorum et monachorum, sciant quod Salvator noster Jesus Christus glorificantes se glorificat, et servien tibus sibimet, non tantum regna coelorum, sed etiam hie in ipsis montium secretis latere cupientibus, famae tribuit nobilitatem; scilicet, ut et ipsi fruantur laude meritorum, et caeteri eorum provocentur exemplis. Si autem necessarium fuerit, et gentibus legite, ut vel sic agnoscant quia Dominus noster Jesus Christus non solum est Deus, Dei Filius, sed etiam his qui eum sollicite colunt, et in eum fideliter credunt, hanc dedit potestatem, ut daemones, quos illi deos esse arbitrantur, conculcent atque ijiciant deceptores scilicet homi num et totius corruptionis artifices? (PL, 73, 168). Two of the most curious examples of the unorthodox transmission of the Gospel text, Mt. 19.21, and thus of the Vita Antonii, are found in the conversion of the founder of the Waldenses, Pierre Valdes (A. Dondaine O.P., Aux origines du Valdeisme une profes sion de foi de Valdes, ?Archivum Fratrum Praedicatorum?, 16, 1946, 214-17, and 191); and, Valla's dialo gue against the privileges of the monastic orders, De professione religiosorum, in which Valla questions the validity of renouncing everything: ?Frater. Cur non vendis omnia et das pauperibus? Laurentius. Etiamne libros vendam et erogabo? Apostolis praeceptum est hoc et illis quibus sine libris, sine studio, sine praeme ditatione tributum erat ut princibus responderant. Mihi vero codices necessarii sunt et pecuniae eaeque non paucae, unde codices plurimos ac cetera vitae praesidia coemam? (Laurentius Valla, Opera omnia, con una premessa di E. Garin, II, Torino 1962, 312).</page><page sequence="16">514 D. DUTSCHKE there emerged in the fourteenth century those anonymous members of lay confrater nities, including the Compagnia di St. Antonio in Arezzo, who also sang the praises of Antony's conversion 80: Noi sapemo cierto come tu '1 sapesti ch'al mare de la pieta tu recorresti colla tua redita c'ai povari desti, con pura e viva santa consciencia. (UK 8, vv. 15-18) Petrarch did not fail to point out another of the most important images of Antony to flow directly from that solitary source of the Vita Antonii: by nominating Antony as the victor over the demons of temptation, ?omnes demonum vicit insul tus? 81, Petrarch was isolating one of the most frequently recurring themes in the Vita Antonii, that is, Antony's struggles with the devils. The thematic premise of the struggle is set in one of the first encounters in which the devil, fearing that Antony will fill the desert with his asceticism, unleashes a great number of demons: ... nam et bestiarum et serpentium formas induentes, omnem protinus locum replevere phantasiis leonum, taurorum, luporum, aspidum, serpentium, scorpionum, necnon et par dorum atque ursorum. Et haec singula secundum suam fremebant naturam. Rugiebat leo, occidere volens; taurus mugitu et cornibus minabatur; serpens sibilo personabat; luporum impe tus ingerebantur; pardus discoloriter auctoris sui calliditates varias indicabat. Truces omnium vultus, et vocis horridae dirus auditus. Antonius flagellatus atque confossus sentiebat quidem asperiores corporis dolores, sed imperterritus durabat mente pervigili82. The beasts torment Antony unmercifully until the appearance of Christ: Non oblitus Jesus colluctationis servi sui, eidem protector factus est. Denique cum elevaret oculos, vidit desuper culmen aperiri, et, deductis tenebris, radium ad se lucis influere. Post cujus splendoris adventum nec daemonum aliquis apparuit, et corporis dolor extemplo deletus est. Aedificium quoque, quod paulo ante dissolutum fuerat, instauratum est. Illico praesentiam Domini intellexit Antonius, et ex intimo pectore trahens longa suspiria, ad lumen quod ei apparuerat loquebatur, dicens: Ubi eras, bone Jesu? ubi eras? Quare non a principio adfuisti, ut sanares vulnera mea? Et vox ad eum facta est, dicens: Antoni, hie eram, sed ex pectabam videre certamen tuum. Nunc autem, quia dimicando viriliter non cessisti, semper auxiliabor tibi, et faciam te in omni orbe nominari83. With its high quotient of colorful beastly imagery and dramatic representation, the episode forms a self contained nucleus that is transmitted in its entirety through a variety of texts, and over an extended period of time: Vita Antonii, Vitae 80 The transmission of the text of the Vita Antonii, especially through the Vitae Patrum, according to Delcorno is, ?un tipo di spiritualita che peraltro raggiunge gruppi di laici attenti ad un esercizio piu con sapevole della religiosita, e soprattutto i membri delle confraternite dirette dagli Eremiti di S. Agostino. Basti ricordare lo splendido laudario illustrato del Banco Rari 18 della Biblioteca di S. Spirito? (Delcorno, Le 'Vitae Patrum', 203-04). 81 The reference is followed by: ?Ut tot iam spiritalibus bellis victor, tot invisibilium hostium exerci tibus triumphatis, cum ad nonagesimum vite annum pervenisset et, nullo uspiam apparente hominum, se iam solum heremicolam cogitaret, multo vetustiorem atque remotiorem solitudinis incolam alterius, Paulum Thebeum, querere admonitus revelatione nocturna, paruit: quesivit, invenit, horrificis in itinere primum monstris inventis?

Quare non affuisti a principio, ut me eriperes de manibus pessimorum, qui me adversantur inique?' Et dixit Ihe sus: 'Antoni, hie eram, sed expectabam videre certamen tuum. Nunc autem, quia ad dimicandum viriliter non cessasti, ecce ego tecum sum et faciam te nominari in toto orbe terrarum'? (Halkin, Une histoire, 248-49); Halkin notes the almost exact quote from Vita Antonii, 10. Cfr. also the Translacio sanctissimi confessoris Anthonii abbatis et heremite a Constantinopoli in Viennam: ?Sed non impossibile hoc idcirco estimari debet, quia Dominus Iesus, sicut in textu Vite beati viri legitur, superato demonum conflictu visi biliter ei apparens et quam suavis sit ostendens, inter cetera repromisit asserens quod per totum orbem ter rarum faceret eum nominari.

Et por ce que tu as tes aversaires sormontex, je ferei de toi parler par tout le monde' (Jean de Mailly, Abbreviatid)95. Although it would appear that even Francis of Assisi absorbed something of the influence of St. Antony's struggles with the devil96, the major arena for the art minus Iesus Christus manu sua habitum qui vocatur in arabico calezeut, et cinxit ilium manu sua zona que vocatur esary. Et dixit illi: 'In hoc erit tibi victoria contra inimicum et in hoc confringes exercitum eius et adnichilabis astucias eius et dissolves robur eius et humiliabis eum sub pedibus tuis? (Halkin, La legende de saint Antoine, 205); in this version, the scene has been added in which Christ gives Antony the habit which, coincidentally, will become the habit of the Antonines, ?Et tune induit eum Dominus Iesus Christus manu sua habitum ...? (Halkin, La legende de saint Antoine, 205). See also the verses in honor of St. An tony in the eleventh-century manuscript from monastery of San Pietro in Gessate (Milan): ?Tunc sacer An tonius dictis sublimibus infit:/ Die ubi, dux Iesu, die ubi, pastor, erasl/ Olli subridens: Aderam, sed fas ti bi fido / Decertare fuit nunc, ait, ut decuitJ Quocirca totas renitens fundetur in oras/ Maxima fama tui; tu quoque victor eris?

(Beato Iacopo da Varagine, Leggenda aurea, a c. di A. Levasti, 206); and also the fourteenth-century Sacra rappresentazione di sant'Antonio, ?Vanno i demoni a mazicare Antonio, e quando I'hanno mazicato se ne vanno, e Antonio dice vedendo Jesu apparire./ O buon Jesu, or dove se' tu stato/ in questo tempo della pena mia?/ Vedi e' dimon come e' m'hanno straziato!/ Come consenti tu che questo sia?/ Risponde Jesu ad Antonio e dice:/ Non dubitar, Anton, che in ogni stato/ la grazia mia con teco sempre fia./ Io ho voluto provar tua costanza;/ Va' segui il tuo ben far con isperanza? (Rappresentazione di Sant'Antonio, in Sacre rappresentazioni dei secoli XIV, XV e XVI, 54). The same scene appears also in: ?Et allora ecco Christo et apparse allo beato Antonio, lo quale dixe: 'O Singnore, potisti vi esse da primo cqua ay me facto tanto rompere l'ossa ch' me ayno lassa to per morto et non me avite aiutato?'

Translations of the Versio Evagrii of the Vita Antonii into French began to appear in the twelfth century: between 1176 and 1181, Baudouin II, comte de Guines et d'Ardres, had a translation (now lost) made by a ?maitre Landri de Waben?; and, in the thirteenth cen tury, Wauchier de Denain made an abbreviated translation into French, which circulated widely.

During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the scene of the demons beating Antony is taken up by, to name only a few painters, Sassetta, Bernardo Parentino, Martin Schongauer, Matthias Nithart (Griinewald), Lucas Cranach, Hieronymous Bosch, the illuminator of the Grimani Breviary, and Simon Bening 98. If these centuries marked the apogee of St. Antony's cult and the artistic representation of the saint's struggle with demons ", we cannot ignore, however, the vast amount of painting (fresco, panel, manuscript illumination), sculpture and stained glass win dows, produced in Europe prior to the fifteenth century, in which the saint is re presented not only as a solemn bearded old man with his attributes (Tau cross, bell, Tantony pig), but also in the three principal scenes of his life, in which he hears the Gospel of Matthew and gives everything to the poor, he battles demons, and he meets and shares with Paul the loaf of bread brought by a raven; the source of the first two is the Vita Antonii, the third is based on Jerome's Vita Pauli, and all three are contained in the Vitae Patrum 10?. The thirteenth-century stained glass windows in the cathedral at Chartres contain all three scenes among the twenty-one whose main sources are the Vita Antonii and Jerome's Vita Pauli101. In the church of San Sepolcro in Barletta, the twelfth-thirteenth-century frescoes (severely damaged) depict the scenes of Antony's conversion and his battle with the demons. The twelf th-thirteenth-century frescoes in the church of St. Angelo in Formis, in Rome, depict the battle with the demons and the meeting with Paul. Agnolo Gaddi h&amp;s in cluded all three scenes in his frescoes for the Castellani chapel in the church of dente Ferrari (active 1500-1535) in Villa Palmieri (Florence), of the temptations of St. Francis, in which Francis is depicted kneeling at the altar upon which rests a statue of the Virgin, and Francis is surrounded by four monstrous beasts lashing out at him with their claws (E. Castelli, // demoniaco nelVarte, Milano Firenze 1952, 97, plate X). 97 Leclercq, Saint Antoine, 241. 98 All are cited in L.

Even earlier depictions of Antony (episodes of Antony's meeting with Paul, and pos sibly the earliest depiction of the temptation of Antony, in which Christ appears) are found in the in the twelfth-century decorations of the column capitals in the abbey Vezelay (E. Male, L'Art religieux du XHe siecle en France, Paris 1922, 237-39; cfr. Morawski, La legende, 35). One of the earliest Italian depictions of Antony's struggle with demons is found in the tenth-century frescoes (ruined), in the Oratorio di S. An tonio, in the church of S. Maria Antiqua, Rome (Kaftal, Iconography of the Saints in Central and South Italian Schools of Painting, 81).</page><page sequence="20">518 D. DUTSCHKE Santa Croce in Florence 102. Throughout Italy in the fourteenth-century, the battle with the demons appears in fresco wall paintings: the Le Campora (Florence) frescoes, executed by an artist close to Maso di Banco (before 1350), include the scene of the demons and the meeting with Paul; the frescoes in the fourth chapel of the church of San Francesco, in Montefalco, Umbrian school XlV-XVth century, contain the scenes of the conversion episode and the battle with the demons; Pisa, Campo Santo, Traini and assistants, frescoes of the battle with demons and the meeting with Paul; in the church of San Francesco, in Bassano, the fresco in the ex chapter room, now library, by an artist of the late fourteenth-century Veneto school, includes the conversion and the battle with the devils 103. One can only con clude that the three scenes were a familiar sight in churches throughout Italy by the thirteenth century, and that they not only constituted concrete visual examples of the well-read Vita Antonii, but also extended the transmission of the hagiographical text far beyond its literary origins, forcing each episode to its historical and fictive limits, and reached a significantly larger and more varied (religious and secular) audience. Our understanding of the extent of the diffusion of the devils' scene, and other scenes from Antony's life, is limited by the extensive but still partial census of paintings in churches (Reau, Kaftal, etc.). This ignorance is especially evident with regards to small urban centers and rural areas in Italy. For example, in Feltre (North Eastern Italy) and environs, Antony's life enjoys widespread popularity in painting: in the church of St. Antony in Bardies, there are frescoes, by Giovanni da Mel and Cesare Vecellio, of Antony with his simbols of the Tau cross and bell, of Antony's conversion, his battle with the demons, his vision of an altar being kicked by beasts of burden, and Antony's death and burial 104. Antony also appears in the paintings of other churches: Ognissanti in Borgo Rua; Santa Maria Assunta in Servo; San Giorgio in Sorriva; church dedicated to St. Gottardo and Mary Magdalene in Fol; San Giacomo Maggiore in Colderu; San Donato in Lentiai, depicted with one or more of his simbols (with a letter T on his shoulder, holding a flame, a Tau cross, bell, and with a pig at his feet), not to mention the many others throughout the peninsula that could be cited 105. The artist joined the writer as trans mitter of the text, and the audience became the reader-viewer. The most pronounced case of this process of literal and pictoral translatio is the one regarding the episode of Antony's battle with the demons: the myriad of different images of demons beat ing Antony, not only in wall frescoes and panel paintings from the fourteenth century onwards, but also the manuscript illustrations, all attest also to the creative imagination of the artist, who, with a common set of iconographic elements, sought to illustrate the text. For example, in a manuscript of the Vitae Patrum (New York, Pierpont Morgan Library, M626), written and illuminated in Naples in the second half of the fourteenth century, on f. 6v, Antony is seen being beaten by an thropomorphic demons wielding clubs (not the phantoms of lions, bears, leopards, 102 Kaftal, Iconography of the Saints in Tuscan Painting, 64 and 69. See also: B.

Roberto Salvini asserts that the scene of Antony against the demons was painted by Gherardo Stamina, not Gaddi, in L'arte di Agnolo Gaddi, Firenze 1936, 183, pi. 21. 103 All of the frescoes are cited and described in the four volumes by Kaftal, Iconography of the Saints.

In a miniature of a Franciscan missal, executed about 1380 in Lombardy (Paris, Bibl. Nat., Latin 757, f. 373), Antony lies prostrate and is attacked by a lion, dragon, goat and a dog 107. In the frescoes of the Castellani chapel, attributed to Agnolo Gaddi, there is a similar representation (also departing from the Vita Antonii version, by depic ting the demons as horned men with masks, bat wings and claw feet, beating Antony with clubs), but one that includes the vision of Christ 108. In the fifteenth century fresco in the choir of the church of s. Antonio in Cascia (Umbrian school), Antony is seen lying down asleep, with a snake on his breast, a lion and monkey chewing on his legs and feet, and two standing demons in human form who are beating him with a club; Christ does not appear 109. In the panel in the Yale University Art Gallery, attributed to Sassetta (Maestro delFOsservanza, ac cording to Carli) no, the saint is lying on the ground with two demons above beat ing him with clubs, and another holding a snake and flying towards him; all the demons are anthropomorphic, with masks and horns, bat wings and claw feet. A predella painting by Sassetta, now in Siena, Pinacoteca Nazionale, n. 166, shows Antony being beaten by two demons (faces ruined) while another, holding two snakes, hovers above them; the devils have horns, wings and claw feet 111. These fanciful depictions of demons, anthropomorphic figures who flagellate Antony, are pale precursors of the grotesque demonic monsters of Martin Schongauer's engrav ing, Matthias Nithart's (Griinewald) Isenheimer Altarpiece, and Hieronymus Bosch's Lisbon triptych 112. Rather than adhere faithfully to the narrative, they seem to have been more prone to responding to Antony's warning to his fellow monks that the forces of evil ?are treacherous and prepared to undergo every change and transformation)) 113, as well as succumbing to external influence beyond the pages of the Vita Antonii114. Through them, the transmission of the Vita Antonii reached a highly splintered phase of development. Whereas the writ ten text had flowed in relatively pure form, through the transcriptions, translations and rewritings of the Vita Antonii (retaining in most cases the intensely spiritual message of each episode, as was particularly the case with the conversion of Antony), the pictorial representations instead transformed the narrative into spec tacular images which, as in the case of the battle with the demons, became only 106 There are eleven miniatures representing Antony, and the main theme is Antony's struggle with the devil: f. 5v, the devil offers Antony a crown and jewels, and a horned woman offers herself to An tony; f. 6, the horned devil kneels before Antony; f. 6v, encouraged by the devil, demons beat Antony; f. 7, the devil, with his tongue out, offers a silver bowl to Antony; f. 9v, Antony chases away devils; f. 10, Antony chases away devils; f. lOv, Antony prays against devils; f. 11, Antony prays as an angel chases away devils; f. 12, Antony confronts two devils and a dragon; f. 12v, Antony and his disciples are confronted by the devil; f. 14, Antony chases away devils.

The verses of UK are suspended somewhere between the textual source and the pictoral rendering to the battle with the demons: A la bataglia fosti puoi chiamato et comme paglia battut' e fragellato, senca altra maglia per morto lassato, po' confortato da Cristo salvatore. Romito santo, vedesti la luce de Iesu tanto gratioso duce, con dolce canto gridasti ad alta boce 'Dove se' stato, o mi' defensore'? Tosto respose: 'Era qui presente e le noiose guerre virilmente vittoriose feci giustamente, e per tutto '1 mondo te faro honore'. (UK 17, vv. 23-34) The availability and reliability of source material, the fidelity to truth, history vis-a-vis hagiography, so blatantly circumvented in pictorial representations of Antony's struggle with demons, may well be considered to be the main concern of the life of Antony from its onset. Athanasius indicated his belief in reports by others, noted that he would recount very little of the whole story, reminded his readers that few recollections would not suffice, and that other witnesses were to be sought out, so that the complete congrua dignaque relatio could be achieved 116. If we are to acknowledge Athanasius as the initiator of the life of Antony, it was in tended to be an open ended life (even if the preface is a literary commonplace) 117, as we are also encouraged by the author himself to witness the expansion of it through the addition of complementary stories, all of which are expected to con verge into a complete account (relatio) of Antony's life. One of the first to add to the Vita Antonii was Jerome, in the Vita Pauli. Jerome's account of Paul's life is actually about the fateful meeting between Antony and Paul, in which Antony is the main figure of the narrative: 1) It is revealed to Antony that there is a monk (Paul) better that he, and Antony decides to visit him; 2) during the journey, Antony comes upon a hippocentaur, a satyr, and a she wolf, all of whom help lead him to Paul; 3) Antony meets Paul, and shares a loaf of bread brought by a raven; 4) Paul dies and Antony, with the help of two lions, buries him. Throughout, Paul retains his role as a secondary figure to Antony, and it is as much a case of Antony's life being expanded as Paul's being introduced. The expansion of Antony's life carried with it the extension of the truth which was compromised by the addi 115 Evidence of the gradual process of distancing the painting from the original source is the trans formation of the demons from the fourteenth-century anthropomorphic figures who appear to be flagella ting Antony (evoking the flagellation of Christ), to the monsters, unlike any human or animal figures, that were conjured up in later centuries. Cfr. Castelli, // demoniaco. 1,6 ?Ergo ut breviter dicam, et omnibus, quae de eo referentium sermo jactavit credite, et minima vos existimate audisse de maximis; quia non ambigo nec eos omnia potuisse cognoscere, cum et ego roga tus a vobis, quantacunque per epistolam significavero, non aequalia sim ejus meritis narraturus. Sed et vos omnes hinc navigantes studiose percontamini, quo, singulis quae norunt referentibus, congrua dignaque tanti nominis relatio compleatur?

ANTONY 521 tional marvelous elements (hippocentaur, satyr, wolves, raven, lions). This is not to say that the Vita Antonii is devoid of the marvelous, for the demons appear on almost every other page 118. Even though he stated in the introduction of the Vita Pauli that, Nonnulli haec et alia, prout voluntas tulit, jactitant: subterraneo specu crinitumcalcaneo tenus hominem fuisse, et multa quae persegui otiosum est eincredibilia fingentes. Quorum quia impudens mendacium fuit, ne refellenda quidem sententia videtur 119. Jerome nonetheless added many marvelous tales about Antony and Paul in the Vita Pauli. Ever sensitive to the verisimilitude of his life of Paul, he offered a rationalization for each marvelous event: 1) the hippocentaur, that appears and dis appears before Antony's wondering eyes, is described as having been created by the devil or the desert, both of which breed monstrous beasts (PL, 23, 23); 2) for the incredulous, Jerome submits physical evidence of a satyr preserved in Alexandria, packed in salt lest it should disintegrate in the heat of the summer (PL, 23, 23-25); 3) the shewolf leads Antony to Paul, but only by returning naturally to its own cave (PL, 23, 25); 4) the exceptional act of the raven bringing a loaf of bread is explain ed away by Paul who tells Antony that it is an act of the merciful, compassionate God, and he adds that previously the raven brought only a half loaf for Paul (PL, 23, 25-26) ; 5) the lions appear as if sent by God to represent the universal mourn ing for the death of Paul, so that even the dumb beasts may feel that there is a God (PL, 23, 28). All contributed towards the creation of a popular ?fantastica leg genda?, to use Noordeloos' term 120. As Rose Graham noted, ?The story which he told in a charming and poetic style appealed to the popular imagination, it had a great and immediate success in Rome, and was as widely read in the Middle Ages as the Vita Antonii of St. Athanasius? 121. All the marvelous events of the Vita Pauli were repeated over and over again in the many copies of the Vitae Patrum, Domenico Cavalca, Vite dei santi padri, and Jacopo da Voragine, Legenda aurea. The meeting between Antony and Paul even provided the literary inspiration for a touching comment by Petrarch regarding his friendship with Boccaccio. In one of his last letters, Sen. 17, 2, written to Boccaccio in 1373, Petrarch isolates a particular from that meeting to affectionately compare their friendship to that of the famous hermits, for whom one portion of bread should be, as it had been for Paul and Antony, enough to maintain their equanimity. Qui si Paulo et Antonio famosissimis olim heremicolis satis fuit, cur non nobis etiam satis sit? Non sumus paris meriti; panis tamen ille conditus mutua caritate et, quamvis non corvi rostro, ab eodem tamen Domino missus erit.

All the episodes became prime sources for pictorial representations of the lives of Antony and Paul, principally in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries 123, and they thereby transmitted the text to a far wider religious and secular audience than would have been possible through written form. As the Dominican friar Alphonsus Bonihominis, who in 1342 translated a legend of Antony's life, remarked in the dedicatory letter to his translation, St. Antony's notoriety, based on written sources to which Bonihominis himself intended to add yet another example, was represented principally in the pervasive form of painted images in churches: ?De sanctis etiam confessoribus anachoritis [i.e. Antony, Macarius], quorum nomina sunt in honore apud nos et quorum ymagines in nostris ecclesiis depinguntur...? 124. The marvelous elements from the Vita Pauli are prominent in the paintings found in Italian churches, as for example in the porch frescoes of the basilica in S. Angelo in Formis (Campanian school, twelfth century) 125, in the panels ascribed to Martino di Bartolommeo 126, the frescoes by Giacomo Jaquerio in the Antonine church of S. Antonio di Ranverso 127, the frescoes in the church of S. Fiorenzo in Bastia Mondovi 128, the late fifteenth-century frescoes (School of Nice) in the 122 Petrarca, Prose, 1138. The source of the meeting between Antony and Paul is the Vita Pauli by St. Jerome: ?Inter has sermocinationes suspiciunt alitem corvum in ramo arboris consedisse, qui inde leni ter subvolabat, et integrum panem ante ora mirantium deposuit; post cuius abscessum: Eia, inquit Paulus, Dominus nobis prandium misit, vere pius, vere misericors. Sexaginta iam anni sunt quod dimidii semper panis fragmentum accipio: verum ad adventum tuum, militibus suis Christus duplicavit annonam? (PL, 23, 25-26). 123 In addition to the paintings of the fourteenth century already cited above, many examples from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are listed in Reau, Kaftal, Graham, Ferrari and Kaiser (see above). 124 The translator continues, noting that, by comparison, the Western World has many fewer exam ples than Egypt: ?... respective ad ilia que habent Egipeii monachi habuimus valde pauca; et ut de pluribus taceam de quibus non est modo dicendum per singula, de beatissimis Anthonio [et Enufrio] et Machario preter ilia que nobis Ieronimus contulit sunt apud dictos monachos facta et dicta alia in libris eorum ma gnifica et preclara; de quibus libris immediate de duobus sanctis predictis hec transtuli in latinum que in hoc parvo volumine continentur? (Halkin, La legende de Saint Antoine, 158-59). 125 The frescoes include, in addition to Antony being beaten by demons, Antony's meeting the satyr, his arrival at Paul's retreat, the embrace between Antony and Paul, the raven bringing a loaf of bread to Antony and Paul, Antony and Paul breaking the bread brought by the raven, and Antony seeing Paul's soul being carried to heaven (Kaftal, Iconography of the Saints in Central and South Italian Schools of Painting, 77-96). 126 In Rome, Vatican 225, 231 and 227-9 (Kaftal, Iconography of the Saints in Tuscan Painting, 64-72). The scenes are: Antony beaten by demons and Christ appearing to Antony after his battle with the demons; Antony, on way to find Paul, meets the hippocentaur; Antony arrives at Paul's cave and begs to enter; Antony and Paul break the bread brought by a raven; Paul sends Antony to fetch St. Athanasius' cloak; Paul dies while kneeling; Antony, with help of lions, buries Paul; other scenes include: a monk's blessing Antony before he leaves for the desert; Antony tempted with gold; Antony's last admonition; an gels carry Antony's soul to heaven; and Antony's funeral. 127 Kaftal, Iconography of the Saints in the Painting of North West Italy, cols 69-81, including the scenes of the revelation of Paul's existence, the hippocentaur, the breaking of the bread brought by the ra ven, Paul's death and the burial with the help of the two lions; other scenes are Antony's conversion, his giving everything to the poor, leaving his sister to the nuns, the temptation in the form of a beautiful wo man, and Antony's farewell to his fellow monks as he leaves for the desert. 128 xhe frescoes, attributed to the Maestro di S.

Not all of the fresco and panel cycles match up with the single source of Jerome's Vita Pauli. The earliest Italian example of the multiplying of sources in painting of scenes of Antony's life is found in the severely damaged twelfth-thir teenth century frescoes in the church of S. Sepolcro in Barletta, which include: 1) the conversion of Antony; 2) Antony beaten by demons; 3) temptation of Antony by a woman; 4) Antony's monks find a dragon in the well; 5) Antony chases the dragon from the well; 6) on his way to see Paul, Antony sees a hippocentaur 131. The first three scenes are the familiar ones from the Vita Antonii, and the last scene is from Jerome's Vita Pauli. The two middle scenes are from neither the Vita Antonii nor the Vita Pauli, but instead from a third source, the Legend of Patras. In the church painting of fourteenth and fifteenth century Italy, especially in the central region of the peninsula, the new scenes of the meeting between Antony and Paul are inserted into the wider narrative, based on not only the Vita Antonii and the Vita Pauli, but also the Legend of Patras. The narrative progresses from Antony's residence in the city of Patras and his troubled thoughts about the best way to serve God there, to his retreat into the desert with his fellow monks, the tribulations in the desert and the help given by the king of Palestine, Antony's divine revelation of the existence of Paul (i.e., another solitary ascetic), and the meeting between Antony and Paul 132. Other fourteenth and fifteenth century Italian cycles of the life of St. Antony, which in part are based on the Legend of Patras, and located principally in Central-Southern Italy, are found in: the frescoes (Um monastiche nella societd medievale.

(Kaftal, Iconography of the Saints in the Painting of North West Italy, 69-81). 130 The scenes are: Antony receives the monk's garb, Paul's existence is revealed to Antony, Antony meets the hippocentaur, Antony and Paul break the bread brought by the raven, Antony sees Paul's soul rise to the heavens, Paul's death and burial with the help of two lions (Kaftal, Iconography of the Saints in the Painting of North West Italy, 69-81). Cfr. Bernardo Parentino's depiction of Antony's meeting with the satyr, along with scenes of the demons beating Antony and Christ appearing to him, and the tempta tion with gold coins (Kaftal, Iconography of the Saints in the Painting of North East Italy, 52-68), and also the meeting with the hippocentaur that appeared in the late fourteenth-century frescoes (destroyed in 1944) by a local artist influenced by Guariento in Bolzano, in the Chiesa dei Domenicani (Kaftal, Icono graphy of the Saints in the Painting of North East Italy, 65, fig. 86), and the canvas by Lazzaro Bastiani (Kaftal, Iconography of the Saints in the Painting of North East Italy, 65, fig. 87). 131 Kaftal, Iconography of the Saints in Central and South Italian Schools of Painting, 77-93. 132 This last episode is contained in both the Vita Pauli and the Legend of Patras, but not without unique elaborations, including: the geographical and historical settings are completely different; the Legend of Patras adds dialogue and descriptive particulars not present in Jerome; only in the Legend of Patras does Antony boast that he is the only solitary, and then learns through revelation that Paul lives in the de sert; regarding Antony's departure to seek Paul, only in the Legend of Patras does Antony enter the church seeking a divine sign, and then sees two wolves to guide him; in Jerome, Antony meets the hippo centaur who barely speaks, and points the way, and Jerome adds the meeting with the satyr; in the Legend of Patras, Antony meets neither a hippocentaur nor a satyr, but instead a loquacious Agathon, who intro duces the theme of sin, and explains the way to find Paul; in Jerome, the shewolf leads Antony into Paul's cave; in the Legend of Patras Antony finds the cave without the help of a shewolf, and there is additional dialogue by Paul who will not open because he believes Antony to be a temptor.</page><page sequence="26">524 D.

X-XI, from the monastery of San Gregorio in Clivio Scauri in Rome; Vatican Library, San Pietro, A 2, sec. X-XI) 139. Even if it did not issue forth solely from the creative phantasy of the Middle Ages, as asserted by P. Noordeloos 140, it gained a popularity that may be termed truly exceptional in Western Europe 141. As with the Vita Antonii and the Vita Pauli, Rome (in par ticular, the Papacy with regards to the Legend of Patras) constituted a fertile place for the dissemination of the text: of the seventeen extant manuscripts containing the legend, listed by Halkin (Une histoire, 217-18), five of the earliest ones, dating from the tenth to the fourteenth century, are closely associated with the seats of papal power, the Later an and St. Peter's. The circulation of the Legend of Patras was not limited to Rome or Italy, however, or to the small group of manuscripts. It spread throughout europe, and by the fourteenth century constituted an alternate reading of the lessons for the feast of St. Antony in the breviary 142.

LIX; Kaiser, Medieval and Post-medieval Iconography, 62, no. 64); the fifteenth-century German panel in the Munich Alte Pinakothek, which includes twenty-four scenes from the legends of Paul and Antony based on the Vita Antonii, Jerome's Vita Pauli and the Legend of Patras (Halkin, Une histoire, 220; Gra ham, A Picture Book, 137-141, pi. LX; Kaiser, Medieval and Post-medieval Iconography, 62, no. 65). 138 Halkin, Une histoire, 211-50. Since the story is less known than the Vita Pauli, here follow the main scenes of the Legend of Patras: Part I: (1) In the city of Patras, Antony is troubled about the inabi lity to serve God; (2) Antony has a vision of an angel who tells him to leave the city of Patras, and to seek a valley, fountain, and marble statue in the form of man; (3-4) Antony departs from the city of Pa tras, and arrives in a valley on Mount Cedron; (5) Antony and brethren find the fountain contaminated by a dragon, Antony defeats the dragon with prayer and the sign of the cross; (6) after four days, Antony and his brethren are hungry, and pray to God for help; (7) an angel appears to the ailing king of Palestine and tells him to bring food and drink to Antony; (8) a hermit (homo mendicus) tells the king to send help by camel, the king sends twelve camels loaded with food and drink to Antony; (9) the food and drink arrive; (10) Antony thanks the king, and he establishes a large monastery. Part II: (11) Antony's revelation of Paul (Paulum Simplicem heremita, abandoned by his mother, nurtured by a lion, fed by a raven), God instructs Antony to find Paul; (12) Antony enters the church to ask forgiveness for his vain glory (in thinking he was the only and best hermit), Antony asks for and receives a sign from God to find Paul, two wolves appear to guide him; (13) Antony meets the Agathon who shows him the way to find Paul; (14) Antony arrives at Paul's cave and asks Paul to let him enter, Paul initially refuses; (15) Antony and Paul meet together; (16) a raven brings loaf of bread, Paul predicts his death and sends Antony back to the monastery; (17) Antony, returning, sees the horned man (Agathon) who has been cured, they both re turn to the monastery; (18) Antony prepares to leave the monastery, elects the Agathon as abbot; (19) An tony returns to Paul, finds him dead, sees his soul in heaven; (20) two lions dig Paul's grave, Antony bu ries Paul, Antony puts on Paul's cloak of palm-leaves. 139 Halkin, Une histoire, 111. 140 ?La narrazione, pero, non pud avere fondamento storico. Antonio infatti mai ando fuori dell'E gitto, per cui non pote fondare un monastero in Grecia o in Palestina, se per Patras si volesse intendere Petra. E una creazione della fantasia medievale per dar fondamento alia vanita di Antonio e al comando, da parte di Dio, di visitare Paolo? (Noordeloos, Una leggenda italiana sconosciuta, 224). Halkin also notes that the elements of the first part of the Legend of Patras (Antony's escape to the desert, and the help from the king of Palestine) are present in the Vita Frontini abbatis, and that both were composed in the West (Une histoire, 213-15); the second part is an adaptation of Jerome's Vita Pauli. 141 Halkin, Une histoire, 211. 142 The Breviarium Romanum, for Antony's feast day on the 17 th of January, usually contains, for example, lessons which correspond to the Vita Antonii: ?Antonius Aegyptius nobilibus et christianis parentibus</page><page sequence="28">526 D. DUTSCHKE to the desert is found in fourteenth and fifteenth century breviaries, and, as it is demonstrated in UK, it found its way into the office of the confraternity of Saint Antony in Arezzo: the four lessons (UK, ff. 1-3) include the first part of the Legend of Patras, from Antony's initial concern about staying in Patras to the decision to leave for the desert 143. In other breviaries, the additional text includes: the monks' affirmative response to Antony, Antony's continued urging and quoting of the ap propriate passage from the Bible, Mt. 16, 25, and the singing of psalms by all, the exit from the monastery, and the climb over the city walls (Antony is lowered by rope), and the arrival at the mountain valley, where Antony and his followers find the marble statue, in the place where Joseph had been sold into Egypt (Gen. 37, 17-32). 144 The more complete version was clearly available to the Arezzo confratern ity, as is demonstrated in the scene of the escape over the walls of Patras (missing from the UK Office), in lauda 18 of UK: Tu nell'Egitto, te stava 'n Patrasse chol cor aflicto pari che dubitasse, che '1 mal delicto del mondo te noiasse, e nel diserto aviva '1 tuo amore. E per le mura messo nelle sporte, senca paura, serrate le porte, con duo conpagni che t'amavan forte da la citade la nocte uscisti fore?. (UK 17, vv. 11-18) The author of the lauda demonstrates a receptiveness to more than one source in the episode of Antony's escape: in addition to the Legend of Patras, there is a close correspondence, with verbal echoes, between Antony's escape and St. Paul's flee natus, quibus adolescens orbatus est, cum ingressus ecclesiam ex Evangelio audivisset: Si vis perfectus esse ... Qui aliquando quintum et centesimum annum agens, cum innumerabiles sui instituti imitatores haberet, convocatis monachis et ad perfectam christianae vitae regulam instructis, sanctitate et miraculis clarus mi gravit in caelum, decimo sexto Kalendas Februarii?. The Vita Antonii is also the source for the lessons of printed fifteenth century breviaries, such as the incunable PR 59073, f. 297rv (Milano 1483: Hain 3858) of the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. In Ms. 81 (dated ca. 1400, written in Lombardy, Augu stinian use) of the New York Public Library, the nine lessons of Ms. 81 (ff. 295v-296v) include not only the familiar episodes, based on the Vita Antonii, of Antony's conversion and his battles against the devil, but also the episodes (lessons 7-9) of Antony's meeting Paul (source is Jerome, Vita Pauli). 143 The corresponding text in the edition by Halkin is the Legend de Patras, 1-3: ?Beatus Antonius abbas, cum esset in civitate Patras in monasterium ... Propterea fugiamus a facie peccatoris? (?Analecta Bollandiana?, 61, 1943, 224-27). Cfr. also nos 16 (Paris, B.N., Nouv. acq. lat. 386, sec. XIV, Antonine breviary) and 17 (Nancy, Bibl.

Sed tamen videamus ne in vacuum labo remus, proinde ut ad exempla sanctorum possimus pervenire.' Ille iterum dixit: 'Videte, fratres, ut cor ve strum et cogitatio vestra non vacet in vanum et nec seducat vos seculi cupiditas, sed voluntatem meam per omnia custodite, et audite me, quia ita dicit in evangelio: Qui voluerit animam suam salvam facere, perdet earn, et qui perdiderit animam suam propter me in vitam eternam inveniet earn'.

(Acts, 9, 25). In the Legend of Patras, instead, the text is: ?In prima vigilia noctis, tune surgens beatus Antonius, accepit vaculum suum et sus citavit illis qui secuti erant ilium. Egredientes cum silentio de monasterio, perre xerunt ad murum civitatis; et deponentes Antonium per funiculum et omnes qui cum eo erant, exeuntes foras civitatem, ambulaverunt per diversa loca montium tota nocte ilia et duos dies? (Legend of Patras, ed. Halkin, 227-28). Even though the presence of Legend of Patras in the Office and lauda of the Arezzo confraternity may be considered a rare case in the transmission of the text, it is not unique. The same Legend of Patras is the textual basis for a lauda written in approximately the same time (sec. XlVex-XVin), in nearby Perugia for the flagellant confraternity of Saints Simone and Fiorenzo 145. The laude formed part of a widespread circulation of the Legend of Patras, in Latin and in vernacular (Italian and French) versions, which inspired, or even per haps were inspired by, the flourishing pictorial representations of Antony, in that medium Honorius of Autun called the ?literature of the laity? 146. They combined to add yet another chapter to the evolving life of saint Antony. Italy and France again come to the forefront in producing one of the most spectacular manifestations of interest in St. Antony in the early fifteenth century, the composite picture book of the life of Antony, which is contained in the Valletta MS (dated 1426) in the Public Library of Malta and its direct copy, Med. Pal. 143 (dated between 1429 and 1434, artist and scribe unknown), in the Biblioteca Lauren ziana in Florence. Both manuscripts were closely related to a great painted linen cloth (non longer extant) displayed in the early fifteenth century, in the Abbey of St. Antoine de Viennois (Dauphine, dep. Isere, France) 147, they were both copied and 145 The lauda, ?In festo sancti Antonii abbatis. Antonius, Dolce figluogle e pate?, is contained in a laudario of 158 laude, in ms. Vallicelliano A 26, published by G. Galli, I disciplinati delVUmbria del 1260 e le low laudi, ?Giornale storico della letteratura italiana?, suppl. 9 (1906), 155-92 (see also 35-37, descrip tion of manuscript). Cfr. E. Monaci, Uffizj drammatici del disciplinati dell'Umbria, ?Rivista di filologia romanza?, 1 (1872), 243-57. 146 ?De pictura.

Ob tres autem causas fit pictura: primo est laicorum litteratura; secundo, ut domus tali decore orne tur; tertio, ut priorum vita in memoriam revocetur? (Honorius, Gemma Animae, 132, in PL, 172, 586). Hono rius echoes the position taken by the Synod of Arras (1025) by which contemplation of pictures could substitu te the reading of Scripture for the unlettered (Synod of Arras, chap. 14, in J.D. Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum Nova et Amplissima Collectio, XIX, Florentiae 1767 (reprint Graz 1960, 454-55). One of the most prominent early (sec. IX) examples of the use of pictures as source for writing was by Agnellus of Ravenna in his Liber Pontificalis Ravennatensis, as Agnellus himself admitted: ?De vero illorum effigie si forte cogitatio fuerit inter vos, quomodo scire potui: sciatis, me pictura docuit, quia semper fiebant imagines suis temporibus ad illorum similitudinem? (Agnellus Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis, MGH: Scriptores Rerum Langobardicarum, XVIIII, 32, Hanover 1887, 297); cfr. Heffernan, Saints and Their Biographers, 142-68). 147 The Valletta MS is admirably described by R. Graham in A Picture Book', the Laurenziana ma nuscript was studied by S.C. Cockerell, Two Pictorial Lives of St. Anthony the Great, ?The Burlington Magazine?, 62, no. 358-63, (1933), 59-66. Regarding the linen cloth, see the Valletta MS., colophon on f. 102v: ?In presenti libro continentur figuraliter sub brevis vita et acta sanctissimi Antonii abbatis heremite patroni nostri videlicet a nativitate usque ad mortem seu ad ultimam sepulturam eiusdem et ultra prout ia cent in quodam magno panno lineo; quern compilavit et extraxit de legendis et vita eiusdem sancti frater Johannes Marcellarii condam sacrista huius monasterii sancti Antonii Viennensis.

DUTSCHKE painted at the Abbey, and both manuscripts have detailed colophons which indicate their French (Valletta) and Italian (Laurenziana) provenance. The colophon of the Laurenziana manuscript repeats that of Valletta, and continues: venerabilis dominus et religiosus vir frater Johannes de Monte Canuto cellarius dicti monasterii et preceptor Ranversi (and another hand adds), pro dando sanctissimo ac beatis simo domino nostro pape Eugenio quarto 148. Whereas Valletta is situated entirely in the abbey of St. Antoine, the Lauren ziana instead is connected to the most important Antonine commandery in Italy, at Ranverso (Torino), Pope Eugenius IV, and quite possibly to the Medici family, in whose hands the manuscript most likely ended up in 1434 149. The Valletta picture book, a visual and verbal mosaic compiled with scholarly thoroughness by the Antonine canon and once sacrist of the Abbey of St. Antoine de Viennois, Jean Macellard 15?, has the peculiar distinction of being the most com prehensive collection of stories ever compiled regarding Antony, a veritable summa moderna 151, but at the same time, because of its unique format of pictures ac companied by excerpts of corresponding texts, it is a visual feast sustained by a text ually varied yet sparse diet. The range of literary sources is also larger than any other life of St. Antony produced before or after it. Under each picture is an ex cerpt quoted from the different sources, usually followed by the author's or the work's name: Athanasius (i.e. Vita Antonii, the principal source), Iheronimus (i.e. Jerome, Vita Pauli), In legenda breviarii (i.e. Legend of Patras), In Vitis Patrum, Augustinus, Liber VIII Confessionum. Additional references, usually in conjunction with the main sources, are also made to St. Augustine (Augustinus, In prologo libri de doctrina Christiana) 152, St. Thomas (Thomas super iiij Sententiarum, distinctio xlv, questio Hi, articulus ij) 153, the Corpus juris canonici, Decreti secunda pars, Graham, A Picture Book, 1 and 129). For a similar type of cloth in the Antonine church in London, cfr. the 1499 inventory of St. Anthony's, Threadneedle Street in London: ?Item ij stenyd [i.e. painted] clothys to hange abowte the churche, on the lyffe of Seynt Antonye. And a nother of the Invention? (R. Graham, The order of St. Antoine de Viennois and its English commandery, St. Anthony's, Threadneedle Street, ?Archaeological Journal?, 84, second series 34, 1927, 398, and A Picture Book, 7). Med. pal. 143, is close ly linked with Italy through the main Antonine commandery in Italy, at Ranverso (Torino), having been paid for by Jean de Montchenu, Cellarer of Saint-Antoine de Viennois (the ?office of cellarer had been en dowed since 1323 with the revenues of the commandery of Ranvers or Ranverso in Piedmont, two and a half miles from Avigliana in the Va di Susa?), and having been presented to the Italian Pope Eugenius IV (Graham, A Picture Book, 8-9). 148 Cockerell, Two Pictoral Lives, 60. 149 Cockerell, Two Pictoral Lives, 60. 150 The scholarly and literary aspects are emphasized in the pictures of Guigue Robert, grand prior of the abbey (1404-1430), as he kneels and presents the book to St. Antony: Valletta ms., f.

The source for fifty pictures, one fourth of the total, is the Legenda mirabilis, which appears in the West for the first time as the translation (and adaptation) from Arabic to Latin by Alphonsus Bonihominis in the 1342 156. In addition to the references to Alphonsus which are combined with other authors, such as Athanasius and Augustine for the episodes of Antony's conversion 157 and his famous battle with demons 158, as well as isolated scenes 159, Alphonsus' Legenda is cited principally for two sets of pictures, sixteen depicting the temptations of the devil in the guise of a hunter and queen 160, and tw enty-three of Antony's visit to Barcelona to exorcise the wife, son and daughter of the king, and to heal the sick in the city 161. Even though it was the most recent, the least authoratative, and the most obviously legendary account of Antony's life (in cluding a visit to Barcelona) 162, it appears that the Legenda mirabilis met the expec tations of the Antonines of Saint Antoine de Viennois, as well as other Antonine commanderies, who became the main purveyors of Antony's cult. Combined with the other accounts, it entered the textual canon of the saint's life, substantiating, like a supporting footnote, the well-known stories (conversion, battle with demons), and introducing new stories that Alphonsus had personally authenticated as original 154 Corpus juris canonici, ed.

Et iste est habitus monachorum beati Anthonii, quern portant super tunicam superiorem, sicut Predicatores portant scapulare; sed quando exeunt de monasterio, induunt unam falciatam sine aliqua sutura, sicut Predicatores non exeunt monasterium sine cappa?, in Halkin, La Legende de Saint Antoine, 186-87; see also 182-83, 205-06. 159 Valletta, f. lOv, Athanasius et Alphonsus, Antony prays and listens to scripture, as his memory serveds him instead of books; f. 11, Athanasius et Alphonsus, Antony, loved by all, has the ambition to be second to none; f. 20v, Alphonsus, devils assemble to plot to trick Antony; f. 21, Alphonsus, devil in guise of holy monk, forced by A. to show he is devil, f. 21v, Alphonsus, Antony is physically wounded by devils, healed by the Lord; f. 22, Alphonsus, the devil is defeated by Antony, devil flees as a spirit of fla ming fire; f. 31v, Alphonsus, Antony restores a boy to life; f. 32, Alphonsus, the boy's mother is struck dumb, but her speech restored by Antony when she promises to not reveal the miracle; f. 32v, Alphonsus, Antony heals blind, lame, sick, and then feigns not being Antony in order to flee the crowd.

The result, as observed by Thomas Heffernan for sacred biography, was, The function of the text was not only to document the wondrous appearance of the divine in a man or woman but also to interpret for the community what was only partially un derstood, mysteriously hidden in the well-known public record, buried in the very ideal of sanctity itself. Such complex narrative structures possess what Clifford Geertz, borrowing a phrase from Gilbert Ryle, has called 'thick description' 163. The sanctity of Antony, supreme ascetic and thaumaturge of both the desert and the city, as portrayed by Alphonsus, corresponded perfectly with the image of the saint that had emerged at the shrine of Saint Antoine de Viennois since the elev enth century when Antony's relics were translated to their final resting place in Vienne (actually Motte-aux-Bois, now called Saint-Antoine, in the Dauphine region of Southern France). St. Antony's body was believed to have been translated three times: it was first taken from its secret burial place in the desert and brought to Alexandria in the sixth century (at least by 561), then to Constantinople in 670, and finally to Vienne in the eleventh century. Each translation was accompanied by miracles 164. About the year 1100, a small community of hospitallers, dependent on the Benedictine monastery of Montmajour, was founded at the shrine to accommo date pilgrims and to care for the sick, especially those suffering from a disease that came to be associated with St. Antony, ?St. Antony's Fire? (ignis sacer, herpes zoster, ergotism). In the first half of the thirteenth century, the statutes of the order were drawn up 165, and with the papal bull Ad apostolicae dignitatis, 10 June 1297, Pope Boniface VIII confirmed the hospitallers as an Order of Augustinian Canons, and he raised the priory to the status of an abbey, and exempted Saint Antoine and all the dependent commanderies from episcopal jurisdiction 166. By the time Alphonsus' translation passed into the hands of the Antonines 167 where it probably arrived soon after being completed in 1341, the shrine (abbey, almonry house, and hospital) had become well-known and well-visited, as even Petrarch had occasion to observe in a letter written to Francesco Nelli in 1352, in which he complained that 163 Heffernan, Sacred Biography, 21. 164 The Translatio sancti Anthonii confessoris, as it appears in Ms. 159 of the Bibliotheque Publique in Namur, is published by the Bollandists in ?Analecta Bollandiana?, 2 (1883), 341-54.

Maillet-Guy records the story about Geilin, a count of Dauphine, who brought back the relics of St. Antony from Constantinople in the middle of the eleventh century, in The Order of St. Antoine de Viennois and its English Commandery, St. Anthony's, Threadneedle Street, 342. 165 The statutes are published in Henri Tribout de Morembert, Le prieure antonin de Rome, ?Ri vista di storia della chiesa in Italia?, 19 (1965), 190-92. ?66 Les Registres de Boniface VIII, ed. by G.A.L.

Maillet-Guy, Les commanderies de I'ordre de St-Antoine en Dauphine, Abbaye de Liguge, 1928, 2). 167 The Spanish Cardinal to whom Alphonsus dedicated the translation (in 1342) was probably in at tendance at the papal court at Aviginon from 1348 until his death in 1374: ?At Avignon this Spanish car dinal was inevitably in contact with canons of the Order of Saint-Antoine; they were closely associated with the papal court, their commandery was close to the papal palace, and they were attracted to that uni versity to study law?

ANTONY 531 Angelo Acciaiuoli, while in Avignon, had promised to come to Vaucluse to see him (and the famous Fountain of the Sorgue) after having visited the shrine of St. Antony at Vienne, but had not yet done so 168. Angelo Acciaiuoli was one of the many distinguished visitors to St. Antoine de Viennois; others included St. Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln in the year 1200, Simon of Montfort in 1215, the German Emper or Charles IV with Philip II, Duke of Bourgogne, in 1365, Charles V, King of France, cardinal Robert of Geneva (later antipope Clement VII) in 1378, cardinal Pedro de Luna (later antipope Benedict XIII), Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Emperor Sigismund I in 1415, Pope Martin V in 1418, Jacques II de Bourbon, Comte de la Marche, in 1423, and Louis XI in 1475 169. The extraordinary expansion of Antonine order began in Italy at Ranverso, where a commandery (church, monastery and hospital) was established in the early thirteenth century 170. Ranverso was well situated along the via romea, the only route which was open all year long, south to Rome, and north through the Alps connecting Saint Antoine de Viennois to the pilgrimage routes between Santiago de Compostela and Rome. In an anonymous pilgrimage itinerary (from Florence to Santiago de Compostela), composed in 1477, there is a clear indication of the route through Antonine commanderies at Ranverso and Susa to the abbey of Saint Antoine de Viennois, the latter being described as a pilgrimage shrine of miracles, Lamotta, un chastello dov'e il miracholo di sancto Antonio ed ecci il braccio suo 171. 168 Fam.

DUTSCHKE More than two hundred years earlier (1254), the archbishop of Rouen, Eudes Rigaud, described his return trip from a pilgrimage to Rome along the same route, and although he does not mention Ran verso (in Torino, he stopped at the benedic tine monastery of Sant'Ambrogio), he does say that he stayed a few days at Susa and also ?Apud Sanctum Antonium Viennensem [St. Antoine de Viennois]? 172. The shrine of St. Antoine was also the destination of the flagellant confraternity of St. Antony from Assisi: having made a long and arduous pilgrimage to St. James at Santiago de Compostela in the mid-fourteenth century, the confraternity made another pilgrimage in 1439 not only to St. James, but also to St. Antoine de Vien nois 173. Arezzo, a city close to Assisi, is along the pilgrimage route from London to Rome, passing through the Moncenisio pass, as is shown in the Iter de Londinio in Terram Sanctam, by Mathew Paris (1253): Le chemin versus Rume...

XLV (miglia di distanza a Roma) m. Although there is no record of a pilgrimage by the Arezzo confraternity of St. Antony, there may have been the possibility to have contact with those who had done so, such as the confraternity of St. Antony in Assisi, or with pilgrims travel ling south to Rome or those travelling to the north to the shrine of St. Antony or any of the others. By the end of the thirteenth century, Antonine hospitals had been founded along trade and pilgrimage routes and in most of the larger towns of France, Spain, England, Germany and Italy, and they extended into such far-reaching regions as Scotland, the North Sea, Hungary, as well as Cyprus, Constantinople and Acre 175. In Italy, hospitals had begun to appear in the late twelfth century-early thirteenth century, first in the north but within a short time also in the south, as far as Compostella di un anonimo pellegrino [1477], ed. R. Stopani, in Le vie di pellegrinaggio del Medioevo: gli itinerari per Roma Gerusalemme, Compostella, Firenze 1991, 151-52). The anonymous author also notes another Antonine shrine close to Leon, Spain: ?Sancto Antonio (San Anton), una villa. Ecci una chiesa di Sancto Antonio dov'e un braccio di detto che ffa molti miracholi ed e bella reliquia? (Stopani, Le vie, 157). 172 Regestrum visitationum archiepiscopi Rothomagensis.

Regarding Susa and its relationship to Ran verso, Giovanni Donna d'Oldenico writes: ?Sempre in Susa esisteva fin dalla seconda meta del secolo XII una vera e propria domus infirmorum tenuta dagli ospedalieri di S. Antonio i quali amministravano contemporaneamente un altro ospedale a Ran verso, loca lita situata presso il Comune di Rosta, sulPantica strada romana che partendo dalla porta Decumana o Se gusina di Torino risalendo la Duria minor univa il Piemonte alia Moriana quale importante via romea me dievale in quanto Tunica aperta tutto l'anno?

ANTONY 533 Sicily 176. An Antonine commandery was founded in Rome in the late twelfth century (the earliest record is dated 1190), and the close ties between the Antonine order and the Papacy were ensured by Pope Nicholas IV who transferred the new institution to the Lateran during his Papacy (1288-1292) 177; some time between 1274 and 1279, Fr. Hieronymo de Asculo (future Pope Nicholas IV) added a note to St. Bonaventura's Legenda maior, recounting that St. Francis, while in Rome seeking approval of his rule (1209-1210), was found staying ?iuxta Lateranum in hospitali S. Antonii? 178. Within close proximity to the Roman Curia, the importance of the Antonine commandery in Rome rivalled that of Ranverso 179. Saint Antoine de Vien nois, however, remained the main abbey, enjoying a favorite status with the papacy, as is demonstrated in documents, such as, for example, those identified by R. Enking in the archives of St. Antonio Abbate in Rome, and also in the sixteenth century Antonine chartulary of Papal bulls and briefs related to the Order now in New York Public Library, ms. 85. In ms. 85, beginning with the introductory miss ive of the collection by Innocent VIII, the Papal bulls and briefs are by popes Boniface VIII, Clement V, Urban V, Gregory XI, John XXIII, Martin V, Eugene IV, Nicholas V, Callistus III, Sixtus IV, Innocent VIII, Alexander VI, Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII 18?. Antony became known universally as the miracle working saint of Vienne, and another feature of his life (rather of his afterlife) was added to those of the Vita Antonii, Vita Pauli, Legend of Patras, Legenda mirabilis, Vitae Patrum, and Legenda aurea. Although the Vita Antonii contains accounts of Antony's miracles, as well as his healing the sick and exorcizing the possessed 181, the emphasis on the 176 I.

DUTSCHKE saint's miraculous powers is associated with the saint after his death, and in par ticular with the translation of his relics from the secret burial place in the desert to Alexandria, Constantinople and finally to Saint Antoine de Viennois, as is recounted in the fourteenth-century Translatio, ...in quo domus helemosinaria construeretur, infra quam Christi pauperes et universi, qui ex predicto gehennalis ignis incendio perurerentur et ad implorandum suffragium beati Anthonii confugerent, gratuito susciperentur 182. Panel and fresco wall painting in thirteenth and fourteenth century Italy illus trate the ready acceptance south of the Alps of the stories, mainly by Antonine commanderies but also by other religious and lay groups, including the Arezzo con fraternity. For example, in addition to the four scenes about the Legend of Patras, Vitale da Bologna painted a panel depicting scenes of: 1) at the time of the trans lation of his body to Constantinople, Antony raises to life three men killed by wild beasts; 2) Antony saves Effron, son of a soldier of Alexandria, who has been un justly condemned and hanged (Antony holds him up for eight days); 3) Sophia, the daughter of Emperor Constantine, who is possessed by the devil is brought to the shrine of St. Antony; Sophia is cured before the body of St. Antony. The episode of Antony saving the hanged man is a miracle which is attributed to the Virgin and to many saints, including St. Aman, St. James of Compostela, St. Jerome, and St. Nicholas of Tolentino 183. The possibility of confusion of attribution must have been great, as, for example, in the confraternity of St. Antony in Assisi, whose members dedicated their oratory and hospital to both St. Antony and St. James, and it not only recounted the story of the miracle of St. James (upon return from their pil grimage to St. James and to St. Antoine), but also had Pier Antonio Mezzastris paint the miracle on the oratory wall, opposite the scenes of Antony (conversion scene as Antony gives everything to the poor, and the scene of the arrival of the camels sent by the king of Palestine to bring food to the saint) 184. Two of the scenes (Effron and Sophia) are contained, together with other episodes of Antony's life in the elaborate fourteenth-century fresco cycle (ca. 1372) attributed to Niccolo di Tommaso, in the Antonine church of St. Antonio abate (del Tau) in Pistoia. Enzo Carli suggests that the Antony cycles were painted at the same time as the other cycles in the church (Paradise, twenty-six scenes from the Old Testament, and fifteen scenes from the New Testament), and that they together constitute one of the bantur omnes spiritali cibo pleni? (Vita Antonii, PL, 73, 154). In chapters 52-53 (PL, 73, 163-64) Antony's miracles are closely set within the pattern of miracles of Christ, Mt 10, 8. Other miracles recounted in the Vita Antonii are in chs 29-30 (PL, 73, 152), in which Antony cures the sick, and in ch. 43 (PL, 73, 157-58) in which Antony exorcizes a child possessed by the devil. 182 Noordeloos, La translation, 79-80. Noordeloos suggests that the legend of the translation of An tony's relics, which he publishes on 75-81, may have been the lessons for the Office of St. Antony celebra ted by the Antonines on March 17th, and therefore of Antonine origin; the earliest manuscript is Paris, Bib. Nat., lat. 5579, XIII cent. Cfr. the Incipit translatio sancti Anthonii confessoris, in ?Analecta Bollan diana?, 2 (1883), 341-54, and Noordeloos, Una leggenda italiana sconosciuta, 228-29 and 239; Morawski, La legende, 14-29, and 57-59.

The Antony cycle taken within itself is similarly complex: it is made up of eleven scenes from Antony's conversion to the miracles during the translation of his re lics, and it is based on a wide variety of sources (the legend of his translation, the Vita Antonii, Jerome's Vita Pauli, and the Legend of Patras) 186. The three laude of UK present an equally complex program, conceived at about the same time, based on all the same sources, and clearly depicting not only the hermit, according to the Vita Antonii and Vita Pauli, but also the miracle-working Saint Antony of Vienne, appropriately with his newly assumed name, Venuto '1 tenpo che fosti trovato, rechato al tenpio di Sophir beato et a Soffia fossti presentato, quel gran demonio tossto fuggi fore. Con reverencia in Vienna stai, per tuo clemencia, miracholi assai in ogni exencia di creature fai quando chiamato se' liberatore. (UK, lauda 17, vv. 71-78) 187 As with the painting of Vitale da Bologna and Niccolo di Tommaso, the verses depict the miraculous exorcism of Sophia, daughter of Constantine, as is also expressed in the closing words of the Italian version of the Legend of Patras: Et actaccaro lo carro ad duy gence salvaie et lassarolo andare. Et lo imperatore colle preite, colle reliquie et colla processione andaro dereto a cquisto santo corpo, et quisti genci se affissero ad una ecclesia da fore de Alexandria una lega. Et la ecclesia se clamava santo Iohanne Babtista. Et loco foy aducta la figlia de lo imperatore. Et como foy in presencia de quillo santo corpo, incontinente fo liberata per li merite de quillo santissimo corpo 188. A similar association of Antony with Vienne is found in an addition to the lauda, ?Tornate a Cristo con paura?, in the fourteenth century laudario of a confraternity dedicated to St. Antony in Assisi (the same confraternity that made a pilgrimage to St. Antoine de Viennois and that commissioned Antonio Mezzas tris to paint the frescoes of the church): 185 E. Carli, Gli affreschi del Tau a Pistoia, Firenze 1977, 4; see also 3-16, and pi. 54-66. 186 Carli identifies the main figure in two of the scenes as St. Athanasius instead of Antony: ?I1 Vescovo Attanasio a colloquio con l'lmperatore. Tav. 61; II Vescovo Attanasio in Refettorio - Sant'An tonio ammansisce i mostri del deserto. Tav. 62? (Carli, Gli affreschi del Tau, 16). 187 Cfr. ?Qui mox per viam quae ad Sanctum Sophir iter habebat alacriter ire coeperunt.

DUTSCHKE Vertudioso confessore santo Antonio de Vienda fratello si te facia onore che '1 nimico no te ofenda sancto Antonio barone si te conduca a salvatione 1 In addition to the Arezzo confraternity, there were many other Italian con fraternities dedicated to St. Antony in the fourteenth century (for example, in Genova, Vicenza, San Sepolcro, Assisi, Citta di Castello). All were flagellant con fraternities, they were all connected with hospitals, they all had churches or oratories dedicated to St. Antony. Genova: there was a confraternity of Flagellants dedicated to St. Antony in Genova, recorded as early as 1232 in the Church of S. Domenico; and the duties of the members were healing the sick and assisting at funerals 190. In the mid-fourteenth century, Barnaba da Modena painted the processional banner for the Genova confraternity, ?depicting the Crucifixion with the Virgin, St. John and St. Antony Abbot on the front and Saints Antony Abbot and Eligius, adored by members of the confraternity, on the back? 191. Vicenza: the confraternity was called the ?Fraglia dei battuti di S. Antonio?, also called ?dei negroni? 192. San Sepolcro: in this town, nearby Arezzo, St. Antony and St. Eligius appear together on a relief of 1366, ?now lost, over the entrance porch of St. Antony's church at Borgo Sansepolcro, is described as depicting Christ flanked by Saints Antony and Eligius with 'two hooded figures')) 193. 189 Pesaro, Biblioteca Oliveriana, f. 33, vv. 37-42: Fortini, La lauda, 301, 269-73. Cfr. V. De Bartholomaeis, Origini della poesia drammatica italiana, Torino 1952, 286, footnote 20. One of the many examples of the identification of Antony with St. Antoine de Viennois is in the missal of the Ran verso Antonines, f. 177, rubric for January 17: ?In festivitate sancti Anthonii Viennensis introitus? (P. Ladner, Das Missale von Sant'Antonio di Ranverso in Lausanne, ?Zeitschrift fur schweizerische Kir chengeschichte.

ANTONY 537 Assisi: one of the most noted confraternities of St. Antony, and one which we are able to compare with the Arezzo confraternity, resided in Assisi (see above) I94. Citta di Castello: the confraternity is known through its statues; the Statuti della Compagnia di S. Antonio Abate begin in fourteenth century, with additions of 1336 and 1386 195. One of the main charitable duties of the Arezzo confraternity was the care of the sick, a duty which in general was not always under the direction of the Antonine canons 196. All the confraternities dedicated to St. Antony, and in particular those of Arez zo and Assisi, became central agents in the propagation of the cult of saint Antony, through the medium of literature and that of painting. The Arezzo Confraternity proves to be rich in literature, but without any extant example of painting. Un fortunately, the gonfalone painted for the Arezzo confraternity by Domenico Veneziano in 1450 no longer exists 197. The confraternity church has also disappear ed, and only the door of the hospital (reconstructed in 1423 as a hospice for travellers and pilgrims) is still standing 198. In the Arezzo confraternity, St. Antony Abbot was clearly acknowledged as uni versal protector, the ascetic monk who for the community inherited and shared the role of defensor civitatis with other Arezzo saints, from Donatus to Ilarianus and Laurentinus and Pergentinus 199. A pictoral analogue to the image of St. Antony as defensor civitatis is found in a panel painting from the church of St. Antony fuori Porta in Pisa, dated 1353 and ascribed to Allegretto Nuzi, in which a larger-than-life figure of Antony stands, with staff and book, over a group of religious and lay men and women (one is holding up a swaddled child to Antony) who are kneeling, hands clasped in prayer, and reverently looking up to Antony; two pigs stand at the saint's feet 20?. 194 G.M.

DUTSCHKE The inclusion of not only the lay groups but also the Antonine canons together with them is found in the North Italian fourteenth-century cutting of an illumination in the Cleveland Museum of Art: Antony, with a abbot's mitre and cope, Tau patch on his shoulder, is seated holding two blank scrolls; on his left are lay followers and on his right are tonsured Antonines, with Tau patch on their copes 201. Other examples portray similar images of Antony, as for example the fifteenth century depiction (possibly from a diptych) made for the newly consecrated hospital of St. Antony, in Cologne, re-built in the 1380s, in which Antony, holding a crosier in his left hand, with his right hand blesses the surrounding group of people (includ ing clerics and cripples) and animals (sheep, deer, goose, and ducks), in confir mation of his role as patron of people and animals 202. The representation of Antony as patron is even more striking in a fresco in the church of San Teodoro in Pavia, by Bernardino Lanzoni: a towering figure of Antony sits before the city, dominating it with his very presence 203. More intimate, but no less expressive of the image of Antony as patron saint, is the fresco in the church of San Lorenzo in Berzo Inferiore, attributed to Maestro Paroto, in which a standing St. Antony pres ents a hooded flagellant to the enthroned Virgin and Christ child 204. As patron saint of the confraternity of flagellants in Genova, Antony is depicted on one side of the gonfalone at the crucifixion, holding Christ's feet, and on the verso side he sits with St. Eligius, both surrounded by kneeling confraternity members 205. One of the most unique examples of Antony's presence in different forms of devotion is evident in a late fourteenth-century roll, perhaps from Emilia Romagna: above six scenes from the Bible (passion of Christ), there is a representation of the annunciation, and the imposing figure of Antony, with his Tau staff and book, and pig at his feet, stands between Gabriel and the Virgin; Gigetta Dalli Regoli, who studied the privately owned roll, leaves unanswered the question of its use 206. Whether the roll was destined for a religious or lay audience, for a group or for an individual, it offers a suggestive example of the image and cult of Antony in fourte enth-century Italian popular devotion, one which is close in nature to the depiction of Antony participating in the Genova confraternity's view of Christ's passion, as Antony is seen as a primary figure in the event (holding the cross). Antony is protector of human kind, Christians above all, defender against hatred, war, adversity, evil death and sickness, and every sorrow and trouble, patron saint of his devout followers, large and small, who live in the city and the country. He is the saint for all seasons, as is declared in the Oratio devota ad beatissimum Antonium in the Valletta manuscript (f. 5v): O magne pater Antoni. Ave pater ...

The sacred biography which stands in support of this image of St. Antony has assumed its physionomy and internal character through the intricate process of re ception and re-creation, from the most ancient to the most recent acquirements, of stories about the saint's life. Sacred biography emerges from and is dependent on a complex relationship between author and audience 208. The extent to which this relationship is operative in the Arezzo confraternity's own biography of Antony is illustrated in the most enig matic verses in one of the three laude dedicated to St. Antony in UK: Noi sapemo prima che tu fosse nato dai tui parenti per loro peccato concetto ello viaggio, fosti dato a Tinfermale maladetta semengia. Noi sapemo, padre santissimo Antonio, che '1 maladetto feroce dimonio te rechedia per suo atesstimonio dei tui parenti con falsa loquentia. (UK 8, vv. 7-14) This reference to a controversial birth and early childhood of Antony is a striking departure from the enduring version in the Vita Antonii: Antonius nobilibus religiosisque parentibus natus, in Aegypto oriundus fuit, tanta suorum nutritus cur a, ut nihil aliud praeter parentes domumque cognosceret. Et cum jam puer esset, non se litteris erudiri, non ineptis infantium jungi passus est fabulis: sed Dei desiderio flagrans, secundum quod scriptum est, innocenter habitabat domi 209. In what would have been characterized by Delehaye, disparagingly, as a legende hagiographique, by De Gaiffier, less disparagingly, as a legende apocryphe, by Hef fernan, approvingly, as sacred biography, and by Elliott, also approvingly, as hagiographic romance 21?, the beginning of Antony's life has been altered so that it typologically coincides with that of a number of saints, including Amador, James, Lawrence, Bartholomew, Onuphrius, and Julian the Hospitaller 211. Only the legend of St. Amador is closely related to the UK 8; once the saint is born, the others become stories of the infant being stolen by the devil and replaced by a changling. The common thematic feature is the curse of the newborn, who is forced to struggle 207 Graham, A Picture Book, 127. 208 Heffernan, Sacred Biography, 18-22. 2&lt;*&gt; Vita Antonii, PL, 73, 127. 210 H.

DUTSCHKE with the devil from infancy 212, all of whom must overcome a curse of the devil. The controversial birth also emulates the apocryphal birth and early life of the rival hermit Paul which appears for the first time in the Legend of Patras: Nam si vis esse solitarius, quod non sit similis tui, vade, require Paulum Simplicem here mita, quern matrem suam in adulterium peperit et portavit in excelsis montibus, et misit eum in speluncam leonis et revolsit lapidem magnum, ut nullus quidem cognosceret verecundiam matris eius213. The Italian translation faithfully renders the episode: ?Impero ch' Paulo primo heremita fo nato de adulterio e la matre lo fe iectare intro uno bosco alii liuni. E li liuni lo notricavano? 214. Except for Julian and Paul, all are variations on the theme of the miracle of the Virgin: the newborn who is pledged by his mother to the devil, and rescued by the Virgin 215. In his study of La vie de saint Sauveur I'ermite, a French version of the legend, Paul Meyer cites five principal thirteenth and fourte enth-cenutury versions of the story, in Latin, French, and Spanish, as well as the version which appears in Vincent of Beauvais' Speculum historiale 216. All the ver sions have the main episodes in common: 1) The parents make a vow of chastity (?celibemque vitam deinceps servare promiserant?)217; 2) the husband breaks the vow, and forces his wife to have intercourse, on the eve of Easter, and the wife pled ges the newborn to the devil (?Obstupefacta mulier ...ad virum ait: Quicquid in hac nocte a nobis fuerit operatum, sit maledictum, &amp; Diabolo mancipatum, concepit &amp; peperit, natusque est infans visu mirabilis?); 3) the day the devil is to claim the newborn, he is put off; later, the truth is told to the young son who goes to Rome, then to Jerusalem (?Tunc Adolescens nocte fugiens ... venit Romam, &amp; inde cum literis Domini Papae ad Hierosolymitanum Episcopum longo itinere fatigatus acces 212 B. de Gaiffier concludes that the story of St. James is a legende apocryphe (p. 173), whose ear liest manuscript dates from tenth-eleventh century (Monte Cassino, ms. CXVII, and de Gaiffier, 173-74, discovered another of the fifteenth century, Biblioteca Marciana, ms. VI, 51). It circulated, especially in painting in Italy, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. For example, de Gaiffier cites seven panels in the Francfort-sur-le-Main, Stadel Collection, attributed to Bartolo di Fredi (Sienese painter of sec. XIV), and a predella, painted by Andrea Vanni, in the church of St. James in Siena (de Gaiffier, Le diable, vo leur d'enfants, 171-73). In addition, there is the fifteenth-century fresco, of St. James holding up the han ging man, in the chiesa parrocchiale in Cuna (Siena), in Kaftal, Iconography of the Saints in Tuscan Painting, 513 and 518, fig. 597. Regarding St. Onuphrius, A.G. Elliott writes that the saint is an example of the motif of the departure of saintly hero: ?The early lives of Onuphrius include no details about him prior to his joining a coenobitic monastic community, but in subsequent accounts, he becomes the son of the King of Persia or Egypt. The devil (a displaced evil-father figure), disguised as a pilgrim, persuades the king that his son is the result of an adulterous union, and in an attempt to prove the veracity of the charge, the baby is thrown into a fire, from which he escapes uscathed. Later the baby is suckled by a doe, and later he is raised not by his own family but by a community of monks?

Paul's story contradicts that of Jerome, Vi ta Pauli and Palladius' Historia Lausiaca (PL, 73, 1086-218), and Halkin concludes: ?Ils proviennent appa remment de quelque conte ou recit folklorique?

The focus of the legend is on the Virgin, and the beneficiary of her miracle remains in anonymity as infans, adolescens, puer, or saint Sauveur I'ermite. There are no legends in which the hero is St. Antony, except in the verses of UK 8, and, as we shall see, in other Italian poetry of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. None of the lives of Antony, from the Vita Antonii to the Valletta manuscript, contains a story which could be construed as the direct source of the legend. The Vita Antonii (and therefore the biographies that derive from it) portrays Antony's birth and childhood as the ideal beginning of a Christian life. Only a remote connec tion is to be surmised with Antony's vision, in the Vita Antonii, in which the adult Antony sees himself, as it were, outside himself as though being guided aloft (?raptum se sensit in spiritu, et ab angelis in sublime deferri?, PL, 73, 155), but then prevented from passing through by demonic forces who accuse him of an un specified sin at birth: Illis vero ab exordio nativitatis replicare peccata nitentibus, calumniosa angeli ora clauserunt, dicentes non debere eos a nativitate ejus delicta narrare, quae jam Christi essent bontitate sopita; si qua autem scirent ex eo tempore quo factus esset monachus, et Deo se consecrasset, licere proferri. Accusabant daemones multa procaciter mentientes; et cum deesent probamenta fallacibus, liber Antonio conscensus aperitur (PL, 73, 155). The Legenda aurea even ignores Antony's birth and childhood, and begins with the conversion scene. The account of Antony's birth in the translation by Alphonsus Bonihominis (which, as we have seen, adds substantial amounts of apocryphal material), although adding some particulars, such as the names of Antony's parents, Antony's birthplace in Egypt, and the sterility of the parents (the only indication of a difficulty), it varies only slightly from the Vita Antonii version, and it ignores the devil episode completely: Pater eius vocatus fuit Behabex et mater eius vocabatur Giux. Et erant ambo iusti ante Deum et erant valde divites in peccuniis et pecoribus. Et habebant ambo magnam devocionem ad sanctum Michaelem archangelum. Et dabant terciam partem bonorum scilicet reddituum suorum in elimosinam annuatim. Et fuerunt de Egipto, de parte ilia que vocatur Zaide, de villa que dicitur Zaituna arabice, id est oliva latine. Parentes eius, cum essent steriles, a Domina matre Dei istum filium precibus impetraverunt. Qui cum esset trium annorum, incepit ire ad ecclesiam solus ambulans firmus et rectus; et non implicabat se in ludis puerorum, sed tota cura eius erat circa ecclesiam, ita ut parentes mirarentur vehementer 218. In another section of Legenda mirabilis, Alphonsus recounts that Antony was blessed by God, not damned to the devil, before being born: Christ appeared to Antony and said, 218 Halkin, La legende de Saint Antoine, 201. Halkin also mentions a Ligurian legend: Raynaud, Symbola antoniana, 184-89 (= Opera, VIII, 412-13); G.A. Lucenti, Vita di S. Antonio abate, Roma 1697, 99; Gir. Rossi, Storia delta citta di Ventimiglia, Oneglia 1886, 36-38. Cfr. Morawski, La tegende, 126.</page><page sequence="44">542 D. DUTSCHKE Beatus es tu, pugil fortis, in confessione nominis mei, in omni tribulacione et in omni loco. Scias te fuisse sanctificatum per Spiritum sanctum ab utero matris tue 219. On f. 3 of the Valletta manuscript, under a picture of the birth of Antony, the rubric corresponds closely to the Legenda mirabilis text: Quomodo beatus Antonius in matris utero sanctificatus a beata virgine Maria impetratus parentibus sterilibus religiosis et nobilibus in Egypto ortus est. Athanasius et Alphonsus 22?. The contradictory message of the verses of UK 8 is marked by an emphasis on collective knowledge, authority and voice, as each strophe of the birth episode begins with the words Noi sapemo (v. 7 and v. 11)221. The unique story of Antony's birth (it is the sole reference to his birth in the Arezzo laudario) is forcefully declar ed to be common knowledge of the group, a paradigmatic episode in the life of the confraternity's saintly hero. The story, infact, may owe its origin only remotely to the hagiographical tradition of the miracle of Virgin. The direct source of the story would seem instead to be tied more closely to the audience for whom it was intend ed (we may again refer to the notion of 'thick description' as described by Hef fernan, Sacred Biography, 21) and, in particular, to the secular tradition of story telling. By the early fourteenth century, the story of St. Antony pledged to the devil circulated in Italy, and in the fifteenth century, versions of it are found in manu scripts from the Veneto, Lombardy and the Abruzzi; UK is the earliest manuscript copy, being of the late fourteenth century, although the story is believed to have circulated orally a century before being written down. In 1896, Ernesto Monaci published two versions of the story, entitled the Historia sancti Antonii, which he had discovered in ms. 1808 of the Biblioteca Casa natense (ff. 28-30v) and ms. 44. G. 27 (fragment of one folio) of the Biblioteca Cor siniana. Monaci gave the title according to the note which ends the text of the Cor siniana manuscript: ?Istoria sancti Antoni finita fuit die decimo tertio mensis julii 1485? 222. According to Monaci, the Casanatense version was written in the Abruzzi by a minstrel (giullare), and the Corsiniana version was written in the Lombardy Veneto area, also by a minstrel. Monaci concluded that except for the final scene (in which Antony, tempted by a woman, enters a fire and invites the woman to join him), is ?affatto nuovo nella vita di S. Antonio l'eremita, benche non nuovo nelle tradizioni del medioevo? 223. The fire scene appears in both the Casanatense and the Corsiniana manuscripts (Ca, vv. 133-146; Co, vv. 61-90) 224, and also it may well be in the Arezzo confraternity's lauda 17: 219 Halkin, La legende de Saint Antoine, 196. 220 Graham, A Picture Book, 46 and pi. I. 221 Heffernan, Sacred Biography, 19-22. 222 E.

A modern extension of this medieval story of An tony tells of three travellers who find Antony's heart in the ashes, and give it to a young girl who eats it and becomes pregnant; distraught, she jumps out the window, and is saved by Antony, and she later gives birth to another Antony, St. Antony of Padua (R. Partini, Lu nimmice de lu dimonie. Storia e leggenda di santo Antonio Abbate, ?Lares?, V, 1, 1934, 142-43).</page><page sequence="45">THE TRANSLATION OF ST. ANTONY 543 O santo Antonio che nel fuocho intrasti quando '1 demonio da te tu cacciasti (UK, 17, vv. 35-36) The only possible antecedent in the Vita Antonii is one of the devil's first temp tations of Antony: Ille titillabat sensus naturali carnis ardore; hie fide, vigiliis et jejuniis corpus omne vallabat. Ille per noctes in pulchrae mulieris vertebatur ornatum, nulla omittens figmenta lasciviae; hie ultrices gehennae flammas et dolorem vermium recordans, ingestae sibi libidini opponebat 225. The Legenda mirabilis contains an analogous scene of the temptation of Antony by the queen in her bedchamber, but Antony resists her not by fire, but by the sign of the cross. Tune sanctus Anthonius signavit se signo sancte crucis, et ilia tremefacta est... Tune S. Anthonius cognovit ipsam esse dyabolum, et perterritus est valde, et dixit ei: 'Nunc congnosco quod tu es inimicus.' Et clamavit vociferando tota virtute qua potuit dicens: *0 Domine Iesu Christe, adiuva me; succurre michi cito, ne derelinquas me.' Ad hanc vocem facta est mulier ante oculos eius sicut mons niger et grossus, et de lateribus eius erumperunt ignes et evapo raverunt fumi terribiles 226. Since the Legenda mirabilis dates from the approximately same time period of the UK verses and the Historia sancti Antonii, it may well have been influenced by them rather than being the source of inspiration. The Valletta picture book depicts the temptation scene on f. 50v, followed by scenes of Antony's domination of fire, on f. 51r-v, but they cannot be designated as the direct source since the Valletta manuscript post-dates UK and the Historia sancti Antonii. Neither does the Valletta manuscript connect directly the themes of temptation and fire, as is seen in the rubric, on f. 50: Ubi premissa longa disputatione et orationibus simulatisque multis miraculis et illu sionibus previis temptavit diabolus sancti virginitatem, et habitum calvec realiter auferre, in quo divina gracia diabolum esse cognoscens signo crucis se muniens illusiones evanuerunt. Alphonsus, et Thomas super quarto Sententiarum, distinctio xlv, questio iij, articulus ij 227. The closest version to the UK verses and the Historia sancti Antonii is found an anonymous poem in French, which J. Morawski has dated mid-fourteenth century, but which is contained only in a fifteenth century manuscript (Paris, Bibl. Nat., fr. 2198, ff. 40-44): Le mauvais, qui avoit la belle fourme prise, S'en vint lez saint Anthoine et li dist en tel guise: 'Amis, regardez moi, je vous aing moult et prise, Vous pouez de moy faire tout a vostre devise. S'avec vous n'e couche, je mourray vraiement. Ame ne le sara, faittes le seurement!' 225 Vita Antonii, PL, 73, 129. 226 Halkin, La legende de saint Antoine, 183. 227 Graham, A Picture Book, 91.</page><page sequence="46">544 D.

II scet bien que le feu de 1'infernal hostal Est plus ardant mil fois que celuy de sa val; Le saint entra ou feu, mais onques n'i ot mal, Car estaindre le fist le roy celestial 228. Rather than these verses being the main source of the temptation scene, however, I would submit that another source provided the inspiration for UK 8, vv. 7-14, the Historia sancti Antonii, and the French poem, and that is, that they all derived from the popular sacred story telling of the fourteenth century, and in par ticular from the story telling that was connected to the Fioretti of St. Francis. It is in the Fioretti (composed ca. 1370-1390, and based on the Actus beati Francisci, composed in late twelfth and early thirteenth century) 229 that we find the earliest version of the story of a saint, St. Francis, who is tempted by a woman and enters a fire in order to reject her: Ed ivi si era una femmina bellissima del corpo ma sozza deLTanima, la quale femmina maladetta richiese santo Francesco di peccato. E dicendole santo Francesco: *Io accetto, andiamo a letto', ella lo menava in camera. Disse santo Francesco: 'Vieni meco, io ti menero a uno letto beliissimo\ E menolla a uno grandissimo fuoco che si facea in quella casa; e in fervore di spirito spogliasi ignudo, e gittasi allato a questo fuoco in su lo spazzo affocato, e in vita costei che ella si spogli e vada a giacere con lui in quel letto spiumacciato e bello 230. Just as Antony had been the source for the themes of conversion and struggle with the devil in Francis, it may well be that Francis provided the inspiration for the theme of temptation. Those who wrote about them were certainly drawing from common sources, as Monaci stated, ?al ciclo delle novelle e dei fabliaux? 231. Francesco Novati identified a third version of the story of Antony pledged to the devil, which Luigi Crivelli, in Milan and in the year 1402, inserted into in a mis cellany manuscript 232. Novati underscored the popular themes of the Historia, the newborn pledged to the devil who is liberated by a divine force and the descent into hell by a mortal who through his wit gains his liberty. Novati also agreed with Monad's early dating (original composition date in the beginning of the fourteenth century) 233 of the Corsiniana manuscript (Co), for reasons of the rhyme scheme of strophes of five mono-rhyming edecasyllables, and he suggested that the Co was a copy of the Visconti (V, a copy made in the last years of the fourteenth century), whereas the Casanatense (Ca) was a patchwork reduction (rozzo e sgarbato raf 228 Paris, Bib. Nat., fr. 2198, f. 41, ?Vie de saint Antoine de Viennois?, vv. 85-96, published in Mo ra wski, La legende, 178. 229 The same temptation of Francis, in which he enters into the fire, is contained in cap. 27 of the Actus, in Actus beati Francisci et sociorum eius, ed.

ANTONY 545 fazzonamento) of V. 234 Paolo Toschi added yet another version of the story, a modern orazione, from the Umbria-Abruzzi area (whose roots he believed were trac ed back to the fourteenth century), and he compared the four versions 235. He reach ed the same conclusion as Monaci and Novati that the original poem from which V and Co derived had been composed in Northern Italy in the first half of the four teenth century, and he agreed that Ca was a raffazzonamento of V (as well as another separate source, originally composed in early fourteenth century), but he disagreed with Novati about the dependence of Co on V, declaring them to be two separate versions of the same poem 236. To the two separate versions, one in V and Co and the other in Ca, Toschi added the third of the Umbro-Abruzzese orazione, which he believed had been preserved in the oral traditions from its origins, in the same period of time as V and Co, until present day: Concludendo: abbiamo su S. Antonio tre poemetti distinti: 1) Un poemetto dell'Alta Italia (in due lezioni: Co e V) composto nella prima meta del trecento in circa 50 strofe monorime di 5 endecasillabi. 2) Un poemetto abruzzese, con tendenza a costruirsi in strofe monorime di quattro endecasillabi: deriva in parte dal precedente, e in parte da fonte piu bre ve, forse l'orazione popolare su S. Antonio.

E pero essenzialmente piu breve di entrambi, con uno svolgimento del racconto piu serrato e piu sintetico fin dairinizio: nessuna prova che essa derivi dai suddetti poemetti, invece sicurezza di rapporti con entrambi 237. Although there still may be some question as to the relationship of the different versions to one another, there is convincing evidence that the story of Antony being pledged to the devil was told, in poetic form, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in Northern, Central and Southern Italy. The written evidence is also sup ported by pictorial representation, such as the elaborate fresco cycle of the story painted in the year 1493 by Dionisio Baschenis, in Pelugo di Vigo Rendena (Trento), which includes twenty scenes of the story of Antony pledged to the devil, along with other scenes from his life (from the Historia, Vita Antonii, and Vita Pauli) 238. The episodes depicted are: a couple on pilgrimage to St. James at Compostela; the breaking of the vow of chastity, and the mother's pledge of Antony to the devil; as 234 Novati, Sopra un'antica storia, 746, and 749-50. 235 Toschi, Chapter VI ?Quando furono composte le Orazioni Umbro-Abruzzesi??, in La poesia po polare, 106-31. 236 Toscm, La poesia popolare, 109-10. 237 Toscm, La poesia popolare, 113. Cfr. Partini, Lu nimmice de lu Dimone, 118-53; in this article, Partini has also studied the story of Antony pledged to the devil, as it appears in Ca, Co and V, and in the modern version, ?La storije de sand'Anduone?, which was published by G. Finamore, Una leggenda popolare abruzzese, ?Archivio per lo studio delle tradizioni popolari?, I, (1883), 207-10. 238 Kaftal has reproduced the episodes in Iconography of the Saints in the Painting of North East Italy, 53-68, and he has adopted the Casanatense manuscript as the sole textual source. Twelve of the four teen episodes of the story of Antony pledged to the devil in the frescoes of Dionisio Baschenis are present in the Historia in Ca. Of the two remaining episodes not in Ca, the storm caused by the devil to disrupt the travel by ship of Antony's parents is found in V, vv. 44-50, and the episode of Antony's return home after his ordeal is present in Co, vv. 148-152 and V, vv. 116-120. None of the three manuscripts contains the episodes of seven other scenes in the frescoes of Baschenis: Antony's conversion, when he gives every thing to the poor; Antony leaving his sister with pious virgins; Antony receiving the monk's habit from a bishop; Antony praying as he is carried by angels to heaven; Antony's meeting with Paul, and a raven brings them a loaf of bread; Antony and Paul breaking the bread; Antony seeing Paul's soul carried by angels to heaven. These episodes find their source in the Vita Antonii and the Vita Pauli.</page><page sequence="48">546 D. DUTSCHKE the couple travels by ship to the shrine of St. James, the devil raises a storm at sea; Antony's birth; Antony is sent to school; Antony's mother tells him of her pledge/ curse; Antony goes to Rome and serves a cardinal; the Pope sends Antony away; Antony goes for help to a saintly hermit; an angel appears and sends Antony away from the hermit; Antony invokes the devil, and the devil takes him to hell; Antony is made doorkeeper of hell and is given the keys; having refused to let anyone in or out, Antony makes the devil give him a signed paper attesting his complete release; Antony returns home; Antony resists the temptress by entering into the fire; Antony's conversion, as he gives everything to the poor; Antony on his way to find Paul, meets the centaur; Antony and Paul meet; the raven brings the bread to Antony and Paul; Antony sees Paul's soul being carried by angels to heaven; Antony receives a monk's habit from a bishop; and Antony's soul is carried to heaven by angels 239. It should be no surprise to find that the story of Antony pledged to the devil was well known (Noi sapemo) by the members of a fourteenth-century confraternity in Arezzo dedicated to St. Antony the Abbot, and that the story was associated with the saint from not only Egypt, but also Vienne. Nor is it surprising to find that it existed alongside episodes of Antony's life derived from the Vita Antonii and the Vita Pauli: the same coexistence is found in the frescoes by Dionisio Baschenis, and in the Casanatense manuscript in which the Historia of Antony pledged to the devil, on ff. 28-30v, is contained in the same volume, ff. 133-137, together with a long poem entitled Leggenda de to Beatissimo Egregio Missere lu Barone Santo Antonio, which follows closely the Vita Antonii and the Vita Pauli; Antony's birth in the Leggenda, for example, is from the Vita Antonii: Santo Antonio beato In terra de Egipto fo nato. Ne la scriptura agio trovato Morto li fo lu patre et la matre, Cho una sore remase lu sancto patre. (vv. 14-18)240 The Leggenda recounts the major episodes of Antony's life: the conversion after hearing the Gospel (?Lo evangelio benedicto, Che a lo riccho si fo dicto:/ Se voy essere perfecto,/ Quanto possedi tucto vindi/ Et per li poviry lo despendi?, vv. 26-30); the retreat into the desert and the struggles with the devil, including temp tations (?citello nigro et pauruso?, v. 73; ?spiritu de fornicacione?, v. 80; ?Vede lo disco nel diserto?, v. 210), and the scene of Christ's appearing before Antony after he has been beaten by the demons (?Sancto Antonio mese voce:/ Ubi era Christus? et dove stava,/ Che le piagche non me resanavi?? vv. 177-179); and a complete re counting of the meeting with Paul. The meeting with Paul, vv. 237-458, is taken directly from Jerome, Vita Pauli: Antony sets off for the desert (vv. 237-255), meets the centaur (vv. 256-268), and the satyr (vv. 269-294); Antony finds Paul (vv. 295-335), they embrace each other (?Li dui sancti se abraczaro?, v. 336), and the raven brings the bread (vv. 339-358); encouraged by Paul, Antony returns to his bre thren (vv. 359-371); on his way back to Paul, Antony sees Paul's soul being taken to heaven (v. 391), and later he finds Paul dead (401-417); with the help of two 239 Kaftal, Iconography of the Saints in the Painting of North East Italy, 53-68. 240 Monaci, Una leggenda e una storia, 496.</page><page sequence="49">THE TRANSLATION OF ST. ANTONY 547 lions, Antony digs the grave and buries Paul (vv. 418-428); and Antony, wearing Paul's habit, returns to his brethren (vv. 434-458) 241. The juxtaposition of the Casa natense manuscript, by which the story of Antony pledged to the devil in the Historia is brought together with the episode of Antony's life in the Leggenda into one volume, in UK is a full integration of biographical material into two laude, in a compilation which, with regards to variety and extent of sources, rivals the Valletta manuscript picture book. The Valletta manuscript shares all of the episodes in UK 8 and 17, except for the story of Antony pledged to the devil and the miracles during the translation of his body, which are only in UK; Valletta contains the episodes from the Legenda mirabilis by Alphonsus Bonihominis which are missing in the laude. In the laude of UK and in the Visconti manuscript, there is a clear identifi cation of St. Antoine de Viennois: ?Con reverengia ? in Vienna stai? (UK 17, v. 75), and: ?In uiena auia una so cela? (V, v. 121) 242. Novati was able to uncover another reference to the shrine of St. Antoine de Viennois, by correcting the Corsini version (?chi da lo focho vol esser scanpato,/ a Usso longo vol esser andato,/ e tochar li sancti reliqui cum devotione?, vv. 94-96), with the Visconti version: ?Chi uolese el fogo scanpare./ al so logo [i.e. Vienne] conuien andare,/ le so requilie sancte sconuien tocare, vv. 151-153 243. Novati noted the close link between Northern Italy, especially Milan and the shrine to St. Antony de Viennois, I rapporti tra l'Abbazia di Sant'Antonio e la Lombardia furono strettissimi nel corso del sec. XIV e del XV. Basti ricordare che il duca di Milano era uno dei quattro signori a cui competeva il dirittto di portare la reliquia del Santo nella solenne processione che aveva luogo ogni anno. Gian Galeazzo, ch'erasi piaciuto inviare ricchi doni al santuario famoso, morendo lego poi ad esso le proprie viscere, secondoche attesta Pepitaffio composto per la sua tomba dal Loschi: Cum duels anguigeri variis divisa sepulchrisJ Membra cubent, sic iussit enim; nam viscera servat,/ Antoni, tua sancta domus celebrata Viennae etc. (cfr. A. De Luschis, Carmina Patavii, MDCCCLVIII, p. 35) 244. Because of the two references to the shrine at Vienne, as well as a close re lationship between Milan (the probable origin of the Visconti manuscript) and St. Antoine de Viennois, Novati suggested that the story of Antony pledged to the devil, as it was recounted in the Visconti manuscript, may have found its origin across the Alps in Saint Antoine de Viennois, ?vuoi che la raccogliesse egli stesso [il canterino] dinanzi all'urna che racchiudeva le reliquie del Taumaturgo, vuoi che l'udisse da compaesani che riedevano dall'averle venerate? 245. There is no concrete evidence of any such transmission, however, and the story of Antony pledged to the devil does not appear to have been part of the Antonine hagiography in France. Al though the verses of UK 8 recount only the first part of the story, the breaking of the vow of chastity by Antony's parents and the devil's taking of Antony who had been pledged to the devil by his parents, they convey a story which is distinct from the only possible source, the anonymous miracle of the Virgin.

DUTSCHKE Virgin, Antony is left to his own wits to struggle with the devil, and, like other heroes of Italian folklore tales, to outwit him in order to gain his freedom 246. In stead of a miraculous intercession of the Virgin, Antony engages in a legal and moral litigation with the devil (?[il dimonio]/ te rechedia per suo atesstimonio/ dei tui parenti con falsa loquentia?, UK 8, vv. 13-14), and in a gesture that reflects the world of Boccaccio's novellas rather than a miracle of the Virgin, the victorious Antony demands and receives a written document of his release, Dise Anthonio: se uoi me ca^aty, carte bele e bone me fa?aty, che de my camay no u' enpagaty, Ne a mio pare ne a mia mare may non doma[nda]ty. Le carte fon scrite e segelate 247 Even if the story of the miracle of the Virgin was transmitted into medieval Italian sacred biography, into Italian vernacular poetry, and into the laude of the Arezzo confraternity, it would seem that it was not received as a unified or distinc tive piece, but instead as an anonymous tale whose general theme and separate parts were indiscriminently extrapolated and combined with other sources to conform to a new and different tale. As Monaci and Toschi concluded, it is more likely that the story of St. Antony pledged to the devil found its origin in the common fantasia of the story teller of the fourteenth century in central Italy. Monaci writes: Se non avessimo dinanzi altro che l'antica Storia, si potrebbe pensare - e cosi avevo pen sato dapprima - a una fantasia quasi direi individuale, a uno spediente improvvisato da qualche povero cantimpanca per attirare piu folia intorno a se il giorno in cui per tutto l'Abruzzo le plebi celebravano la festa del santo. Ma la stessa narrazione, sempre viva anche ai giorni nostri sulle labbra del popolo, dice abbastanza che le sue radici si approfondiscono e si allargano ben oltre i limiti del repertorio di un povero giullare 248. Toschi responds: Sicche possiamo concludere, dietro la scorta di validi argomenti probatori, che i canti narrativi religiosi in endecasillabi con tutti quei caratteri formali e interni che illustreremo fra breve, sono nati nelle regioni deiritalia centrale e piu particolarmente neirUmbria e neirAbruzzo 249. Within that area of central Italy, Arezzo was strategically situated, and the Are zzo confraternity proved to be a receptive audience to the story 250. 246 A similar modern story, which may well have medieval roots, was collected in Sardegna, and was retold by Italo Calvino, in Fiabe italiane, II, Torino, 1968 (1 ed. 1956), 673-75. The story is about An tony's descent into hell to find fire: the devil refuses to let him free, until his pig raises such havoc that all of the devils force him to leave. Not only has he tricked the devil for his freedom, he also picks up a bur ning coal without being seen, and brings fire to the world (Sant Anton e su voju, Nughedu S. Nicolo [Sas sari], told by Adelasia Floris. Cfr. F. Valla, Sant'Antonio Abate va all'inferno, ?Rivista delle tradizioni popolari?, I, Ozieri [Sassari], 1894, 499; published in G.
