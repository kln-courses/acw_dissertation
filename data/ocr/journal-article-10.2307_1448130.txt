<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES IN COLORA- DO: A COLORADO FIELD GUIDE. Geoffrey A Hammerson. 1999. 2d ed. University Colorado Press, Niwot, Colorado ISBN 0-87081-521-0. $59.95 (hardbound); ISBN 0-87081-534-2. $29.95 (paperback). xxvi + 484 p.-Conservation be- gins with a working knowledge of the floral and faunal elements that occur in a region. Regional field guides such as Hammerson's Amphibians and Reptiles in Colorado are invaluable in provid- ing specific information to state and federal management agencies when the management needs of nongame wildlife are considered. This field guide is an extensive review of the herpe- tofauna of the southern Rocky Mountains re- gion. The overall format and breadth of infor- mation set a precedent for future authors. The text is considerably expanded and up- dated since publication of the first first edition (Hammerson, 1982). The species accounts gen- erally reflect the current knowledge of a partic- ular species. Individual species accounts vary in length from 12 pages for Crotalus viridis to only two pages for Rhinochelius lecontei and Sonora sem- iannulata. Photographs, ranging from one to 10 per account, are of high quality and illustrate diagnostic and other interesting characteristics of the species. Distribution maps are well pre- sented, with individual collecting localities rep- resented by single dots. I did not find any ty- pographical errors that detracted from the qual- ity of the book. There are some inconsistencies in format of the citations, but this will be no- ticed only by the most picky copy editors. No- menclature throughout the book generally fol- lows what is currently accepted, with especially interesting systematic discussions of Bufo boreas and Eumeces multivirgatus. The book is organized into eight chapters, four appendices, a glossary, references, and an index. Chapter 1 describes many of the impor- tant events that helped shape the study of her- petology in Colorado. As in many western states, the first explorations that included herpetolog- ical collections occurred during the early 1800s. Hammerson describes some of the most impor- tant expeditions of this period and follows the development of Colorado herpetology through modern day university professionals, graduate students, and management agencies. All of these should be commended for their role in the conservation of Colorado's native herpeto- fauna. Reading Chapter 2 feels like to vacation to Colorado. This chapter provides detailed infor- mation on the major physiographic regions of the area, with color photographs illustrating the varied topographic features and habitats of the state. There are 12 maps illustrating prominent physiographic features, topography, geology, major streams and drainage systems, tempera- ture regimes, precipitation, and vegetation. Chapter 3 discusses anthropomorphic impacts on the herpetofauna of Colorado, including res- idential and commercial development, intensive agriculture, pesticide use, mineral extraction, water development, and introduction of non- native species. The take-home-message, that hu- man activities often have devastating conse- quences for native wildlife, is important and is true for amphibians and reptiles worldwide. Along with important herpetological conserva- tion organizations (e.g., DAPTF, PARC), public awareness gained through well-written regional field guides is paramount in the efforts to slow the worldwide decline of amphibians and rep- tiles. Chapter 4 lists the conservation status of the amphibians and reptiles in Colorado as of 1998. Such lists are interesting, albeit dynamic. As hu- man population growth and the associated hab- itat degradation continues, and as more am- phibian and reptile population data are collect- ed, these rankings change. In the more inno- vative-thinking state and federal wildlife management agencies, stricter regulations for the protection for native amphibians and rep- tiles are being developed. I found it interesting that as of 1998, the Colorado Wildlife Commis- sion still affords protection to bullfrogs, requir- ing a fishing license to harvest the species. With this voracious, nonnative species being impli- cated in the possible decline of native ranid frogs throughout the western United States, it is surprising the species is still protected by state law. However, the same is true in New Mexico! Table 4.1 provides a graphic look at the conser- vation status of Colorado amphibians and rep- tiles, though many readers will need extra strong reading glasses for the fine print. Chapter 5 discusses the observation and pho- tography of amphibians and reptiles. It is obvi- ous from the 207 photographs of amphibians and reptiles in this book, with all but 18 taken by the author, that Hammerson is well qualified</page><page sequence="2">292 COPEIA, 2001, NO. 1 to write on this subject. He admits, and as any- one who has taken in situ photographs of am- phibians and reptiles knows, that most of these photos were taken after the animal was cap- tured and painstakingly coaxed into a seminat- ural pose. The species accounts discuss the identifica- tion, distribution, conservation status, habitat, life history, and taxonomy of each species of amphibians and reptile occurring in Colorado. Chapter 6 contains a brief explanation of these accounts and factors affecting the information to be included under each heading. There is an interesting discussion on the taxonomy and var- iation in select species. Chapter 7 begins with a detailed and informative introduction to the general biology of amphibians, followed by in- dividual species accounts for one salamander and 17 species frogs and toads in five families. Some species accounts are longer than others, but this reflects the current state of knowledge. The Bufo boreas account is perhaps the most complete treatment of this declining species ever written. Egg masses, tadpoles, or larvae are illustrated for 13 species, but not for Scaphiopus couchii, Bufo cognatus, B. debilis, Acris crepitans, or Gastrophryne olivacea. Chapter 8 begins with a detailed and infor- mative introduction to the general biology of reptiles, followed by accounts for five turtles in four families, 19 lizards in four families, and 26 snakes in three families. Again, the length of the accounts is variable, reflecting differences in available information on each species. Both the amphibian and reptiles species accounts con- tain much original data and interesting infor- mation gleaned from the author's own field- work in Colorado. For instance, I had no idea that Liochlorophis vernalis would feed on crayfish! Additionally, the term "invertivore," used to de- scribe the food habits of Cnemidophorus, stimu- lated interesting conversations with my col- leagues. Are any amphibians or reptiles solely "vertivores"? The book includes four appendices. Appen- dix A lists five species, one amphibian, one am- phisbaeinid, and three snakes that might occur in Colorado. Although the possibility of the amphisbaenid (Bipes sp.) or an unidentified plethodontid salamander (e.g., Aneides or Pleth- odon) occurring in Colorado is slim, the occur- rence of the three snakes is more likely. Two of these, the rubber boa, Charina bottae, and the eastern hognose snake, Heterodon platyrhi- nos, are included in the Key to Snakes, but the brown snake, Storeria dekayi is omitted. Appen- dix B lists the amphibians and reptiles found in National Parks, National Monuments, and River Canyons of Colorado and Eastern Utah and will be useful for tourists. Included is a brief description of three lizards known to oc- cur in eastern Utah but not in Colorado, the desert horned lizard (Phrynosoma platyrhinos), chuckwalla (Sauromalus ater), and desert night lizard (Xantusia vigilis). The print font is small in Table B.1 and therefore will be difficult for some to read. The table contains a question mark (?) when the distribution is expected but unknown, which will be helpful for those in- terested in furthering the knowledge of the dis- tribution of the Colorado herpetofauna. It is evident from this table that more herpetofaun- al surveys need to be conducted in the Pawnee National Grasslands. Appendix C is a 16-page Key to Amphibians and Reptiles of Colorado, which includes sepa- rate keys to amphibian larvae, metamorphosed amphibians, and turtles, lizards, and snakes. I found the keys accurate and easy to use. The key illustrations are clear and well done, but I wonder why the illustration of the dorsal blotch- es in Bufo cognatus takes up more space than the entire scalation of a snake head or the nomen- clature for the scutes on the plastron and cara- pace of a turtle. Appendix D provides an expla- nation of the use of scientific names and pro- vides an etymology of most names used in the text. The glossary is mostly complete, with 104 terms, but I felt it should contain terms such as keratinized, striated, or phenology to be more complete for the layperson who will surely ap- preciate the detail in this book. The references section includes 1823 citations (by my count); it is complete and up-to-date. This listing of ref- erences alone is worth the cost of the book. I found only a couple of missing references (in- cluding Stuart and Painter, 1994; p. 91, Bufo bo- reas account). The index is thorough; for in- stance, there are 42 references to beetles! This book is a worthy and valuable addition to the herpetological literature for Colorado and the southern Rocky Mountains. It is packed with interesting natural history information and is written with the enthusiasm and concern of someone truly dedicated to the conservation of amphibians and reptiles.
