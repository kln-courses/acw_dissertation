<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVENING DEVOTIONS JEROME TONER IT seems that the Carthusians of Parkminster are in the enviable position of being able to discourage people from trying the austerities of their life. In a recent issue of the Life of the Spirit, there is an open letter from Peter Anson with the purpose of staying-off converts from joining the community at Parkminster. Among other interesting things, he writes : "I may be wrong, but I have the feeling that it is unwise for any convert to enter a Carthusian novitiate until he is firmly convinced that the man or woman in the street is capable of the same union with God by saying the Rosary, making the Stations of the Cross, dropping into the last Mass on a Sunday morning, and just managing to make his or her Easter duties, as an enclosed monk who chants the Divine Office in choir, and who has a profound knowledge of mystical theology." A statement like that leaves room for qualification, but it puts a point from which this paper should begin : evening devotions are a work of supererogation. People who never come to evening devotions can live in union with God, and some of them in very close union with Him. There is a great number of people for whom the Mass is everything ; it is the unique form of public devotion, and for them it seems more than sufficient. Outside of Mass they have their private prayer, but no other form of public worship attracts them. Evening devotions have a limited appeal ; they are not necessary for everyone. Yet they fulfil a purpose in the life of the Church, and in the lives of many people in the Church of God. They continue the priestly work of Our Lord. For in our evening devotions God is thanked, God is praised, God is petitioned, and to God satisfaction for sin is offered. They continue his teaching work, for normally an instruction is part of the evening service, or a meditation on the mysteries of the Rosary or meditations on His Passion. We learn from Christ Our Lord at evening devotions. The individual Christian has always found that some form of community worship in the evening time serves a useful purpose. From the very beginning we are told that the faithful " remained steadfast to the apostles' doctrine, and to fellowship and the Breaking of Bread ; and to the Prayers." (Acts 2 :41). This fourth characteristic of early Christian life?prayer in common?is the primitive background to evening devotions. Before the Family Rosary was thought of, " about midnight, however, Paul and</page><page sequence="2">EVENING DEVOTIONS 621 Silas were praying and chanting psalms to God, and the prisoners were listening to them." (Acts 16:25). Besides this tendency to pray together, there was always in the Church what St. Thomas calls oratio communis in contrast with oratio singularis. &lt;Of oratio communis he says?" est quae per ministros Ecclesiae in persona totius fidelis populi Deo offertur." (II. II. 83.12). This we would call the Divine Office, as chanted by canons, monks and friars, on behalf of the whole people of God. St. Thomas, speaking here of vocal prayer, says that this should be chanted with a loud voice, so that it may be heard by those for whom it is being offered. People have always loved to listen to this wonderful prayer ; and in listening to it, they themselves have been moved to prayerful union with God. Perhaps this is the highest form of participation of which the ordinary faithful are capable ; when they are initiated into a more literal participation in the liturgical prayer of the Divine Office, they are overwhelmed by a task too great for them. In countries where the cathedral canons recite the Divine Office in common, the liturgical spirit penetrates outside of the cathedral. In France one meets the extraordinary phenomenon of a parish priest singing solemn vespers with a few dozen women parishioners. A few years ago I undertook a summer tutorship with a French family. The mother was a country woman, and often I used hear her singing the Veni Creator as she washed the dishes. One day she told me how as a girl she used to join in Vespers each Sunday. I could hardly believe it, because from other conversations with her I knew that she had only primary education. But to prove it, she began to sing the In exitu Israel de Aegypto in the tonus peregrinus, and then, contrasting her liking for singing at the High Mass with singing Vespers, she said : " J'aime beaucoup la Grande Messe : mais chanter les V?pres, c'est toute ma vie." On the other hand, as experience shows, there are everywhere people who have no desire to join in singing liturgical offices or even hymns of any kind. Neverthleess it seems true that to sing is a great help in our Christian life when the singing is done well and worthily by a choir, e.g. the cathedral Tenebrae, the sung office in the great monasteries, and also when the singing comes from a very large congregation of the faithful at the close of a mission, on a pilgrimage, or at a Eucharistie congress. As a private devotion of small groups of holy people it can also be helpful. One cannot forget how St. Dominic loved to sing the Ave Maris Stella, as he walked with his friar-companions through Italy, or</page><page sequence="3">622 THE FURROW how Matt Talbot and Monsignor Hickey sang "O Mother I could weep for mirth " in the attic where the Servant of God was living. But in our enthusiasm for congregational singing of any kind, we cannot afford to forget what a convert wrote recently: "I thank God that I can at last go to service without having to sing." To listen to the singing of the sacred liturgy is for many people very helpful ; it puts them in the mood for prayer, it is an invitation to join in spirit with the choir which sings in their stead. Further more, to sing with a multitude, or to be one of a multitude which sings praise to God and His saints is an unforgettable experience. It is half the joy of Lourdes. Experiments Normally when we experiment with approved forms of liturgical worship at evening devotions, we take either Vespers or Compline, because they are the evening and night prayer of the Church. In St. Saviour's, Dublin, the community and the altar boys sing Compline together every Sunday. There evening devotions on Sundays consists of Compline, Sermon and Benediction. Since this experiment began, the congregation has not decreased, but it has changed somewhat. Old devotees were a little shocked at the dropping of the Rosary, and they now go to some other church, where Sunday evening devotions are as they have always been. On the other hand the younger people will grow up in this liturgical atmosphere, and they will love it more than any other form of evening service. It is really nothing new. When the late Father Bertrand Larkin was a young man and working in Dublin in the 1870's, he used to join with the community of St. Saviour's in singing Vespers. That was one of the duties of a member of the Rosary Confraternity. All over Ireland at the close of the last century there was an enthusiastic revival of liturgical life. While giving a retreat in Blackrock, Co. Dublin, an elderly man? a retired teacher?called me aside on my way out of the church. He wanted to tell me how pleased he was to meet a Dominican again. As a boy he had served Mass in St. Mary's, Cork, and he recalled with a good deal of pride how, being a singer, he was asked to sing the In manus at Compline on a Sunday afternoon. Besides the Dominick Street experiment, a group of university students sings Compline each Sunday in University Church, Dublin ; another group of students sings Vespers with the Third Order in the Carmelite Church, Clarendon Street. In the diocese</page><page sequence="4">EVENING DEVOTIONS 623 of Cloyne Compline is sung on Sundays. These I think are hopeful signs of liturgical life. Another reason, of course, for taking Vespers and Compline rather than any other part of the Divine Office as an evening service for the faithful, is that they are short, and do not change. This makes it an easy matter to teach intelligent people the Latin psalms and hymns. If, however, one thinks of having Vespers or Compline in English I think we should extend our experiment to other parts of the Divine Office, particularly to Matins and Lauds. For I think it is true to say that the people who most appreciate Vespers or Compline are those whose spiritual life is nourished in one way or another by what Matins and Lauds supplies for us. They read the Scriptures ; they read devout works and the lives of the saints ; they meditate. But such people are a minority. There are few people who read in their leisure time, and very few people whose reading could be called spiritual reading. Yet it is normally through meditative reading of the Scriptures and of devout works that ordinary people as well as priests and religious can attain to a spirit of devotion and prayer. For that reason, I feel that a form of Matins and Lauds adapted for the use of the faithful at evening devotions, would enrich the spiritual lives of ordinary people. Again we must insist that evening service is a matter of supererogation ; our aim is not to fill the church for devotions, but to fill the people with devotion. It would be a lamentable mistake to focus one's attention on box office judge ments concerning evening service. At the same time our evening service must be attractive, and particularly nowadays when there are so many counter-attractions. Prayer is sometimes difficult, and depending on our temperament, more trying for some than for others. But we know that prayer should not be a bore, nor essentially a penitential exercise. More or less on this point, Abbot Vonier wrote : " We must be quite clear on this one matter ; we are expected to give to the world a religion that will interest the believer, a religion that will satisfy his artistic cravings . . . our Faith must be beautiful if it is to hold souls." {Sketches and Studies in Theology, p. 150). An evening service planned on the format of Matins and Lauds could run this way : Begin with an invitation to pray?the 94th Psalm, or simply the hymn Holy God We Praise Thy Name. Then there follow three psalms, or a decade of the Rosary?the Our Father, the Blessing, and the reading of some suitable part of the Sacred Scriptures. Another three psalms, (a further decade</page><page sequence="5">624 THE FURROW of the Rosary) follow immediately. Then the Our Father, the Blessing, and the reading of some spiritual classic, the short life of a saint, or a suitable extract from a longer life of the saint. The priest could if he wished preach a short panegyric on the saint. People love that kind of sermon. Continue with a third nocturn on the same lines, the reading of the Gospel of the Mass for the following day, and commentary thereon from the Fathers, or by some modern writer, or a homily preached by the priest himself. Then the Te Deum could be sung in Latin or in English ; or it could be said as one says the Litany of Loreto. I feel that Lauds should be incorporated into Benediction. One could hold on to the Sunday Lauds, or use any of the psalms for Lauds during the week. The use of such prayers is important for the spiritual life of the people. Prayer has tended too much of late to be purely a matter of petition. Even the Rosary, which is fundamentally a contemplative prayer, has been given a pre dominantly petitionary value by certain compilers of novenas and prayer-books. The Monday night novena is also an instance of a most popular form of evening service, with, however, a dominant note of petition. I feel, therefore, that to introduce a form of prayer in which God is praised in a specific manner, would be an excellent development in our evening devotions. The Canticle of the Three Youths?Benedicite?is something every Christian should be familiar with. Such prayer has, like all liturgical prayer, a wonderful doctrinal power. A person may know that God made the world ; it is one of the first things one learns in the catechism. But it is only by using a prayer such as the Benedicite that one begins to appreciate the godliness of natural things ; one feels more than ever the impact of God's sustaining and creating power in the world around us. At the close of Lauds, the Benedictus could be sung in Latin, and the ordinary Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament would bring the service to a close. One of the great advantages of this form of evening devotions is that it contains an amount of spiritual reading, and particularly the reading of the Scriptures. In his article on The Integral Irish Tradition,1 An tAth. Donnchadh ? Floinn, Professor of Modern Irish in Maynooth, notes that among the primary intellectual and spiritual attitudes in our ancient Church, the first was " a great articulate reverence for the sources of revelation, for Sacred Scripture and Tradition ... The Irish Church, following St. Patrick's 1 The Furrow, December 1954.</page><page sequence="6">EVENING DEVOTIONS 625 example, was steeped in Scripture and also in the lore and learning of the Church." In his Confession there are thirty-seven citations from the Old Testament and almost a hundred from the New Testament. But we have grown shy of the Scriptures. The difficulty one experiences in getting a modern congregation in a Catholic church in Ireland to listen to a few short passages from the Scriptures is distressing. Perhaps it can be explained by our love of personalities. Nowhere are people more devoted to their favourite preachers. They will not allow a book to come between them and the personality of the preacher. Preaching and reading are different things. And while we are quick to find fault with the training we received as preachers, we are slow to murmur about the lack of training as readers. Preaching is a far more specialized art than reading. Almost any literate person can be trained to read, just as we have been trained to write. Public reading, in spite of the wide circulation a book may have nowadays? is still a wonderful means of enriching the spiritual lives of our people. I remember listening to a French cur? as he read during the Sunday Mass, which happened to be the Feast of the Holy Name of Mary, that little sermon of St. Bernard which is the 2nd Nocturn for the feast. It made a wonderful impression on his flock. An Italian priest I knew read classical works on Our Lady every evening during May as a form of evening devotion. He told me that for him to preach every evening for the month would be quite impossible. No doubt only a small proportion of our parishioners would turn up for spiritual reading each evening for a month ; but these are very often the people whom God is calling to a high degree of sanctity, and we cannot deny them the care and direction they need. Our Lenten, May and October devotions should always contain some form of spiritual reading. EVENING DEVOTIONS TODAY The Rosary Evening devotions normally consists of Rosary and Benediction, or during Lent and on Fridays, Stations of the Cross and Bene diction. This is a form of evening service to which we in Ireland are very attached. We carry it with us abroad. I suppose in Rome the Irish churches are unique in celebrating their patron feasts with Rosary, Sermon and Benediction. In his encyclical letter on Christian Worship Our Holy Father Pope Pius XII said that the practice of concluding certain devotional exercises which</page><page sequence="7">626 THEWFURROW have become customary among Christians with Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament is to be especially commended?that such devotion undoubtedly contributes greatly to the living of the liturgical life. Among what he calls non-liturgical devotions he mentions particularly the Rosary. It may be that in Ireland we have found it to be an excellent substitute for liturgical forms of evening devotions. If that is so, we must keep our Rosary, Benediction and hymn as like in form to the splendour of the Church's liturgy as possible. But is it like in form to the splendour and beauty of the pure liturgy ? First of all the manner of saying the Rosary. It is rushed, jagged, without pause, whereas in the Church's public prayer, dignity, sweetness, solemnity are recommended. That is one of the reasons why so many people dislike the Rosary as a prayer in church. For many people it is all very well to say the Rosary privately, but its public recitation is something to be endured. Perhaps we should be honest about it and say that few people really meditate on the mysteries during the public recitation of the Rosary. It is not the lack of good will, but the need for some kind of stimulating image or thought which we could give them instead of the " let us contemplate in this mystery." Occasionally one might break off from that to give a personal meditation on the mystery. One could read from the Gospel, where there is a reading of the Gospel to match the mystery ; or one could read the meditation of some saintly writer?or from the Mass in the Missal which corresponds to the mystery. At any rate it is essential that if the Rosary is to remain the prayer of our evening service, it should be used properly. As a prayer it is closely linked with the liturgy. On account of its format of one hundred and fifty Ave's it is known as the layman's psalter, the mysteries are the very ones round which the liturgical cycle turns. I sometimes wonder if it would not be better to say only two mysteries and to preface them with an instruction or meditation on those mysteries, rather than to go rambling through five mysteries in a drowsy, listless manner. The Rosary, being a contemplative form of prayer, is not ideally suited to public service ; its value as a family prayer comes from the fact that it prepares the children of a family for a life in which they will have to pray on their own, and on account of its simplicity and adaptability for alternate use it is an excellent community prayer for any married couple. But the richest graces come from using the Rosary as a form of private prayer, after the manner of St. Bernadette, whose soul was infused</page><page sequence="8">EVENING DEVOTIONS 627 with the spirit of contemplation?" tout en r?citant le chapelet, je regardais tant que je pouvais." When we compare the liturgical presentation of such mysteries as the Resurrection of Our Lord, His Ascension, the Coming of the Holy Ghost, the Assumption and Crowning of Our Lady with the ten minutes spent in con templation of these mysteries in the corresponding part of the Rosary, it is obvious that the Rosary cannot be considered as an adequate substitute for the liturgy. Indeed, it is the celebration of the feasts in honour of these mysteries that enriches more than anything else our meditation on the Rosary. It is interesting to notice how many people prefer the sorrowful mysteries of the Rosary to the others, and how many people find it easier to make the Stations of the Cross than to say the Rosary. The reason is that people are better acquainted with Holy Week than with any other part of the liturgical cycle ; they have the Passion of Our Lord in their minds, and besides, the five sorrowful mysteries of the Rosary and the fourteen stations are facets of the one great mystery of Our Lord's Passion. We should not be satisfied with celebrating the great feasts of the Church by having Rosary and Benediction on the day of the feast, or for an octave afterwards. I do not think that such a manner of celebrating a feast?although it is the easiest way? achieves the purpose of the Church in instituting that feast. The Church wished that we should learn the mystery, and that having taken the mystery to heart, it should become a means of increasing God's grace within us. In the third of these interesting articles which were published by Dom Vonier first of all in The Clergy Review, and then in book form as Sketches and Studies in Theology we read : Yet we have to admit that the Catholic Church has achieved the impossible ; that she has presented to all generations of Christians the mysteries of her Faith, not only with the greatest fidelity to the very text of the mystery, but with a skill in rendering the invisible visible, the intangible tangible, that is truly astonishing . . . How is it that in spite of its baffling abstruseness the doctrine of the Trinity has remained, even for the simple Catholic, a vivid and life giving familiarity with God without any intermingling of base anthropomorphism ? How is it that the Catholic people can understand easily what is meant by the Incarnation ? How is it that the Virgin Birth, about which learned men outside the Church blunder so grossly, is for Catholics a</page><page sequence="9">628 THE FURROW doctrine easily acceptable, a doctrine whose place in the economy of salvation they instinctively see ? Evidently the Church has done more than just state those doctrines, she has made them acceptable and sweet, she has given them a charm, she has made them lovable. The Church, in other words, has made of all her main doctrines feasts for her people, (p. 147-8). But nowadays it is obvious that feasts pass unnoticed. What do Epiphany, Candlemas, Ascension, Pentecost, mean to the people ? Speaking for cities, I think they pass without an impression on the Christian mind and memory. Whatever our difficulties may be about presenting the mystery in its fullness at Mass, we could harness evening service in such a way as to bring before the people the mystery they are celebrating. For this purpose, the Rosary and Benediction evening service is certainly a failure. In Tallaght, and I am sure in other churches, when announcing on Sunday certain feasts that will occur during the week, we say: "Friday, the feast of St. Joseph will be " a day of special devotion," and immediately we follow up with " Rosary and Benediction at 8." But really there is nothing special about that devotion. It may succeed in getting people to do that much in honour of St. Joseph ; but after his feast St. Joseph is no better known, or loved, the memory of his life is in no way renewed. I suggest that we should go back to the use of the vigil. On the night before the feast rather than on the actual feast we should have our evening service, much the same as Matins and Lauds for the same feast. That will give us an opportunity of preparing the people for the feast itself. On such an occasion we could draw on the Matins and Lauds format of evening devotions which I have suggested. Or we could speak for a while and read a little about the mystery to be celebrated, and if it forms part of the Rosary, we could then say that mystery. It might be possible to comment on the proper of the Mass for the feast. Whatever we do, we should remember that the celebration of these great liturgical feasts is a most important and vital thing in the Christian life. Benediction and Hymnsinging Benediction must remain an essential part of our evening service in Ireland, for Celtic piety is profoundly Eucharistie. Yet there is room for improvement here also. O Salutaris and Tantum ergo are too frequently sung to the same tune, and congregations are</page><page sequence="10">EVENING DEVOTIONS 629 allowed to drag these hymns notoriously. The latitude which the Rubrics permit with regard to the hymns is not sufficiently exploited. It is a pity that our congregations do not extend their repertoire of Latin hymns and antiphons. Short antiphons like the Ave Verum, the Salve Regina, the Regina Coeli, the Christus vincit? would enrich considerably the spiritual treasure of the faithful. I often wonder how many ordinary people understand what Benediction is ; and for that reason I think Dom Vonier's study of the relation between Mass and Benediction should be published in pamphlet form. At any rate the faithful have the vaguest ideas about the meaning of this Eucharistie service, and there is always the danger that they may think of it as something altogether distinct from the Mass. This danger is more pressing than we think ; a man once said to me:" you know I prefer Benediction to anything else." A practice that may be the cause of this con fusion is the Benediction service after the last Mass. In favour of this custom it is argued that in some parts of the country there is no other suitable time for evening devotions. If that is the case, the Mass must be everything. The system of getting things in, as we say, by changing morning into evening is peculiarly Celtic ; good, bad, or indifferent, the law must be fulfilled. What rankles most of all is the hymn we sing after Benediction. By some unwritten law it must never be more or less than two verses. No doubt sometimes these hymns are lacking so much in meaning that it really matters little which verses we sing. We have a legacy from the 19th century of outmoded pious melodies. They are as dead as the music-hall hits of the same period. In a very interesting lecture which was published afterwards in Blackfriars (June-July, 1937), Father Aelwin Tindal-Atkinson O.P. said : " The criterion of their popularity is difficult to estimate : it seems to depend partly on a resolute conservatism which rejects all but those learnt in childhood : these few are sung without much regard to their teaching, their poetic value, their musical quality or their devotional stimulus. They are just a habit ! Rather like sitting in the same pew in church ! The presence of a stranger in our pew or on our hymn board produces the same feeling of mild outrage." In the matter of hymn books, the C.T.S.I. has helped us very little. Few of the hymns which are in frequent use in Ireland have for their theme a mystery in the life of Our Lord. Most of them are personal addresses to Our Lord, and the form of address is often lacking in reverence and dignity. Contrast, for instance,</page><page sequence="11">630 THE FURROW the " Adoro Te" with "Sweet Sacrament Divine," or "(9 vos aether ei plaudite cives," a hymn for the Assumption (West minster Hymnal), with "Hail, Queen of Heaven." How different from " Remind thy Son that He has paid the price of our iniquity " is that verse of the Assumption hymn : Then hear us, we pray, on this blessed day ; Remember we also are thine ; And deign for thy children with Jesus to plead, That He may forgive us, and grant us in need His strength and protection divine. A non-Catholic could read through our small hymnal, and at the end, were it not for "God Bless our Pope," he might still be wondering to what sect these hymns belong. Having read through the hymn "God Bless our Pope," he might be excused for continuing to withhold his allegiance to the one who lives " full in the panting heart of Rome." I suggest that we should ban such hymns with all the courage of the man who threw the T?stal flame into the Liffey. Instead of them there are many translations of Latin hymns which suit the celebration of the great mysteries of our Redemption. Whatever we do about this problem, our hymns, if they are to be proper by-products of the liturgy, must have dignity, dogmatic clarity, and sound piety. The approach in too many of our hymns is emotional and the poetry flat and uninspiring. In 1937 Father Tindal Atkinson, in the lecture already quoted, was not so hopeful. He said : The hymn is a song just like any other : and if we find our supreme musical pleasure in drawing-room ditties like " The Little Grey Home in the West " or " Roses in Picardy," we shall almost inevitably prefer the hymn that conveys the same kind of sentiments in the same kind of fashion. If we know next to nothing of poetry, we shall be prepared to tolerate almost any doggerel that comes our way in church. In fact for the generality of Catholics set right in the thick of modern industrial conditions, which make it uncommonly difficult to form human cultivated tastes and find an active recreation in creative pursuits, it is hard to see when we shall begin to form any taste whatever for really good hymns such as we possess in the Church's liturgical offices.</page><page sequence="12">EVENING DEVOTIONS 631 Occasional Services In rural Ireland, the Rogation processions should be revived. Morning is not always the most suitable time for such processions. But there is no reason why they could not take place in the evening. A plain cross erected at three cross roads in the parish, would be the rallying point for the procession. For the occasion it would be a good thing to teach some group of people the Litanies of the Saints ; once an impressive schola cantorum has been formed, other people will pick up the responses. When someone dies in the district, part of the Office of the Dead could be introduced as a devotion, suitable for the evening on which the remains are brought to the church. Perhaps it might be better if the evening devotions on one Sunday in the month consisted of part of the Office of the Dead, the singing of the Libera, and Benediction with the officium of the Requiem Mass instead of O Salutaris. During November this could be done each week. In times of crisis, when there is sickness, for instance, when crops are in danger, when the Church is suffering persecution, prayers with these crises as their theme should be embodied in the evening service. Doubtless the prayer which the bishop in such an event may prescribe as an additional collect in the Mass, has in itself a wonderful efficacy. But to read from the votive Mass for one or other of these crises during the evening devotions stimulates the prayer of the faithful and expresses their trust in God's providence, and their Christian solidarity with brethren, however distant they may be from them. In Ireland we are too frequently inclined to let Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament for a few hours after the last Mass become the common form of dealing with any crisis which calls for special prayer. These particular needs of the people of God demand a more specific prayer of the priest and the people together. When it is specific, as it is in the votive Masses, the one in time of war for instance, the prayer contains all those other acts besides the petition which are so essential to the perfection of any prayer. Conclusion People are saying that evening devotions are finished. Indeed we hear it more often from priests than from people. There are too many counter-attractions. That may be so. But some of this decadence is due to our own lack of initiative. We are too content</page><page sequence="13">632 THE F?RROW with forms of evening devotions which have no hold on the people of to-day. These devotions, being an accidental thing, must be changed from time to time. The Mass, being essential, is different. Even an accidental change in the Mass must be countenanced by the highest authority. But in the matter of evening devotions, we can afford to go back to that happy state which preceded the Reformation, and in which every diocese had its own peculiar customs. Too much uniformity can be deadening, and a uniformity of accidentals can take away from that beauty which we find in the liturgy of the Church. The loveliness of this variety is a reflection of the loveliness of our accidental beatitude in heaven. JEROME TONER St. Mary's, Tallaght, Co. Dublin.</page></plain_text>
