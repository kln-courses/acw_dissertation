<plain_text><page sequence="1">Natural Religion and Deism in America before Ethan Allen and Thomas Paine A. Owen Aldridge T 1IMOTHY Dwight in i803 recorded his opinion that Ethan Allen's Reason the Only Oracle of Man (1784) was "the first formal publication in the United States openly directed against the Christian religion."1 I propose to show that, except for the word "openly," this statement more properly applies to a pamphlet published in Boston in I77i bearing the title Sermon on Natural Religion by a Natural Man. I shall also show that Dr. Thomas Young, generally considered to be the co-author of Allen's Reason the Only Oracle of Man, published an openly deistical creed in a Boston newspaper in 1772, the year following the appearance of the Sermon on Natural Religion.2 In so doing, I am making no claim whatsoever to trace the history of deism in America. My primary objective is to reveal the impor- tance of an acknowledged deistical tract being printed in America in 1771, and my secondary objective is to suggest a transitional relationship between natural religion as presented in this openly heterodox work and natural reli- gion as treated by earlier orthodox theologians. The task of introducing any document associated with deism in its his- torical and ideological contexts is complicated by the manifold connotations associated with the concept itself and with the overlapping term natural reli- gion. According to some historians, the concepts are identical; according to others, they are vastly different. Some of the original texts on which scholars have based their conclusions similarly maintain that revealed religion and natural religion are complementary and mutually supporting; others affirm that they are contradictory and diverse. A simple distinction has been offered A. Owen Aldridge is professor emeritus at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana. He is grateful for the exceedingly helpful comments of the anonymous readers of this article. 1 Dwight, Travels in New England and New York, ed. Barbara Miller Solomon, vol. 2 (Cambridge, Mass., i969), 283; Allen, Reason the Only Oracle of Man (Bennington, Vt., I784). 2 None of the books on American deism treats these texts. The earliest stresses political rela- tionships: G. Adolph Koch, Republican Religion: The American Revolution and the Cult of Reason (New York, I933); reprinted in i964 under the same title and in i968 as Religion of the American Enlightenment (New York). Herbert M. Morais devotes considerable attention to theological background in Deism in Eighteenth-Century America (New York, i960; orig. pub. I934). Kerry S. Walters has edited an anthology with a long general introduction, head notes, and bibliography: The American Deists: Voices of Reason and Dissent in the Early Republic (Lawrence, Kans., I992). Walters's companion volume, Rational Infidels: The American Deists (Longwood, Colo., I992), presents biographical background and ideological analyses of the 6 deists covered in the anthol- ogy: Benjamin Franklin, Ethan Allen, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, Elihu Palmer, and Philip Freneau but, apart from Franklin, does not deal with the period before Allen. The William and Mary Quarterly, 3d Series, Vol. LIV, No. 4, October I997</page><page sequence="2">836 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY by a recent British critic: one system is "a supposed set of divine truths spe- cially communicated by God in history" and the other "a real system of truths available to all by the use of unaided reason."3 Another scholar has asserted that the associated term deism is so elusive that it should be taken merely as a label of convenience rather than a reference to a precise system of thought.4 Both deism and natural religion exist in two forms, that which professes to discover God through the signs of order and contrivance in the physical universe and that which professes to discover God through the moral nature of man.5 Another seldom articulated distinction is between deists, who wished to proclaim a particular form of religion, and freethinkers, who envi- sioned the liberty of writing and publishing without censorship. Many English deists were reluctant to declare themselves openly opposed to revela- tion and retained membership in the Church of England as a necessary requirement for citizenship. Some of their writings, deliberately or not, mixed elements of latitudinarianism and free thought.6 Another confusion exists between the terms "natural religion" and "natural theology." The first was used by Jean Bodin in the late sixteenth century and the second by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz early in the eighteenth. In the strictest sense, natural religion comprises mainly cosmic evidence to prove the existence and providence of God, whereas natural theology forms one of the branches of metaphysics dealing with the deity. The texts I shall be examining make no such distinction but consider natural religion to be, as defined above, "a real system of truths available to all by the use of unaided reason." During the eighteenth century, American ministers followed the reason- ing of Anglican divines who argued, on the basis of the life sciences as well as on Isaac Newton's astronomical discoveries, that nature offers unim- peachable proofs of the existence of God. Newton wrote a series of letters to the Anglican theologian Richard Bentley explaining how his theories of order in the universe could be used as evidence of a divine creator. Bentley turned the letters into eight sermons delivered in i692 and published under various titles, including The Folly and Unreasonableness of Atheism. In the previous year, John Ray had published a similar work with a more specific title, The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of the Creation.7 3 Peter Byrne, Natural Religion and the Nature of Religion: The Legacy of Deism (London, i989), 4. This definition conforms with Allen's statement, "The senses are well calculated to make discoveries of external objects, . . . enabling the mind to examine into the natural causes and consequences of things, and to investigate the knowledge of moral good and evil.... This is the origin of moral obligation and accountability, which is called natural religion," in Reason the Only Oracle (facsimile edition, New York, I940), i86. 4 Robert E.

The work's modern editor explains that it was the first to transmit to America the basic method- ology of natural theology and notes that in following Ray and various com- mentators on Newton, Mather "goes dangerously far at times in characterizing nature in mechanistic terms, but he does not go all the way."8 Later in the century, John Wesley, founder of Methodism, published a semiscientific textbook, A Survey of the Wisdom of God in the Creation; or a Compendium of Natural Philosophy (1763).9 Although Wesley's title is similar to Ray's, the book is essentially a composite of abridged translations of works by Continental authors John Francis Buddeus, Charles Bonnet, Louis Dutens, as well as Mather. Other divines in England stressed ethics rather than science, following Lord Shaftesbury's method of arguing that the basic principles of morality could be discerned by human reason and that these principles in themselves demonstrate the existence of a divine being. Their arguments were based solely on reason, not on intuition, and they had little in common with individual inspiration of the kind later hailed by Emerson in his essay "Nature." William Wollaston in his Religion of Nature Delineated (1722), perhaps the locus classicus at the time for the definition of natural religion, combining as it does scientific discoveries with ethical reasoning, affirms that correct behavior is based on the eternal nature of things.10 Benjamin Franklin, while an apprentice printer in London, set the type for Wollaston's third edition (1725) and wrote and published in the same year what he claimed is a reply to it, a Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain. Franklin did not even consider the argument from design, however, but refuted Wollaston's doctrine that the foundation of religion lies in the distinction between moral good and evil. He asserted the doctrine of absolute necessity and categorically denied that evil exists.11 This work was not known in America until long after Franklin's death. Of the modern books on deism in the New World, only that of Herbert Morais undertakes to treat the British American colonial period in depth. Morais amply documents the existence of natural religion in the writings of various divines and shows that orthodox Christians had no objection to appeals to natural religion as long as they were used in concert with the 8 Mather, The Christian Philosopher, ed.

The lecture series was dedicated to "proving, explaining and proper use and improve- ment, of the principles of Natural Religion."13 Gay's text, which has been called a "tour deforce" and a "locus classicus of liberalism,"14 is by no means a document of deism; rather it insists on the independence and supremacy of the Christian message. Gay's approach was controversial but nevertheless respectable. It offered no danger to author or publisher. His main argument is based on the need of a personal relationship between the individual and the creator. The words of Christ, Gay affirms, are "written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the liv- ing God, not in Tables of Stone, but in fleshly Tables of the Heart." 15 Like Wollaston, Gay maintains that the difference between right and wrong, good and evil, is "founded in the Natures and Relations of Things," but he does not declare these differences separate from the will of God. The obliga- tion to do what is right may be "antecedent to any Law or Institution" enjoining it upon us, but it originates from the will of the Author of the nature and relations of things. In a nutshell, "The Law of Nature is given by the God of Nature, who is Lord of all."16 The innate impulses toward right conduct produce an internal feeling of satisfaction as well as a reflected glow from the approbation of others. Adopting a Newtonian metaphor, he sug- gests that "there may be something in the intelligent moral World analogous to Attraction in the material System-something that inclines and draws Men toward God."17 Unlike most ministers in his milieu, Gay does not insist that only exper- imental Christians will achieve salvation. It is impossible to know, he says, how far fulfilling the law of nature will go toward obtaining divine approval or whether a lack in obedience may be compensated for by repentance and humility. The evidence from nature reveals the essential goodness of God but gives no assurance of pardon, much less of eternal life. Gay, nevertheless, deliberately rejects the extreme Calvinist view that moral virtues without God as their foundation are counted as mere ciphers. He also claims that natural religion should not be cried down under the pretence of thereby honoring revelation. Nothing is more preposterous than "to raise the Credit of the one, upon the Discredit of the other." 18 If inconsistencies appear between the two, they must be due to our lack of comprehension. "No Doctrine, or Scheme of Religion, should be advanced, or received as scrip- tural and divine, which is plainly and absolutely inconsistent with the 12 Morais, Deism in Eighteenth-Century America, 6i-62. 13 Josiah Quincy, The History of Harvard University, vol. 2 (Cambridge, Mass., i840), I39. 14 Robert J.

It is an absurdity to say that the ideas of goodness and right are different in God and man. So far, Gay is positive in his attitude toward natural religion, but he issues a warning in his conclusion. As natural reason should not be dis- carded, neither should it be magnified and extolled to the detriment of revela- tion. Without spiritual evidence, the amount of goodness left to man in his lapsed condition might diminish and perhaps disappear altogether. Christian revelation, moreover, states the principles and duties of religion and moral conduct better than the writings of the ancients or any other preceding texts. It has been "a Light to lighten the modern deistical Gentiles."20 Further separat- ing himself from the deists, Gay declares that the notions they have of moral- ity are more just than those possessed by the ancients and have come in large measure from revelation. Humorously, he compares the deists' view of revela- tion to that of "the simple Rustick, who thought the World had little Benefit by the Light of the Sun, 'Because it shin'd in the Day-time."' Gay concludes on a temperate note, both reason and revelation are "good Gifts,-Rays from the Father of Lights, to enlighten every Man that cometh into the World. "21 Radical deists in England such as Charles Blount, Matthew Tindal, and Anthony Collins attacked revelation directly without proposing natural reli- gion as a superior system of belief. In America, however, deism emerged as a transition from natural religion, using both scientific arguments derived from Newtonians and moral arguments derived from Shaftesburians. The earliest printed work of overt deism, a pamphlet of sixteen pages, bears the title Sermon on Natural Religion by a Natural Man. Nothing else appears on the title page except "America: Boston, Printed by I. Thomas for the Author." No date is given for this publication, but it is assigned to 1771 in Evans's American Bibliography from an original in the American Antiquarian Society. This was the first year that Isaiah Thomas, later one of the most eminent printers in the colonies, set up business as an independent entrepre- neur. His need for custom may have been one of the reasons he took the risk of launching a heterodox work like the pretended sermon. Since the work was not advertised in Thomas's newspaper, The Massachusetts Spy, its circula- tion was undoubtedly limited. The Sermon entirely denies supernatural inspiration, defines natural religion as equivalent to deism, completely rejects the doctrines of original sin and individual salvation, and considers polytheism a rational belief. The style of the work is crude and unpolished and gives no evidence that the author had either a literary or a theological background apart from his use of a seventeenth-century etymological dictionary, which I discuss 19 Ibid., 2I-22. 20 Ibid., 30. 21 Ibid., 31-32-</page><page sequence="6">840 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY below. Labored though it is, the language is at least as perspicuous as that of Allen's Reason the Only Oracle of Man, which is painfully halting and diffuse. The significance of the tract comes from the manner in which it addresses conventional religious belief without expressing adherence to received opin- ions. Its weakness, apart from style, consists in treating individual concepts without any effort to explain how they affect other notions to which they are intrinsically related. The pamphlet opens with an address to the god of nature, who is assigned Hebrew titles: O Jehova, Elohim Adonai! Thou incomprehensible, deign us to adore Thy perfections; let us admire Thy wisdom, power and good- ness: We praise Thee, almighty GOD, and give thee Thanks, for forming us in the manner Thou hast done: Glorified be Thy name: Every creature existing shews Thy glory, Thy might, and Thy bounty. Amen.22 The text of the sermon, i Corinthians 2:14, is quoted, not as the inspired word of God, but as an affirmation to be criticized: "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned." In his commentary, the writer makes a complete break between natural and revealed evidence, accepting the former and discarding the latter. Not only does he reject Paul's denigration of the natural man, but he also suggests that all men belong to the natural category and that those who profess to have other antecedents are suffering from delusion. The author, or "Naturalist" as he calls himself, argues that if Paul meant by "the spirit of God the perpetual motion and the universal direction of all things, by which the infinite and all powerful Being governs and regulates the world, then the natural man must certainly receive the things of this spirit"-but if he meant a "divine essence and substance" different from this, the natural man does not accept these things because they are "incomprehensible, supernatural and mysterious doctrines, acquired by inspiration, faith, and extraordinary divine instruction, which a natural man is entirely incapable of." Men can comprehend only that which is assimilated by reason, "that power in the human mind, whereby it compares its several sensations, ideas &amp;c either immediately one with the other, or mediately by some common measure."23 The natural power of reason, the Naturalist indicates, is "most beauti- fully" exemplified by John Locke. As an illustration of the use of reason, the Naturalist describes comparing the size of two fields by means of a chain and rod to obtain the measurements of each field and then using mathematical calculations to pronounce them equal or one larger than the other.24 This is his version of Locke's demonstration of abstraction or the manner in which 22 A Sermon on Natural Religion by a Natural Man (Boston, [I77I?]), 4. 23 Ibid., 5-6. 24 Ibid., 6.</page><page sequence="7">NATURAL RELIGION AND DEISM IN AMERICA 841 "the Mind makes the particular Ideas, received from particular Objects, to become general."25 The Naturalist next presents definitions of six terms, the first of which, Nature, offers a minor clue to his personal antecedents. The definition is taken verbatim from John Rider's dictionary, Bibliotheca Scholastica, a some- what esoteric source.26 That the work was not readily available to the com- mon man suggests that the Naturalist was probably not a simple laborer or tradesman, as his style suggests, but a person of some education. His text also includes a fair number of Latinisms, but these are less significant since they are all tags such as "summum bonum," widely used in English. There are also references to classical names such as Ovid and expressions such as "incidit in Scyllam qui vult vitare Charybdim." According to the verbatim quotation from Rider, nature consists in "the established order and course of material things; the series of second causes, or the law which God has impressed on matter: The action of providence, or that spiritual power diffused throughout the creation, which moves and acts in all bodies, and gives them certain properties." This sentence may have given the Naturalist the idea for his contention that perpetual motion and the universal direction of things are spiritual elements and that the partisan of natural religion fully admits their influence. The quotation further affirms that the ancients held this spiritual power to be a separate cause or a joint cause with God, but in actuality there is no other God but the first cause. Finally the quotation indicates a secondary meaning of nature: "sentiments or ideas consistent with the truth or reality of things; natural affection and reverence, or the principles implanted in us by the deity. "27 For the remainder of his six definitions, the Naturalist abandons Rider and presents his own conceptions. (2) Natural man is "a person who directs all his actions by the dictates of reason, and who contemplates the works of nature with an awful and reverent admiration." (3) Religion in general con- sists in "the worship of one or more deities, according to the ideas and tenets which have been imprinted in the minds of the worshippers." (4) "Natural religion is a worship and contemplation of an only infinite and eternal Being, and of his attributes, as far as human nature is capable of the investi- gation of them." The author remarks that logic inevitably leads to the con- clusion that a natural man must be of this religion "and consequently a Deist," which he straightaway defines. "A Deist (I comprehend in this list Arians and Unitarians) is a person who acknowledges, adores, and reveres an all-powerful wisdom and director of all the immensity, who admires the stu- pendous effects of his consummate productions, and who with astonishment takes a survey of the marvellous symmetry and surprizing order, wherewith all these immense bodies are directed in a most perfect regularity."

He charges that this definition is faulty since "no Deist or Naturalist denies an inspira- tion of the spirit of God, or that summum and perpetuum mobile," but every deist is convinced that everything in the universe is directed in the "most beautiful manner."28 At this point the author equivocates because the clergy were correct in charging that most of the deists reject textual revelation, ecclesiastical tradition, and mystical or supernatural inspirations. The author seems to admit this circumstance because he adds that the clergy may main- tain that they are not accusing deists of denying all revelation, but only pri- vate and supernatural inspirations delivered to especially chosen and elected men. The deist must reply, according to the author, in the words of his text from i Corinthians, that "the natural man receiveth not" such things of the spirit. He then asks whether it is possible to understand the Mosaic account of creation. "What do you say of God's planting the tree of life in the garden? What of the cunningness of the serpent? What of God forbidding Adam and Eve to eat of the tree, lest they die, and of the first parents having their free will?"29 Thomas Paine in his Age of Reason (I794) was far more explicit in ridi- culing these and related doctrines: "the whimsical account of the creation, the strange story of Eve, the snake and the apple; the ambiguous idea of a man- god; the corporeal idea of the death of a god; the mythological idea of a family of gods, and the Christian system of arithmetic that three is one and one is three."30 "Whimsical," "strange," and "ambiguous" drive home Paine's dis- paraging attitude, less apparent in the listing by the Naturalist. The latter does not explain why he finds the Mosaic doctrines beyond belief. Perhaps he was unwilling to scoff or to challenge more forcefully lest he shock potential con- verts to his natural religion. He assumes, however, that his readers will agree with him that the listed episodes and doctrines are contrary to reason. He next argues that there are two ways for the deist to escape from the "labyrinth" or "intricate abyss" constructed by the orthodox. He may "sub- mit to an absolute implicit faith" contrary to his reason and thereupon become a hypocrite or fall into a greater danger by asserting that Moses wrote like Ovid in a "mystical, figurative, and hyperbolical style," mixing the real with the fabulous and by this assertion open himself to "ecclesiasti- cal ban, excommunication and inquisition. "31 In plain words, the author is saying that the deist must either become a hypocrite or subject himself to persecution.32 The Naturalist, nevertheless, implies that the only valid and 28 Ibid., 8-9. 29 Ibid., io. 30 Paine, The Age of Reason, in Philip S.

See note 6 above. Franklin also recognized the liabilities deists were likely to incur from adverse public opinion. See Leonard W. Labaree et al., eds., The Papers of Benjamin Franklin, vol. 7 (New Haven, i963), 295.</page><page sequence="9">NATURAL RELIGION AND DEISM IN AMERICA 843 rational position for a deist is to deny unequivocally any type of revelation other than that from nature. In spite of this implication, he was not bold enough to publish his pamphlet under his own name. The Naturalist's fifth definition is that of a polytheist, who, he affirms, is one who worships a great many deities. He assumes that polytheists are merely ignorant of the means of paying homage to the one all-powerful God and are therefore "reasonably addicted to their religion."33 By polytheist, he obviously has in mind the Greek and Roman ancients, even though some moderns, including Newton and Franklin, had flirted with the notion of a plurality of gods. Polytheism could also literally include the Christian devil, but there is no reason to believe that the Naturalist referred to malevolent beings. The sixth and last definition is of an atheist as one who believes in no God at all. The Naturalist cannot imagine that a reasonable person could hold the theory of atheism, for reason reveals the absurdity of believing that the beautiful order one perceives could ever have come about by chance. He is willing to accept that there may be some atheists in practice-presumably those who do not engage in any form of worship-but he does not accept that their reason would allow them to harbor a theory as stupid and nonsen- sical as this. Those who actually do hold it are "detested, abhorred and despised by every body, as a pest and plague to society."34 The author contrasts the natural man with the orthodox Christian: the former can never be persuaded that any person can be damned to all eternity for his religious beliefs-no matter what these may be, even atheistic. In supporting this position, he gradually elucidates a concept of optimism now associated with Leibniz, Pope, and Voltaire's Pangloss, that this is the best of all possible worlds. According to his account, everything in the universe, even atheism, exists through the direction of the Almighty, and no religious belief or sentiment can lessen or detract from his "all-goodness or omnipo- tence." To the contrary, "these diversities contribute to the perfection, beau- tifulness and accomplishment of a variegated infinite universe." The Naturalist knows "that all what is, is good and perfect in his kind, and con- tributes to the beauteous structure of the universe."35 That Mather in 1721 should have revealed an optimism as naive as this is understandable, but it is somewhat strange to find it expressed fifty years later in the wake of Voltaire's Candide and other exposes of the suffering entailed by the Lisbon earthquake. The Naturalist next introduces a rhapsody in praise of the creation, a rhetorical device originating with Shaftesbury and commonplace throughout the century. The infinite Being is like a consummate Florist, who embellishes his flower-garden with all sorts of flowers of different kinds, and 33 Sermon on Natural Religion, ii. 34 Ibid., I2. 35 Ibid., I3.</page><page sequence="10">844 WILLIAM AND MARY QUARTERLY mixes them in such an order, and with such diversities, vicissitudes and varieties of colours and smells, that by the contrast of them, he causes such a surprising enchantment, that it turns out the most charming and most perfect object and ornament to the senses: And so has God Almighty formed the world with such variety of actions, motions, sensations, opinions, &amp;c. that the contrast of them gives us the highest idea of the Supreme Director of all those diversified motions and actions, &amp;c36 The sermon uses the logic of noncontradiction to prove the perfection of the universe. The reason of the natural man tells him that "it is impossible that a thing can be and not be in the same time"; therefore, as God cannot be both perfect and imperfect, "nothing whatsoever can be attributed to him, which is imperfect, as hatred, envy, wrath, &amp;c. so that all such expressions must in his opinion [the natural man's] be taken in an hierogryphical, mystical, and figura- tive sense." The natural man is fully persuaded "that he has nothing to fear from, nor to do with, an irascible, cruel, wrathful or vindictive Deity, but with an all-good, all-perfect and all-powerful God, who directs and modifies every- thing with the most surprising order in such a manner, that all what is, and exists, is in its kind perfect, and for the best of the world, and what it contains."37 The author, in extolling the perfection of the universe, takes no account of natural events such as earthquakes, disease, storms, and the like. Returning to the topic of damnation, he argues that it is difficult for the moralist to accept the view that "this little earth" alone holds all the "ratio- nal animals called men" and that of these descendants of Adam, ninety-nine out of one hundred go to hell and eternal damnation. "No! he rather sup- poses, and with great reason, that other celestial bodies comprehend as well rational animals as this earth; and as for Adam's descendants, he thinks that never a one is to go to Hell."38 After rejecting the population of Hell, the author fails to consider the possibility of any other kind of immortality. Instead he concludes with a long quotation from James Ferguson, whom he identifies as "a natural man." In this passage from Astronomy Explained upon Sir Isaac Newton's principles (1756), Ferguson rejects the anthropomorphic view of the universe, holding as ridiculous the assumption that the planets or moons were created for any advantage to human beings when the deity well knew that they could not even be seen from earth except "by a few Astronomers peeping through telescopes." Moreover, furnishing these plan- ets with a regular order of seasons and returns of days and nights is of no service to the inhabitants of earth; to maintain that the deity had such a pur- pose would be to accuse him of doing a great deal in vain. It would be just as absurd to imagine that he created an entire planetary system within the center of our earth. "These considerations," Ferguson maintains, "amount to little less than a positive proof that all the planets are inhabited, for if they are not, why all this care in furnishing them with so many moons, to supply 36 Ibid. 37 Ibid., I3-I4. 38 Ibid., I4-I5</page><page sequence="11">NATURAL RELIGION AND DEISM IN AMERICA 845 those with light which are at the greater distance from the sun?" Since we know about the rotation of the earth around the sun, may we not conclude that the "end and design of all the other planets is the same?"39 There is nothing in this concept of the inhabitation of other worlds that is inherently damaging to orthodox Christianity. Cotton Mather assumed the probability of intelligent beings existing elsewhere in the universe,40 although Paine was later to raise the question whether Christ was therefore required to travel from one planet to another dying for the sins of the inhabitants.41 Ferguson's direct contradiction of the Scriptures came in his denial that the cosmos was created for the advantage of the human race-not only a rejec- tion of the Mosaic account but also a repudiation of the essential Christian message. The Naturalist's sermon concludes with an adoration of the deity. Let us praise the Lord! praised be the Governor of the universe, his infinite power, the immensity of his works, and his incomparable bounty be praised! Glorified be the name of God! His incomparable goodness, his wisdom and all his perfections be adored, admired and exalted. AMEN.42 There is more rhetoric than solid argument in the Sermon. The Naturalist, like other deists, disparages revelation while praising the wonders of the natural world. His originality consists in using the genre of the ser- mon, highlighting a scriptural text, and turning to his own advantage a famil- iar topic in evangelical theology, the Pauline notion of the natural man. He converts Paul's disparaging view of the natural man into a glowing portrait of a person of superior knowledge and imagination contemplating the symmetry and order of the natural universe. In addition to this ingenious stroke, the Naturalist ridicules major orthodox doctrine including the Mosaic account of creation, the concept of the Trinity, and the notion of damnation. Since the Naturalist clearly states major objections to Christian doc- trine, it seems paradoxical that he should entitle his tract a sermon, intro- duce it with a New Testament text, and include a prayer to God under an Old Testament name. These may have been devices to attract orthodox read- ers with the hope of converting them later in the text to his way of thinking. He may, on the other hand, have deliberately played the nature card as a challenge to orthodoxy. There seems to be deliberate ambiguity in the three- fold use of natural man as the essential man, the reverse of Paul's spiritual man, and as an exponent of natural religion. In 1771, the year the sermon was published, the governor of New York offered a reward of twenty pounds for the capture of Ethan Allen, commander of the Green Mountain Boys.

As a consequence of this politi- cal involvement, Young published an unequivocally deistical creed over his own name. Believing that his moral character had been impugned by his adversaries, he stated his religious belief as a defense of his integrity.43 In November 1772, Young met with other patriots of Boston to discuss measures to be taken against Governor Thomas Hutchinson and his enforce- ment of unpalatable royal decrees. Objecting to the radical nature of the proposals put forth by the patriots, Aaron Davis, Jr., a merchant and captain in the local artillery, declared at a subsequent meeting in Roxbury that he did not choose to be involved in any measures in which he must follow the leadership of such men as Young.44 When informed of Davis's remarks, Young addressed an open letter to the Massachusetts Spy, indicating that he believed that his reputation in regard to virtue and religion was solid and well known, but that he would nevertheless publicly declare his beliefs. My creed is this. I believe in one eternal God, whose being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice and beneficence are altogether inconceivable to such atoms of animated matter as are yourself and I. 2dly. I believe that this God possessing infinite space with all its amazing furniture of habitable mansions, created forth beings as we are, that they might enjoy the bounties of his grace which must otherwise have run to waste or at least have existed to no purpose. 3dly. I believe that the happiness of his creatures being the concern of the supreme God himself, might in consequence be the concern of every intelligent [being?] under his government. 4thly. I believe, that in the order of nature and providence, the man who most assiduously endeavours to promote the will of God in the good of his fellow creatures, receives the most simple reward of his virtue, that peace of mind and silent applause of a good conscience, which administers more solid satisfaction than all the other enjoyments of life put together. 5thly. On the other hand I believe, that the man who endeav- ours to build up either his fortune or fame on the ruin of the estate or character of his neighbour, acts contrary to the rule of right, and in consequence must fall short of that approbation from God and his own conscience, which the performance of his known duty would have ensured him of. 6thly. I, most explicitly believe that all men shall be rewarded for the deeds done in the body, whether they be good or evil, 43 As far as I know, Young's statement has never been reprinted. The political controversy is introduced by Henry H. Edes in "Memoir of Dr. Thomas Young, I73I-I777," Colonial Society of Massachusetts, Transactions i906-I907, 2 (Boston, I9IO), 2-54. Edes reprints 3 of the letters in the controversy but makes no mention of the longest, which is devoted primarily to Young's religious beliefs and the manner in which he acquired them. 44 At the original meeting, a committee of correspondence was chosen, including James Otis, the chairman, Young, Samuel Adams, and i8 others; Boston Weekly Newsletter, Nov.

To support his creed, he added a brief spiritual auto- biography. At age eight he had anguished over his salvation. The doctrines of predestination and eternal damnation, which were dominant in his milieu, had confronted him with a profound dilemma: good deeds, fasting, and prayer were regarded as abominations while he was in the state of a nat- ural man, yet he was pressed to carry out these very abominations as essen- tial to his religious duty for fear of God's vengeance. Unlike the bulk of mankind, he could not reconcile these two positions. Hence he became an Arminian and, subsequently, pursuing the same chain of thought, arrived at his present system, comprising two major principles. ist. To believe that God is, and the rewarder of all those that diligently seek him. 2d. To do justly, and to love mercy and to walk humbly with our God. The standard of justice among us being, As ye would that others should do unto you do ye also unto them in like manner. Young concluded by calling on those who believed these to be the prin- ciples of the Christian religion to be content with them and to give up argu- ing about "Paul, Cephas, Luther and Calvin; and put on charity." In his own practice, Young indicated that he had labored to attain knowledge and to put it into the service of mankind, "knowing that the great Lord of the universe spoke me into being for other ends than barely to stalk about and destroy the fruits of his bounty."46 Young's creed did not silence his antagonist, who accused him in a letter to another newspaper of trying to palm himself off as a Christian. Davis also maintained that there was nothing in the creed to distinguish Young "from the most thorough paced infidels, and virulent opposers of our holy Religion."47 It is significant that Samuel Adams, given his personal conserva- tive Christianity, immediately defended Young in a spirited letter in another journal. He accused Davis of hypocrisy in attacking Young on grounds of religion when it was Young's political influence that he wished to undermine. Making no adverse reflections on Young's metaphysical beliefs, Adams affirmed that Davis's "illiberal slander" would "shock decency and common sense" more than any article in Young's creed.48 Young's own reply to Davis also steered clear of religious controversy other than accusing Davis of adopt- ing his "cloke of Christianity" for political ends. He pointedly asked Davis whether, if he were on an armed vessel being attacked by pirates, he would 45 Massachusetts Spy, Nov.

One reason may be that even conservative Christians were familiar with the major arguments of nat- ural religion as they had been previously presented by orthodox British divines or colonial ones such as Mather and the more liberal Gay. There are, nevertheless, significant differences between Young's articles of belief and the sermon of the Naturalist. The latter by casting his remarks as a sermon and quoting a scriptural text at least makes a polite bow to Christian doc- trine before making his frontal attack on it. Also he bases his system in large measure on the evidence of science concerning the perfection of the material universe. Young, on the other hand, does not even allude to physicotheology but, in the vein of Shaftesbury, uses reasoning exclusively based on the moral nature of man and the deity. Neither Young nor the author of the Sermon indicates belief in either immortality or the doctrine of rewards and punishments in a future state. This was an extremely radical position, for both Franklin and Paine upheld both doctrines. Young and the Naturalist seem to oppose immortality, moreover, by specifically rejecting hell while not suggesting the possibility of heaven. The four exponents of natural religion that I have discussed, Cotton Mather, Ebenezer Gay, the Naturalist, and Thomas Young are linked by the assumption that natural religion comprises a real system of truths available to all by the use of unaided reason. Mather and Gay accepted a system of divine truths or revelation that the other two reject. By rejecting revelation, the Naturalist and Young turned natural religion in America into outright deism. The process was not necessarily one of progression but of transition. Mather, Gay, and the Naturalist cited one or more English forerunners. Most important, each charac- terized at least part of his system as the religion of nature. Mather made use of natural religion as a buttress to orthodox Christianity; Gay accepted the validity of natural religion while worrying that it could be turned against Christianity; and the Naturalist actually did what Gay feared by declaring natural religion to be the equivalent of deism. Young did not apply the term natural religion to his own creed but adopted its methodology by bringing to bear rational arguments to support the existence of a God and a moral universe, or "the rule of right," as he expressed it. His deliberate omission of reference to the doctrines of Christianity makes him a deist and as such, according to the definition of the Naturalist, a partisan of natural religion. As is well known, Young later co- authored Allen's Reason the Only Oracle of Man, which contains considerable physicotheology. Although Gay and the Naturalist are linked by the term nat- ural religion in their respective titles, the Naturalist is closer in spirit and pur- pose to Young, who did not even use the term. Whether I am justified in claiming that the Sermon on Natural Religion represents an intellectual bridge between Gay and Allen, there is no question that it was "the first formal publica- tion in the United States openly directed against the Christian religion." 49 Boston Evening Post, Nov. 30, 1772.</page></plain_text>
