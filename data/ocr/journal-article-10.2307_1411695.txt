<plain_text><page sequence="1">LETTERS TO THE EDITOR. DR. FOREL, OF ZURICH. TO T:RE EDITOR: The following short account of the work of Dr. Forel is gladly sent in response to your request: Outside of (3witzerland, Dr. Forel's reputation is based largely on the fact that he is one of the greatest authorities on hypnotism but a more intimate acquaintance with his work here brings other phases of it inX equal prominence. In appearance Dr. Forel is large and comlnanding, and shows in every mourement the spirit of actierity that is one of his most marked characteristics. The medical department of the University of Zurich has attained a good reputation among German universities, and when vacancies occur, effort is made to secure the be#t men from abroad to fill them. A few years since Dr. Forel was called from Munich to occupy the position of professor of psychiatry in Zurich. In con- nection with this offlce, he gives two courses of lectures during the year, one on general psychlatry, and one on hypnotism, and also holds 8emi-weekly clinics. His lectures are very popular and well attended, and in the course on psychiatly he touches on many general subjectst which show how broad and far reaching his interests are. The opening lecture states his Weltanschauuqwg. He is a pantheistic monist believing in the existence of Gkod as a uxiiversal force, of which iife and matter are maliife8tation8. 3Ie denounces with great ngor all anthropomorphic ideas of a personal Gkod, and explains what is commonly called sin as being the re#ult of a weak omplasma. He gives one lecture of the cour#e on Weismann's theory of heredity which he accepts. Among the most interesting of his lectures tiis year were one on brain locali- sabion, and one on disturbances of speech. The clinics are attended by meaical students, and, by special permission, by students of psychology. To the latter, these clinics furnish a fine opportunity for the study of pathological psychology as Dr Forel never fails to malre the psychological signiflcance promi- nent in the diagnosis of the cases examined. Among the rare ca#" presented this year was that of a patient suSering from paragraphis th general paralysis of the muscles of the eye, on the same side as the brain trouble, causing the paragraphia. Only one other case of the kind has ever been known. Also a case of nezative hallucina- tions of memory, the possibility of which was discovered a fesv years since by Bernheim, and several interesting cases of auditory and motor hallucinations. In addition to hi8 offlcial position as professor of psyÂ¢hiaty, Dr. Forel is director of a large insane a#ylllm in Burgholzll, a picturesque village about two miles from Zurich.

He is most cordial to all who vislt the asylum for #cientific purposes, and very free in oSier- ing opportunitie# for study in his haboratory. Dr. E5orel him#elf is making some special investigations in brain localization, and i# quoted as authority in scientific worlrs on brain anatoms. A# director of the asylum Dr. Forel is noticeable for the nhilanthropy which enters into all his relations with the insane. Xe studie# to promote the comfort of earen the most abandoned cases, and often patiently listens himself to the details of slight disagreements among them. His regimen for the patients is lfberty and work, in so far as possible. I)r. Forel's investigations in hypnotism are well known. Hi# worlr on hypnotismis much 8uperior to that of Moll, and is probably the best hand-book on the subject yet produced. He is also one of the editors of the Z"tschrtft fihr Hypnotianus, published at Berlin. In his theories of hypnotism he belongs to Bernheim's #chool, although he oppose# all dogmatism on the subject. He in#i#ts on accurate scienfific methods in hypnotic research, and denounce# the large class of psychologists who condemn hypnotism on a prun grounds, without hanng any experimental knowledge of it. His method of inducing hypnosis is short and quick. He causes the eubject to look him fisedly in the eyes. Then, holding his thumb and finger before the two eyes of the subject and near, he bids him loolr at them, and drawing them down and away, the eyes diverge, and at the same time close, and the subject is asleep. On subse- quent occasions a mere " schlafen Sie " is usually sufflcient. 1dhe percentage of hypnotizable subjects Forel puts very high.-I think from 90 per cent. to 100 per cent. among normal persons. Despite the fact that an insane asylum is the most unfavorable place for the practice of hypnotism, Dr. Forel furnishes remarkable examples of its psycho-therapeutic value, and striking illustration# of the power of post-hypnotic suggestion. One cannot but think, however, that his success in the latter is due largely to the influence of his own strong personality. One feature of his use of hypnotism is his economy of labor in the insane asylum by its means, a course which has been opposed by his confreres, but the practical advan- tages of which they have been obliged to admit. One occurrence of the past year will illustrate this. An insane woman was expected to give birth to a child, and as on several previous occasions she had caused the death of her infants, the ctosest watch was required. Instead of providing night watchers, Dr. Forel hypnotized a wait- ing maid, and put her to sleep ill an adjoining room, telling her to sleep qliietly, but to awake and call the doctor should the woman be taken ill in the night. The waiting maid slept, undisturbed by the ordinary #creaming of the insane woman but awoke the moment that medical aid was required, and the iife of the infant was thus saved. In the city of Zurich Dr. Forel is well known as the president of the Temperance Society, a proxninent member of the Society for Social Purity, and the leader in a movement to procure funds for the establishment of a People's Palace. He advocates total ab#ti- nence from alcoholic drinks with great ngor and does not allow any use of alcohol in the insane asylum. l:[e never faSls in his clinic# to emphasize the fact that a large proportion of the ca#es of insanity re#ult from the prevalent use of Schnapps in Ssvitzerland, and one of his most prominent lectures is a arigorou# #etting forth of the effect of alcohol on the brain ti##ue.</page><page sequence="3">488 LETTERE TO THX EDITOR. This short outline of Dr. Forel's work would not be complete without reference to his illvestigations in natural science. Among other studies in this direction, he has worked for years in collecting material in regard to the habits of ants. His library is full of books on the subject, and his published articles about ants and their habits are authoritative. MARY MILLS PATRIC1r. Z{irich, April 20, 1894. A CoRREcTIoN.
