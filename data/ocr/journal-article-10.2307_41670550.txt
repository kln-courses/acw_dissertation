Ag- riculture is thought to have begun in this area in the seventh millen- nium B.c. Gradually a highly de- veloped agricultural and pastoral culture came into being, reaching its height during the third, and espe- cially the second millennia B.C. The most exciting find at Altyn- Tepe is a monumental architectural complex of adobe brick, interpreted as a temple, dating to the middle of the second millennium. The in- vestigation of this frequently re- built structure has not yet been completed, but it is now known that in one period the eastern façade was decorated with three-step pilasters. Later, these projections were par- tially filled in and a massive tower abutment, 6 by 4.8 meters in di- mensions, was built at one corner. Excavations in the residential area of Altyn-Tepe revealed a seventeen room dwelling block; large houses were apparently divided into small apartments. It is possible that indi- vidual families occupied separate blocks of rooms, uniting with re- lated families in other blocks to form a home-commune. In a yard to the north of the apartment com- plex was discovered the foundation of an oval tandyr for baking bread. One apartment consisted of two rooms with niches in the walls and a narrow room with a water vessel cemented into the floor. A walled area in the yard contained a kitchen hearth with a central pole, and a grain grater. Wheel-made ceramics with painted patterns on a red background were recovered, as well as double-decker pottery kilns, in which temperatures reached 1400 degrees centigrade. The advanced handicraft techniques of the people of Southern Turk- menistan enabled them to produce materials of high quality for use in trade with other Near Eastern cul- tures. A developed social system is sug- gested by the variation in the rich- ness of grave goods. A wealthy up- per stratum can be singled out from the rest of society, since some bur- ials contained such offerings as bronze and silver seals, while others held only one or two pottery vessels. A large assortment of anthropo- morphic terracotta figurines indicate that a complex religious conception prevailed. Most of the figurines are female, and many are decorated with pictures of grain ears and trees, which point to agrarian rites. The most interesting of thç figures have unusual symbols incised on their shoulders, backs and thighs. So far twenty symbols have been recognized, among them a triangle with cilia, crosses, eight-pointed stars and signs shaped like the letter K. Russian archaeologists believe that these signs may be part of an integrated system, which has not yet been identified, although many of the signs appear to have counter- parts in the Sumerian and Proto- Elamite written traditions, which were developing at about the same time. It is hoped that further exca- vations at Altyn-Tepe and similar sites will produce inscribed tablets.</page></plain_text>
