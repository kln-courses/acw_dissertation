<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity Amy J. Elias The only sense in which we are Communists is that we care for  the commons: the commons of nature, the commons of what is  privatized by intellectual property, the commons of biogenetics.  For this, and only for this, we should fight. Communism failed  absolutely, but the problems of the commons are here. —S lavoj Žižek We must be able to explain success as well as failure of efforts  to achieve collective action. . . . Mobs, gangs, and cartels are  forms of collective action as well as neighborhood associations,  charities, and voting. —E linor Ostrom Everyone knows what a “commons” is: it’s a public, community location  open to all, controlled singly by no one, and somehow linked to public beliefs  and communication. Synonyms for the word “common”— such as “ordi- nary,” “everyday,” “widely known,” “usual,” “jointly shared,” “standard,”  “low born”—h ave a range of connotations, but all imply a leveling, a state  of equality where no one has a special or notable designation, status, or rank.  “Common law” is law developed through customs and usages rather than  through statutes; at a university, “the Commons” is often a communal din- ing hall or a public green. We like people with whom we have something  “in common,” people with whom we share an abstract commons such as a  personality or lifestyle. Experts define a commons as a shared resource in which all stakeholders  have an equal interest: “Nothing belongs to anyone, yet everything belongs  to everyone.”1 Yet “the commons” is in the category of tricksy things that  disappear when you try to touch them, like fog, floating soap bubbles, or  financial markets. Calling something a commons gives it a pseudo-u topian  halo, an implication of equality and sharing aligned with fraternité in the  best sense, but we tend to forget that a modern commons is often an enclosed   37 </page> <page sequence="2"> 38 Amy J. Elias space dependent on an exclusionary border that designates an inside and an  outside, brother and Other. We also tend to forget how commons are created  in modern societies: a commons is produced either from within itself, a mise  en abyme situation in which one requires a commons to define a commons  (in such cases of exemplary democracy, few commons actually see the light  of day), or from a paradox, in which developing a commons depends on the  military power, beneficence, or sheer will of autocrats, bureaucrats, entre- preneurs, or wealthy patrons in the private or power sectors. (How many  public parks in the United States originated from private gifts from wealthy  patrons or from acts of imminent domain by government?) Many places  that most people believe to be commons, such as public parks, or university  quads, or waterways, are often revealed to be private or legislated spaces  when someone becomes angry or litigious about how others are using the  space. Certainly, that’s one of the things that the various Occupy movements  of 2011 illustrated; occupiers who camped out in Zuccotti Park, seemingly  a commons area, found themselves the target of hostility from passersby as  well as from the actual owner of the park, Brookfield Office Properties. The  point is that not only are archaic commons, such as an agrarian society’s  grazing area, necessarily defined differently in modern, urbanized contexts,  but also that in order to function efficiently and fairly, a commons might need  to be mediated by authority and law. Today, a reconsideration of the commons is, implicitly or explicitly, every- where redefining the concept on a planetary scale. At a moment of world  population explosion and depletion of natural resources, the rhetoric of the  planetary commons is central to environmental studies; within the context  of global finance capitalism, notions of the financial commons preoccupy  sociology and economics; as world nations experience increased travel and  labor mobility and weakening of nation- state boundaries as a result of  globalization, the commons comes to the fore in cultural theories of cosmo- politanism and in world democracy movements. But we need a better sense  of the sociological and anthropological work tackling the problem of the  commons— or, more accurately, common pool resources— if our conversa- tion about this often under- theorized topic is to avoid the dangerous political  poles of communitarian fantasy or political authoritarianism. In our new  twenty- first- century zeal to create a global commons, we should remember  that there is a material history to commons creation, development, and man- agement to which attention must be paid. A rethinking of the commons began with research about simple commons  (or common pool resources [CPRs]), moved to consideration of complex  CPRs, and expanded exponentially with the rise of the global environmen- tal movement and its early adoption of commons discourse.2 Deliberations  about the commons today almost always take as their starting point a 1968  paper in the journal Science by biologist Garrett Hardin, who presented a  theory of the commons that argued for its inevitable tragic outcome. He  </page> <page sequence="3"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity 39 claimed that, in any commons, people will be motivated to increase their own  profit by optimizing their use of the common resource; however, if everyone  does this, the resource itself will be rapidly depleted, since its longevity and  health are predicated not on everyone’s maximum individual profit based  on maximum individual yield, but on maximum profit based on maximum  resource yield, ideally distributed equitably among resource users. Hardin’s  famous example is that of the herdsmen’s common grazing area: Picture a pasture open to all. It is to be expected that each herdsman  will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons. Such  an arrangement may work reasonably satisfactorily for centuries  because tribal wars, poaching, and disease keep the numbers of both  man and beast well below the carrying capacity of the land. . . .  As a rational being, each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain. . . .  The rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for  him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd. And another;  and another. . . . But this is the conclusion reached by each and every  rational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each  man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd  without limit— in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination  toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a  society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a  commons brings ruin to all.3 Hardin maintained that relying on morality to regulate the commons will not  circumvent this tragedy, for morality is “system-s ensitive,” depending often  on context, and is thus impossible to determine unilaterally.4 For instance,  he maintains that in places of low population density and huge bison herds,  a hunter’s killing a bison just for the tongue meat would be less ethically  fraught than the same act would be if the dependent population were large  and only a thousand bison remained on the earth. He asseverates that to  ask individuals to restrain themselves for the general good by means of con- science will also lead only to tragic outcomes, for those who break the rules  and operate selfishly will be more successful over the long run and eventually  dominate the system. Hardin’s social Darwinism is much maligned in leftist circles, but often  overlooked is the fact that he also called for an “exorcism” of Adam Smith’s  “invisible hand” theory from economic affairs, rejecting the assumption  “that decisions reached individually will, in fact, be the best decisions for an  entire society.”5 Because people have no motivation to act ethically in rela- tion to the commons and have every incentive to shirk, free- ride, cheat, or  respond opportunistically regardless of the economic system that is in place,  Hardin concluded that the only way to avoid the tragedy of selfish overuse  was to regulate the commons either through privatization (that is, markets)  </page> <page sequence="4"> 40 Amy J. Elias or through governmental oversight. “The social arrangements that produce  responsibility,” he wrote, “are arrangements that create coercion, of some  sort. . . . The only kind of coercion I recommend is mutual coercion [such as  taxes], mutually agreed upon by the majority of the people affected.”6 My question is this: what impact has such thinking had on today’s discus- sion of the planetary commons, particularly in the context of digital culture  and media studies, where talk of the commons has always been part of the  indigenous language? Perhaps the rhetoric of “open source” and “digital com- mons” did not originate when the first computational machines were created,  but certainly it is characteristic of cyber research after the birth of the Internet  Protocol Suite in 1982, the introduction of hypertext, and the creation of the  World Wide Web (WWW). The Internet may have been born of the military-   industrial complex, but it was from the start considered by developers to be a  commons space, and commons thinking fundamentally drove innovation in  it. In the second decade of the twenty- first century, however, as telecommu- nications goes global, technologies such as smartphones become ubiquitous,  and platforms such as social networking systems encroach on the open graz- ing lands of cyberspace, privatization is wildly disputed among developers  and users. As more and more of our material and informational reality gets  transferred to the oversight of machines and stored in the cloud, who owns  these machines and these clouds (and how ownership impinges on the nature  of the WWW as a global informational commons) will become increasingly  central to, among other things, fundamental definitions of individual and  group autonomy, collective oversight of resources, property rights, profit dis- tribution and labor production, and privacy rights. This is not a new insight. In fact, the wars over online privatization have  been waged for so long that weariness, cynicism, and naive utopian accom- modation are now easily identified rhetorical norms in digital culture studies.  Movies have been made about this. Thus, rather than rehearse yet again the  stories of Napster and other start-ups that ran into a wall of privatization, in  this article I’d like to go back to basic definitions and address the complexi- ties of the commons— what it is, how it operates, and what controversies  surround its management. Specifically, I will consider three ways that the  figure of the commons is now being reimagined, after decades of contesta- tion, to answer Hardin’s original theory and also how these reconceptions  are impacting discussion regarding the planetary media environments of the  Internet and World Wide Web. The word “digital” is of course a plenum, designating everything from  social networking sites to Krzysztof Wodiczko’s public video projections; to  talk about “digital planetarity,” then, risks further complicating and perhaps  confusing the discussion with multiply overlapping digital domains, scales,  platforms, and aesthetics. I therefore set my sights primarily on theory and  have deliberately picked three radically different domains in which the com- mons is apprehended— public economy, discussions about digital culture  </page> <page sequence="5"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity 41 and open source, and affect theory—i n order to illustrate how a range of  approaches can be used to address the problem of the planetary digital com- mons. At the site of commons inquiry in digital media studies, distinctions  between “planetarity” and “globalization” become clear: it is precisely the  issue of the commons— as a social space that is organized neither on the  nation- state model nor on the neoliberal global model—t hat is most aligned  with the idea of the Internet as a new planetary collective. The last section  of this chapter evaluates the effectiveness of these three avenues of theory  for addressing central issues related to the planetary digital commons. Since  the second of the three example discourses— namely, the debate about open  source and property rights— should be familiar to most readers involved in  technology studies, I will focus primarily on the other two, though all address  two questions I see as key to any discussion of digital planetarity: What does it  mean to understand life online as living in the planetary commons? And what  direction might be posited for commons life in this virtual, planetary space? Elinor Ostrom, Public Economy, and The Commons A significant counter to Hardin’s “tragedy of the commons” scenario emerged  in public economics through the work of Elinor Ostrom, who in 2009 was  awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics “for her analysis of economic gov- ernance, especially the commons.”7 Ostrom made two unique contributions  to theories of the commons. First, she turned to game theory to try to map  and understand interactions between appropriators of, and outcomes within,  common pool resources (CPRs).8 Second, she tested projected CPR outcomes  against those of actual field settings and case studies, assessing the predictive  capacities of game theory and also the results of lab experiments in relation  to documented human use of CPRs across the globe. Ostrom is clear that simple and complex common pool resources require  different oversight to operate efficiently and fairly. Complex CPRs may call,  for instance, for the inclusion of experts to provide research background and  information to CPR appropriators/managers as well as to supervise the imple- mentation of sanctions stipulated by them. “Providers,” she says, are “those  who arrange for the provision of a CPR,” and a “producer” is any person  “who actually constructs, repairs, or takes actions that ensure the long- term  sustenance of the resource system itself.” In some cases, providers and pro- ducers are the same people, but in other cases they are not: Ostrom gives the  example of a national government providing the financing and design of an  irrigation system and then arranging with local farmers to produce and main- tain it, at which point the farmers themselves become the providers as well  as the producers. A group of many people or more than one firm can be the  producer of a CPR, but “the resource units . . . are not subject to joint use or  appropriation.” For example, a number of fishermen may control a common  </page> <page sequence="6"> 42 Amy J. Elias fishing ground as providers and/or producers, but “fish harvested by one boat  are not there for someone else.”9 Thus, “CPR appropriators who organize  themselves to govern and manage a CPR are faced with some problems that  are similar to those of appropriating private goods and other problems that  are similar to those of providing public goods.”10 Ostrom also clearly asserts that interdependence is the state in which  appropriators of a material resource (recognized as such) find themselves,  and the motivation for acting interdependently in good faith is the maximiza- tion of profit, however defined. She specifically rejects a view frequently seen  in much popular and academic discussion, where “interdependence” within a  commons is presented as a moral good and ethical goal or outcome.11 In other  words, the commons in much of Ostrom’s work is not the happy if somewhat  vaguely defined space of an ethical cosmopolitanism, nor is it a contestatory  sphere of planetary intercultural communication.12 Practically speaking, in  Ostrom’s view, acting interdependently means coordinating action strategies  to obtain higher joint benefits or reduce joint harm. A commons is the shared  bedrock of survival, where success or failure is defined in terms of a function- ing economy of goods. Ostrom’s research seems shaped by a pragmatic approach to human  nature. She implicitly rebuts conceptions of the commons based on the evo- lutionary basis of human altruism,13 but she also ignores or is not aware of  a poststructuralist radical interrogation of individual self- determination and  agency that might inhibit the pursuit of a commons. Much more down to  earth, she understands a commons as a benefit to material life but humans  as beings subjected to constant temptation to act opportunistically in rela- tion to resources. Her research avoids utopian promises that a commons  will revamp human subjectivity and concludes instead that CPRs and their  situational contexts themselves do not produce ethical outcomes. She posits  that people basically need to be ethical going in to the CPR situation or be  given incentives to act ethically once the CPR is operating. “The capacity  to design their own rules,” Ostrom argues, “will not enhance the outcomes  achieved by the nontrusting and narrowly selfish individuals of the world,  but will enhance the outcomes of those who are prepared to extend reciproc- ity to others and interact with others with similar inclinations.”14 Based on  lab experiments measuring cooperation in different simulated CPR circum- stances, Ostrom contends that there are at least three kinds of settings that  seem unlikely to be improved by self- organization: those where people “have  no expectation of mutual trust and no means of building it”; those in which  “mistrust is already rampant, and communication and continued interac- tions do not reduce the level of distrust”; and settings in which many people  “are willing to extend reciprocity to others but lack authority to create their  own self- governing institutions.”15 In order for a CPR to function optimally,  appropriators themselves must have the opportunity to lay down rules, mon- itoring systems, and penalties. </page> <page sequence="7"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity 43 In fact, the central problem facing any self- organized group seeking to  operate a CPR is “the commitment problem,” or adhering to the principles  of the CPR without an external enforcer. Unlike Hardin, Ostrom thinks that  though this problem will inevitably arise, a resulting “tragic” outcome is not  inevitable. In the face of great temptation to break rules for personal gain,  producers/appropriators “have to motivate themselves (or their agents) to  monitor activities and be willing to impose sanctions to keep conformance  high.”16 Research has shown, she also reports, that “users of a resource sys- tem will continue to harvest resource units, without trying to self- organize,  unless they perceive that the benefits they would receive from a change in  their rules will be greater than the costs involved.”17 Highly relevant to The Planetary Turn’s axial focus on relationality is a  CPR’s communicational dynamic. Notably, Ostrom’s team found that face-   to- face communication played a significant role in the successful functioning  of CPRs in laboratory situations. After running a series of game models with  test subjects, her group concluded that “the inability [of subjects] to communi- cate [with one another] limited the durability of their agreements.” However,  “in a decision environment where subjects were given repeated opportunities  to communicate [face- to- face and without having to pay for the opportu- nity], subjects offered and extracted promises of cooperation and chastised  one another when conformance was not complete, thereby increasing their  joint yield significantly above that obtained prior to communication.” In their  experiments, they also found that the highest yield of a CPR was gained, and  the defection rate from agreements was lowest, when subjects/appropriators  had “the right to choose a sanctioning mechanism [for rules-b reakers] and a  single opportunity to communicate” face- to- face.18 This flies in the face of Hardin’s tragedy scenario, but, as Ostrom notes,  also of assumptions by theorists of noncooperative games, such as John Nash,  who see “words alone . . . as frail constraints when individuals make private,  repetitive decisions between short- term, profit- maximizing strategies and  strategies negotiated by a verbal agreement.”19 These theorists maintain that  what keeps people honest are enforceable contracts (the Hobbesian- based  model of interaction), not whether they were able to communicate with one  another. Olstrom’s own research indicates otherwise: In many of these [CPR dilemmas], but not all, individuals overcome  the temptations present to overuse the CPR. They do this by commu- nicating their desires to reach acceptable sharing agreements. They  build trust in these agreements by extending reciprocity through the  use of personal heuristics like measured reactions. In difficult set- tings, they use measured reactions to bolster their agreements as well  as imposing sanctions on those who violate agreements. Individuals  who extend reciprocity to others and who learn to craft their own  effective rules can accomplish more than individuals who do not,  </page> <page sequence="8"> 44 Amy J. Elias especially when they can identify others following the same heuris- tics. Such individuals achieve more than predicted by noncooperative  game theory as currently understood.20 It seems that communication between producers of a CPR is not only central  to its most efficient operation but also may sometimes offset the “tragedy of  the commons.” This may be good news for planetarity, specifically for any discussion of the  “planetary commons,” for this is one area in which digital technologies can  contribute unprecedented benefactions. If face- to- face communication plays  a significant role in the construction and operation of successful common-   pool resources, the “digimodernist” global world of the twenty- first century  can facilitate such interactions cheaply, at a pace and on a scale that has never  been seen before in human history.21 Real- time, direct written language- based  online chat (such as instant messaging), social networking systems (such as  Facebook), and proprietary voice- over- IP services combined with software  applications (such as Skype) offer now-f amiliar and easily accessed means  to overcome distance on a global level, and more advanced technologies are  being created daily. Many of these communications platforms allow people  to meet “virtually face-t o- face” in real time. If their potential for expediting  and simplifying communications is not hampered by politicians or corpo- rations, these new communications systems offer previously unparalleled  opportunities for CPR providers and appropriators to create new commons  on a planetary scale. At the same time, of course, privatization and politics  are working to limit access to this type of ownership and control, which  is increasingly available only to those who can afford it, to those whose  governments allow it, to those whose communication and digital literacy is  sufficiently advanced to use it, to those who speak the lingua franca of the  digital system, and to those who are logged into systems that have security  sophisticated enough to control misuse and surveillance. These are not trivial  limitations. Equally important, while Ostrom does not completely reject Hardin’s  pessimistic hypothesis and, as noted above, she fundamentally agrees with  Hardin that people will be tempted to use the commons selfishly, her research  offers tested criteria that can lead to appropriators’ equitable use of CPRs  with optimum output. Whereas Hardin saw tragedy as inevitable and thereby  advocated governmental or privatized oversight as the only means to regulate  a commons and avoid its misuse, Ostrom and her team submit that the com- mons tragedy is one possible outcome among many and suggest lab- tested  strategies for CPR use that might avoid Hardin’s prognoses under certain cir- cumstances.22 The good news is that as research on CPRs has evolved, there  has been a convergence of studies concerning collective action and common  pool resources that presents these as “social- ecological systems” (SES). These  are complex CPR systems (such as the world’s oceans) that need to be studied  </page> <page sequence="9"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity 45 so that CPR investigators learn how to describe and empirically and reliably  predict their operation. As Amy R. Poteete, Marco A. Janssen, and Ostrom  note, scale is important when considering a full SES. Such systems are char- acterized by a nested hierarchical structure in which subsystems function as  semi- autonomous units that interact across scales or system levels and are  often challenged by changes in leadership and resources.23 This seems an  obvious point, but it poses particular difficulties when trying to organize and  predict the behaviors of the system as well as of the appropriators of complex  CPRs such as the stratosphere—o r the World Wide Web. Thus, contrary to  popular notions that often picture the commons as a vast, open, mutually  supportive collective, these studies indicate that CPRs operate in all kinds  of ways, can be nested within one another on all kinds of scales, and can be  overseen by all kinds of appropriators. As a result, a CPR must be consider- ably researched up front, before it is implemented, if it is to yield maximum  profit (as defined by its maximum carrying capacity) for all appropriators.  Otherwise, producers can expect a long period of trial and error, potentially  devastating to the CPR, before the CPR usage problems are resolved. It would seem that logistical and administrative planning— the mundane  bureaucratic stuff of organization building rather than the sexy utopian call  to collective action— is key to the viability and sustainability of a common  pool resource. Centering on the components of CPRs and the logistics of  their operation, Ostrom clearly thinks that common pool resources are good  things and that it is imperative for researchers and policymakers to address  the issue of the global commons.24 Yet her projects and those studies build- ing upon them tend neither to posit ideal CPR environments that might be  instituted by public policy advocates nor to formulate regulations and laws  setting restrictions on CPR creation. What Ostrom attempts to reveal are  the nuts and bolts of CPRs: what they need in order to thrive and which  questions are still left to be investigated in relation to their genesis and opera- tion in the real world.25 This work is perhaps most important to the large  and exponentially growing conversation about behaviors in cyberspace—  particularly behaviors in contexts directly or indirectly related to digital arts  such as MMORPWs (massively multiplayer online role- playing worlds) and  SNSs (social networking systems, such as Facebook). To illustrate, a very old example comes to mind, one referencing the old- est functioning Multi- User Domain Object- Oriented (MUD or MOO) and  familiar to anyone working in digital culture studies. In 1993, freelance jour- nalist Julian Dibble made digital culture history when he published a Village  Voice article titled “A Rape in Cyberspace: How an Evil Clown, a Haitian  Trickster Spirit, Two Wizards, and a Cast of Dozens Turned a Database into  a Society.”26 Dibble documented “the Bungle Affair” in LambdaMOO, an  early text- based, real- time Internet multiplayer game or MUD (Multi- User  Dungeon).27 This incident involved a gamer who appeared inworld as Mr.  Bungle, an evil clown. At around 10:00 pm PST on a Monday in March 1993,  </page> <page sequence="10"> 46 Amy J. Elias when the virtual world was populated with many users, the gamer logged in  and Mr. Bungle went to the “living room” and began running a “voodoo  doll” script which allowed him to control other characters’ actions. Target- ing specific characters, he caused them to engage in sex acts and perverse  self- mutilations that they could not stop, and “his distant laughter echoed  evilly in the living room with every successive outrage” until someone named  Zippy used a different script (a gun that enveloped targets in an impermeable  cage of protection) to stop his rampage. One might write off the incident as a very early example of online “troll- ing” (malicious behavior), now a staple of almost any online community (one  thinks of the horrible below- the- line comments on YouTube or the treat- ment of newbies in MMORPGs). To us today, the LambdaMOO incident is  hardly shocking, and people who don’t think much about the Internet often  write it off as a just another stupid online prank. For LambdaMOO after all  wasn’t “real-l ife”: it was “just a middlingly complex database, maintained  for experimental purposes inside a Xerox Corporation research computer in  Palo Alto and open to public access via the Internet.”28 In fact, the incident  probably would not have garnered the international attention it did if it were  not for Dibble’s provocative analysis of what happened next. Dibble made clear that the Bungle Affair was so distressing, first, because  it ended up having real-w orld effects: the avatars that had been violated in  the virtual world were controlled by real people logging in from different  geographical locations, and those people felt themselves traumatized by Mr.  Bungle’s “rape” of their avatars. The incident brought to light questions con- cerning the relationship between real- world and online personae— and online  ethics incumbent on those personae—t hat we are still hashing through today  in discussions about the psychological implications of intermeshed human-   avatar identities, from online relationships to gameworld role- playing.  Second, the Bungle Affair raised queries about how real-w orld acts translate  into online contexts: as Dibble notes, while everyone using LamdaMOO that  day saw a “rape” happen, violated users chastised Mr. Bungle for his lack of  “civility”— not the ethical terminology we would normally apply to rape.  Actions, particularly violent ones, somehow had double meanings, or new  meanings, in the inworld context; there was an ontological as well as an ethi- cal problem to be overcome when a line of code became an act of real- world,  personal violation. Third, and most important to the discussion of cyberspace CPRs, the  long- term questions generated by the Bungle Affair concerned the nature  of commons governance in online communities. One LambdaMOO user  named evangeline, “who identified herself as a survivor of both [this] virtual  rape . . . and real- life sexual assault, floated a cautious proposal for a MOO-   wide powwow on the subject of virtual sex offenses and what mechanisms if  any might be put in place to deal with their future occurrence.”29 Following  her post, another user named legba called for Mr. Bungle’s “toading” (the  </page> <page sequence="11"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity 47 deletion of his account from the MOO—e ssentially a “death sentence”) for  “raping Starsinger.” While many in the collective agreed to this, it could not  be done without unilateral action from a “wizard,” one of the master pro- grammers of the MOO. In the case of LambdaMOO, this was Pavel Curtis,  a Xerox researcher and the MOO’s principal architect, who had early on  issued a declaration that wizards would not be involved in day- to- day, mun- dane operations of the virtual world. LambdaMOO was in a quandary: Since getting the wizards to toad Mr. Bungle  .  .  . required a con- vincing case that the cry for his head came from the community at  large, then the community itself would have to be defined; and if the  community was to be convincingly defined, then some form of social  organization, no matter how rudimentary, would have to be settled  on. And thus, as if against its will, the question of what to do about  Mr. Bungle began to shape itself into a sort of referendum on the  political future of the MOO.30 The online community met to discuss options: various participants expressed  their opinions about the action and what its consequences should be, and  this played through a number of political positions from libertarianism to  anarchism to dictatorial fiat. In the end, the band of MOO users reached  a stalemate, and it was only through the unauthorized act of a wizard—  JoeFeedback, who acted alone and toaded Mr. Bungle— that the matter  was immediately resolved. The long-t erm outcome of the Bungle Affair for  LambdaMOO was the institution of a “new regime” that included a petition-   and- ballots system that would allow citizens to define and impose sanctions  and a procedure for adjudicating conflicts, “an ad hoc arbitration system in  which mutually agreed- upon judges have at their disposition the full range of  wizardly punishments.”31 Ostrom’s CPR research becomes visible here. In particular— and contra- dicting much utopian rhetoric upholding the idea that online cooperation is  natural or automatic—t he Bungle Affair supports Ostrom’s claims that coop- erative ethics and civility must be either part of the appropriator’s disposition  going in to the CPR situation (in Mr. Bungle’s case, it was not) or must be  cultivated by specific procedures of CPR operation that appeal to the self-   interest of appropriators. In contrast to the hymns of praise we hear so often  for “flow” or horizontal structure and self-o rganization that eschew unilat- eral rules and hierarchy, the LambdaMoo appropriators learned that in a  completely open commons there are no checks and balances on behavior, and  that this can bring such a sodality to a grinding, even traumatizing, halt.32 But the LambdaMoo incident posed additional questions that apply today  to any digital commons. What constitutes an online community and what  are the rules governing such a commons space? Who should decide those  rules: the commons provider, producer, or appropriator? If there is always  </page> <page sequence="12"> 48 Amy J. Elias an “admin” behind the scenes who has control of the code—a lways a “man  (or corporation) behind the curtain” who has the ability to act unilaterally  to toad players, manipulate the platform, or pull the plug on an entire virtual  environment— can cyberworlds ever truly be “commons”? Or are they just  commons more complex than we had imagined, in fact perfectly illustrat- ing Ostrom’s contention that some CPR situations call for administrative  oversight by commons providers or even require the inclusion of experts to  oversee sanctions created by appropriators. (If they do need administrative  monitoring, then we should be discussing how appropriators of cyber- CPRs  might negotiate and legally formalize sanctions rules with providers. This  of course leads us, as we shall see below, to the property rights problem  diagnosed by open source advocates.) And significantly, in view of the pres- ent discussion, Dibble’s article raises the question of human ethics in digital  space. If, as Ostrom claims, even minimal face- to- face communication plays  a decisive role in the successful functioning of CPRs, what will replace this  human interaction in the digital environment, particularly if we haven’t yet  come near to sorting out the relation between online personae and real-l ife  human identity in digital worlds? As we try to engender and maintain com- mons across cultures on a planetary scale, will new, Skype-l ike platforms that  “actually” offer us the chance to see one another’s faces be perceived by us  as the same ethical situation as face- to- face meetings, or will this be a third,  avatar space between fiction and reality for which we need to revise our  negotiating and commons- building skills? The Digital Commons, the Anticommons, and Open Source New media studies analyzing the nature of “cyberspace as commons” have  been another rejoinder to Hardin’s theory, which is cited frequently in debates  about “open source ethics.” In fact, open source is the most easily recognized  commons desideratum in digital culture contexts. In the work of writers such  as James Boyle, David Bollier, Lawrence Lessig, Clay Shirky, Diana Saco, Car- olyn Guertin, Manuel Castells, and many others, the conversation about the  network society has fundamentally defined scholarship concerning the Inter- net, World Wide Web, and online cultures.33 One could argue that this inquiry  was in fact birthed with the Internet itself. But certainly with the develop- ment of Richard Stallman’s GNU Unix operating system, with its “CopyLeft”  rules of appropriation, and the FOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source) software  movement, combined with newer ideas about “net neutrality” and the devel- opment of peer- to- peer file- sharing software, the idea of the global Internet  as a public commons took permanent hold.34 Yet as early as 1998, it was  clear that bellicosity regarding the Internet Commons was focused primar- ily on property distribution rights and copyright laws. Douglas Noonan, for  example, proposed that the Internet is a commons because it “meets both  </page> <page sequence="13"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity 49 criteria of (1) nonexcludability and (2) rivalrous consumption.”35 The second  criterion has been examined extensively, and the first is not used primarily  to assess commons resources but rather to gauge to what extent things meet  the definition of public or collective goods.36 The overlap between theories of  the commons and of public goods continues in deliberations about the digital  commons because such inquiries often involve arguments about copyright  and management of open- source software.37 Those of us in language studies might note the key role played by meta- phor in these debates. The Internet is in fact understood in terms of property  rights when the dominant trope organizing discussions is that of “cyberspace  as place” or planetary space. Dan Hunter has pointed out how frequently the  “cyberspace as place” metaphor is used in legal scholarship, thereby fostering  a regulatory environment. This metaphor, he contends, is “leading us inexora- bly towards an undesirable policy outcome: the staking out of private claims  in cyberspace and concomitant reductions in the public ‘ownership’ of the  space”— one version of “the tragedy of the anticommons.”38 “Anticommons”  is a term Hunter appropriates from James Boyle, a major player in the open  source movement who writes prolifically about the need to keep the Internet  an open commons space.39 Boyle writes that “we are [now] in the middle of a  second enclosure movement,” an “enclosure of the intangible commons of the  mind” that mimics in many ways the English enclosure of arable lands in the  nineteenth century.40 He makes the case that, historically, intellectual prop- erty law worked to protect the intellectual commons, but that key changes  in intellectual property rights are now radically extending those rights’ tra- ditional boundaries—s uch as the troubling move by the European Database  Directive to attempt to copyright compilations of facts.41 However, Boyle  cites two important differences between the nineteenth- century enclosure of  the arable commons and the movement attempting to regulate intellectual  property today: (1) the “commons of the mind” (unlike the arable commons)  may be “non- rival,” that is, one person’s use does not preclude or undermine  use by another, and (2) this use is also “non-e xcludable,” meaning that the  good can be used and duplicated again and again by many people without its  diminishment. The second of these sounds like a good thing in relation to the  arable commons, but in the context of the digital commons, it could actually  undermine incentive to create the resource in the first place, for creators of  products would not be able to regulate copying of, block usage of, or charge  for their creations. There are also ways to wreck an online commons that are unique to its  digital character. With the development of the WWW, for instance, the strat- egy of overloading websites became an intentional, premeditated method for  hacking and disrupting websites and public access to them. Critics such as  Noonan point out that sophisticated users often can easily overload differ- ent links in the network chain, “reducing the value of other transmissions  congested at that point” and thereby “pos[ing] collective- action dilemmas”  </page> <page sequence="14"> 50 Amy J. Elias related to bandwidth and its use.42 In the same vein, Gian Maria Greco and  Luciano Floridi stress that overloaded bandwidth (“bandwidth exploita- tion”) and spam (“information pollution”) should be considered online  forms of Hardin’s “exploitation” and “pollution of the commons.”43 Boyle’s thesis, however, is that “a global network actually transforms our  assumptions about creativity and innovation so as to reshape the debate  about the need for incentives.” He specifically references the collaborative  work at the heart of the free software and open source movements: here,  one does not simply donate work to a public domain, but rather the domain  itself is “a continual accretion in which all gain the benefits of the program  on pain of agreeing to give their additions and innovations back to the com- munal project.”44 This definition makes the similarities between open source  and commons clear. His notion of distributed production—w hereby smaller  groups work on chunks of a problem and then coordinate results— implicitly  accords with Ostrom’s assertion that complex CPRs will need to be broken  into smaller coordinated units. Boyle also is not adverse to intellectual prop- erty regulation but tends to see the Internet as a vast experiment in new kinds  of commons production that may or may not be compatible with some forms  of intellectual privatization: “our concerns about the excesses of intellectual  property were simply the ones that Jefferson, Madison, and Macaulay gave  us so long ago.”45 But important to Boyle’s argument as well as to others’ in  his camp is the idea that it doesn’t matter why or with what attitudes people  engage in this commons behavior (for instance, the love of others, participa- tion in a gift economy, or potlatch), just that often they will work within  distributed production without proprietary/exclusion laws and that if gover- nance processes are needed, these too can be assembled through distributed  methods. Yet I would venture to ask in what ways our perspectives on, say, Wiki- pedia would change if we saw it less as a flashpoint for discussions of  copyright and intellectual property rights and more as an example of par- ticipatory, digital art on a global scale that avoided the “cyberspace as place”  metaphor. Joseph Michael Reagle has made a strong case, for example, that  “Wikipedia is both a community and an encyclopedia” and “a good faith  collaborative culture.”46 His presentation of Wikipedia dovetails perfectly  with Ostrom’s definition of well- functioning commons communities, for he  see it not as the completely open, egalitarian, and free space of public con- tribution often praised or bemoaned in popular discussions but rather as  a highly defined and policed community effort. Reagle examines the three  core community policies outlined on Wikipedia’s metapages (“Neutral Point  of View,” “No Original Research,” and “Verifiability”) as commons prin- ciples formulated by providers and supported by appropriators that keep  the wiki from locking into self- interested points of view, and he analyzes  the multiple vehicles for user interaction (the page editing, the talk/dis- cussion page associated with each article, Wikizine bulletin, Wikiprojects,  </page> <page sequence="15"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity 51 Wikipedia- related blogs, aggregators, and podcasts) as if they were dialogi- cal, face- to- face encounters between appropriators.47 He strongly implies that  appropriators’ attitudes matter, but that they need to be reinforced by rules and  oversight. As pointed out above, retracing all the ins and outs of the discussion about  open source and the “anticommons” would be to rehearse an exchange foun- dational to the entire field of digital culture studies. It is important to note,  however, that Ostrom’s work rarely is mentioned in this exchange, which  concentrates not on how to make a commons or on its actual operational  logistics but on intellectual property rights and laws built upon the “cyber- space as place” metaphor. Thus we see how two approaches to the digital  commons can talk past one another— or, put more positively, address very  different aspects of commons creation. On the one hand, the feuds about  open source call attention to right of access to CPR platforms (software),  and this skews the conversation toward the “cyberspace as place” metaphor.  Since open access to the digital commons is the primary concern, theories  extolling open source tend to center on property and access rights: rather  than examining closely the ethics of appropriators or providing clear defini- tions of the territory that is threatened, this conversation converges on new,  privatizing “enclosure movements” and warns against the construction of  an “anticommons” that both locks out new CPR producers and administra- tors and radically limits the actions of all appropriators. On the other hand,  Ostrom’s work in the field of public economics tends not to focus on the  threat of privatization or regulatory oversight (though she does acknowledge  and, clearly, disapprove of this) and instead delineates the concrete opera- tions of common pool resources themselves. Her work may in fact prove to  be central to the effectiveness of arguments in the other camp: it is difficult to  preserve the freedoms of an ill- defined commons. Certainly, however, Ostrom’s work speaks to many assertions that a global  digital commons will emerge organically from the inorganic space of online  life. Rejecting a strict Hobbesian view of sociality,48 but also rejecting an easy  communality, Ostrom emphasizes that trust, reciprocity, and ethical relation- ality all maintain a role in the successful operation of a CPR while also insisting  that the CPR does not always create these ethical attributes (a claim implicit  in some open source positions, such as Boyle’s) but rather that it depends on  them. Relationality is the condition of the commons, but relation can be mere  adjacency, coterminous occupation, contiguity, or even hostile cohabitation  that collectively builds and sustains nothing. A healthy and operationally  successful CPR grows from appropriators’ ethical relationality— reciprocity  and trust— and while a CPR can be constructed so that it fosters and grows  mutual trust, it also hinges on the ethical maturity and trust of administrators  and appropriators entering the CPR situation. Nonetheless, Ostrom’s theory,  centered as it is on the logistics of CPR operation, does not help determine  where and how this ethical maturity may be developed. </page> <page sequence="16"> 52 Amy J. Elias Affect Theory and the Planetary Commons So there is still a piece missing in theories of the digital planetary commons.  What is not put in place in hypotheses about the commons in biology, public  economics, or digital culture studies appears, in effect, to be the generating  operational principle, which is neither legal nor logistical but ethical and  based upon rational communication. A critical investigation known as “affect  studies” attempts to remedy this oversight and find this missing ethical piece,  and yet it too seems, at this point, shy of this goal. But before fleshing out  that claim, I’d like to examine affect studies as a third entry point to current  constructions of the planetary digital commons. Affect studies range across a number of disciplines, topics, and scales, and  here I’d like to look at only a few examples that speak to the relation between  affect and commons creation. For instance, Michael Hardt and Antonio  Negri have addressed the problem of the mislaid keystone in the commons  edifice by bringing together affect studies and theories of the commons in a  Deleuzian- inflected model of global collectivity. In Commonwealth, Hardt  and Negri (H&amp;N) champion the term “love” as a concept for inducing a new  sociality, of bringing about a new notion of the social predicated upon, or  birthing, a new subjectivity in a Foucaultian sense.49 Hardt asserts that cur- rently we lack “a political concept of love” that would unite political interest  and our affective lives, would operate on multiple scales and in the encounter  with difference, and would help us to transform our world but also give us  a lasting foundation upon which to build a new one.50 This may or may not  be true, and, indeed, one can think of examples, from Socrates’s hemlock to  Christ’s Passion to modern anti-a partheid movements, where love seemed to  have serious political dimensions and was theorized, accordingly, as a trans- formative social power.51 Nonetheless, H&amp;N argue that “love is a process  of the production of the common and the production of subjectivity,” and,  moreover, that “love— in the production of affective networks, schemes of  cooperation, and social subjectivities— is an economic power.”52 With Spinoza and Bergson in the background, H&amp;N maintain that love  is joy and the recognition of an external cause, God, which they immediately  secularize to “love of nature as a whole.” To this they add a twist of Deleuze  and Guattari, to the effect that this joy/love is corrupted in two ways. First,  it is made into “identitarian love, or love of the same” in which love becomes  love for “those most like you.” This love includes family love, race love,  patriotism: “Family, race, and nation, then, which are corrupt forms of the  common, are unsurprisingly the bases of corrupt forms of love.” Combating  these is the mandate to love the Other: “The mandate to love thy neighbor,  then, the embodiment of each and every commandment for the monotheistic  ‘religions,’ requires us to love the other or, really, to love alterity.”53 Anyone  familiar with the biblical story of the Good Samaritan will not be surprised;  however, the great monotheistic religions do not assert that love is love of  </page> <page sequence="17"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity 53 alterity per se. This is H&amp;N’s Deleuzian move, which also requires a radical  secularization of love that simultaneously imbues the affect itself with trans- formational, even sublime, power. Second, for H&amp;N, corrupt forms of love  stem from a “process of unification or of becoming the same,” namely, from  what Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus call a despotic forma- tion. Such forms include the unity of the state but also the unity bestowed  by identity politics. What H&amp;N essentially want is love as a line of flight, an  immanence in movement without telos, or an assemblage (that is, a multi- tude) but not a unity (that is, a nation).54 This is the basis of their hypothesis that a commons derived from emo- tion, from love, is not the same as a unity. Instead, they posit, this commons  is made up of “multiple singularities”— that is, it is more like a Leibnitzian  universe or a Deleuzian plane of consistency. The powers of love are, first, its  creation of the common as social relation (in Marxist terms, these would be  its powers of association and rebellion); second, its force “to combat evil,”  defined as a corruption of the common; and third, the ability to form “the  multitude,” the name for a new collective released from the shackles of iden- tity and telos associated with Marxist definitions of the proletariat.55 And how do we learn love? Where do we learn the reciprocity and trust  necessary to the function of the commons? The authors conjecture that “the  deployment of love has to be learned and new habits have to be formed  through the collective organization of our desires, a process of sentimen- tal and political education. Habits and practices consolidated in new social  institutions will constitute our now transformed human nature.”56 (This is  the move that radically departs from the doctrines of major monotheisms:  the transformation of human nature itself.) Since, however, H&amp;N disregard  religion, nation- state, and ethnicity- based communities, they don’t answer  the questions of how human nature can be transmuted and what might be  the nature of the new social institutions that alter it. Clearly these institutions  hold considerable power and seem to iterate the claim often made in digi- tal culture studies that a commons produces the community and ethos that  sustains it. And so it appears that H&amp;N’s utopian version of the planetary  common is the reworking, through Deleuzian metaphysics, of an old Marxist  dream: the rise of a global underclass undivided by race, class, ethnicity, or  beliefs, which will bond together in brotherly love born out of opposition to  material oppression and will be collectively organized by new social institu- tions that will both guide action in the new material common and help to  transform human subjectivity.57 For Hardt, love, as affect, has this sublime power, but it also operates as a  metaphor for something like “collective spirit.” It is both an operand in the  creation of the common and a figure for an eternally open and nonteleologi- cal political collectivity: the multitude, another name for the common itself  as a new form of being. It may thus be important that H&amp;N continually refer  to “the common” rather than “the commons.” The former connotes a larger,  </page> <page sequence="18"> 54 Amy J. Elias more abstract territory than the latter, a reorganization of Being rather than  a reorganization merely of space or material resources.58 Where love comes  from— from what ethics or ontologies it is born and why it is created instead  of something else, such as competition— is not clear. H&amp;N sidestep the very  problem they set out to solve, which is how love can serve as the catalyst  and foundation for a new global collectivity. Love here is alpha and omega:  the affect (love) links to a Deleuzian line of flight (in H&amp;N, “exodus”) and  transforms the global workforce into a multitude and commonwealth, but  love also is the result of global collective organization that brings about a  new ontology. The difference from older Marxisms as well as from the con- crete, worldly ethics of monotheism— and, to me, an unsatisfying swerve into  metaphysical vagueness— is the turn from politics to ontology in the interest  of pure utopianism. Real, lived human communities such as the family or the  group with shared ethnic history are suspect and discarded while the com- mon is defined as eternal, the opening of a space of nonteleological possibility  inhabited by the multitude, which evinces a new subjectivity born from love  and exodus. Hardt has defended these ideas in his dialogues with Lauren Berlant, who  herself explores the notion of affect as bedrock for the foundation of a com- mons. Like Hardt, Berlant sees affect as an opening, providing new access  to the social: as a psychosocial concept, it replaces older terms that con- note stasis and normativity or that have lingering associations with Hegelian,  teleological idealism or with “great man theory” of the “Zeitgeist” type.59  Berlant’s approach to affect blends the notion of “a spirit of an age” (as  a kind of general feeling about the present) with modern psychology and  theories of globalization: individually felt affects can be shared generally, as  an intuition about the times, and may thus lead to transformations in per- ception and even to new social formations. Berlant is interested in how the  singular becomes the general, how the local becomes the global— that is, how  affect experienced viscerally by one person indicates a shift in the culture  at large— but unlike H&amp;N, she does not say that affect necessarily gathers  the planetary multitude or that love is the key to any affective collectivity.  Like Ostrom, who is cautious about the dangers of understanding common-   pool resource communities as inherently positive and collegial, Berlant seems  wary of Hardt’s “love” as a recuperated institutional fantasy and psychic  investment.60 While to some extent she shares H&amp;N’s Deleuzianism, Berlant  allows only that “affective atmospheres are shared,” that “affect, the body’s  active presence to the intensities of the present, embeds the subject in a his- torical field, and that its scholarly pursuit can communicate the conditions of  a historical moment’s production as a visceral moment.”61 In Cruel Optimism, Berlant is interested in historicizing the present as a  point in time when affect is itself a new kind of subjectivity, an intuitionism  that is fundamental to the cognitive mapping abilities of an “affective class”  that is the global “precariat.” This new subjectivity is born of shock—t he  </page> <page sequence="19"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity 55 shock of the triumph of finance capital that makes apparent that the old  promises of upward mobility, the welfare state, and the fantasy of “the good  life” no longer hold for most people. These people experience a crisis reaction  that jolts habitus, the collective affects that are the culmination of institutional  fantasy: “a rhythm of life, a habit, all of the things that are affectively incul- cated in one’s orientation towards the world are institutions.”62 Unmoored  from stable social foundations and denied a progressive or even a custodial  future, the precariat loses faith in, and sees for the first time, the ideological,  fantasy narrative that structures its lifeworld; affects associated with that  lifeworld are inadequate to the new precarious reality in which it finds itself.  The affective class, living in a time of constant threat and crisis, feels that  something is off- kilter, and it uses its intuitions to map a new epistemologi- cal and political landscape. The disaffected cross traditional class lines, and  they respond to the crisis-e vent of the present in radically different ways but  through the same means: intuitively and viscerally, through affective reac- tions to social changes and intuitions of alternatives to the status quo. Berlant  writes that “a shift between knowing and uncertain intuitionisms enables  us to think about being in history as a densely corporeal, experientially felt  thing whose demands on survival skills map not the whole world in one  moment but a way to think about the history of sensualized epistemologies  in the atmosphere of a particular moment now (aesthetically) suspended in  time.”63 Berlant reasons that this is a postwar phenomenon related to the collapse  of the welfare state, no longer upheld by what used to be strong political  narratives. She claims that this moment in the twenty-fi rst century consti- tutes a historical situation, “a state of animated and animating suspension  that forces itself on consciousness, that produces a sense of the emergence  of something in the present that may become an event.” Consequently, we  experience the present as a kind of duration, an “impasse” or a “glitch” that  “is lived as adjustment, remediation, or adaptation.” Brilliantly, she writes  that this is “a space of time lived without a narrative genre. . . . An impasse  is a holding station that doesn’t hold securely but opens out into anxiety.”64  Berlant thus brings together affect, contemporary sociality, politics, psychol- ogy, and art: each refracts affective intuitions about a present that voices its  truth slantwise, in not- yet- formed articulations. Berlant’s notion of the present as duration or “impasse” that is lived as  adjustment, remediation, or adaptation is completely compatible with the  notion of the planetary commons as metaphysics of flow, queering of time,  or digital stream.65 Like H&amp;N, she sees the new commons as a provisional,  a- teleological space of lived possibilities, inhabited by those disaffected  with, or reeling from, the aftershocks of global capital. While H&amp;N stress  the rhyzomatic nature of this commons, Berlant underscores its psychoso- matic foundations. The commons is a kind of “nervous system,” an affective  atmosphere that is shared.66 Thus if there is a collectivity forming from the  </page> <page sequence="20"> 56 Amy J. Elias precariat’s affective perception of the present, it is the “affectsphere,” the  social commons located not in the future but in the “becoming- event” of  the present, the becoming- historical of the affective, “prehended” event.67  The commons that is germinated— this provisional, affective, atmospheric  commons that we might call, using an older language, “common sense”— is  not based on “love” but does put people into relation (with others, with  the world) and features other affects central to relationality, including those  “involving proximity, . . . friendship, . . . aversions.”68 Unlike Hardt, Berlant  leaves open the ethical valence of this affective commons that is also the his- torical present, though she strongly implies that it is a positive collectivizing  movement. But how is affect theory addressing media studies and its particular focus  on a planetary digital commons? Situated within the province of digital  culture studies, Richard Grusin’s work might provide one answer. Like Ber- lant, Grusin understands “the real” to be thoroughly mediated. His focus,  however, is not on somatic or even on ideological intervention, though his  argument builds upon both of these ideas. His primary concern is with what  he terms “the affective life of media”: “Our contemporary media forms  and practices also collapse into a single heterogeneous action a number of  specific human and nonhuman, cognitive and affective, interactions, which  create affective feedback loops in conjunction with our everyday media  forms and practices.”69 For Grusin, these feedback loops—t his affective life  of telecommunications— are distinctly not derived from an ethics of love, nor  do they reflect a kind of intuited Real that allows cognitive mapping in the  historical present. In fact, they specifically foreclose the latter. The real world  has become the world of digital communications: in the twenty-fi rst century,  specifically after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, we live in a state  of culture that is “hypermediated” into “diverse and interconnected media  formats of social networking” and where televised and Internet newscasting  invent a cultural logic that Grusin terms “premediation.”70 “Premediation” is  a specific effect of news coverage and journalistic reporting in all technologi- cal platforms. It is a kind of temporal distortion or flattening of time in which  the news and social networking services constantly try to articulate, in the  present, all possible immediate or near-f uture disaster scenarios in order to  anticipate them. They do so in order both to assuage citizens’ fear of being  surprised by terrifying natural, economic, or social acts and (in collusion with  political power) to keep the citizenry in a state of anxiety that precludes real  political action. Thus, rather than distracting viewers, the media construct  “an affect of anticipation.” Affect here fashions a collective in Berlant’s sense,  but this affect does not spontaneously make its presence felt in response  to conflicts defining a social milieu. The collective affect is, instead, fully  controlled and created by communications venues, which thereby become  “agents of juridicality” as well as “governmentality”: there is a “social net- working among the executive branch, the military, and the media.”71 In some  </page> <page sequence="21"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity 57 ways, this is a newer, global, informational version of the twentieth- century  “military- industrial complex.” Public broadcasts as well as other information  formats together produce “premediation,” or the affects of anticipation. Any- thing that happens seems, to the public, to be inevitable, and the possibility  of an unmediated future is staved off. Building upon Niklas Luhmann’s theory of autopoietic systems, Grusin  argues that “there is  .  .  . an ontological aspect of premediation in which  [media guarantee that] the future is always remediated at the very moment  that it emerges into the present.” Rather than an event, the “future pres- ent” will be a present that is the product of, and completely defined within  the parameters of, information systems and communications technology,  “the continuation of a recursive system of irritation and stabilization.”72  The media don’t exist to patrol government or even to report events to the  citizenry: they exist solely to reproduce themselves, and to produce a false  continuity between past, present, and future that may in fact collude with the  aims of power.73 As Grusin writes, More like designing a video game than predicting the future, preme- diation is not concerned with getting the future right, as much as with  trying to map out a multiplicity of possible futures. Premediation  would in some sense transform the world into a video or computer  game, which only permits certain moves . . . [and] only some of those  possibilities are encouraged by the protocols and reward systems  built into the game. . . . In fact it is precisely the proliferation of competing and often  contradictory future scenarios that enables premediation to prevent  the experience of a traumatic future by generating and maintaining a  low level of anxiety as a kind of affective prophylactic.74 The difference between premediation and video games, however, is that in a  game there are a limited number of possible moves allowed by the system.  Premediation works not with the possible but with the virtual: it remediates  (or puts into technological formats) in the present the virtual potentialities  of future actions to generate possibilities for such occurrences. All of these  possibilities are “real” in the sense that they all have an effect in the present  regardless of which ones turn out to be true. Grusin notes that “to think of  premediation as virtual [à la Deleuze], and therefore as real, is to refuse this  metaphysical distinction [between true and false] and to insist instead on  the efficacy, or force, of the multiplicity of premediations in and of them- selves— no matter how the future might actually turn out.” Premediation’s  main effect is to change “the relationship of proximity, closeness, or intimacy  to embodiment” into a kind of “distributed affect.”75 Grusin’s vision of the affective commons is the most pessimistic of those  I’ve noted here. Unlike H&amp;N, Grusin sees little emancipatory potential in  </page> <page sequence="22"> 58 Amy J. Elias such a commons, for it would be produced within an autopoietic media sys- tem whose gaze is turned only upon itself in its many forms and networks of  distribution. From the perspective of his account, which is compatible with  popular world-systems theories, the members of Berlant’s precariat seem to  be cogs in a machine, manipulated by the system according to its own needs  for self- reproduction and self- extension.76 If there is a “real” outside of this  system, it is increasingly difficult for people to access; in the proliferation  of social media that constitutes our modernity in the twenty-fi rst century,  there may indeed be, as Berlant claims, an “affectscape,” but for Grusin, this  is not based in human psychology and intuition. It is instead constructed  through an overload of information geared to produce a low- level intensity.  Grusin maintains that the media manufacture content that becomes “com- mon sense” and short- circuits the precariat’s relation to the real; the media  commons is a homeopathic machine that stays or inhibits political action by  constantly producing the affect of paralyzing anxiety in the citizenry. In its various forms, affect theory thus positions the planetary commons  as a somatic or cognitive miasma, circulating through media and culture and  determining human perception and social action. It may be defined positively  (“love”) or negatively (“premediation”), but in all of its formulations, affect  implies the irrelevance of human rational agency. The planetary commons  in this theoretical sphere is shared intuitive perception rather than shared  communal project. Such a definition easily supports the bleakest pictures of  the coming media technocracy and biopolitical control. But even at its most  optimistic, such a planetary commons offers the possibility only of affective  cognitive mapping and somatic intuition of political oppression, duplicities,  and hypocrisies. People may think, “Something has gone wrong: I feel it to be  so, and I will join with others who feel it to be so.” But how to build upon this  feeling in a way that leads to an egalitarian, productive planetary commons  constructed at various scales is a question that remains largely unanswered.  While affect theories give provocative reasons why collectivization might  occur, it is left to other conceptual models to account for the actual rise and  maintenance of the commons, as well as for the ethical values needed to  maintain its productivity and fair use. Worlding the Technological Commons In his concert performance Stripped, Live, the British comic Eddie Izzard  quipped that after downloading, the new version of iTunes “starts asking  you questions, like, ‘Will you sign a new agreement with iTunes?’ I’ve signed  many agreements with iTunes. I don’t know what they want from me any- more. Surely they know that I agree with them.”77 Whether we agree with  iTunes, as a global conglomerate redefining the digital commons, is part of  the fun here. </page> <page sequence="23"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity 59 It would seem that today, in fact, a reconsideration of the commons is,  implicitly or explicitly, everywhere. As the planet is seen more and more as  a closed system, and as technology advances into territories once reserved  for science fiction,78 the planet as commons becomes increasingly tied to  notions of the common media grid. Different perspectives situated within  biology, property rights law, digital culture studies, political economy, and  affect theory speak of the wedding of the planetary commons to the tech- nological sublime, the machinic territory of the posthuman. The shadows  of Deleuze and Guattari loom over this theoretical scene, which implies that  Pierre Macheray was prescient in 1979 when he predicted a shift from Hegel  to Spinoza in contemporary thought: in articulations of the commons, across  discourses and disciplinary borders, we see the language of flow, becom- ing, posthumanism, alterity, and affective and somatic relationality often  privileged over that of rational planning, ethics based in habitus, dialogic  relationality, and institution- building.79 In the context of digital culture and global media studies, the commons  is treated differently than it is in environmental studies, comparative arts,  ethics, or even political economy. The textual and remediated territory of the  Internet seems to elude a humanism interpreted as embodied performative  mimesis.80 Cyberspace also poses unique problems to a planetarity defined,  in Spivak’s terms, as recognition of materiality, placedness, and difference.81  While I hesitate to agree with Mark Poster that “global culture can only  be global media culture,” certainly it is true that “the human/information  machine link introduces new configurations of the binaries of space and  time, body and mind, subject and object, producer and consumer, indeed all  the constituents that form cultures.”82 In response, cyber-t heorists and open  source advocates often appear to adopt radically different perspectives on  the commons and on the possibilities for human agency in it. Some advocate  a Habermasian conception of communicative agency and public sphere, in  which human initiative and self- determination (based in fundamental needs  of survival and communication within social systems) are frequently under- stood to be ingredients central to the construction of creatively imagined,  collaborative digital commons.83 And yet critics from these same fields have  also issued some of the most frightening predictions about global surveillance  and mind control in this online environment. Oftentimes, researchers and advocates in the open- source technology camp  who campaign with zeal for a planetary digital commons seem undisturbed  by the idea that “flow” may come at the price of the human, perhaps even at  the price of the organic. Autopoiesis is, after all, a machinic idea, and systems  theories proliferating in digital culture studies routinely drift in the direc- tion of Singularity religiosities.84 In the most ecstatic as well as the bleakest  pictures of the emerging technological planet (such as the global- collective-  a s- Matrix image), the most human of concepts— that of a commons, a  collectively managed territory promoting survival but also a shared space of  </page> <page sequence="24"> 60 Amy J. Elias negotiated values— may be precisely what is occluded, wresting control from  people and placing it in the domain of machines and networks, undermin- ing notions of human agency, and overriding humans’ ability to rationally  plan and negotiate their realities by streaming affect through our cognitive  processing centers and/or short- circuiting, through new legal and illegal sur- veillance, our determination of public space. It may be difficult to be jubilant about digital planetarity as it is currently  being configured if it just mirrors older notions of globalization—t hat is, if  the digital commons we create is just a new platform for creating us in its  own image and according to the dehumanizing logics of the market, or if  the digital commons is merely a way to funnel free labor to multinational  corporations. In 2013 I visited the website for “hack/reduce,” a Boston-b ased  nonprofit organization supported by the state of Massachusetts and MIT that  advertises its membership as “a meritocracy based around community and  innovation.” I was perplexed to see that this “hacker” organization touting  open- source rhetoric and collaborative organization was funded by, among  other entities, Microsoft, IBM, Dell, Google, and Bain Capital Ventures.85 Of course, it is precisely in the territory of the digital that the most vehe- ment protests and subversive action are taking place against privatization  and market appropriation of the planetary commons— from the Hackers  on Planet Earth (HOPE) annual conferences featuring speakers such as The  Yes Men and Steve Rambam to global online actions by Anonymous and  Wikileaks. On the side of these protests and informed by research such as  Ostrom’s, we are not simply championing theoretical naïveté when we assert  that “a broader theory of human behavior views humans as adaptive crea- tures who  .  .  . learn norms, heuristics, and full analytical strategies from  one another, from feedback from the world, and from their own capacity to  engage in self- reflection and imagine a differently structured world. They are  capable of designing new tools— including institutions— that can change the  structure of the worlds they face for good or evil purposes.”86 Such a claim  does not necessarily impose anthropomorphic machinery upon the planet  and its life forms. Rather, it is recognition that humans are clever little ani- mals who occupy the top of their planetary food chain, and often it is good  for everyone’s and everything’s survival when these social mammals learn to  collaborate. Certainly, the planet will be impacted by technology, as is most apparent in  such initiatives as “Hack the Planet,” a geoengineering project to technologi- cally control the planet’s weather. In his book of the same title, Eli Kintisch  quotes Stewart Brand, author of the original Whole Earth Catalog, as noting,  in 2009, “Whether it’s called managing the Commons, natural infrastructure  maintenance, tending the wild, niche construction, ecosystem engineering,  mega gardening, or intentional Gaia, humanity is now stuck with the plan- et’s stewardship role.”87 If stewardship of the planet is to be the goal of the  new planetary commons— and I think it is the only option linked to human  </page> <page sequence="25"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity 61 survival— then perhaps we should pay more attention to Ostrom’s model,  which seems to me to offer the most reasonable discussion of operational  commons and a particularly useful set of cautions when planning a digital  commons that will inevitably operate on a planetary scale. But, as I’ve tried  to show, her model needs to be supplemented by some kind of discourse—  philosophical, religious, affective— that posits a way to fashion its ethical  keystone. This is the starting place for the good-f aith values that will organize  and maintain the planetary commons. These are not necessarily “traditional  values” (though they are not necessarily radically new values either) and they  will not come naturally to the human animal. They must be constructed in  the spirit of the commons itself— relationally, collaboratively. Oddly, therefore, looking at the planet as digital commons may require  us to develop a new form of humanism rather than an anti- humanism (Rosi  Braidotti’s work is particularly useful in this regard).88 Surprisingly, in the end,  planetary cyberspace in fact may not be incompatible with Spivak’s demand  for a re- cognition of humanity through planetary dialogue. For some time  now, I have been researching, and thus steeped in, the ethics and politics of  dialogue and have come to understand that there is often an excluded middle  in both constructivist and essentialist theories of human agency—n amely,  the territory of negotiation between the phases of construction and adop- tion, and, located between identity and exchange, the negotiated selfhood  that provides the very territory of dialogics. In other words, if we do not  assume an autopoietic system (even one based in affect) acting similarly at all  levels of the planetary system and training persons to act in accordance with  its own objectives, and if we can, without theoretical embarrassment, posit  that effective human action requires rational planning, the missing ethical  linchpin in current theories of the commons must be forged through dialogic  exchange between persons in a public sphere. What Mr. Bungle made clear,  and what new research about online civility illustrates, is that in lived human  contexts, relationality does not necessarily equal dialogue. Ethics and the  politics of ethics matter. The birth of the digital planetary commons need not  be divorced from conceptions of human agency, ethics, law, and optimism, if  these are what it takes to build a commons that is not a hive or a sweatshop.89 I have written elsewhere about the linkages between planetarity and dia- logism; in the discourse of the planetary, we see a concept opposed to “the  global” and a return to the idea that survival depends on dialogic relation,  on persons able to negotiate with their surroundings—w ith other persons,  with cultural and natural environments.90 In Ostrom’s theory of common  pool resources, we see how important dialogue is to maintaining integrity  and good faith in commons interactions, even if these need to be undergirded  by law that is itself of our own making. We need to think much more about  how dialogue and negotiation—t he face- to- face relation— are not just pos- sible but imperative to any functioning commons, even to one encompassing  the planet, in cyberspace. </page> <page sequence="26"> 62 Amy J.

Analysts of Hardin’s essay align him with various politics;  recently, Rob Nixon has shown how his “antipastoral logic” often resonates with  neoliberalism’s “hostility to shared goods, a hostility inseparable from the neo-   liberal drive for resource appropiation and for dismantling regulatory oversight,  whether by international, nation-s tate, or local bodies.” However, as Nixon does  note, this is precisely opposite to Hardin’s objective, which was a call for more  (possibly governmental) oversight of commons areas; his primary concern was  population control, and, alarmingly, he called for a repeal of the UN Universal  Declaration of Human Rights, asserting that the size of families should be regu- lated by the state.

CPRs come in two  strata: the resource system associated with stock (“groundwater basins, graz- ing areas, . . . parking garages,” etc.) and resource units (RU) produced by the  system associated with flow (“the acre-f eet or cubic meters of water withdrawn  from a groundwater basin or an irrigation canal, the tons of fodder consumed  by animals from a grazing area, . . . the [number of] parking spaces filled,” etc.).  Each stratum is dependent on the other. With renewable resources, one factors in  a replenishment rate: “as long as the average rate of withdrawal [i.e., “appropria- tion”] does not exceed the average rate of replenishment, a renewable resource  is sustained over time. CPR access can be limited to a single individual or firm  or to multiple individuals or teams of individuals who use the resource system  at the same time.” Appropriators may themselves “consume the resource units,”  may “immediately transfer ownership of resource units to others,” or may “use  </page> <page sequence="27"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity 63 resource units as inputs into production processes.” For instance, fishermen can  use an RU in the process of making something else (such as irrigating a field) or  sell it directly, thereby transferring ownership (such as selling fish at market).

I would put Appiah’s theory of cosmopolitanism in the first camp; see  Kwame Anthony Appiah, Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers (New  York: W. W. Norton, 2006). Spivak’s view would be a part of the second; it is  more muscular, recognizing the role that economic disparity and cultural dif- ference will play in any intercultural contact, but her Derridean assumptions  lead her to valorize difference as such and can construct only an abstract plan- etary commons made and unmade in a perpetual cycle of unmasking, undoing,  and rearticulation. See Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Death of a Discipline (New  York: Columbia University Press, 2003). 13. “Yet by now,” Nixon notes, “most sociobiologists accommodate a broader  vision of species self- perpetuation, one that acknowledges how altruism—f orms  of apparent selflessness—m ay be genetically beneficial, enhancing the prospects  of collective survival. Hardin’s genetic- generic method fails to acknowledge the  evolutionary role that the paradox of selfish selflessness may play.” See Nixon,  “Neoliberalism,” 594. 14.

(Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1998), 189. 36. In economics, a public good is defined as a good available to all (“nonex- cludable”) and one in which one person’s use does not subtract from another’s use  (“nonrivalrous”). For the classic statement on public goods, see Paul A. Samuel- son, “The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure,” Review of Economics and Statistics  36, no. 4 (1954): 387– 89. A public good is therefore distinguished from common  pool resources, where subtractability or rivalry plays a major role in the viability  of the resource (one person’s use has the potential to subtract from another’s  use). Charlotte Hess and Elinor Ostrom provide a useful short discussion of the  difference between public goods, private goods, and CPRs in “Introduction: An  Overview of the Knowledge Commons,” especially on pages 7– 10. 37. See, for example, Steven Weber’s discussion of open source and/as the com- mons, in The Success of Open Source (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University  Press, 2004), particularly his summary on pages 243– 48. Justyna Hofmokl con- tends that Internet goods do not fall into the common pool category at all; see  “The Internet Commons: Towards an Eclectic Theoretical Framework,” Inter- national Journal of the Commons 4, no. 1 (2010): 226– 50. Noonan posits a  criterion of “rivalrous consumption” important to studies claiming that digital  spaces contradict Hardin’s original “tragedy of the commons” scenario—n ot, as  Ostrom maintains, because users can find ways to negotiate resource use but  because the goods that electronic sites make available are (1) nonmaterial and (2)  cannot be depleted (downloading a pdf from a website does not reduce the num- ber of pdfs available later to others); see “Internet Decentralization, Feedback,  and Self- Organization.” However, Karthik Jayaraman argues that it is not par- ticipation in commons based peer production (CBPP) but lack of participation in  it that has more impact on a CBPP project’s success (“Tragedy of the Commons  in the Production of Digital Artifacts,” International Journal of Innovation, Man- agement and Technology 3, no. 5 [2012]: 626). 38.

Dan Hunter notes that “the anticommons effect occurs when multiple par- ties [though not everyone using a resource] can prevent others from using a given  resource so that no one has an effective right of use.” He correlates the digital  anticommons to the situation in Japan following the 1995 Kobe earthquake, in  which rebuilding was stymied because of “a ‘world class’ tangle of property”  rights claims in the area that led to an “anticommons” situation (“Cyberspace  as Place,” 502, 510, 513).

There is no space here to analyze how Hobbes’s own theory has been  oversimplified in recent discussions to make it seem the über-n eoliberal theory of  state- managed, pro- capital force— something a bit astray from Hobbes’s notion  of the Leviathan as commonwealth, created when every man makes an agreement  with every other man to give the right to govern. 49.

It has no “general” or hierarchical  </page> <page sequence="31"> The Commons . . . and Digital Planetarity 67 structure and is linked to micropolitics, and it is a machinic assemblage of desire.

One hears echoes here of Boyle’s claim that the digital com- mons will itself alter user subjectivity.

Joss Hands’s excellent analysis in @ Is for Activism of H&amp;N’s “commons  multitude” identifies many of the same questions I raise here and below. Hands  accounts for and locates H&amp;N’s heralded “new social institutions” in the arena  of dematerialized and somewhat autonomous labor that is situated in the bodies  of laborers themselves (thinking and feeling work in a new information econ- omy) brought about by the growth of cognitive and affective work related to  media expansion (170). 58. In her excellent discussion of Negri’s notion of “the common” in rela- tion to the “inoperative community” of Jean- Luc Nancy, Helen Morgan Parmett  notes that “the common” was formulated through the Italian “Autonomia”  movement and emerged in the 1970s as a way to theorize the collective as living  labor. Parmett distinguishes the relevant theorists on the basis of “their differing  ontological theories of being as alterity (Nancy) and being as immanent totality  (Negri).” See Helen Morgan Parmett, “Community/Common: Jean- Luc Nancy  and Antonio Negri on Collective Potentialities,” Communication, Culture &amp; Cri- tique 5 (June 2012): 174, 175. 59. During a joint interview that also included Hardt, Berlant notes that “Unlike  Michael, who is trying to think love as a better concept for suturing or inducing the  social, I’m trying to think about what the affects of belonging are without attach- ing them to one or another emotional vernacular [such as love]. . . . We’re thinking  of the affective phenomenology of these conditions, not how to do it.” See Heather  Davis and Paige Sarlin, “ ‘On the Risk of a New Relationality’: An Interview with  Lauren Berlant and Michael Hardt,” Reviews in Cultural Theory (2008): 9. 60.

Again, the echoes of Deleuze and Guattari, Bergson, and Foucault are clear  here, as becoming and prehended event are elevated over being and analysis. As  Berlant writes, “Life in the impasse turns from threat to aim. To enter experience  without eventilizing it will mean knowing something is afoot without forcing  prediction into being, as though it would be possible to place one’s affect on a  kind of confident cruise control. The literary figures grow something like that: a  historically capacious, neointuitive sense of becoming- present” (Cruel Optimism,  70–7 1). 68.
