<plain_text><page sequence="1">Oranges, Anecdote and the Nature of Things Helen Deutsch On August 6, 1763, the man who would become the greatest master of anecdotal form in English, James Boswell, and the object of his adulation and future biographical subject, Samuel Johnson, enter a church in Harwich. Boswell is about to take unwilling leave of his new friend, who is doing him the honor of seeing him off on his voyage to Holland. They approach the altar: "Johnson, whose piety was constant and fervent, sent me to my knees, saying, 'Now that you are going to leave your native country, recommend yourself to the protection of your CREATOR and REDEEMER/" Outside the church they talk "of Bishop Berkeley's ingenious sophistry to prove the non-existence of matter, and that every thing in the universe is merely ideal." Johnson is provoked by his companion's assertion that "though we are satisfied his doctrine is not true, it is impossible to refute it." "I shall never forget the alacrity," Boswell avows, "with which Johnson answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he rebounded from it, 'I refute it thus'" (Boswell I: 471). In this most iconic of Johnsoniana, the thing speaks for itself. Johnson's constant faith in his creator is equaled and expressed by his faith in the reality of objects. The anecdote, by extension, expresses Boswell's faith in Johnson; it is representative of the way in which, as I argued in Loving Dr. Johnson, "the force of the collision of man and object enacts the solidity of both, a solidity bolstered by the anecdote's unique proximity to historical reality" (49).1 But rather than interpret this oft-cited anecdote about the materiality of things anew, I choose to evoke it here as itself an object, the closest a narrative can get to a thing. Anecdotes function at the beginning of a variety of literary-critical, new-historical and just plain historical essays as stones critics kick to prove the reality and solidity of the historical matter they analyze. I'm struck in this context not by how the stone's heft proves Johnson's real-life vitality, but by how its materiality reminds us that the great author himself is- or was (and this ambiguity reminds us that Boswell's version of the anecdote in the Life transpires in a revivifying present tense, while haunted by the inevitability of his subject's death)- a weighty thing. The process by which matter is © Board of Regents, University of Wisconsin System, 2009 31 Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="2">32 Helen Deutsch brought to life here is symbiotic and janus-faced; this anecdote enlivens the subject of Boswell's great Life and renders him potentially object-like, mute as the stone at the anecdote's heart. Or, we might say, as we turn to our next anecdote, as expressive as an orange. Golden apple of the Hesperides, cinematic mobster's smile, the orange is translated via the portable genre of anecdote through time and space, from East to West, across historical eras and literary traditions, while resting at the heart of Wikipedia's definition of " differ ance," that elusive distinction definable neither as word nor concept: A clear example of this effect occurred in England during the Renaissance period, when oranges first began to be imported from the Mediterranean. Yellow and red came to be differentiated from a new colour term- "orange." What was the meaning of these words before 1600? What is their meaning afterwards? Such effects go on all the time in our use of language and frequently, in fact, this effect forms the very basis of language/meaning.2 Here the orange is the unique thing that paradoxically proves there is nothing outside the text. If we turn from textual matters to the orange itself (and this essay explores the impossibility of doing so definitively), things become even more complicated, for not all oranges are orange. As Pierre Laszlo informs us in a caption beneath a photo of green oranges at a Rio de Janeiro market, "Brazil is representative of the world-wide tropics, where oranges are not orange-colored, but greenish. The synonymy between the fruit and the color orange is thus seen to be an artifact of the European experience" (plate 18). Paul Eluard's pronouncement, "[l]a terre est bleue comme une orange," begins from this perspective to make sense.3 How is an anecdote like an orange? We might begin by observing that the orange and the anecdote are similarly, in Joel Fineman's phrase, "compact of both literature and reference" (57), existing at the threshold of subjective experience and materiality, the literary and the real. As I work through a variety of versions of this anecdotal object in what follows, the unique mystery of the orange opens up a couple of questions: What kind of thing is the anecdote? What transactions- extending far beyond the commercial4- does it effect between the objects it contains and the subjects who consume it? This essay is an adventure in letting a particular thing speak for itself. The Author's Orange When I presented an early paper on Johnson's death and ensuing autopsy to an audience at Vanderbilt University, someone responded: "It's just like the orange peel." Anecdote, I've come to see over the course Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="3">Oranges and Anecdote 33 of a research trajectory often diverted and redefined by such epiphanies, inspires a particular kind of associative shorthand. The smallest version of a narrative whole which is also, to use Joel Fineman's influential definition, "the smallest minimal unit of the historiographical fact," or "the historeme" (56-7) thus is evoked by synecdochal recall of the thing itself (or in the case of the orange peel, the remnants of the thing) at its heart. Anecdotes, unique in their combination of literariness and that which is in excess of the literary, their "referential access to the real" (Fineman 57), substitute things for facts. Here is the anecdote to which my colleague was alluding: I won a small bet from Lady Diana Beauclerk, by asking [Johnson] as to one of his particularities, which her Ladyship laid I durst not do. It seems he had been frequently observed at the Club to put into his pocket the Seville oranges, after he had squeezed the juice of them into the drink which he made for himself. Beauclerk and Garrick talked of it to me, and seemed to think that he had a strange unwillingness to be discovered. We could not divine what he did with them; and this was the bold question to be put. I saw on his table the spoils of the preceding night, some fresh peels nicely scraped and cut into pieces. "O, Sir, (said I,) I now partly see what you do with the squeezed oranges which you put into your pocket at the Club." JOHNSON. "I have a great love for them." BOSWELL. "And pray, Sir, what do you do with them? You scrape them, it seems, very neatly, and what next?" JOHNSON. "Nay, Sir, you shall know their fate no further." BOSWELL. "Then the world must be left in the dark. It must be said (assuming a mock solemnity,) he scraped them, and let them dry, but what he did with them next, he never could be prevailed upon to tell." JOHNSON. "Nay, Sir, you should say it more emphatically:- he could not be prevailed upon, even by his dearest friends, to tell." (Boswell II: 330-331) The anecdote that provoked the audience member's association to Johnson and Boswell's wittily self-conscious exchange was its gothic double. Concluding John Hawkins' Life, succeeding even Johnson's last words and followed immediately by a report on the autopsy results, is a moment of embattled resistance: He had often reproached his physicians and surgeon with cowardice; and when [THE SURGEON] Mr. Cruikshank scarified his leg, he cried out - "Deeper, deeper; - I will abide the consequence: you are afraid of your reputation, but that is nothing to me."- To those about him, he said, - "You all pretend to love me, but you do not love me so well as I myself do." (Hawkins 275) Both anecdotes solicit and deny intimacy, emphatically refusing the whole story: the fate of the orange peel and the fate of the author remain a mystery. Brought to the fore instead is fate in material form, the mortality of both fruit and flesh. (Johnson precipitated his own death through excessive blood loss by scarifying himself shortly after the Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="4">34 Helen Deutsch episode recounted here). Such "strange unwillingness to be discovered" provoked a frenzy of display after Johnson's death. The biographers encapsulated his presence in anecdotes such as these, while the surgeons performed an autopsy- a relentlessly literal search for an interior- that was likely to have violated Johnson's wishes, preserving parts of his corpse as secular relics. In Loving Dr. Johnson, I analyzed the affinities between these two anecdotes as part of a larger investigation of the cult of authorship that Johnson inspired, tracing the fate of these particular orange peels to a variety of literary locations, including the lyrics of James Merrill and Samuel Beckett's notes for an (aptly) unfinished play on Johnson called Human Wishes. But it's that moment of association to the orange peel that I want to focus and build on here. Why has this particular thing- object of Boswell's financial and narrative speculation, edible, fragrant, solitary aftermath of communal revelry, fragmentary still life, an outside without an interior- captured so many imaginations, made so many authors speak? In what follows the definition of "anecdote" might seem to become as elusive and fragmentary as the orange itself (the bright surface which gives it form always reminding us of the remnants with which we began). But it is my hope that this literary thing will also emerge as tangible and whole. What follows is a sort of communally constructed palimpsest through which the orange might be claimed as the fruit of our ongoing associations, our anecdotal literary inheritance. The King's Orange At the close of the eighteenth century, the bodily detail of Johnsonian anecdote metonymically encapsulated in the orange peel mystery inaugurates the secular worship of an English author as both loveable monarch of letters and "body god" ritually consumed through print (Heiland 199-200). At the beginning of the modern era, oranges also figure at the moment when the body of the monarch stands at the threshold of literal and symbolic life and death. In an opening chapter aptly entitled "Still Life: Clock, Jewel, Orange," Patricia Fumerton's Cultural Aesthetics narrates the death of Charles I on the scaffold with special attention to the significance of seemingly "trivial" things: "Trivial" is my general term for an analytic of the fragmentary, peripheral, and ornamental addressed at once to the context of historical fact and to the texts of aesthetic artifact.... The luxurious bric-a-brac of the aristocrat's everyday life was one with a cosmos in which even central historical configurations seemed broken apart and marginalized in incoherence, and where self was thus fixed in Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="5">Oranges and Anecdote 35 fracture. History, we may say, was a broken confectionary plate whose sweet pieces (...) might be puzzled back together again by the shattered self but never in such a way as to recover the fancied roundness of original unity. (1) In its emphasis on history as "broken confection or disjointed pile/' and in its narrative of the emergence of an aristocratic subjectivity from that pile's beautiful and often edible fragments, Fumerton's 1991 book is in sync with our orange peel motif, while very much of its own historical moment: the heyday of New Historicism in English Renaissance studies and the beginnings of that subfield's championing of a cultural poetics based on the anecdote. Fumerton deploys Walter Pater's description of "aesthetic criticism" as a rationale for her critical method and "as epitaph for Charles- for a monarch who sought to conserve his self in a 'pure' art removed from life, from mutability, while simultaneously dispersing the self and being received in bits and pieces as a relic" (25). Charles's flesh, hair and blood were rent to pieces immediately after death, preserved and sold by a consuming mob. Johnson was, as we have seen, preserved in anatomical preparations, while disseminated and consumed in printed anecdotal fragments. Pater's evocation of the fleetingness of memory makes clear in a way that Fumerton does not the importance of the anecdote as fetish, the literary equivalent to a still life in which the passage of time and the fragmentation of analysis is frozen in the shape of an exchangeable object: To such a tremulous wisp constantly re-forming itself on the stream, to a single sharp impression, with a sense in it, a relic more or less fleeting, of such moments gone by, what is real in our life fines itself down. It is with this movement, with the passage and dissolution of impressions, images, sensations, that analysis leaves off - that continual vanishing away, that strange, perpetual, weaving and unweaving of ourselves, (qtd. in Fumerton 25) Fumerton chooses to emphasize "relic," the moment at which Pater's nostalgically evanescent evocation of a memory fragmented by its own process of preservation barely materializes. For our purposes, it is striking that this critical fusion of history and aesthetics, material objects and immaterial subjects through the fetishistic evocation of trivial things revolves around an object that remains unexplained and nearly un- exchanged, namely a clove-studded orange that the King puts in his pocket en route to his death (4). Fumerton describes Charles's staging of his execution as a highly stylized and successful attempt to construct his own passage from life to death. (We might think here of the knowing self-consciousness, epitomized by the orange peel anecdote, of Johnson's relationship to his biographer Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="6">36 Helen Deutsch as the Life was being written.) Charles's procession to the scaffold is marked by a series of gifts: divesting himself of almost the entirety of his personal possessions the day before he dies (his books, personal Bible, all but one jewel, a gold watch, toothpicker and case) (4), en route to the execution he presents "the silver clock that hung by his bedside" to his Groom of the Bedchamber asking him to "keep it in memory of him" (5) and on the scaffold itself he presents to Bishop Juxon his "last and most valued jewel, which he wore every day," his St. George medallion, echoing the famous injunction of another murdered King, the ghost of Hamlet's father, with his "last, enigmatic word: 'Remember'"5 (8). But what of the pocketed orange? Fumerton concludes her description of the cannibalistic mob whose violence initiates the industry in mementoes of the monarch with a fascinating anecdote from an eye- witness account: They were inhumanly barbarous to his dead corpse. His hair and blood were sold by parcels. Their hands and sticks were tinged by his blood and the block, now cut into chips, as also the sand sprinkled with his sacred gore, were exposed for sale. Which were greedily bought, but for different ends, by some as trophies of their slain enemy, and by others as precious reliques of their beloved prince. (9) Neither trophy nor relic, still whole amidst these bloody fragments, the orange's status remains ambiguous. "The executioner who had secured from the King's pocket the clove-scented orange... was offered twenty shillings for the orange 'by a gentleman in White-hall, but refused the same; and afterwards sold it for ten shillings in Rose mary Lane'" (9). In her book's closing pages, Fumerton returns to Charles's "fatal performance" undecided as to [W]hether we are really seeing subjectivity or commonality (alternatively: aesthetics or history), undecided, suspended, unwilling to reduce one to the other. We remember the clove-scented orange that Charles pocketed before stepping out of the Banqueting House onto his stage of death. Secreted on his person as if it were a last morsel of banqueting stuff,6 the orange could be the emblem of his privacy. Yet, of course, the secret orange ended up in the hands of the executioner, who sold it for ten shillings. The emblem of privacy, it turns out, was really an emblem of the market. But not quite. If the status of Charles's private 'self (with its supporting cast of gifts and ornaments) is undecidable, so too is that of the market universe around him. For the executioner, we will recall, at first refused to sell the spiced orange when a gentleman approached and offered twenty shillings (twice the sum for which he later sold the prize).... Did the executioner (. . .) find himself caught up in the very aura of transcendence that Charles invested in all his gifts (rather than goods): clock, jewel, or orange? Was the spiced orange a relic? Or was it instead a ware? (206) Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="7">Oranges and Anecdote 37 The orange, we might contradict Fumerton here, emblem of the global market as were the cloves that perfumed it, cannot even be classified as a gift; it is the single object that Charles keeps to himself. In puzzling over the fruit's indeterminate object status- gift, commodity, relic- Fumerton sets out a catalog of oppositions we would do well to interrogate: subjectivity/aesthetics/privacy vs. commonality/history/the market. To successfully classify the orange would be to answer the book's final question: "Is it the aristocratic 'self that we see dramatized on that stage of death, or a prosperous transaction" (206)? Clearly, Fumerton's decision not to answer this question is deliberate. The unclassifiable thingness of the King's orange, neither sacred object nor marketable commodity,7 is never given away. We shall know its fate no further.8 God's Orange He hangs in shades the orange bright, Like golden lamps in a green night. - Andrew Marvell, "Bermudas," 17-189 On the other side of Fumerton's divide between fractured royal subjectivity and consuming commonality is the divine orange praised in these lines from Andrew Marvell's 1653-4 lyric "Bermudas." At once mythical and referential, psalmic and descriptive, this gnomic poem transports the idealized philosophical realm of Marvell's poetic gardens to a particular place the poet had encountered only in books:10 Where the remote Bermudas ride In th'ocean's bosom unespied, From a small boat, that rowed along, The list'ning winds received this song. (1-4) Just as the "Bermudas" are "unespied," so is the source of their song unidentified- the only animated things in these opening lines are the "listening Winds," whose disembodied agency "receives" the song and renders it audible, functioning as an invisible yet tangible connection to the poem's reader. The lines that follow are sung, we learn, not by an isolated individual but by a crew of Puritan sailors who have escaped England for happier climes; they sing as they labor of a new world Eden where labor is no longer necessary. This paradise is characterized by an artistry both natural and divine: He lands us on a grassy stage; Safe from the storms, and prelates' rage. He gave us this eternal spring, Which here enamels ev'rything, And sends the fowls to us in care, Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="8">38 Helen Deutsch On daily visits through the air. He hangs in shades the orange bright, Like golden lamps in a green night, And does in the pom'granates close Jewels more rich than Ormus shows. He makes the figs our mouths to meet, And throws the melons at our feet, But apples plants of such a price, No tree could ever bear them twice. (11-24) In one of Marvell's main poetic sources for this description, Edmund Waller's 1654 mock-epic The Battle of the Summer Islands (aka the Bermudas), oranges are linked to Eden through an earlier Greek paradise at the Western edge of the world, the Hesperides (geographically placed by some near Cadiz, by others in Africa near Mount Atlas- an orange- friendly climate, and associated with evening, against which the oranges glow): That happy island where huge lemons grow, And orange trees, which golden fruit do bear, The Hesperian garden boasts of none so fair.11 An anecdotal history of the golden apple will illuminate Marvell's luminous orange. Thought to bestow immortality on those who tasted them, the golden apples of the Hesperides were a gift from Gaia (the goddess of Earth) to Hera upon her wedding to Zeus. In a 15th-century version of the story, the goddess plants the tree bearing the apples in the garden of the African King Atlas and his three daughters, the Hesperides. At Juno's behest, Atlas posts a fierce dragon to guard her treasure. Hercules, embarked on the eleventh of his twelve labors, slays the dragon and steals the fruit.12 The lure of these same golden apples also figures famously in the story of the virgin huntress Atalanta, who swears to marry any man who can outrun her (the penalty for losing the race is death). Smitten, Hippomenes takes the chance, and Aphrodite (associated with apples, tokens of her worship, since Sappho) answers his prayer for help with the gift of three golden apples. As they run he throws each one out, distracting her and gaining ground, but Atalanta can't be stopped. Finally Venus intervenes (and here is Ovid's version- narrated by Venus to her lover Adonis- in Golding's translation): ...I forced her too take It up, and too the Apple I did put a heavy weight, And made it of such massinesse she could not lift it streight. And least that I in telling of my tale may longer bee That they in ronning of their race, outstripped quite was shee. And he that wan her, marrying her enjoyd her for his fee. (qtd. in Palter 16) Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="9">Oranges and Anecdote 39 Francis Bacon in his On the Wisdom of the Ancients (1609), making didactic use of the "veil of fiction" that separates classical mythology from the present and distinguishes "the Mysteries and Secrets of Antiquity. . .from the Records and Evidences of succeeding Times" (243) transforms "Atalanta, or Gain," into a story with a multivalent moral. This Fable seems Allegorically to demonstrate a notable conflict between Art and Nature; for Art signified by Atalanta in its work (if it be not letted and hindered) is far more swift than Nature, more speedy in pace, and sooner attains the end it aims at, which is manifest in almost every effect.... [A]nd yet this Prerogative and singular agility of Art is hindered by certain Golden Apples to the infinite prejudice of Human Proceedings: For there is not any one Art or Science which constantly perseveres in a true and lawful course till it comes to the proposed End or Mark; but ever and anon makes stops after good beginnings, leaves the Race and turns aside to Profit and Commodity, like Atalanta.... And therefore it is no wonder that Art hath not the power to conquer Nature, and, by Pact or Law of the Contest, to kill and destroy her; but on the contrary it falls out, that Art becomes subject to Nature, and yields the obedience of a Wife to her Husband. (322-23) Bacon's golden apples make Atalanta a victim of the market, seduced by the allure of "profit and commodity." His apples have more in common with the exotic and highly fashionable fruits of Marvell's Bermudas (their near contemporaries) than with their classical sisters; they beckon not toward immortality but toward the degraded and diverting ends of gain. In Bacon's monitory version of pride going before a fortunate fall, art's greed results in her inevitable submission to nature despite the fact that she is her husband's superior. We might consider this interpretation when we think back to Charles's orange, withheld from the market to occupy the realm Fumerton mourns and reclaims as the aesthetic. Bacon's purpose in On the Wisdom of the Ancients was "to illustrate either Antiquity, or Things themselves" (249), and the resonance of the latter phrase with Husserl's phenomenological motto should remind us of Bacon's crucial contribution to the modern re-invention of the object and the new science, what Joel Fineman calls "an empiricist, technicist scientism that works to divorce knowledge from experience." Following Husserl's description of the Renaissance as a period when "the language of science, exemplified by Galileo's mathematical physics, grows so formal that the sedimented meanings embedded within it grow too faint to recall... their origination in the natural life- world," Fineman argues for a crisis in "a correspondingly technicist historicism" newly estranged from the anecdotal real, by which "historiography gave over to science the experience of history, when the force of the anecdote was rewritten as experiment" (62-3). Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="10">40 Helen Deutsch The power of the real that characterized "experience" in all its unpredictability and singularity, the "nature" (in Bacon's terms) that infuses anecdote with its literary and referential force, is transformed in Fineman's account into "experiment," what Bacon called "Instances of the Fingerpost," or "instantiae crucis," i.e., the choice between two competing theories that formed the material of science's disembodied and prophetic "art." Fumerton's clinging to the artful mystery of Charles's orange becomes, from Fineman's perspective, symptomatic of how "the New Historicism is at once a symptom of and a response to a specifically Renaissance historiographie crisis" (one that Bacon gestures toward with his dismissal of the fictions of antiquity in favor of modern standards of evidence), a "translation of the real of history into the real of science." Yet science, Bacon reminds us in his pondering of Atalanta's apple, can never conquer the nature to which it is superior. If the orange in its connection to paradises lost (think here too of Goethe's Italy, or the heavenly California depicted on orange crate labels) can be termed the fruit of nostalgia, the anecdote, genre of lost authenticity and plenitude, is its rightful home.13 Might it be possible to read "Bermudas," in its fusing of mythical space with historical time (an opposition we might align with the dual nature of the anecdote as both literary and referential) as having a particular affinity with the anecdote? As Catherine Gimelli Martin argues, things in Marvell's Puritan vision are newly particularized, not purely fixed symbols in the eternal now of a divine revelation that unites "sacred space with eternal time," but rather historically concrete quiddities that point the way toward a divine providence yet to come.14 "Bermudas," combining "elements of both the eternally recurring Anglican 'now7 and the concretely deferred 'then' of the Puritan Apocalypse," takes the reader on a journey that is "ambiguous and shifting yet also relentlessly horizontal," heading insistently "westward, in the direction of Providence" (76) which is also the direction of the mythic Hesperides and of Milton's Eden15 where the apples of life grow, a destination Marvell's sailors never reach. This inconclusive purposiveness is Marvell's attempt to resolve another series of oppositions inherent in the Protestant embrace of the Word- its spiritual reception (the word as disembodied voice, the rowers' song of an island unespied) and its material dimension (the word as image, the detailed description of the island itself). The result is the disappearance of the subjective dimension of lyric and with it the union of time and space in a poetic form that comes extremely close to anecdote, an evocatively particularized vision in which "emblems act as song" (Gimelli Martin 80) framed by a collectively impersonal voice. Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="11">Oranges and Anecdote 4 1 Yet even this opposition between the static emblems of the sailors' song and the linear movement of the frame (the song closes with the hope that the sailors' collective voice, "(perhaps) rebounding, may/Echo beyond the Mexique Bay" [35-35], evoking a literal destination and direction rather than a figurai Providence) is overly simple, and what follows returns us to the orange. For Marvell's island itself is split between "two separate visions.... a garden-island paradise of the natural/divine or pantheistic order [and]... a theological paradise, a reproduced Kingdom of God or second Jerusalem" (Gimelli Martin 80). How do these two contradictory visions, "one pre-Edenic and one post-Edenic," work in terms of the poem's logic of fruit? In the Neoplatonic fantasy of "Bermudas," nature is animated by a God who is not transcendent but rather "an immanent naturalistic force who gives everything and proclaims everything while remaining absent," a god who unites form with content. This God "speaks in providential terms through matter rather than spirit, through nature rather than by divine decree." The nature thus animated- freely giving its plenty- redeems the fallen world: "apples are born on trees which, like humans, bring forth only one offspring at a time. Significantly, this garden's apple is not the product of the death-dealing tree that in the other Eden hung its ominous boughs of fruit above the human head, proleptic symbols of their deficiency and debt, but pineapples that grow at their feet, a plant without a price." The poem's exotic pineapple recast the golden apples of antiquity and the apples of Eden in a form as singular as that of a human being, or as the "pearl of great price," here redeemed and paid for, which the Gospel of Matthew equates with the Kingdom of Heaven (the sailors go on to praise God for casting "the Gospel's pearl upon our coast" [30]). Gimelli Martin calls this mode "reversed metamorphosis- reversed in the sense that instead of humans transformed into natural/divine objects, nature becomes human/divine" (81). The orange, by contrast, is indicative of the opposite tendency- rather than a God merged with his creation, the creator who hangs the orange in the green night is "now an Old Testament Deity who acts not so much through the natural order as by transforming or intervening in it in order to produce history, his quintessential medium." The oranges thus gesture toward God's "real creation, as far as his human subjects are concerned," namely Time. Incomplete in themselves (unlike the self- sufficient pineapples), they "stand for the golden lampstands of St. John's revelation." The oranges gesture toward a world and more importantly a time elsewhere, a transformation yet to be achieved.16 Unlike the figs and melons that proffer themselves to human hands, these oranges are Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="12">42 Helen Deutsch meant to be interpreted rather than enjoyed. Their transformation requires the mind's labor. History's fruit for the eye, they are language transformed to divine light, the word of God illuminating the end of time within time. Marvell's godly revision of Waller's evocation of the Hesperides merges orange with apple and antiquity with Christianity in the service of mythologizing while materializing a new world Paradise.17 The poem's fruit logic revivifies pagan-Christian icons in a dynamic singularity that encapsulates the fusion of historical referentiality with mythological cyclicality that is "Bermudas" itself. Marvell thus transforms the orange into a golden apple at once fallen and redeemed, always referring to something outside itself. Like the anecdote, God's orange is a historeme, not concealed in a royal pocket but meant to enlighten the world by encapsulating pagan and Christian, finished and unfinished stories. Perhaps this is why, in his response to Marvell, "In a Green Night" (1962), Derek Walcott frames his lyric depiction of a decidedly earthly orange ripening and changing color on the tree with two nearly identical stanzas. Walcott's oranges are subject to time and change. Marvell's eternal and metaphorical lamps are here restored to daily rhythms of light and darkness: For if by night each golden sun Burns in a comfortable creed, By noon harsh fires have begun To quail those splendours which they feed. The poem begins and ends thus: The orange tree, in various light, Proclaims perfected fables now That her last season's summer height Bends from each overburdened bough, (first) The orange tree, in various light, Proclaims that fable perfect now That her last season's summer height Bends from each overburdened bough, (last) In the gap between "perfected fables" and "fable perfect" is the "strange, cyclic chemistry" of the orange tree that enacts the movement of the poem itself, "green yet aging," unique in its ability to bloom while bearing fruit, by which "the mind enspheres all circumstance," fragmented and whole.18 Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="13">Oranges and Anecdote 43 The Lover's Orange The orange appears at the threshold of subjectivity and commonality in a crucial scene from Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther (177 4), singled out by Roland Barthes in A Lover's Discourse in the entry entitled (in the English translation) "The Orange." In his analysis of perhaps the most famous scene from the novel that transformed the epistolary form "with a lyrical intensity previously unknown in narrative prose" in order "to make imaginatively accessible the tonality of a unique subjective experience," 19 Barthes, in a gesture similar to the association to the orange peel with which we began, defines a sentiment by focusing on the object that provokes it: The Orange Facheux/irksome Sentiment of slight jealousy which overcomes the amorous subject when he sees the loved being's interest attracted or distracted by persons, objects, or occupations which in his eyes function as so many secondary rivals. Werther: "The oranges I had set aside, the only ones as yet to be found, produced an excellent effect, though at each slice which she offered, for politeness's sake, to an indiscreet neighbor, I felt my heart to be somehow pierced through." The world is full of indiscreet neighbors with whom I must share the other. The world is in fact just that: an obligation to share. The world (the worldly) is my rival. (110) If the world is about relationship, the "obligation to share" epitomized by Charlotte's gift of the orange slices (a secular version of Charles's final gifts and relics, the slices evocative of his body's division into fragments), Werther 's impossible demand- one of a series of "ecstatic transgressions that carry the protagonist beyond the limits of the social" (Goethe 286)- is for an indivisible dyad, two become whole and isolated from exchange and social obligations. David Wellbery observes that this scene, which begins with Werther's vision of Charlotte feeding her six young siblings bread and butter, "lends Werther's love its unique character. The paradigm of his passion is the child's longing for the nourishing maternal presence," the bread Charlotte gives the children is "nourishment in its most basic form, the bread of life" (285), and thus, we might add, an echo of Christian communion. By contrast, the orange, rare and exotic, forbidden fruit, becomes a figure for Charlotte herself, whom Werther refuses to share, with tragic results. What Wellbery says of the novel's treatment of Werther's suicide is equally applicable to what we might call the anecdotal logic of the text's structure, by which I mean the complete merging of subjective and objective perspectives without Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="14">44 Helen Deutsch recourse to larger narrative frameworks. In this regard, anecdote and lyric, as we have seen in "Bermudas," have a great deal in common. Confronting the novel's refusal of "every explanatory solution, be it psychological or moral," [W]hat the reader senses most acutely in this juxtaposition of objective narrative with the personal utterances of the protagonist is the sheer and utter incommensurability of the two modes of discourse; they know no common measure. If... Goethe's is the first novel which aesthetically renders subjectivity -per se, then it accomplishes this by lending Werther 7s speech the status of an enigma. Werther is the first romantic subject to the degree that he cannot fully be understood. However empathetic our response to this experience, he remains for us ineluctably strange. (288) Werther 's unique and unfathomable subjectivity arises from his resistance to translation, to sharing the "common measure" of moral or social behavior, to what Barthes calls "politeness" and then rephrases as "kindness" (and Richard Howard chooses this word, I think, to provide an echo of "sameness" or "commonality") (110, 111). This resistance, Barthes's reading reminds us, is itself conventional and classifiable as typical of "the lover," and thus solicits the reader's passionate identification. Werther, the paradigmatic lover- and we might recall here that Lover's Discourse emerged from a seminar Barthes taught on Werther- demands such resistance from his beloved: Any obedience to worldly procedures appears as a compromise on the part of the loved being, and this compromise alters that being's image. An insoluble contradiction: on the one hand, Charlotte must certainly be "kind," since she is a perfect object; but on the other hand, this kindness must not have the effect of abolishing the privilege which constitutes my very being. (Barthes 111). As with Charles's orange or Johnson's orange peel, at the heart of "my very being" is the mystery of the object at the threshold of exchange. The fragmentary text, the literary object of absorption named after its hero, is shared, creating a Europe full of Werthers, while the orange remains withheld.20 "The Orange" In the previous sections, I've explored how the orange creates a variety of subjects in various permutations of singularity and commonality, poised at a variety of anecdotal thresholds from which history is about to ensue. I want to pause here to point to a particular quality of anecdotal form that we can link to a particular kind of gaze at the object. I draw Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="15">Oranges and Anecdote 45 here on Alexander Nemerov's brilliant discussion of the still lives of the early nineteenth-century American painter Raphaelle Peale (whose subject matter often consisted of fruit, and yes, oranges), whose child- like gaze animates the objects of his pictures with a vitality that breaks the frame. Insubordinate and unsettling, these objects refuse to conform to type and to their place in the larger scientific scheme of things. (Peale was the scapegrace son of the naturalist and great painter of American Enlightenment, as evidenced in perhaps his most famous composition, The Artist in His Museum [1822], Charles Willson Peale). Peale's still lives depict what Nemerov (drawing on Merleau-Ponty) calls "raw objects" (37) in all their material specificity, their nearness, their refusal of the distance afforded by conceptualization and generalization from the bodies that give them meaning. We might think here of Fernand Léger's claim that to isolate a thing is to give it a personality (qtd. in Brown, 8), or of Merleau-Ponty's description of "natural judgment," what Nemerov terms "the kind of perception wherein the observer sees an object in its primitive state prior to knowledge" (37). Merleau-Ponty describes such perception as Edenic, even divine: [I]n order that I may recognize a tree as a tree, it is necessary that, beneath this familiar meaning, the momentary arrangement of the visible scene should begin all over again, as on the very first day of the vegetable kingdom, to outline the individual idea of this tree. Such would be natural judgment, which cannot yet know its reasons since it is in the process of creating them. (43-44) We are back in Marvell's paradise where nature speaks itself in singular objects, before time and history begin. The anecdote too, in all its uniqueness, occupies the threshold of history's teleology- puncturing larger narratives in order to make other stories possible.21 In this regard, the child's-eye view of the object that Nemerov and Merleau-Ponty describe (a vision of things that does not yet know what they are), can be aligned with a particularly Anglo-American nostalgic evocation of anecdote's particularity that brings the past to life. Consider, for example, Macaulay's description of Samuel Johnson, composed of the anecdotal material of Boswell's Life: In the foreground is that strange figure which is as familiar to us as the figures of those among whom we have been brought up, the gigantic body, the huge massy face, seamed with the scars of disease, the brown coat, the black worsted stockings, the grey wig with the scorched foretop, the dirty hands, the nails bitten and pared to the quick. We see the eyes and mouth moving with convulsive twitches; we see the heavy form rolling; we hear it puffing; and then comes the "Why, sir!" and the "What then, sir?" and the "No, sir;" and the Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="16">46 Helen Deutsch "You don't see your way through the question, sir!" What a singular destiny has been that of this remarkable man!. ..To be more intimately known to posterity than other men are known to their contemporaries! That kind of fame which is commonly the most transient is, in his case, the most durable. The reputation of those writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless table-talk the memory of which, he probably thought, would die with him, are likely to be remembered as long as the English language is spoken in any quarter of the globe. (115) Macaulay's vision of a Johnson animated by the bodily particularity of compressed anecdote is articulated from a child's perspective: Johnson is at once "strange" and "as familiar to us as the figures of those among whom we have been brought up," like an eccentric uncle who is only acknowledged as such when one encounters other families and proper behavior. So vivid is this vision that it creates an "intimate" knowledge that seems to transcend time, enduring with an immediacy more powerful than the printed text. Such virtual intimacy- nostalgic and no doubt politically suspect- is harmless. Not the child's wonder at the unfamiliar object but the adult's fond evocation, it patronizes that which it possesses. But in our final version of the orange, a version that pushes the anecdote's double nature- literary and referential- to its limit, the object has the power to possess us, to bring us to speech, dissolving the comfortable "we" into the uneasy and incomplete generalities of "one." At the opening of this essay, I treated an anecdote that revealed the mutual inert "thingness" of man and object. "The Orange" of Francis Ponge mutually animates both the fruit and the mouth that consumes it. I can only treat this poem briefly here, but I want to focus on how in its speaking "on the side of things" (Ponge's book is entitled Le Parti Pris des Choses [LPPdC]), and at a modernist moment when the art work embraces its object/commodity status in order to resist it, "The Orange" epitomizes Merleau-Ponty's vision of an object that enacts the laws of creation in the process of its perception. Ponge's orange is "expressed" through our act of violence, but it also makes us speak: Mais ce n'est pas assez avoir dit de l'orange que d'avoir rappelé sa facon particulière de parfumer l'air et de réjouir son bourreau. Il faut mettre l'accent sur la coloration glorieuse du liquide qui en resuite, et qui, mieux que le jus de citron, oblige le larynx à s'ouvrir largement pour la pronunciation du mot comme pour l'ingestion du liquide, sans aucune moue apprehensive de l'avant-bouche dont il ne fait pas se hérisser les papilles. (Oeuvres 20)22 Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="17">Oranges and Anecdote 47 With "bourreau" we are reminded of the orange of Charles I, which ended up in the executioner's hands; in Ponge's poem the king's "ordeal" or "trial" ("épreuve") is a process of expression that mutually implicates subject and object. Ponge described the poems in LPPdC as at once descriptions, definitions, and literary art works; the closer they come to evoking the objects they describe, the more they call attention to themselves as linguistic artifacts. The orange is always "the orange." Praised by Sartre as "the magus of phenomenology" for his devotion to Husserl's "things in themselves," Ponge made clear in an interview that such attention to things was for the benefit of human readers: If I placed language in front of something neutral, something which had neither feelings nor ideas, I was doing it for man. ...And it is in order to revitalize language that I place myself before something neutral, which is not yet poetical in itself, and has not yet been "sentimentalized/7 7 try, in the verbal world, to do something which has as much concrete existence as the objects that I describe. That's exactly it. (emphasis mine; Gavronsky 96) The repetition of "neutral" here marks the poetic work of "taking the side of things" as an uneasy anthropomorphism that constantly reminds us of its artificiality. Harking back to Lucretius's great materialist epic, De Rerum Natura (Of The Nature of Things), these poems resonate with the Roman poet's assertion that language itself is material, the letters of the alphabet functioning in analogical relation to the atoms of creation, always reminding us that the only Creator is the poet and the perceiver.23 LPPdC has been termed a book "that has never been fully fathomed," and this depth echoes the mystery- of the orange peel, of the pocketed royal orange, of Werther 's impenatrable subjectivity, of Mar veil's oranges of revelation- that has haunted us throughout this essay, a mystery that Ponge sees as inherent in all objects.24 Jacques Derrida plays with these poems as prime examples of "mise en abyme," and in this regard we can consider them as literary versions of a still life, more specifically as verbal examples of the painterly feat of trompe l'oeil. As is true of trompe l'oeil- and we might recall here the most famous trompe l'oeil contest of antiquity, between a painting of grapes so real that birds attempted to eat it, and a painting of a veil that prompted the viewer to attempt to lift it- Ponge's poems are at once representations of things and the things that give the representation. They are versions of mise en abyme (the shield bearing the picture of the shield)25 that predetermine our reading: they are the appearance and the thing that constructs the appearance. Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="18">48 Helen Deutsch In his essay on still life and the dynamics of modern consumerism, Mark Seltzer, drawing on Lacan, observes that we take pleasure in viewing still life and trompe l'oeil because they reinforce our ability to move while objects stay still. In a capitalist market that consistently confuses people and things, that makes us anxious about human agency, still life affirms our freedom and mobility.26 Still life and trompe l'oeil remind us that we are at once representations and something beyond representations, appearances and things that give the appearances.27 We are in other words, in our consciousness of our own irreducibility to the material from which we are made, and in our "certainty of 'the real' beneath appearances," subjects.28 Ponge's poem explores the orange as a figure of "the attraction of the beneath appearance that seems to give the appearance," putting a different twist on what Seltzer describes as the still life's "interplay of stillness and illusionism" with "possession and self-possession" (477).29 For while the still lives Seltzer examines (largely in the abstract) enable the assumption of agency, animation, and movement for their viewers, Ponge's particular poems, like Peale's uncanny images, undermine this illusion. Thing-like as they are, Ponge's poems are also narratives,30 and in this regard they are very much like anecdotes, the closest narrative thing to a thing. The narrative energy of "The Orange" propels it toward the object's interior, even as the poem begins with a sympathetic depiction of the fruit's attempts to save face after having been made to express itself: Comme dans l'éponge il y a dans l'orange une aspiration à reprendre contenance après avoir subi l'épreuve de l'expression. Mais où l'éponge réussit toujours, l'orange jamais: car ses cellules ont éclaté, ses tissus se sont déchirés. Tandis que l'écorce seule se rétablit mollement dans sa forme grâce à son élasticité, un liquide d'ambre s'est répandu, accompagné de refraichissement, de parfum suaves, certes, - mais souvent aussi de la conscience amère d'une expulsion prématurée de pépins. (Oeuvres 19-20) Whose "bitter awareness" we might ask? The passage reverberates between the "on" of "l'éponge" (an "on" or "one" that we hear in the poet's own name) and the "an" (not) of "orange" (and of anecdote), between a generality implicit in the violence with which the orange is expressed and consumed and the specificity of the orange itself.31 The amber liquid that perfumes the air is refreshing, but the "conscience amère," like "contenance" and "expression" both figurative and literal in their range of meanings that unite and divide subject and object, reminds us of both the anthropomorphic commonalities and violent Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="19">Oranges and Anecdote 49 disjunctions the poem enacts. We have seen how the juice of the orange makes us speak; regaining its shape after assault, the fragrant fruit renders us silent: Et l'on demeure au reste sans paroles pour avouer l'admiration que mérite l'enveloppe du tendre, fragile et rose ballon ovale dans cet épais tampon-buvard humide dont l'épiderme extrêmement mince mais très pigmenté, acerbement sapide, et juste assez rugueux pour accrocher dignement la lumière sur la parfaite forme du fruit. (Oeuvres 20) In the poem's play of illusion between inner and outer- the "oval pink ball in its thick damp blotter" (The Nature of Things 21) concealed by the thin skin which, unviolated, constitutes "perfect form/' reminiscent of Marvell's divine orange in its perfection, bringing the lamp of revelation down to earth in its attraction (rather than emission) of light -"The Orange" reminds us of what Bill Brown observes of the work of Ponge's American contemporary, the famous coiner of the phrase "no ideas but in things," William Carlos Williams: "what first reads like the effort to accept things in their physical quiddity becomes the effort to penetrate them, to see through them, and to find (...) within an object (...) the subject" (Brown 12). For Ponge does not end here, but rather with the hope produced by the orange's sacrifice, the seed: Mais à la fin d'une trop courte étude, menée aussi rondement que possible, - il faut en venir au pépin. Ce grain, de la forme d'un minuscule citron, offre à l'extérieur la couleur du bois blanc de citronnier, à l'intérieur un vert de pois ou de germe tendre. C'est en lui que se retrouvent, après l'explosion sensationnelle de la lanterne vénitienne de saveurs, couleurs et parfums que constitue le ballon fruité lui-même, - la dureté relative et la verdeur (non d'ailleurs entièrement insipide) du bois, de la branche, de la feuille: somme toute petite quoique avec certitude la raison d'être du fruit. (Oeuvres 20) The seed is the orange's mise-en-abyme, the relatively firm (which is all that can be said for anything) thing within the thing that renders what has gone before- "the sensational exploding Chinese lantern" of the "fruited ball" (The Nature of Things 21) -ethereal and elusory, reducing smell, taste and touch to the image of memory. Like the stone Johnson kicks (another relatively firm object) to give the world solidity, the seed- containing the even smaller "germe tendre" within it- is the fruit's "raison d'être," the thing that gives it meaning. It renders both the orange and the reader objects with hidden depths; it gives them substance and makes them subjects. Anecdote we might say, in its singularity, its ability to resist or to be "expressed" from larger stories and to give rise to alternative stories, is the seed at the heart of narrative. Substance #118, Vol. 38, no. 1, 2009</page><page sequence="20">50 Helen Deutsch Perhaps this is why the orange has inspired a variety of anecdotal histories, most recently a charming book by the chemist Pierre Laszlo, who sees citrus as food for the mind, for the soul, the imagination.32 On a narrative path that is largely a commodity history, meditating on the possible origins of the Orangerie at Versailles, Laszlo pauses for a moment of 'Irrational and unprovable" speculation, the value of which, he claims is strictly rhetorical: The proposition is that nature carries culture with it. The seeds of a plant somehow ferry, in their genes, as it were, aspects of a civilization.... I shall assert more specifically - although I won't prove it, since such a proposition is devoid of any factual support- that orange trees connect the French Sun King, Louis XIV, to the emperor of China across the centuries.... Could Marco Polo have told a wealthy Italian patron in confidence that the emperor of China safeguarded his orange trees in a special building during winter? Could a copyist of an Arabic manuscript in a medieval abbey, such as the one at Monte Cassino, have shared the idea with fellow monks, one of whom was trusted confessor and confidant to one of the Italian condotierre? Was it a discarded scrap from Thomas More's Utopia that somehow made the rounds of gardeners? Many such scenarios can be devised for the transmission of the idea of royal magnificence, as embodied in rows of orange trees, from capital cities in Asia to western Europe during the late Middle Ages. To give body to this hypothesis, the reader might see it as the seed of the plot for a novel, in the tradition of The Name of the Rose or The Da Vinci Code. (49-50) While orange trees cannot be proved to connect civilizations across the centuries, I hope this essay can reassure Laszlo and the fanciful scientists of the world that their anecdotal fruit- irrational, unprovable, like Ponge's "Orange" strictly rhetorical, the seed of an endless variety of plots high and low, the link between a panoply of idiosyncratic individual sensibilities- can and does.

Palter, 385-6, describes the 2000 English play Blue/Orange, which "features a bowlful of oranges at the center of an otherwise clinically white stage set.... [O]ne of the three characters is a young black African imprisoned 'for lewd behavior with an orange.' The other two characters are psychiatrists, and they argue about whether the patient is psychotic: he believes the oranges in the bowl are blue, says one psychiatrist; he grew up in colonial Uganda, says the other psychiatrist, at a time when Tintiti and the Blue Oranges was popular, and, besides, there is a line by the French surrealist poet Paul Eluard which says 'la terre est bleue comme une or- ange'.... [The] creator of the world-renowned character Tintin... never, in fact, wrote a book about blue oranges, but there is a film called Tintin et les oranges bleues (1964), in which the plot revolves around a mysterious variety of blue orange capable of growing in the desert." 4. My method here resembles Brown's in its attempt to tell a story of an object that exceeds consumerist definitions: "the story of a kind of possession that is irreducible to ownership" (Sense of Things 13). While Brown focuses on one specific historical moment- late 19th-century America- I differ in my desire to pursue the orange across historical periods and in the process to say something about the portability of the anecdote as genre. 5. This injunction also haunts Boswell in The Life, who describes his first encounter with Johnson with reference to that same paternal ghost. 6. Chapter 4 of Cultural Aesthetics discusses the aristocratic penchant at this time tor "void food," food that artfully simulates, in the manner of trompe l'oeil and in sweet and flimsy materials, more substantive edibles; this "void" echoes what Fineman calls the "hole within the whole" (61) of the anecdote, to which we will return at the close of this essay. 7. For a distinction between sacred economies in which objects remain unexchangeable, immaterial and irreplaceable and market economies based on "calculation and equiva- lence" and the dead-end of the flesh that is based on a reading of Hamlet, see Gallagher and Greenblatt. 8. Both Barbara Packer and Andrea Loselle have convincingly suggested to me that the orange served as a pomander (and the resonance of "pomme" will be explored further in what follows), a fragrant talisman with which the king could protect himself from the smell of the mob. 9. All quotations from "Bermudas" are taken from Poems of Andrew Marvell, ed. JNigel Smith 56-7. 10. Much of the critical debate about "Bermudas has focused on whether to interpret the poem literally (and as of a piece with Marvell's Puritan politics) or figuratively/ philosophically, an opposition Gimelli Martin contests. For one of the founding statements from the philosophical camp, see Colie. For an exploration of Marvell's ironic undermining of his idealized new world Paradise based on the complexities of the actual political situation in the Bermudas (one not terribly friendly to Puritans), see Fizdale. Nigel Smith reads the poem as an idealized psalmic tribute to Marvell's friend and host, John Oxenbridge, who had been twice to the Bermudas, served as one of the Commissioners for the government of the Bermudas, and became gover- nor of the Somers Island Company in 1655. He sensibly suggests that "the descrip- tion of natural beneficence can be read literally, or symbolically, or as both" (54). 11. Quoted in Poems of Andrew Marvell 55. 12.

I refer here to Goethe's famous poem that begins "Kennst du das Land wo die Zitronen bluhn?" (Do you know the land where the lemon trees bloom?") and to Pierre Laszlo's excellent chapter on the crucial role of the orange in the history of California, 61-81. Palter notes the association of oranges with lost Edens and the decline of the orange's exoticism and thus its original association with divinity, 375- 6; see also Laszlo, on the disappearance of citrus from still life in the 19th century (with Raphaelle Peale as a notable American exception), 164. In Palter's discussion the orange also becomes a figure for anecdotal literary history that pretends to fact. He takes Gilbert Sorrentino and others to task for telling the anecdote of Columbus convincing Queen Isabella of the roundness of the earth by using an orange: "pre- sumably Sorrentino had misremembered the story of Columbus and the egg, itself almost certainly a piece of biographical fabrication, conflated perhaps with the equally false idea that Columbus had to persuade Isabella and Ferdinand that the Earth was round," rebuking Sorrentino, in the words of Christopher Ricks, for getting "mileage from the matter of fact and then refusing] to pay the fare" (400-401). He similarly dismisses the anecdote that "traces the Lombardi invasion of Italy to the delectability of Italian oranges," which appears in John McPhee's Oranges, arguing that "what is at stake here is not the truth of some minor- even trivial- episode in the social history of citrus fruits; what is at stake is the very way we are to understand history, whether as a succession of amusing anecdotes centered on striking personalities or as the complex interweaving of long-term socio-economic and political forces with a vari- ety of individual human agents" (390, 391). Like so many Atalantas, these authors have been distracted by the orange off history's true path, a path that originates at Bacon's crossroads. 14. "The imaginative horizons of eternal truth are now no longer vertical but horizontal. The pilgrim no longer looks upward to an eternal revelation of the Word, but instead looks outward to its approaching parousia at the Last Day" (Gimelli Martin 75.) For more on the move toward particularity in description in the rise of the English novel, with which the Reformation had a good deal to do, see Wall. 15. For an eloquent defense of Eden as located in the new world rather than the Mediter- ranean, and of Paradise Lost as the first of a Western tradition of "Atlantic epics," see Thorne. This would also support the conjecture that the apples that grew on the tree of knowledge in Paradise were in fact oranges (see Palter, who argues that it would have in fact been a citron, 385). 16. "In this allegory, then, metamorphosis is countered by transubstantiation (...) sym- bols of a progressive revelation to be achieved at the end of time" (Gimelli Martin 82). 17. Smith emphasizes Marvell's Christian revision and de-eroticization of Waller's Epi- curean paradise, concurring with Annabel Patterson that Marvell "was deliberately revising Waller's epicurean poem in the name of godliness," noting the naming of God in the poem, absent in earlier evocations of paradise such as Spenser's Bower of Bliss (55). 18. Waller in his "Battle of the Summer Islands" notes this unique feature of the orange tree: Ripe fruits and blossoms on the same trees live; At once they promise what at once they give. (qtd. in Palter 375). This simultaneity of flower and fruit gave the orange tree a special affinity with Eden for 17th-century gardeners. See Prest plate 49, and chapter VI. 19. Goethe 283.

Gerard [a hunted priest whose autobiography he quotes here] provides us with a detailed explanation of the complexities of this form of secret writing. "Lemon juice/' he writes, "comes out just as well with water or heat. If the paper is taken out and dried, the writing disappears but it can be read a second time when it is moistened or heated again. But orange juice is different. It cannot be read with water- water, in fact, washes away the writing and nothing can recover it. Heat brings it out, but it stays out. So a letter in orange juice cannot be delivered without the recipient knowing whether or not it has been read."... Orange juice was the preferred medium, for it was safer. (241, note 44). Orange juice here is the stuff of transparent communication- more vulnerable to water than lemon juice, asserting itself ineffably when heated, refusing to fade away. Like Werther's orange, messages written with this fluid are meant for one reader alone, not to be shared. 21. See Fineman 61, on anecdote puncturing and dilating larger narratives in order to give birth to new ones. See also Gallop 164, on anecdote as theory "in the flesh." 22. I am indebted here to Ngai's reading of "The Orange" in which she describes the orange "as a figure for a number for personification strategies" (832), including prosopopeia or, pace Paul de Man, "giving face," and discerns in the poem what de Man describes as the "'latent threat7 attending all strategies of rhetorical personifica- tion," namely that by making the inanimate speak, the living will be "struck dumb." For Ngai, who is particularly concerned with cuteness as a mode of and figure for the aesthetic in an age of commodity fetishism, this threat is linked to the potential reversibility of subject and object, the twin poles of "animation and reification," which for Marx are "two sides of the same coin," the potential reversibility of people and things. "Hence while The Orange' begins by highlighting the passivity of the small and compact commodity named in its title (a thing that in this re-doubling serves, as is the case for most of Ponge's prose-poems, as an even smaller stand-in for the already small and compact literary object that is 'The Orange') it culminates by locating this passivity on the side of the subject consuming the essence the object/ artwork/commodity has been forced to expel" (833). 23. See Meadows. 24. See Higgins 31: "the orange's functioning as presented m the poem is not its biologi- cal or economic destiny, but its 'differential quality' or 'mystery.'" 25.

Trompe l'oeil pleases us, says Lacan, at the moment when, by a mere shitt ot our gaze, we are able to realize that the representation does not move with the gaze and that it is merely a trompe l'oeil. For it appears at that moment as something other than it seemed, or rather it now seems to be something else... It is because the picture is the appearance that says it is that which gives the appearance that Plato attacks painting, as if it were an activity competing with his own" (Lacan 112, qtd. in Seltzer 476). 27. In this regard, anecdotes are a verbal form of still-life.

Seltzer, "The Still Life" 476. 29. Ultimately, Seltzer argues: "the attraction to the still life... instances the perpetual recovery of the more-than-appearance that allows one to set oneself in motion: the reaffirmation of agency itself.... [S]uch a rhythm of suspended and recovered motion and agency, such a rhythm of reification and personification, makes up the reanimat- ing ritual of consumption" (478). This is reminiscent of the reversible dynamic of "animation and reification" that for Ngai is the hallmark of cuteness and of the aes- thetic more generally.

Ponge's translator Lee Fahnestock describes the typical story of the poems: "Over and over, an object and singular trait rise together, gathering complexity as they follow a short narrative cycle- a definition-description in metaphor- to fuse with the poem on the page, where all the elements close on the same dying note. For a sort of sacrificial death ends each of these parables: though frequently held at bay by the pulsing regeneration of nature, the machinery still runs down, the poem concludes, even humanity disappears" (Ponge, The Nature... 9). 31. I owe this observation to Andrea Loselle, whose help with the original French was invaluable. On the contrasting nasals of "an" and "on" as the beginning of a detailed discussion of the role of sound in the work of analogy in Ponge's poetry, see Higgins 9, who also observes that these sounds in the particular context of the emptiness of orange, sponge, and "contenance" (the last of which "denotes in part the very quality of being able to be filled up"), lead to a "reality" effect (and one that Higgins is careful to warn us would not occur if these sounds occurred in other contexts): "it is a fact that many people find their mouths watering when they read 'L'orange', so much so that it actually sometimes makes reading the poem aloud rather difficult" (24). Lest we think Higgins is being ingenious here, Ponge himself observed in an interview that, just to give one example, the words "'au reste' at the beginning of the fourth paragraph, where the peel is described" were "intended to evoke, through their sounds, the word zeste (the thin outer skin of the orange), which does not figure in the text." The paradox which results: "the closer the 'equivalence' [what Ponge calls 'adequation']" between text and thing, "the more obvious the difference between text and thing" (Higgins 30). 32.
